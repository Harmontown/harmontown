00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
Music

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Hello Meltdown, how is everybody doing this evening?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Cheering

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
I sort of got that feeling there's a frisson in the air, there's some electric energy going on here

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Meltdown Comics here in Hollywood, California

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Good news everybody, Harmontown once again is now in session

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Cheering

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Once again please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon

00:43.000 --> 01:03.000
Cheering

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
If it seems like I'm taller, they re-raised the stage here at Meltdown, it's not just because I got my job back, I'm not like floating

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Cheering

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
I got my job back, that sounds a lot more pathetic than the heroic triumph of Ulysses coming home and slaying the suitors

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Are we allowed to talk about this this week?

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
I think so, but I mean kind of, my agents keep telling me, shut the fuck up

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
And rightfully so because their job is to close a deal that is not yet officially closed, these things take forever

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
90% of the time, probably 99% of the time when writers are in a writer's room their deals aren't closed yet, they're kind of in the process

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
Third season my deal was so not closed there was actually a kind of debacle, which is probably one of the 800 reasons I got fired

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
The deal wasn't closed and then Sony put a quote, clock on my offer

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
That means you have to, by sundown you better be in the street or you're going to be in a box or whatever

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Whatever cowboy they thought they were as a transner is called conglomerate

02:17.000 --> 02:27.000
I went to the roost in Los Feliz and all the writers followed me and I sat there and I had a drink and I put a clock on them through my lawyers

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
And I think stuff like that probably is why they were like, when we do get to fire this guy, let's just fire him, he's such a dick

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
But now I have returned and you know what's great? I have not changed

02:40.000 --> 02:49.000
I have learned nothing

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
I have only learned that Joel McHale is the most powerful man in television

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Because the truth is nobody wanted me back except the actors

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
Joel, you thank Joel McHale if you want to be happy for somebody

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I will do my best to make 13 great episodes until I make even a single good one

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
Don't pat me on the back because the truth is these companies, they weren't like, you know who we miss?

03:15.000 --> 03:25.000
Like Joel, sometimes this happens in TV, the actors, the actual people in the trenches, the people that create the product that you enjoy

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
The people who are locked in a hot box for 12 hours a day

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
They're the ones that still end up tearing about the show enough to bother to affect a thing

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And Joel, I don't know how much he's comfortable owning up to this

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
I don't know, so just thank him and leave it at that I guess

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
I don't know, like maybe we'll have him on or something and we can tell the story

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
But he's amazing, I mean he's a great guy, a great dad

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
One of those dads that throws his kid up in the air and catches him

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Throws his kid up, back when his kids were small enough to be thrown

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
That was my first impression of him, he grabbed one of his kids and tossed him like 12 feet in the air

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
I'm not kidding and then caught him and I remember thinking like, my dad couldn't do that and I will not be able to do that

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
And that explains everything, that's why I'm a writer and he's an actor

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Is because he had a dad that must have caught him

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
If my dad threw me 12 feet, there was no return, it was just like a trip

04:31.000 --> 04:41.000
Alright, well I want to bring Spencer up earlier than usual, let's just bring him up on ceremony

04:45.000 --> 04:52.000
Careful, yeah, they raised the stage, so if you're tall enough you could die tonight

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
I'm fine down here, thank you

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Hello Spencer, how are you?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm good, I'm good

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
I wanted to make sure you got a good seat because there was a rumor in the green room that Adam Goldberg has lost his mind

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
And somehow gave himself the role of seating people

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Like he was seating people and he was just telling them where they could sit

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Like giving away reserve seats and like telling people they couldn't save seats

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And like, is he on crack or something?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Adam, where are you?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Can you come up and explain yourself?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I want to go misunderstanding, that would be less funny when I repeat it

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Adam, you don't want to come up

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
This must be serious

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
Alright, Adam Goldberg, a rare reluctance, Adam Goldberg

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
How's it going Dan? How's it going Spencer?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
How's it going Jeff?

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm sure these things get conflated as they reach me back in the mayor's chamber

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
But reportedly you've just gone off the rails

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
You know, when you try and date several people on the same night

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Humble brag

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
You have to switch between expensive restaurants back and forth

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh, that's a metaphor, sorry, okay

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
I was like, that was the world's biggest shoe heart

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
I love how easily you bought that premise

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I mean, he took over a room, of course

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
That's probably the whole dance

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
There's women coming in and he's going like, well, what's going on?

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
Well, you're smashing as much pus as I am on a daily basis

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I don't smash like three rules because it rhymes

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
You smush pus

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, get down on it

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
When you have a lot of dates in consecutive years

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm still not biting

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Fair enough, okay, let me count back

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Everyone wants to sit with me, you're all my best friends, all of you guys

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Especially the new guys who don't know that that's false

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
And the thing is, I was like, hey, want to save some seats?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Hey, could you save me some seats? Hey, could you save me some seats?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
And I'm like, yeah, sit over in this general vicinity

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Which has turned me into the left thumb, right thumb guy from Bergenbelsen

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
You got roped into saving seats for people

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Yeah

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Can anybody verify that? Is that actually true?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Now, I've heard...

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Judas, you're all betrayers, you're all betraying me

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
In my hour of need

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
If one person in your pack of disciples betrays you, they might be a Judas

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
If you're in a sea of Judas, you might be a Judas

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
You might be Judas

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
We have an audience full of disciples

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
I was going to say Barabbas

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I'm not parting with my silver that easily

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
You sound like you have a little cold

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, it's been, you know, I've been getting out and about in consecutive days

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Because of my back brace, so I can't get all the vigorous physical activity

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Smash and push

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Smash and push, and I might like

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, so...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Wipe this mic, if it's not my business

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
The back brace is part of the Adam Goldberg

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
This is the new action figure release, Puss Smashin' Adam Goldberg

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
Workman's top item is available with all the things I'm seeing here

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Puss specials, Puss Smashin' Grip

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Just so we have to buy another one

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
Another Adam Goldberg on the shelf is like a new haircut, Dan

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
That's worth the purchase, but like...

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
Couldn't my old Adam smush push, I got him in the...

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
That's the 30 cents spent at the Salvation Army

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
The smush push is your country line dance

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Can we do the smush push?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I am in the back brace, it's about as much as you can

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Adam Goldberg's coming, he's smashing all the puss

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
He's coming around the corner

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
God, you'd say wuss, because that's the time we went to

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
I can't move that very far

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
When I get my workers' comp checks, action figure gets guitar

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Alright, stay tuned for guitar smash, pushin'

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Adam Goldberg everybody, wow!

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Thank you Adam Goldberg

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay, he dismissed himself

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And he actually walked off the stage to applause

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
We are the Caesar Milan to the Adam Goldbergs of the world

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
We're rehabilitating him

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
And yet in a world where you get fired and rehired and you don't change

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You're creating change in the end

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm changing everybody, I don't know what I did to his back

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
But I changed

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Listening, the words back brace, I don't want you to conjure too fragile

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Or tragic an image, I mean he's just wearing a...

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
It looks like a Cumberbund, we've talked about it before

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It's like a big Cumberbund with suspenders on it

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
And you have to go back into the archives and listen to Adam come up

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And talk about his family's history of back problems

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
And there's little flashes of humanity in there

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Here and there, it's pretty charming

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Alright, so...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Can we talk a little bit about this haircut?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I know it's not good podcast material

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
But it's nearly military, you look a little bit like Randy Quaid from The Last Detail

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
I got drunk in Chicago with Dino and I...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I think how that movie starts too

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
And I wandered into a stylist salon, Barbershop

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't know the difference between the three

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
It had a pointed nose and it laid eggs in dry land

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
So that's a salon

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
A salon, yeah

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
And they were bummed out

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
You've never seen three gay guys more sad

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And gay guys have it bad

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
They live in a world of bad play

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Illinois is now recently going through their own debacle with marriage rights and things

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
So I learned while I was there

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
We've been down that road here in California

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
We don't even give a shit anymore

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
We're battle weary

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
But in Illinois now, the battle rages on

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
And they were not in the mood to cut Charles Manson's hair

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
When he rolled in off the Chicago streets with Dino

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I think they maybe were relieved when Dino walked out

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
When he was like, I'll see you later

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And they thought he was my partner

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Which they should, you know, they should assume that

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And he might as well be

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And we chatted

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Chatted about, you know, I'm down with gay people

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Did they trim your beard too?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Is that what you're doing?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
They trimmed my beard

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
That is laser precision man

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah, they made me look like Bob Greenblatt

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
They made me...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
It's two trims

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I've changed

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I've turned into Darth Vader

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I am my own, yeah

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
That's the tragedy

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
He still works there, right?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, but give me a break

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I mean, that place is...

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
That place changes

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I worked for three people while I was there

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I got a feeling I'm going to be working for a fourth at some point, right?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Look, I don't know how they do their business

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I saw the animal practice

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't know what decisions...

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
How they make their decisions

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
I saw the billboard with the doctor that had the face in his hands

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
What was that called? No holds barred? Do no harm?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
What was that?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
It was a doctor

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
He saw that billboard?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Someone greenlit that billboard

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Someone looked at that on an easel

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
And was like, ship it

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So I see a doctor

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
He's got scrubs on

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Because you wouldn't be able to tell he's a doctor

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
He's holding his hands up in the traditional

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I'm about to go into surgery

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Doctor pose, except that they have to be mushed together

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
So that we could put an evil face on the back of his hands

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Indicating like a kind of a Jekyll and Hyde thing

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I'll take four episodes

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Speaking of which, you have not watched season four of Community

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
No, I have not

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Are you going to have to get down and watch it?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, I've got to get down to business and watch it, yes

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
And Sony, to their credit, they expressed interest in the idea of recording me

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Doing the commentary track

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
They're so into it that they're starting to make me

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Like, now I'm not into it anymore

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Like, that's the thing

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
You know, you tweet something shitty

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And then Sony's like, this is awesome

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
You can't wait for Comic-Con

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
And you're like, fuck you

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
They're invincible, because they're a machine

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
They're not human

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
They don't have a heart

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
They have a little cog

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
A little DVD player

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
I've said before, by the way, that people that work in special features and stuff like that

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Sony is a gigantic company

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I think you know that

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
They make cookies, they make bottle openers

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
They must make landmines

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
If any company ever did

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
They've got to be somehow, some way

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
There's got to be making landmines

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I think that's GE

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I know, but Sony must have been jealous

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
It's like, we've got to get in on that racket

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
We're not blowing enough people up

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
But I don't know

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
So there's a lot of fantastic people there

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Corporations are inhuman and therefore vile by nature

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
But within them, there are little heroes

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
And some of them are the people that make the little Sony DVDs

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Because they love making DVDs

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
They love special features

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
They love the fans loving special features

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And when the three seasons I was working there

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I made friends with the people in the DVD department

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
And we had a lot of fun

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
It's hard for you to say nice things about those people

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
That was difficult for you

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Spencer, what do you think?

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
What about you getting maybe a job back in with the works?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I don't know, yeah

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
What do you think of my haircut?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
What do you think of Chicago?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
What do you think of gay people?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
I was discussing it, you know, the haircut

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
And we landed on like an army guy

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Which I enjoy

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Fuck everybody

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
But yeah, yeah, army guy

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Anyway, gay people, great, yeah

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Like they should have it better in that place

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Detroit, Chicago?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Chicago, yeah

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Chicago, they should have it better there

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Sure, Chicago's a good place

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I've said it before and I'll say it again

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
I don't understand anyone that's not in favor of gay rights

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Because it's such a tee-up

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
You can be a hero by not giving a fuck

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
It's one of the only causes, it's so easy

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Like when are you going to get that opportunity?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Every other cause demands like a picket sign

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Or like do something, like you can be such a hero

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
But just standing there and going, I don't care

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I don't care

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Just, I mean, when something comes along like that

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Do it

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
You can't help black people by not caring

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Try it

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I dare you

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
You will hurt them by not caring

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Speaking of me saying weird things

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And the audience reacting weirdly

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
We have a lost episode

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Harmontown has a lost episode, it's our first

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Audio problems, was it?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I think, yeah, the audio problem is that I kept talking about

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Getting my job back at community

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And I wasn't supposed to yet

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I'm probably not supposed to now, but we don't have to release this

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
necessarily tomorrow

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Like I said, we're in the final stages of making an official

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And I don't know what compromises it

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm not an agent, I don't work in it

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I don't know what happens, like a corporation is going like

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
All right, should he get $55,000 in a parking space?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
Or $56,000 and he's got to park his own car

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
This is Jeff Jefferson from parking relations

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And we got a parking spot over here

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
For Jason Alexander, we were just promised him

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Season two

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
If I could interrupt there

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
The key to this operation is going to be synergy

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Without a doubt

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
We've said a thousand times, in parking space

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
You could make a thousand parking spaces

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
It's not going to make a television show

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Sir, I'm sorry, it's a conference call

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Would you identify yourself please?

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
This is just John the janitor

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
But if this mop could talk

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
It would tell you

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
You don't make a show with parking spaces

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Thank you John, I think we understand your points

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Excuse me, is that the mop talking now?

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Yes, this is Marla the mop

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
We are overextended this fiscal quarter

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
I have been squeezed over and over again

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
To the point where we're rearranging deck chairs

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
On the Titanic

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And mopping the area underneath them

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
With people like me, mops like me

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Who cares, edit this out

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
We're going to have another last episode

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
If I do enough bad improv

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's a dangerous precedent

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
This is going to be a test pattern

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
When you download this

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
This is going to be a recording of an Indian

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Hello

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
You can't see me right now

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
But I'm an Indian

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The episode you were searching for

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Audio difficulties

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
They make me cry

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
There was much talk of black people

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
In Sony last week

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Mr. Harmon's words were like litter

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Across a freeway

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
His improv was like an eagle lost in the wind

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Mr. Harmon, or as we call him

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Limpin' Beaver trying to do make-up-ups

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Alright

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
We still have some business

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
This is a town meeting

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
By the way, thank you for showing up

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
In so many numbers, but also, I don't know

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Isn't there kind of a dark side to that too?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Like, fuck you, I guess you just hated me

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Because I was fired?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Alright

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Thank you

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Thank you

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Thank you

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Thank you

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Like, I guess you just hated me because I was fired?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Alright

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Wow

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Maybe you were busy, maybe you were busy

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I mean, don't feel bad for coming

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
That would be counterproductive of me to make happen

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Just think about how I feel sometimes

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
When you randomly show up

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Like when I get fired and then when I get rehired

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
And then all the time in between

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
It's as if my stories about jerking off in my bathtub

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Aren't enough

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
To bring you out from Tarzana

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I drop by once in a while

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I know how many people show up when a real comedian

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Gets up and does material

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It hurts my feelings

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
It's like you expect me to write things

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
In order for me to have value

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Speaking of value, big value is going on

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
At the Harmontown.com store

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Online

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
We are having what's called a flash sale

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I don't know if that means that it's

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
That you need flash installed

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
To participate

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Or if that just means it's like a flash mob derivative

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Like it's like a sale like super fast

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
I don't know if that means

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
What if a bunch of people just showed up somewhere

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
And started like conducting like retail business

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Just like a flash sale

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like you just bring a bunch of like garments

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And then people buy them

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah, that would be amazing

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Just spontaneous acts of capitalism

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
In the streets

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
It's a flash sale

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And people like in the outer periphery

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Like training like like like

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Someone makes it a public offering

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Like on the business going on in there

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
So there's people on the outer rim

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Like trading stock in the company

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
And it's like spreading in the streets

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
It's just an explosion of capitalism

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And there's a Adam Goldberg with little

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Suspenders in bow tie on right in the middle of it

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Someone take it

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
We can call it Wall Street Occupy

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
There you go

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It's like a little reverse

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Like they take back the night

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Alright

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
So if you go to Harmontown.com

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
In the now

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Don't do it now

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Watch the show

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
And then go get a t-shirt

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
It's cheaper now

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Do we sell them here?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Do we bring merchandise here?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
I don't think we do

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And it's because it gets complicated

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Because the Nerdmelt theater

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
That lets us do stuff here

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
If you sell merchandise here

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
Then you have to

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Figure out what the vague is

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
And all this stuff

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
You know you have to like calculate

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Like consignments and things

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
It would be perfectly fair to them

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
And we're not doing it

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Because we're so greedy

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
And I don't think anyone's doing anything

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I'd agree it's just complicated

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Sell our t-shirts online

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
If that's not true

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And it would be easy to sell them here

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
And just give Nerdmelt some money

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Then let's do it

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
I don't care I'm rich

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Alright

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
But I have a feeling we're not doing it

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Because it's hard

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
And whoever had to sell them

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Would not be getting paid

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
But if that's true

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Pay yourself

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
I don't care

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I won't notice I'm rich

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I have people

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
I pay people to manage my money

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Surely they're

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
I hope they're stealing from me

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
If they're not they should be

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I have the same account

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
So I hope that's not true

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I wouldn't have them steal from you

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
It's fine

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
And I'm sure you keep a tight

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
You know

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I'm sure you get out your little

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Scrooge specs at the end of the night

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Your whale oil lamp

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I don't know why that's so funny

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
So go to Harmontown.com

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
You can buy a t-shirt

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's extra cheap right now

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
It's like

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
We made a lot of t-shirts

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
And I guess we didn't know

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
No one would want them

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
So

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Our bad judgment is

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Your game

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
That's capitalism

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
That's how it works

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Everything must go

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Because nothing should have been

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
It's called supply and lack of demand

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I think is the principle there

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Speaking of capitalism

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think now

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Don't waste a segue that good

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Almost top speaking of value

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Head on down to Harmontown.com

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
That wasn't that fucking sweet

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I was like Paul Harvey

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
It was really nice

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Like in the old days

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Like Jack Benny or something

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
You know what I was going to say

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
I want to get like a dick head car

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I've been driving a Prius for

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I can't even remember

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
That was the first car I ever bought new

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
What's your shame

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Aside

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Self-consciousness

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Aside

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
What would be the ultimate dick head car

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Tesla

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I want to get one of these Teslas

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
See, you hear that response

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Because it's a reddit favorite

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
This car

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Like people just sit on reddit

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And they just watch videos of this car

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
But they're really fast

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Do you want a fast car?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
You don't strike me as a fast car

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
If it's fast enough so we can get away

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Maybe we can make a deal

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Leave tonight

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Live and die this way

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It's a Tracy Chapman song

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
It's a Tracy Chapman song

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I've never felt so old and alone

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I got so excited when he said it

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
You want a fast car

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Like

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Which thing is it?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
And then it didn't matter

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I could have taken forever with it

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
I thought everyone was going to go

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
It's a fast car

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
It's like back in the 90s

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Whenever you said who you're going to call

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
Or anything close to it

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
I know that song

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
But what it sounded like to me

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Is a conversation you would have

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
And somebody was asking you

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
If you would help them rob a bank

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, yeah, I don't know what that's

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I mean, I guess she's poor

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
And she's talking to some guy

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It's like a romance story

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It's a little tragic urban

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
Like slice of life

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
It's like a hard on her luck girl

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Is taking care of her alcoholic dad

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
And she's singing to some guy

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
That has a fast car

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I don't know why she thinks

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
That the speed of the car matters

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I think that she seems like a smart person

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Listening to her sing

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
She's very in touch with her emotions

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
She's no doubt cognitive

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
You know, so she

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I mean, who cares how fast

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
You leave a city

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
I mean, it's not like

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Urban plight is like a tornado

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
In a Bruckheimer movie

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
It's not like chasing you

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
There's no escape velocity

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah, thank you

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
It's not like at the end of I.D.4

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
When the fat lady hasn't sung yet

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
You know, you can't speed out of something

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
It's not like the turn of the Jedi

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
When you're like maneuvering

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I think it's metaphorical

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Is it fast enough so I can

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
So I can forget

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
So I can break free

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Yeah, I know

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
She's walking a tightrope

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
A lot of people listening to that song

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Aren't as bright

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
You know, they're going to be like

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Who cares how fast your car is

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Just get on the bus

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You got a bus ticket

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
I got a transfer and a duffel bag

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
So we could save a lot of money

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Sell your fast car and get three bus tickets

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
We'll take your dog

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
You know, just workshop it a little lady

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Keep brainstorming

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
So you want to get a Tesla?

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
I want to get a Tesla

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Okay, so those of you who don't know

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
It's like this crazy nerd car

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
It's purely electric

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
But it's a luxury sedan

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And it's just...

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
All the reasons you're not supposed to get a car

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
All the things that aren't supposed to

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Make you want to get a car

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
All the 12-year-old in you

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
It has these door handles

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That are flush with the body

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And when you reach for the door

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The handle comes out

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
It has a screen in it

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
So big that I don't even know what to tell you

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
You can watch Yojimbo on it

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah, you could watch The Little Mermaid on it

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
And see cleavage, yeah

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
I don't know, I'm sorry that popped out of my head

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Sorry

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Use your own standards for defining resolution

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
Of a TV screen

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Don't go by me

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I just...

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
How much is one of these running it?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Do you know the sticker price?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It's a couple hundred grand

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I don't know if it's a hundred grand or 200 grand

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
It's like, you know

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
It's more than you should ever spend on a car

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Because cars don't gain value

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Real estate, hey, whatever

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Buy gold, buy a puppy, you know

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
These things appreciate

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Puppies, after 10 years? Boy

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
The resale of those puppies

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
You know, have you seen puppy flippers on Bravo?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's amazing, like these guys are sharks

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And they just boom, boom, boom

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Pimp my puppy?

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
They buy a puppy, they pimp it, they flip it

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Puppy pimpin' flippers

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Right after push-smasters

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Oh, shit, that's fine

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Smush, smush-mushers

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Backbracers

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Backbrace Dynasty

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
On an all-new season of Backbrace Dynasty

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Adam Goldberg smashes some puss

29:32.000 --> 29:38.000
You can't sit here

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I don't care where in the blip

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
You think I can sit, mother boop

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
You tell her I'm gonna sit here

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Monica has lost her mind

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
On an all-new push-backbracer

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Smash your pussers

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
After that, duck, duck, duck, duck people

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Guys that work for ducks

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Aquarium Masters

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Carpet

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Munchers

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
You knew that one, you got all excited

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
You don't know Tracy Chapman lyrics, but you...

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I know it's where the wind blows

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
You know where your brunch butter is

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Alright

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I walked the line with some cupcakes

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And I apologize if you were at the back of the line

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
It's hard to be the back of the line

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
But that does mean that you didn't have to wait in line

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
As long as the people in front of the line

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Erin McGathy, who has gone cake-crazy

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
It is clearly a...

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
More than welcome

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Misdirection and projection

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Of some kind of uterine energy

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
She's living with me now

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We got a puppy

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
She's making a million cakes a day

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I know what this means

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
And I'm fine with it

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
She made like a thousand cupcakes

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And we handed them out in line

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
And while I was out there

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
A gentleman named Lars

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Said that he had brought something to share

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
With the audience and that it wasn't a bag of rocks

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Which is a reference to our last episode actually

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Hello Lars

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So yeah, last week

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Bill brought rocks

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Which I thought was a cool souvenir

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Not the coolest thing exactly

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
So...

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
No, I thought it was good

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Lars, before you reveal it

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
We have to describe that you're holding

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
A very mysterious leather sack right now

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I wanted to keep it quiet

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So I made the sack for it

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
No, the rocks were a good idea

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
It was a nice souvenir, but they were rocks

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
So I brought a bag of polyhedral dice

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Wait, what are they?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Polyhedral dice?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
You just brought a bunch of dice

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
On the rice

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
There's about a...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Yes, they're rocks with numbers

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Bill, a passive aggressive

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Bill went from the audience

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Oh, they're rocks with numbers on them

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
That was pretty aggressively aggressive

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
There's about a hundred in there

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
There's probably just about enough

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
For everybody to grab one

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
They're not all 20 sided

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
There's some 10s and some 8s

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Probably some 4s in there

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I have one complete set

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
If you want to give that away to someone

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
You know what, Lars?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I'd like to present you with a cup

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
No, that wouldn't make sense

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Well, let's give him to Adam Goldberg

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
We made a lot of hay out of his misery

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Alright, thank you, Lars

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
I feel...

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I feel that that...

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I was going to say

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I feel that Adam's back brace

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Is just him slowly walking us toward him

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Coming in here strapped with explosives

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
So we're not going to know when it happens

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
We're just going to stop patting him down visually

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
We've seen him wearing something

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
That you could not get on a plane with

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Thank you, Lars, these are great

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
No, he's holding a thumb up

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Is that the joke you were doing?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I thought you were holding a thumb up

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
To further wean us into the idea that

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
He has a detonator in his hand

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It's great! It's great!

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
There's that back brace guy

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
That's always voting

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
His approval on things

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
You can't sit there!

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Everybody sits over here by the wall

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Gather around!

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I'm going to...

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I'm going to...

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
What do you think, Jeff?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
You've done more shows than me in your life

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
The bag of rocks I thought turned out to...

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
The dispensation of them

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Seemed to take some energy out of the room

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
It was noisy and time consuming

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
But again, I like the rocks

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
The rocks was a lovely token

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
No, I'm just saying, as a crowd control thing

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Is it okay to handle other sacks?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
For instance, that lady in the front

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Are you passing out these dice chair too?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Everyone could take a die

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
There's like a hundred of them in here

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Probably won't everybody get one

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Probably won't everybody get one

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
But I reckon if you take your fail

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
We'll have also a little good time

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
It's a nice soft leather pouch

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
That should mute the...

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I think Laura's thought of everything in this camp

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Let's try it!

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
The dice are being passed about

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Hopefully people in the back

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Will die, you could do anything with that

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Put it on your shelf at home

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Put it between

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Your R2-D2 pencil sharpener

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
And that photo of your dad with the eyes

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Cut out

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Or the Sears underwear model

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
You pretend as your dad

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Because your mom told you he was a lion tamer

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
And he was never around

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
So you just picked a guy from a magazine

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And used to worship him

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
But then when you turned 15

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
You're like, fuck this guy

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Or make a necklace out of it

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
What are you bringing then

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
To this fifth season of Community

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
What emotionally?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I'm going to watch the fourth season first

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
And everyone keeps saying

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You know what you got to do

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
You can finish this along with me

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
You should have Abbot come out of the box

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
That you put him in

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Thinking that at the end of season 3

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I got a feeling this shit's going to hit the fan

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Let's put

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Let's put the weird guy in the box

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And have a bright light flash

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
So that just in case

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Just in the weirdest case

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Like scenario where if I don't come back

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
And then an even weirder case

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
A much weirder case

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I come back for a fifth season

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
You can just have him come out of the box

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And then go, lame

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
And then just

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
And then just get started

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
With a fourth season of Community

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
But you already all thought of that

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I've seen you online saying that

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
And it sounds to me

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And I can say this now because I haven't seen the fourth season

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
So I'm just saying from reading the reviews

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Which was very healthy of me

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
That if there was a complaint

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Among fans

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And this is kind of ironic

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
And something to learn a lesson from

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I don't know what

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Keeps coming up

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
There was what Gina Davis and The Fly

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Would call a synthetic

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Kind of going through the motions

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Sort of this is what community is

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
So here it is for you served up on a platter

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I think that

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
In a world where everybody

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Says that and everybody says

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
You should pretend four seasons was a dream

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
And then if I did that

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Then we're just continuing the cycle of abuse

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
So the fifth season needs to definitely be

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
A kind of emotional

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Spiritual reboot

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
It needs to get back to

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Some kind of basics

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm going to bring the monkey back

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I imagine probably

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Three more monkeys

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
That's the short answer

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Just more monkeys

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
As I've pointed out

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
And I'm going to have a doctor with a face in his hands

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
The back

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Of his hands

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I'm talking mop come on the show

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I could carve myself out a little part

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Couldn't I? They can't fire me for anything now

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
So I could just be like

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Here's Uncle Bill

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Could you be like the Phantom of the Opera

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Each episode begins with me

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Up in an attic going

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I've been up here for a while

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Old Annie's had a lot of adventures

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Just like ruin it

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And just like chum the water

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Or do like an Andy Rooney

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Just to camera ending every time

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
You look to camera and say what you learned

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Well I could be like Rod Serling

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Come out and like

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
At the beginning and end of every episode

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Just go like wow this looks like it's going to be a good one

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Looks like they're doing another bottle episode

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Must have broke the bank on the one before it

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
It all comes out in the wash here

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
At the Harmon's Zone

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
That was pretty badass in Twilight Zone

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
For the creator of the show just who entered

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
The cockpit of the plane

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Smoking!

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
The guys are flying a plane, there's dinosaurs outside

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
And Rod Serling just enters

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
To the side of the plane and goes

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Holy shit

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Not only did I just walk in through the side of a moving plane

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
But I wrote this

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I'm here to tell you

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
If you're not here when the commercial is over

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
You're going to blow my fucking mind

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Because there's dinosaurs outside this plane

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Rod Serling was super badass

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
By the way, very angry

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Very

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Outraged about the

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Blacklisting and stuff

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Like he fucking ground heavy duty

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Paul Bunyan sized axes

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
He was a creative guy that wanted the audience

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
To be happy and knew that

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
McCarthyism was bullshit

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And that the government could

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Suck his smoking dick

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
He just came out there and thinly veiled

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
A million metaphors for it

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Considered for your approval

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
This lady thinks she's awesome because she's rich

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
But she just got hit by a fucking car

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
In the Twilight Zone

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
He sued!

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
He was mad

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
You know he went home and gave it

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
To his wife

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
So much harder than me

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I can't even

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I just

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I'm sorry Aaron

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I can't

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Are you saying that when Sony

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
You can have a conference call that you cannot smash

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I cannot

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
I could maybe move it around a little

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Like a

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Croquetball

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Just knock it around the yard

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I can't smash it

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
But you know Rod Serling

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Rod Serling came home

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
You know Amanda Serling was a happy woman

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
And I'm not saying like

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Even though it was the 50s or 60s

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Or whatever the hell it was

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
There were dinosaurs outside the plane

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
So I don't know if it was

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I bet she was an activated woman too

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I bet she was not

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Like wearing a string of pearls in the kitchen

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And making him roast

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I bet she

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Designed jigsaw puzzles

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Or

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Wrote novels

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Even

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
You're being very generous

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
With Amanda Serling

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
It was the 50s

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
So you have to adjust for cultural inflation

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
And say that would be pretty

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
You see mad men, you know how weird it is

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
When a woman does something

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
It was back then

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
It's not my fault

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
But Rod Serling probably didn't put up with it

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
He probably came home and she was probably like

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
She was probably wrenching on the car

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
And he was like

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I wish that car was my dick

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
And then she was like

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Maybe it is

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And he's like you're right anything's possible

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Fucking Rod Serling

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
That's probably where he got half his ideas

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
It's weird sexual games that they would play

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
She'd like tie him to the bed

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
And go like what if I had a pig face

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
And fuck it

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I gotta write this down

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
You know what Amanda write it down for me

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I'll put my name on it because of course

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
We can't allow you to work in the industry

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Your words will reach America

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Tonight Rod, when you come home

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I want you to imagine that my pussy

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Is

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Dinosaur Land

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
And that your dick is a lost 747

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Yes

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Submitted for your approval

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Every night

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Submitted to me

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Submitted to me

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
You know what

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I'm gonna put Sony out of my mind

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I'm gonna go home tonight

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And I'm gonna get dressed up like Rod Serling

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And I'm gonna give it to Erin Hardin

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I'm gonna take up smoking again

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
And get upset about fear of communism

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
We may have to cut the show short

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I got a little diamond down here

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Just thinking about it

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Really?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
No

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I just can't think of what to do next

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I know that you refer to your hard penis

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
As a little diamond

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I'm never gonna pretend

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm hung like a moose

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
You can tell from my work

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
That I'm dealing with something

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
You're hung like a window at Tiffany's

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It's sparkly

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I make up for the lack of size

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
The clarity

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
And you could use

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
My dick to break into a house

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
In a 70's heist movie

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
So we get you so turned on

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
We just hold you up to a window

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
And you turn me in a circle

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
And James Cahn just reaches through

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And opens the door

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Thank you, Dan

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
You're welcome, James Cahn

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Sorry, I couldn't do it

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I know your dick's too big, Mr. Cahn

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
You don't have a little diamond

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Hero's coming all sizes, Dan

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Thank you, Mr. Cahn

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
But then he gets mad that you use his name

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
In a robbery and then he has to kill you

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Stop breaking the fourth wall, Harmon

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Sorry, Mr. Cahn

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Your character's name is Scorpius

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
In this 70's heist movie

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Wouldn't you be worried that in the third act

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
He realizes that instead of breaking into stealing things

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
He should just be smuggling your dick

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
He should heist your diamond dick

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
And then you wake up

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And there's just a little note where your dick used to be

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And it says

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I got your dick

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And it's just a picture of him on a speedboat

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Wait, did he leave the picture of him on a speedboat?

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Yeah, yeah, so the picture has a polaroid

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Of him like

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
And he's got like a big giant briefcase full of money

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And the world's longest tripod

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Is that like what?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
He had someone

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
He could afford with the money from the dick

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
By the time you read this

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I will have hired Julio to stand on the shore

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Of Cabo San Lucas

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
With a polaroid camera

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
With instructions to mail this to you

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
And place it on where your dick used to be

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And then kill himself

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Because no loose ends

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
No loose ends, that's the name of the movie

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And it's just that the poster's just a picture

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Of a diamond and like a high heel shoe

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
It should be a guy

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
With like a magnifying glass up to his dick

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Like an inspector using a

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Maybe call the movie spoilers

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
I don't know

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Diamond dick

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
No

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I think that's something you want to discover in the movie

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Let's not argue about it

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
We're having fun tonight

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Let's play some Dungeons & Dragons

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Unless there's any more business to attend to

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Let's get to it

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Let's bring up Kumail Nanjiani

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
And Erin McGathy to the stage

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I'm sorry it's become the tradition

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
That I talk for an hour and then bring you guys up

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I always want to bring you guys up earlier

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Can I make a couple comments

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
On things you've said tonight?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
One, the shirt

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
The Harmontown shirt

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
It's so

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
For some reason, the way it feels on me

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
It feels like it's amazing

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It feels like I'm in the womb

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
It's so soft

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I looked up the label

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
And I ordered just regular plain t-shirts

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
From Amazon

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Of that type

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I don't know why that's funny already

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Because it sounded for a second

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Like you had engaged in an elaborate attempt

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
To pirate my shirts

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
No

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Clearly I'm like terrible at

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Figuring out what the demand is

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Because clearly there's a ton of them sitting around

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So I ordered it

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And it was not as good

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
As the one

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Somehow the printing process

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Of you guys' faces on it

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Makes it really comfortable

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Also it's made in Honduras

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I saw

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
My prediction is Honduras is going to

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Take off pretty soon

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Because they're sitting on a gold mine of

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Perfect t-shirts

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
What are the Honduras?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Are those islands?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Nobody knows, there's no way to know

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I wish there was some way to figure it out

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
There's no way

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I believe the Honduras is actually a country

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
But it's not

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
There's not multiple Honduras

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Yeah, there's Honduras

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
And then Honduras is all of them

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
But you guys know when you go there

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Don't go to the big island

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
You gotta go to Hondurito

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
People look at it on the map

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
So let's go to the big island

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Don't, it's so touristy

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
It's a Hawaii joke

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
I guess

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I lost my crowd with the Tracy Chapman

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Reference and of course the

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Upper tax bracket Hawaii humor

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
You know

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
The joke when you're going on vacation in Hawaii

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
What's wrong with the big island?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I just ate peanut butter on ramen tonight

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
You have to be like a showrunner

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Of a season 5

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Show to get the joke he just made

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Yeah

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
You have to hit

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
88 miles per hour in a

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Tesla

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Then the humor can actually

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Like soak into your

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Why don't you explain to them what the Hawaiian islands are

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Just so we all know exactly

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
There's a big one

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
You're not supposed to go to

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
That's the big conversation

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You go to which island are you going to

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
And then they go don't go to the big one

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I think the big one is actually called Hawaii

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
You're on the chain

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Well isn't there like a bazillion but there's like

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Three main ones

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
There's Kauai and Maui

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Why are you doing this?

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I just like

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
You have this smug look in your face like

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
You're either going to reveal that I don't know a lot about Hawaii

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Or how much I do

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I thought you was going to make up false Hawaiian facts

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Oh more bad improv

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
He's doing you a favor he's making you seem less rich

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Because you know less about Hawaii

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Right

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
That would make me seem likable if I went there all the time

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
And didn't give a fuck about it

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Do you go there all the time?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Have you been actually

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
What is Honolulu one of the islands?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Isn't it? No that's a city

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Honolulu is a city on one of the islands

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Probably Hawaii

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Nope

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
We're just guessing at facts about

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
What is it a state? I don't know

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Oh it's a state

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It's also an archipelago

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
It's also an archipelago

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
The other thing I wanted to bring up

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Is that Jason Alexander

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Google him now

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
He has a shamelessly full head of hair

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
He has a full head of hair

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
It's fucking crazy

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It's a miracle

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Yeah he just

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Dragged a lot of coffee once I

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
He was really bald for a long time

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Wow

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
May I address something

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
To your erect penis

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Is little dino

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Oh diamonds

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
God damn it please

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Everyone go back in time and don't

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Correct her I want to know what the rest of her thought was

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Yes

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
We did a ten minute sketch about diamonds

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
As Dix

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I was kind of in and out

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I can connect the dots

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Dinosaurs died

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Became fossilized cold

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
But what were you going to say

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I missed what he said dino

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
The reason why is because of our dog

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I have our dog on the mind

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And his toy is his little dino

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I'm so sorry

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Weird

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Not if that guy was just

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
The first to think of my dick in the dog's mouth

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Certainly

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
He is not the first person to think that

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I was

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Kind of like how

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
When you're sitting in the bed

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
You get the good seat back there

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
When you're further back it's harder to

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
To hear

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
To respect me

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Once I'm out of a certain radius

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And I'm like whoa why did I feel that way

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
And then I come a little bit close and I'm like

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I think some of your hair

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Just got transferred to Jason Alexander

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
He's stealing it

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I kept on half listening for you to say

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Which is so funny because my dog's toy

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I've become the most boring person in the world

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Like I'm just thinking about the dog's toys

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Guys we got a dog

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Have you ever

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Pet a dog before?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
We took it to its first

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Class at Puppy Kindergarten today

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
We took it to Puppy Kindergarten today

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
That was a mix of ahs

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
And uhs

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
What's on the curriculum at Puppy Kindergarten?

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Today it's all people talking about Hawaii

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Today we literally

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Is

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
The exact same demographic

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Which island? Not the big one

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Where people go

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
They see it's a big island and they go

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Let's go to the big island

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Go to the littlest one

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
It's made of cocaine

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
The

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
The first class was

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Wait there are different classes

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Yeah yeah yeah

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
And look by the way

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
They're really affordable

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Karma dog care

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I'm sure the money goes to

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Do what we didn't do which is rescue dogs

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Like I'm saying like

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
It's like out of that

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It's run by James Cahn

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Anyways

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
We did have to hold hands and make a decision

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
At the outset of all of this

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
That we were going to be one of those couples

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
So we're fine with it so you can sit there

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
And judge us in silence. We have a dog

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
We're a dog couple. We're fucking doing it

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Putting the puddle to the metal

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
We went to Puppy Kindergarten today

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
He said puddle

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I thought

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
What did you think I said

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I thought

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Instead of pedal you were going to say puddle

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
And then he just did the average of both

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Oh no

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
The puddle to the metal

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
At one point the woman who was running the class

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
That Dan said that his name was

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Jan

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I mean I'm at Puppy Kindergarten

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
My name's probably not

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
You know Tony

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
What

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I tried to think of the most

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Manly name I could

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I just tried to think of a super manly name

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And then realized that

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Why Puppy Kindergarten

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Is that just

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Because we don't know what we're doing and we're scared that we're going to do it wrong

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
And we're reading every book and we're watching

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
It's like a socialization class. I mean no matter what we say

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's going to sound really silly but it's at an animal hospital

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
It's our dog

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Interacting with other dogs and people telling us

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
How cute our dog is

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I like that you were making fun of animal practice earlier

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Meanwhile that's kind of your life right now

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Yeah

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
But I wouldn't expect more than

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
150 people to be interested in it

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Yeah

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
For free

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I thought that his doctor is not an actual monkey

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Which I think was the premise of that show

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Was the doctor a monkey? I don't know

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And the poster it looks like

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It looks like the monkey is the star of the show

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
He's got a little stethoscope

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
At the beginning of the show a doctor gets cursed

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
By an angry patient and he turns into a monkey

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Is that a Sony show too?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Animal practice was that? I believe it is

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
I like to think

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Jason and Alexander directed a bunch of them

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I bet

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
That's where he got

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Most of the initial foundation

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Of his hair

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I just like to think

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
That they were like

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
When they were green lighting that show

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
That they were like

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Fucking Harmon

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
You have a monkey on your show

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Fucking use it right

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Is it the same monkey or a different monkey?

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Yeah, it's crystal, the hangover monkey

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
You

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
You're starstruck

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
There's just like one great monkey in the world

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Yeah, no, you better believe it

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Crystal? How old is crystal?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I don't know

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
By the way, this is a weird fact

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I found out, this is true, you can look it up

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Lobsters are immortal

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
They only die

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
If you kill them or if they get a disease

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
They would otherwise live forever

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And I heard there's a kind of jellyfish

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
That it's technically never has to die

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
But it eventually will bump into enough things

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
That it will die or will get eaten at some point

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Maybe crystal is like a lobster in disguise

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Or like one of

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Jesus

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I was caught up with the

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Because the gesture you made

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
That Jason Alexander used to kill a man in college

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Was a lobster kind of gesture

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I'm just connecting too many dots

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
This is like an episode of Twilight Zone

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Actually

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Submit it for your boredom

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Aaron, are you worried about

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
This imminent

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Puss smashing session that's going to go on later?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Worried, excited, right

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Girlfriend

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I tell Camille everything about her

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Sex life

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Every time we have a two-week show

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Hello

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Hey

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Are you calling him in the 1890s?

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Marjorie, go into the sitting room

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Hey, Camille

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Oh, hey

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Well, it was smashed again

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
I don't know why me

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I was sitting at home

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I was painting and he came in and he was telling me

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Are you paint?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I always try and change the subject

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Yes, but more importantly

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I painted my orgasms all over the walls

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Of our bedroom

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Bedroom walls, now what color is the

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
It's pink

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
It's pink, it's pink

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
The walls are the, oh, of the house

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
So you got

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
You bought a house

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
How are the

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Mortgage, right?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
I'm just going to

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
React to the end of it

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
That's when we found out my girlfriend

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Doesn't know what an orgasm sounds like

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
That's actually the most embarrassing thing that happened

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Tonight

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And never shall

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Yeah, I mean

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Alright Camille, I'll call you

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
In another month or so

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Every time he gets a haircut

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
All of a sudden he's Bill Pullman

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
It's very telling that

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
That's the most viral man you could think of

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
See, they're him or Tony

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
I don't know

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Bill Pullman

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Spencer, you're a little quiet over there

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Yeah, man, I don't know

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
I just haven't thought of a thing

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
To say

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Are you pros at smashing posts?

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Yeah, do you smash posts?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I've been known to smush a push

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Smush a push

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
You and me and Jeff got pretty

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Boosty the other night

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
We got drunk the other night

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Spencer and I have been

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Threatening to go out and have a drink

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
With each other

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
911

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Okay

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Don't scare me like that, man

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I see 9-11 every day

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Twice a day

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I look at the clock

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
What's happening here is Dan hates

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
The Jeff claims that he sees it on the clock

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
So now I see it more than anyone

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
And every time I do

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I sarcastically point it out

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
You're making me see it now

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I know

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
You win again

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Wait, wait, this is a problem you have

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
You don't like what I say that I see 9-11 all the time?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Probably

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
That's a strong word

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
It's adorable

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I don't believe in the theory

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
It's bullshit

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I see 11-11 every day

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
You just think you do

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Because that resonates

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Thank you, that must have been hard for you to say

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
What the fuck

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
I let you say that I'm much more fascinating

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Than I actually am

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I thought you believed in magic more

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Than you do

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Something about Al-Qaeda's attack on the United States

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Like had a mystical

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
You've been looking, you've been noticing

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
That times since high school

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
For some reason

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
If I get in the car and have a digital thing

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
You always see 9-11?

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
It's that way you picked that day

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You can't pin nothing on me, see

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
This is another lost episode

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
We just accidentally

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Stumble into

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I'm on Dan's side with this, by the way

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I don't have a big fucking hang-up about it

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I used to see it a lot

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And then on 9-11

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
9-11, 9-11 happened

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You were seeing it before 9-11

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Since I was a kid

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And you were just going, oh that's the number for emergency

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yeah, I would always see 9-11

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And then 9-11 happened

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I didn't really connect those dots until later

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But you remember

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I had that crazy panic attack on the morning

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
That all happened

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Yeah, I was so rough for you that day

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm sorry

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
9-11 really was your 9-11

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I will treat your ass like a pussy

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And smash the hell out of it

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Aw, that's romantic

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Aw, right?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Yeah, I'll orgasm all over these walls

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
What color are your walls?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Well, they will be pink

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I woke up at 6am

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Which is around 9am

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
When the planes hit the buildings

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And I woke up screaming and freaking out in my bed

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
In LA

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And I've never had a panic attack in my life

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But I woke up just after 6am

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
In my little apartment

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I used to live in then

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And I was screaming at the top of my lungs

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And bawling crying

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I didn't know why, I was wide awake

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
But I felt like the walls were going to fall in on me

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
And I kept looking at the walls

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Like I was afraid that the walls in my place

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Were going to fall in and crush me

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And that was in danger

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
There was a lot of people on the other side of the world

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
That were really, really in danger

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And I was screaming for a half hour

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Wait, you had a psychic vision

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I'm not trying to be fun

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You had a psychic vision of 9-11

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I have them all my life

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I dream about...

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Why is this not every episode?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Thank you, Camille

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
You guys are talking about me

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Do you believe in magic?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
You guys are talking about K-9 kindergarten

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Ask yourself this question

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Why was he so put off

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
By my insinuation

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That he believed in magic?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Imagine the power you have

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
It's revealed that you have a little bone to pick up

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Does anyone wish they would fight last?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
You know what I like?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I like the idea of a psychic

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Who just doesn't have the confidence

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Because his friends always make it funny

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
To prevent horrible disasters

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
If I lived

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
In a little more supportive environment

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
A lot of lives would be saved

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
There would not have been any 9-11

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You would have been like Mark Wahlberg

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
The problem is

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
The times...

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I have vivid dreams

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
About things that happened

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Within hours

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
There's no time to save

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I dreamt about this

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
The big...

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
When was it? 90?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
The San Francisco earthquake

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Walking around San Francisco

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
The houses

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Full house houses

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Walking down the street

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
With whoopie Goldberg

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Walking down the road

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
All of a sudden, the ground starts shaking up

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
All the houses fall

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
The giant cracks on the ground

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Big fires go on

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
The next morning, San Francisco earthquake

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I like that you've just been sitting on these

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You're like a...

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Now you're a bad guy

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
You could have prevented

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
When I wake up in the morning, I turn a TV on

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Rob Schrab called me

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
After I'd finally come out of my freakout

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
On 9-11

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
He's like, hey Jeff, turn on your TV

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The White House got blown up

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
He got it all wrong

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
That was Rob's description of

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Listen, we've relayed

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
The events of 9-11 from our own perspective

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
One of them is that Rob called me

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Whenever it was happening

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And this is how Rob Schrab describes 9-11

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I have to back off the mic

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Because this is how loud

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Schraub was

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Jesus fucking Christ, turn on the TV

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The fucking world's blowing up

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
The White House blew up

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The Pentagon blew up

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
The World Trade Center blew up

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Fucking missiles flying out of the sky

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And then Jeff is like, I knew it

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Yeah, Jeff's like

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
That explains

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
That explains why I didn't have another dream

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
About San Francisco

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I had one dream one day

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I woke up one morning and got out of bed

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And I remembered this dream that I just had

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And I was like, it was really vivid

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And I was like, okay, that fucking happened

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Because that felt like one of those ones

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It felt like this one happened

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So there's a feeling to the ones that are real

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Otherwise it would be like, oh there's going to be

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
A big peanut butter dog

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Every morning

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
There's going to be a

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I'm going to be naked

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Outside

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I'm going to take deal sets again

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You guys are my mom here in an elevator

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
But she wasn't really my mom, but I think she was

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
That's your curse is that

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Every dream feels

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Like a lot of...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
If that were true then I would have felt like today I was going to wake up

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And I would have gone deep sea diving with Stuart Copeland

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
From police

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You also did the theme to the equalizer

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
This felt real

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I had a dream and I woke up

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And I had my hands in the morning and I looked in the mirror

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And I had this little thing like, oh fuck, that thing happened

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I guarantee it

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And so I go out to meet my brother for lunch

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And I drove out to Venice where he lives

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
By the beach

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And I pick him up and he's like

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Is this one of those, your brother's been dead for 20 years stories?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Because I want to be mostly ready for this

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
He had to find out

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
From a train conductor

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
For some reason

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Your brother's been dead for 20 years

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So he goes

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Are you watching this thing that's happening right now

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
About this Chechnyan

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Hostage thing happening in this theater in Russia right now

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You get real specific

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I had a dream

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
A bunch of people were held hostage in a theater

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And the police came in and there was a standoff

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And they gasped the place

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And they killed all the people too

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
They killed the terrorists and the hostages

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
All as one

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Because they put too much gas and there was something like that

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And there was one American that died

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
In that thing

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
That's your side

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
If there's one American then you have a link to it

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I had a dream

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I had a dream that I was in a theater

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And it was like in the lobby of a theater

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And we're all waiting to go into the seated part of the theater

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
We're in the lobby and there's a bunch of people

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And everybody's speaking a different European language

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
It's all European

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And I'm lost and I don't know where I am

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
All of a sudden they're screaming from the outside in gunfire

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And everybody starts running into the theater

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Like into the seated part

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And hiding and I duck under a table

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Why is this not every episode?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I duck under a table and hold on to a guy's leg

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And he looks like

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
The image of this guy in my dream

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
He looked like a big Cossack

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Like the big flowing pants and the big curvy sword

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
He's got a scimitar

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
A scimitar

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
But he also had an AK-47

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Like a Russian

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You don't know what the vibe of the fight is

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You don't know what the vibe of the fight is

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
He looked like a Cossack basically

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And on the outside

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You don't want to bring a scimitar to an AK-47 fight

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
That's not the Chicago way

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
But there was a guy's all dressed in black

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Like paramilitary people running around the outside

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And I could see him running around by windows

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And I didn't know if this guy was on my side or not

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But I tug on his pants, I'm hiding on her table

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And he's standing there with his gun out

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And I see these paramilitary guys run by a window

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And I see they're coming toward a door

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Like in the lobby area

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And I tug his leg and I point at that door

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And they come in and they're all in black

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Like paramilitary

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And he shoots them all, and then I wake up

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And I remember early in the dream

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I was the only American in this room

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And all this stuff, but like

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Oh, you were the guy that died

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I'm having a very difficult time with this, Jeff

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I mean, shouldn't he sleep more often?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The world?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
You should be just taking Xanax

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And pre-cog, like you should be sleeping in a hot tub

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
You know what?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You should be in a hot tub all the time

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Go to Dan's house

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I've been saying this for years

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
It's not a hard note to take

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Every time you're awake

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Right now, you're kind of killing people

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Because somewhere you could be

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
What I like is that God picked you

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
And he's like, oh, I fucked up picking this guy

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
He's still hungover

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And he's just running on to the stage in Prodigy

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Yeah, you're like doing improv

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Hey, I had a dream that 14 women

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Were raped in a cellar

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Hey, everybody!

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Welcome! Can I get a suggestion of a fart noise?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah!

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I did just using it for your improvs

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
God's like, man, alright

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I fucked up

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Jeff, your improv is really rape-centric

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
You brought up rape, not me

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It would be awesome if there was somebody in the audience

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Like, have you ever seen Jeff doing improv?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
The next day, it's in the news

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I mean, it's never particular

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
It's always very grim scene work

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It's not like, oh, hangover too did better than expected

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
You know, there's a lot of comics

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That like, you know, you're laughing on the way home

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Because they're geniuses

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
His improv shows are like

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
You kind of sit there in an uncomfortable

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Puzzled silence

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
But the next morning, you're like

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Oh!

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Fuck

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Why is this not like

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I've known you for like a year

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I've had a bunch, there'll be times

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
When I'll wake up and I'll have a dream and I'll go

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I'll just get online and I'll look and I'll just type in

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Backyard helicopter crash

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And it'll be just like my dreams

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
There'll be a picture, exactly

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
The amount of people that got hurt or the thing that happened

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Or if nobody got hurt, they'll just say

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I'll just type in, I'll Google some of this shit

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
That happens in my dreams and there's an image of it

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
By the way, four people dead tonight

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I'll do the audience tonight

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
That's the Davis Guarantee

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Only the Americans

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Only the Americans count

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
That is amazing

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
How long has this been a...

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
It doesn't happen as much as it used to be

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
If you ever have a dream where I'm in it

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And something shitty happens to me

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Well dude, don't

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Chechnya me

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
But he doesn't have time, he wakes up and it happened

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
That's why I'm saying

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
He should be asleep all the time

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And people should wake him up every two hours

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
He'll always be pissed, but it's the least he can do

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
It's literally the least you could do

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And then just wake him up and he's always

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Cranky, you know

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Just checking like anything

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I don't know, marshmallows, crocodiles

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Google it

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Go to the Everglades

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Go to every campsite in Everglades

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I'm like sleepy lassie

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Aw, sleepy lassie

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
That's cute

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
That is amazing Jeff

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
So what do you think is going on?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I don't know, I feel like it's

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Like I used to have constantly deja vu

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Like every day

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
The only thing, this is where I am right now

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Because I'm like very

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
You know science and all of that

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Is that how you word that scientifically?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I'm like just a science guy, you know

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
This is what I'm saying

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I have two options right now

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
We're friends and you're like a very

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Normal, grounded guy

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I have to either believe that you're a little bit

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Crazy, or that everything I know

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Is lies

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Those are my two options right now

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I used to have deja vu all the time

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
When I'd walk into a room

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And I would literally

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Like go into like a restaurant

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And I would be like so

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It was a deja vu that was happening

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
But I'd be a little ahead of it

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And I'd go that glass is going to fall off that table

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And it would fall off the table and I'd go

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And there's going to be a fight in like 10 seconds

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And then over and under

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
You're like in Groundhog Day

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
But they say that's like a thing where it's like

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Some people say deja vu is an iron deficiency

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Where brain synapses are

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
What?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Brain synapses are firing twice

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
But it fired once and you store something

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
As a memory that you don't remember where it's from

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So it feels like a distant memory

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
But it's all kind of happening at once

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
So you're kind of double firing at once

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
So your brain is kind of lying

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I used to walk into places and go like

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
We have to get out of here right now

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Because bad shit's about to happen

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And bad shit would happen in there

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I don't like what's about to happen

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I haven't seen that

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Don't you know what it's about already?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
It's not happening

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Oh my god, wow

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I just got that

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
That's amazing

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
What do you think of it, Dan?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Your joke? No, no, no

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
It was fucking great, I laughed

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It took me a while, 40

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
The joke is great

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Look

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Can we retrace our steps here?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I did a callback to a kind of

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Running joke where Jeff has talked

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
About in this podcast with the 9-11 thing

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Every time he looks at the clock it says 9-11

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Not every time he looks at the clock, he sees 9-11

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
And it runs out of time

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
As a guy who like yourself, I believe the phrase he used was

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I'm very like science and all that

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I also am very like science and all that

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Although I am

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
The foremost proponent of having

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
A relationship with the unknown

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And the idea that life is mysterious

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And that there's a consciousness to the universe

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And oblivity blah

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
But that's philosophy

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And kind of like when it comes to

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Abe Lincoln might be in your dining room

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And the numerology

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And the ability of people to

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
This doesn't sound very sciencey

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I'm saying when it comes to that stuff

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
When it comes to that stuff, I'm skeptical

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
By default because it's dangerous

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
To bother to believe something

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
By default

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
We've talked about that here

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
So as a skeptic

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Like Jeff

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Because there's a clock next to Jeff's head

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
So every time I do the show

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I see Jeff's face and I see a big red

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Numbers and it says

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
9-11 which is once during the show

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Lately because we had that conversation

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Jeff look what time it is

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Which is both a callback and it's also kind of like

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I don't know if I'm like proving it's wrong

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Or whatever

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
We talked about that

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
My imagination or did he get a little

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
You got a little like you thought I was like

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Making you

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I thought it was being revealed

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
That was a bur in your boot

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I'd said that

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Like literally that

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Extreme

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
A bur in my boot

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I own it, I don't care

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It doesn't make me

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I don't go like Jeff's hurting my foot

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It's a bur in my boot

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Bur is too strong

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Is there a micro bur?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I've heard of micro buries

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Is that what that is?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
So here's the thing

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I just want to like my sense of justice

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Because I felt like Jeff got mad at me

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
For just a second

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Like I can read his body language in his face

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Because I was like well Jeff you believe

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
That you see 9-11 on the clock all the time

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And wasn't he just for a second

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
He was kind of like what

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
No I'm not that into that

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
And then proceeded to reveal

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That he is the plot of a CW show

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
That every night he goes to sleep

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And werewolves come to him

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And the reason I get angry

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Is because I didn't choose this power

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Let's play D&D shall we?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Spencer if you would

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Last time

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
On Harmontown

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
D&D

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Our heroes were in the midst

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Of a decisive duel with deadly doppelgangers

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Except not real doppelgangers

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
They were the gang's own shadows

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
There's a difference

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
After 30 solid episodes

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
About that long of combat

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
The gang had been pushed to the brink of destruction

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Wounded and bleeding

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Christopher was dying

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Sharpie saved the singer

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Swinging the soul of Rope

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
To soothe the savagely sundered sneak

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Down but not out

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The foes regrouped

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Weapons were used

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Some things happened

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And then the shadows were dead

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
As they stood above the broken corpse

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Of their slain shadows

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
The dark sun pulsed

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And they were back in their home

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
In the canny forest

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
The end

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
The last episode

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And now we're back

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
In our own

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Not back in our own world

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I can't remember

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Before we got sucked to the shadow plane

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Where were we before we went to the shadow plane

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Let's take a trick

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
We were in a fish but the fish blew up

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And we crashed

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Starting plane

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
The material plane

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
That's the homeworld

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Eating by the infinite fish

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Who took you through time and space

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And everything kind of takes you through time and space though

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
In a way like yeah

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Existing would take you through time

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
The earth takes us through space

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yeah

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Fair play

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I mean not really the time

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
To nitpick

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I'm sorry

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Guys here to give us clarity

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
No I know we're all on the same page

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
You two are fighting

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
We're just all defining reality

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Alright so

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You're just saying he took us through the plane of Twilight?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Yeah the plane of Twilight

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Which was sometimes Twilight

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
But not always

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
That was the foresty place

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You met Christopher there

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
He took you to the soul of growth

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
We've been through so much

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
You guys did this stuff

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I used it like crazy in the last episode

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I'm not kidding I can't

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Beef fungus bill came up and played for you

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Thanks

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I thought you were saying thanks to me

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
For letting him play you

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
No thanks beef

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
He reminded me

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Do you have the soul of growth

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It pretty much kept us at death's door

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
When I use it

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It's kind of like a heal

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Heal all

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Like it gives us all a little glass of lemonade

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Anyway

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
The plane of Twilight took you to the plane of shadow

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Now you're back to the plane of

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Material plane

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
We're just back to where my dad was

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
In the burned ruins of the Connie

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Forest

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
What are we going somewhere

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
What are we doing

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
There's a good chance what we were doing

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Was asking what we were doing

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Because we've done that a lot too

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
But really

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Overall what are we trying to achieve

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Adventure

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
No

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Alright

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Well I'm going to put some

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Meat all over my body

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
And just run around in circles

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You can ask in your own day to day life

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
The answer is no more clear than it is

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
What did we do today

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Why did we go to puppy kindergarten

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Is that our mission when we're done with that

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Do we just blow our brains out

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It's a

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
One of you does

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Ahhhh

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I don't think it would be me

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
My nose starts bleeding like firestarter

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
It is taking so much effort

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
On my part to not just

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Talk to Jeff about it

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Well we genuinely asked

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Tell me about it

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
One of us was to commit suicide who would it be

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I mean that's a very dark topic

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Definitely me, what are you talking about

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Yeah, I mean, what? I hope that answer gives you the happiness you need to carry on.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
No, but it doesn't help me any.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
That's a bad or some.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Alright, so can I go back to the game?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I'm sorry, can I ask something and we'll go back to D&D real quick?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So you guys, you knew about this.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Well, I'm always so drunk when I'm with him that the line between my friend being crazy and my friend being psychic is like pointless.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Like it's like jukeboxes are become important, you know, like I start crying about my dad because I hear, you know, a country western song.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
These are things that when you wake up in the morning, you're like, what was that?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Okay, reality is a little fluid.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Did Jeff say he was psychic last night?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Yeah, but I don't believe in psychic.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I don't think psychic is the thing.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
What?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
What is it?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Is it the P word to you? You guys don't know what to call that.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I prefer to call myself temporarily advanced.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I mean, I don't believe in ghosts necessarily either.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I think there's something to people having certain encounters and stuff like that.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I don't think you, I don't think there's spooky ghost running around.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Stan Lee here, please see podcast episode 38 where Jeff talks about ghosts for, like you had a ghost, you have a ghost story.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I have a fucking, I have a couple of goodies of ghost stories.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
That apartment was haunted.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yeah, the Rob Schrab's current apartment is or was haunted when I lived there.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I believe in psychic ability.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I think that we don't, we don't know what we're capable of and I believe you.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I feel like, I'm not saying I don't believe you.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I just want to know more.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
I feel like, like there are a lot of people, I talked to other people that on 9-11 that that morning.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I mean, honestly, like the meeting of the temporarily advanced, like, oh, we fucked up again.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000
It's just, everyone stands up and deals with their guilt of like, yeah, I shouldn't have slept in.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Yeah, jeez.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I was eating toast.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I was doing an improv show in Montreal.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
They're all improv comedians.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I like the idea that there's a class system where there are the people who just know what's going to happen like two hours before.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I felt like there was a time in my life when I actually had like, like visions and voices and stuff like, like,

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
nothing that meaningful about it.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I don't, I don't want to be mean, but this is like such a shitty use of your powers being here right now.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Is it?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Yes.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Okay.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Thank you.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
There was like a diversion path where like one prevents 9-11 and one you're comp-trolling.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I just felt, there was a time in my life when I was, especially when I was really broke and being evicted and I didn't know what was going to happen to me.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I felt very like in the moment at all times.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Okay, okay.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
There was no past, there was no future.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Every, from moment to moment, I didn't know what was going to happen.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And I really felt there was like a, there was a couple years in my life where I felt like I could point to where the lightning was about to strike.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Like if there was a storm out there.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And I felt, it was like, you know, like when Ken Casey and Ashley talked about that, it was like, you're so in the moment that past and future kind of are all touching.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It's all one thing.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
So like, you're just kind of so in the moment that everything, it's all kind of happening together.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Or like someone coming to a show and being like, I think I'm going to play Dungeons and Dragons with Dan Harmon and then that night we go,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
we're going to, is there anyone who's a dungeon master here?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
There's a little bit of magic to.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Sure, but that's a big leap from knowing 9-11 is going to happen.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Jeff, Jeff, have you ever.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Only to the 9-11 people.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
You said that.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
You said that you.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
For those 3,000 people.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Yeah.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
These premonitions were stronger when you were younger.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Did you ever wonder if you caused them?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Did you ever get nervous about them?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
My mom, who passed away when I was 13, she had a recording.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000
She went to a psychic when she was pregnant with my brother.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And she wasn't like, like into mysticism and stuff.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
But she went to, like, had a psychic reading that was recorded.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And everything that she said about my brother, pretty accurate.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And she said about me that I would be psychic.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And then I've been with friends.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Way to bury the meat, bro.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Jeff is going to start flying around the room and be like, no, I'm not.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I'm not psychic.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I just have some ideas.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
My mom's crazy.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
She predicted I would be psychic and now I am.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
But she wasn't into mysticism.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Like everyone does, she had a recording.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I was at a coffee place with my friend Michael Pollock, a piano player.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I am your disciple.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
We're getting coffee and he was going through a bad business thing with some stuff.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And he's totally skeptical, like absolutely a psychic on all kinds of things, I guess.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
And there was a woman doing terror readings.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I'm going to go get a terror reading over there.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So he sat down and he didn't act like, come on, show me what's up.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And so she sat down and she does this terror stuff.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I don't know how it all works.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
It seems like you might.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
So we're sitting there and the first two things she says, she goes, this is about business.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
There's a woman that you work with.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
No, sorry, it's a guy that you work with that's fucking you out or something right now.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
That's why you sat down right now.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
He's like, that's exactly why I sat down.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
So, okay, now I'm on board.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And she got another thing.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Like right before he even said anything, she said two things about it right on it.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And the third thing she says was, as I was sitting next to him, she goes, I'm sorry,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
can your friend leave?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
He's freaking me out right now.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I'm like, what?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And she goes, you're really psychic and it's fucking throwing me off.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Are these stories so old for you?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
You know, like, have you talked about this with him before?

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I feel like I have.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Jeff can't pass the butter without being special.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Like, there is...

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
There's, his stories are like, he...

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
So funny you literally go, there's Jeff again.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I'm not saying that in a punitive way.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I'm like, I'm his best friend.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I've been hanging out with him forever.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
If you're asking me if I'm bored hearing about how remarkable he is.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
A little bit.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I mean, I'm familiar with it.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I know that he is.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I know that he has a lot of...

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
But your mom predicted you were going to be psychic.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
She had, there's this old, like, old tape.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
There's a tape of this?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And the woman that gives her the reading tells her that I'm going to be psychic.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
There's an actual tape of this?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Yeah.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
What?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Well, I mean, we have a podcast, so I guess we should...

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I wish there was some way we could share about the world.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
If my sister would have it, if anybody has it, I'll try to find it.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Your sister that disappeared in Roswell?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
By the way, Jeff's 80.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
All right.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Yeah, so we're on the material...

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Look, you've been around here long enough to hear that he can't go out for drinks without meeting Vince fucking Neil.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It's everywhere he goes.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
He goes to Las Vegas and Neil Diamond goes like,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Hey, wait, sorry, I gotta stop singing.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Who's in the audience?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Hey, you get over here.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And he just goes and hangs out with Neil Diamond.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It's not lies.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
He's not lying.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
No, he's like a real life...

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It's just like, after a while, it's like, ay, ay, ay.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000
He's like a real life forest gump.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
There should be footage of him like...

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I don't want it to stop, but I'm not like, what the fuck?

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I bet six years ago, there was one point where he was like,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
It's all about community, and then he walked away.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Well, he did...

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I mean, he is like...

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
When I first moved to LA, the reason Jeff and I are such good friends is because we were both fucking broke-ass.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Vagabonds, and all we would do was go out for drinks and tell each other how talented we were.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I mean, you're such a good actor.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You're like, I know you're such a good writer.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And Jeff was like, I see good things for you.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
We believed it enough.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
I look back on how bad a writer I was when Jeff was telling me I was a good writer,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.000
and I realized that I owe my entire life to being convinced by it.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I don't know if it's... there's something sad about it, isn't it?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
That was an amazing time.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
It's either Dumbo's Feather or it's like...

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Dan used to pay my bills, and then when he had money, then he was broke, and I paid his bills for a while,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and it kind of went back and forth, and we really were keeping each other alive.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Dude, I don't know how to say this because I'm proud.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Can I borrow $2,000? I'm going to get evicted.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
No, here you go, here you go. I'm so sorry.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And then both back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And every time, what one person would say to the other is,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
look, it's not that big a favor.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I have money right now, you don't, but I know you're going to

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
because I know that you're a special, wonderful person.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I mean, that's beautiful, but now are you bummed out because you know that he knew...

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
that he could have planned...

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Oh my God, I just got that.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
He was cheating.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I was an actual good person.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And he just knew.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Dan, I had to wait until you're ready to learn that to fire that up for yourself.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I fire fire arrows.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I mean, I guess what's the difference, though, between faith and prognostication?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I mean, what is that?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
If you say to your friend, I know that you're going to be president of the United States.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Like, are you a dick if you're psychic and you actually know more than you are?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Maybe cost them to become the president because you already knew what was going to happen.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
That's the thing.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And then you told them...

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I'm telling you, like, I was really hacky when I was 26.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I was not. I was like...

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Monster House had to be rewritten by the lady that did Willy Wonka's whatever adventures.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I sat there for two years, tried to write a movie about a house

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
with children on trick-or-treat and couldn't get through it without having a fucking nervous breakdown.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
My head so far up my ass, I never would have gotten through anything.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000
But I would go out for drinks with this guy that would go like, you know, you're right, you're right.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I bet we'll find a picture at some point of the Civil War and Jeff is there like talking to Lincoln.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Hey, here's an idea. I don't want to be crazy, but...

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's a picture of me in bed the day he gets shot and I was late for the theater.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I had a ticket.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Two tickets to my American cousin on the nightstand and you're just like fucking some flapper.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I was going to say flapper.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
My knowledge of history and women only goes back.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
He just means a woman who talks a lot.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I was so prescient that I predicted the fads of 60 years in the future

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
of what women would be doing and dressing like.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
All your hair is going to be short. You're going to be doing the Charleston.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Did you know he was going to have a haircut when he showed up today?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Yes, because I saw him yesterday.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Okay.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
See, he's not saying it anymore because he has Instagram. He doesn't care.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Okay.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Well, and Jeff, you have kind of a weird relationship with this ability.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
You sometimes embrace it and sometimes...

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Well, you know, there was a time...

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
I was talking to our friend Sam Christensen about it because this is when it was all happening

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and it happened quite a lot and it actually kind of warmed me out a little bit.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
There was times when I felt like I actually felt guilty when the tsunami happened

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
and I didn't dream about it. I felt guilty about it.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
But even if you hadn't dreamed about it, you would have done fucking nothing about it.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Because it would have been...

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I actually went to this place.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I should have dreamt about that.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I'm a bad person.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I couldn't meet my wave blocker 3000.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
In a way, that's the most narcissistic thing I've ever heard.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
In a way?

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I felt like I'm losing touch.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I've lost that thing.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
But Sam Christensen is kind of why his sage friend of ours is great.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
He's like, you're in a place right now where a lot is happening for you

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
and you're kind of in a strange moment.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
He goes, you don't want to be in this place forever.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It's going to take a lot out of you.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000
But when I was really, really broke, I really had...

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I would hear voices and stuff.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I think it's weird to me. I imagine you being broke and being like,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I wish I could somehow make money.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
That glass is going to fall. The helicopter is going to crash.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I wish there was some way.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I guess I'll go on audition.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
What is pilot season?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Time to reach my brain across time and see which blood donation clinic

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
is paying the most tomorrow.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
What is pilot season? That pilot is going to fly into a building.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It stopped happening.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But once in a while, I'll still have dreams where I'll like,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
in the dream, I'll wonder,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
you can kind of navigate your dreams.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
You can kind of pick...

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I want to try to steer left into that part of the dream or go backwards.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I don't have that. I just have...

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
My dreams are on rails.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
There were times when things would be happening.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Actually, I would say out loud...

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
The helicopter went right... I woke up in the morning.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I said out loud to myself before I went to bed as an experiment.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I said, have one of your dreams tonight.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Have one. Have a dream about something that happens tomorrow.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I assume you were single at the time.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
I was.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Have one of your dreams tonight.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
What was that, baby?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
What?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I have to go.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I was very single.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Jeff, do you have premonitions about anybody here?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
No, never people. Never people.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
My dream life is really...

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I wouldn't trade my dream life for anything.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I woke up in the morning and I really went to the computer.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It was the first time I had money to have a computer.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I went to the computer and I typed in

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Mexican backyard helicopter crash.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And there was a helicopter crash that killed three in a backyard.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
They just fell into some residential neighborhood.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
It was exactly what I dreamt.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And I was like, that doesn't help anybody.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
That's the stupidest power in the world.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
It seems like if you'd worked on it...

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I mean, listen, it's probably today.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I'm lazy.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It doesn't happen as much anymore.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
But there was a time and it was pretty wild.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
My favorite memories of us, Dan,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
was when you were writing Monster House and you were just drawing them

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
and you'd just be sobbing, crying

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
because you couldn't finish the script about

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
the house that is a monster.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
And you were so broke one time.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I was like, Dan, you were really broke.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Which is amazing. You'd make like $300,000.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And then six months later, penniless.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
But you had a Pac-Man and a Centipede in your house.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Or in your apartment.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Yeah, I wasn't six months. It was a couple of years.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
What happened to that Pac-Man and that Centipede?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
They're at my studio.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
What studio?

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I make cartoons.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I was imagining a pied-de-taire.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
That's what I was thinking.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
They're at my...

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
They're in Puerto Vallarta.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
At the summer home.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Do you remember when I told you...

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I said, you wouldn't finish the script you were writing.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And I said, write me the first 40 pages of it

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and I'll pay your rent.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And you're like, I'll take you up on that.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Because that's where you were.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And you wouldn't finish it.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
You wouldn't get it out.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
You wouldn't click print on anything.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Like feature stuff.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And I was like, you're so broke.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I'll pay your rent for the next two months if you give me the script.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And I won't show it to anybody.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And you're like, I actually will take you up on that.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And you still didn't do it.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
No, I gave you pages.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
I didn't read it.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
He knew there was shit.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I gave you a manila envelope with the pages.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It was the best.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
It was the best time.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I still think you need to make that movie.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Well, I'm going to.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
By the way, the movie that you're thinking of writing,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
that you've been thinking of writing since you were 25,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
put it off till you're 40.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
You will get so much more work done.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Don't try.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
The thing that you were thinking of when you were 15

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
and you were listening to the Pink Floyd

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and they're like, oh, I can see the whole thing.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'm going to move out to L.A. and I'm going to be a screenwriter

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
because I got this idea.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
It's a fine idea, but fuck you, you can't write it.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
By the way, this Don't Try philosophy

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
exactly explains why Jeff never did anything.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Because he's friends with you

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
and you were like, don't try.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And he's like, you're right.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Well, no, but I'm saying

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
to the young writers in the audience,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I'm saying the ideas that you have,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
the screenplays that you think that you're destined to write,

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
maybe you are destined to write them,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
but much like the relationships you're destined to have,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
you might not be the writer

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
that is supposed to be writing that script at that time.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
So where do you think

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
is the best place to get our ideas?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I think that ideas come

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
from whatever gives Jeff his psychic powers.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I think that ideas,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
this is where I become

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
a non-skeptic about mythology

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
and things.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
I think that we are vessels.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I think that we are prisms.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
To use that metaphor,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
light doesn't look like anything.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
It's in the air all around us.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Campbell said that religion,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
for instance, is a frame that you draw

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
around nothing.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
You draw the frame so that people can actually appreciate

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
what nothing actually means for a second.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But too many religions

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
and too many sects of religions

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
and too many zealots of sects of religions,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
they add so much stained glass,

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
they add so much opacity

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
to the window

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
that it becomes a newspaper.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
It becomes something that blocks light

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and casts shadows.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Those shadows take the form of

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
explosions and wars

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
and all kinds of things.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Because it's too many people taking too much shit

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
way too seriously that was meant to be

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
transparent, open source.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
The air around us is filled

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
with the thing that we are constantly

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
struggling with. We,

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
as a great species, were designed,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
we were born with these antennae

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
that we were able to actually suck

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
the nothingness

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
through us and split it

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
into all kinds of weird shit based on

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
where our parents touched us when.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And spray it

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
onto a piece of paper or onto celluloid

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
or a digital projector

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
or for you kids out there,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
some kind of podcast.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
The light

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
comes through you, it gets

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
scattered unintentionally by who you are.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Your job is to share

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
that map of the cosmos with everyone

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
around you. For

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
that reason, if you're thinking in your

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
head, oh man, I got this great idea.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
It's like Batman, but he's not Batman.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
It's set in the future, but he goes back to the 1920s

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
and he's fighting Chicago monsters and he just drives a Prius

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
and he's got a thing. You know, fuck,

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
you can't steal this.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
That idea you had

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
that you were working on on prom night

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
that you used is the

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
reason why you weren't going.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You will

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
you will write it one day or

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
pieces of it will slowly get chunked

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
into everything that you write, but the important

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
thing to realize is that you don't create

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
ideas. There is something

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
else out there that creates ideas.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Your job is to

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
suck them in and shit them out.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
You know, like you're supposed

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
to kind of be a dick about it, like kind of

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
like be lazy and like follow your

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
bliss and go, is somebody giving me the light?

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Oh, the door's open. Okay.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Oh, shit. I got the light at Harmontown.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
That's when

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
like, okay, now I'm embarrassed.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
No, the, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I'm just saying like,

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
because if you're like me

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
and many of you are, like,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
you walked around your living room

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
and you played certain music and you imagined

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
yourself accepting an Oscar for some

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
movie that had so many fucking characters

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
in it that it was impossible to watch.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Like you, it's some kind

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
of thing. In the meantime

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
you will, you know, what do they say?

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
What's the saying? Life is what happens.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Life is the box of chocolate.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
While you're waiting.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Life is half.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Life is the thing that interrupts you

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
while you're making other plans. What is it?

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Life is what happens while you're making other plans.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Yes. Like, yeah, go ahead

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
chart your course by that star, but accept

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
the fact that that's not what you're going to be famous for.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
It's not, you don't control it.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
We can't all, we can't all be Jeff Davis.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
We can't just go to bed and dream of Chechnya.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
That's the name of your one man show.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Dreams of Chechnya.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Dreams of Chechnya.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Dreams of Chechnya.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Oh, and for instance, you know, we

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
planned, we brought Spencer out here early for some reason

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
and we're not going to play. We're not using him at all.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
We're not going to play D&D tonight.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
But yeah, we kind of, we kind of fell down

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
our own little dungeon. I feel like we didn't

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
really need to go to a magical place

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
because we already were

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I mean, what could be

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
more awesome and weirder

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
and I don't mean, I mean that in a great way

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
than listening to

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
you

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
having dreams about

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
shit that hasn't happened yet.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
That doesn't happen to anybody else. No one else has had that before.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
You'll be surprised.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
What's your name?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Aaron. Aaron, you've had that happen to you before?

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Yeah.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Briefly, what was it?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I was just real small and I just,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I was young and I had a

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
really sexy dream.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
A sexy dream?

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
You were little and you had a sexy dream

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
and it came true. That's not good.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
That's...

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I had a dream

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
about my first boyfriend which was years later.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
So...

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
What did your first boyfriend say

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
when you explained that to him?

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
You never told him?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Wait, you had a dream that you were going to have a boyfriend at one point

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
and then years later you had a boyfriend?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
No, I'm not, I just want to be clear

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
what the power is.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You knew it was going to be the specific guy?

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I didn't know that

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I'd have a face or anything, but when I met him

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I just knew it.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Are you guys still together?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
No. Why did you break up?

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
She told him that story.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I used to live in Illinois and then I moved to Ohio.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
So instead of having a long-distance relationship

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
we just decided to break up.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Alright, so that's kind of different.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I would say very different.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Sometimes love reaches across time, space and

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
money, but you know,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Illinois to Ohio, jeez.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
How are you going to make that work?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
He's got a dreaming of Mexican helicopters.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
So I was surprised you didn't tell him

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
even when you were breaking up.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
If it was me, I would

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
scream it at him as I was

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
grabbing me.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Clearly she got sick of him.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I can't tell him about the dream now.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I hate the way he slurps his cereal.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I don't want him to think that this is cosmic.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
We're actually still in touch, but we don't talk as much

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
as we used to.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
That's good, move on.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Spencer, it looks like

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
we're not going to get to play any D&D tonight, man.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Can I tell you guys I had a dream last night?

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Whoa!

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
That we wouldn't be able to play?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
It was about Jeff

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
and he was talking.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So I didn't prepare

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
any D&D content and it

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
ended up working out.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Whoa!

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Full circle!

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Thank you very much, everybody.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Welcome, and thank you.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Kumail Nanjiani, everybody.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Thank you.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Erin McGathy.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
The Sneaky Leaf Psychic Spencer

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Crittenden.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
One more time for Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
And please,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
if you are

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
a mid to upper levels TV writer

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
and you have not yet been hired

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
by Parks and Rec, please see me after the show.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I may hire you.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Please.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Wow.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
That's a good offer.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Good night, everybody. We love you so much. Thank you for coming.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Thank you.
