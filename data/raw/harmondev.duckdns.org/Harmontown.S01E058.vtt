{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.000\nMusic\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:20.000\nHello Meltdown, how is everybody doing this evening?\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:23.000\nCheering\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:28.000\nI sort of got that feeling there's a frisson in the air, there's some electric energy going on here\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:31.000\nMeltdown Comics here in Hollywood, California\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:35.000\nGood news everybody, Harmontown once again is now in session\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:38.000\nCheering\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:43.000\nOnce again please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon\n\n00:43.000 --> 01:03.000\nCheering\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:11.000\nIf it seems like I'm taller, they re-raised the stage here at Meltdown, it's not just because I got my job back, I'm not like floating\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:18.000\nCheering\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:29.000\nI got my job back, that sounds a lot more pathetic than the heroic triumph of Ulysses coming home and slaying the suitors\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.000\nAre we allowed to talk about this this week?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:39.000\nI think so, but I mean kind of, my agents keep telling me, shut the fuck up\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:45.000\nAnd rightfully so because their job is to close a deal that is not yet officially closed, these things take forever\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:52.000\n90% of the time, probably 99% of the time when writers are in a writer's room their deals aren't closed yet, they're kind of in the process\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:58.000\nThird season my deal was so not closed there was actually a kind of debacle, which is probably one of the 800 reasons I got fired\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:03.000\nThe deal wasn't closed and then Sony put a quote, clock on my offer\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:12.000\nThat means you have to, by sundown you better be in the street or you're going to be in a box or whatever\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nWhatever cowboy they thought they were as a transner is called conglomerate\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:27.000\nI went to the roost in Los Feliz and all the writers followed me and I sat there and I had a drink and I put a clock on them through my lawyers\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:34.000\nAnd I think stuff like that probably is why they were like, when we do get to fire this guy, let's just fire him, he's such a dick\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:40.000\nBut now I have returned and you know what's great? I have not changed\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:49.000\nI have learned nothing\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:54.000\nI have only learned that Joel McHale is the most powerful man in television\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:58.000\nBecause the truth is nobody wanted me back except the actors\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:04.000\nJoel, you thank Joel McHale if you want to be happy for somebody\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:09.000\nI will do my best to make 13 great episodes until I make even a single good one\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:15.000\nDon't pat me on the back because the truth is these companies, they weren't like, you know who we miss?\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:25.000\nLike Joel, sometimes this happens in TV, the actors, the actual people in the trenches, the people that create the product that you enjoy\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:29.000\nThe people who are locked in a hot box for 12 hours a day\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:34.000\nThey're the ones that still end up tearing about the show enough to bother to affect a thing\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd Joel, I don't know how much he's comfortable owning up to this\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nI don't know, so just thank him and leave it at that I guess\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:47.000\nI don't know, like maybe we'll have him on or something and we can tell the story\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:53.000\nBut he's amazing, I mean he's a great guy, a great dad\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:57.000\nOne of those dads that throws his kid up in the air and catches him\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nThrows his kid up, back when his kids were small enough to be thrown\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:05.000\nThat was my first impression of him, he grabbed one of his kids and tossed him like 12 feet in the air\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:11.000\nI'm not kidding and then caught him and I remember thinking like, my dad couldn't do that and I will not be able to do that\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:16.000\nAnd that explains everything, that's why I'm a writer and he's an actor\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:21.000\nIs because he had a dad that must have caught him\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:31.000\nIf my dad threw me 12 feet, there was no return, it was just like a trip\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:41.000\nAlright, well I want to bring Spencer up earlier than usual, let's just bring him up on ceremony\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:52.000\nCareful, yeah, they raised the stage, so if you're tall enough you could die tonight\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nI'm fine down here, thank you\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nHello Spencer, how are you?\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nI'm good, I'm good\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:05.000\nI wanted to make sure you got a good seat because there was a rumor in the green room that Adam Goldberg has lost his mind\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:11.000\nAnd somehow gave himself the role of seating people\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.000\nLike he was seating people and he was just telling them where they could sit\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nLike giving away reserve seats and like telling people they couldn't save seats\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nAnd like, is he on crack or something?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nAdam, where are you?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nCan you come up and explain yourself?\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nI want to go misunderstanding, that would be less funny when I repeat it\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nAdam, you don't want to come up\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nThis must be serious\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:47.000\nAlright, Adam Goldberg, a rare reluctance, Adam Goldberg\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nHow's it going Dan? How's it going Spencer?\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nHow's it going Jeff?\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:59.000\nI'm sure these things get conflated as they reach me back in the mayor's chamber\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\nBut reportedly you've just gone off the rails\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:09.000\nYou know, when you try and date several people on the same night\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nHumble brag\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou have to switch between expensive restaurants back and forth\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nOh, that's a metaphor, sorry, okay\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\nI was like, that was the world's biggest shoe heart\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:25.000\nI love how easily you bought that premise\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nI mean, he took over a room, of course\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nThat's probably the whole dance\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nThere's women coming in and he's going like, well, what's going on?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:36.000\nWell, you're smashing as much pus as I am on a daily basis\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:40.000\nI don't smash like three rules because it rhymes\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:41.000\nYou smush pus\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nYeah, get down on it\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:48.000\nWhen you have a lot of dates in consecutive years\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:51.000\nI'm still not biting\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:58.000\nFair enough, okay, let me count back\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:03.000\nEveryone wants to sit with me, you're all my best friends, all of you guys\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:06.000\nEspecially the new guys who don't know that that's false\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:10.000\nAnd the thing is, I was like, hey, want to save some seats?\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nHey, could you save me some seats? Hey, could you save me some seats?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nAnd I'm like, yeah, sit over in this general vicinity\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nWhich has turned me into the left thumb, right thumb guy from Bergenbelsen\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nYou got roped into saving seats for people\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:21.000\nYeah\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nCan anybody verify that? Is that actually true?\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nNow, I've heard...\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:30.000\nJudas, you're all betrayers, you're all betraying me\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:31.000\nIn my hour of need\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:36.000\nIf one person in your pack of disciples betrays you, they might be a Judas\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:40.000\nIf you're in a sea of Judas, you might be a Judas\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nYou might be Judas\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nWe have an audience full of disciples\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nI was going to say Barabbas\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:55.000\nI'm not parting with my silver that easily\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nYou sound like you have a little cold\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:03.000\nYeah, it's been, you know, I've been getting out and about in consecutive days\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:07.000\nBecause of my back brace, so I can't get all the vigorous physical activity\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nSmash and push\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nSmash and push, and I might like\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nYeah, so...\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nWipe this mic, if it's not my business\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nThe back brace is part of the Adam Goldberg\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:22.000\nThis is the new action figure release, Puss Smashin' Adam Goldberg\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nWorkman's top item is available with all the things I'm seeing here\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:31.000\nPuss specials, Puss Smashin' Grip\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nJust so we have to buy another one\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.000\nAnother Adam Goldberg on the shelf is like a new haircut, Dan\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nThat's worth the purchase, but like...\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\nCouldn't my old Adam smush push, I got him in the...\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nThat's the 30 cents spent at the Salvation Army\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nThe smush push is your country line dance\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nCan we do the smush push?\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nI am in the back brace, it's about as much as you can\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:08.000\nAdam Goldberg's coming, he's smashing all the puss\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:11.000\nHe's coming around the corner\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nGod, you'd say wuss, because that's the time we went to\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nI can't move that very far\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:29.000\nWhen I get my workers' comp checks, action figure gets guitar\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:33.000\nAlright, stay tuned for guitar smash, pushin'\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nAdam Goldberg everybody, wow!\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nThank you Adam Goldberg\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nOkay, he dismissed himself\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nAnd he actually walked off the stage to applause\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:47.000\nWe are the Caesar Milan to the Adam Goldbergs of the world\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nWe're rehabilitating him\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:54.000\nAnd yet in a world where you get fired and rehired and you don't change\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nYou're creating change in the end\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI'm changing everybody, I don't know what I did to his back\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nBut I changed\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:05.000\nListening, the words back brace, I don't want you to conjure too fragile\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:08.000\nOr tragic an image, I mean he's just wearing a...\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:11.000\nIt looks like a Cumberbund, we've talked about it before\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nIt's like a big Cumberbund with suspenders on it\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnd you have to go back into the archives and listen to Adam come up\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nAnd talk about his family's history of back problems\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nAnd there's little flashes of humanity in there\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:30.000\nHere and there, it's pretty charming\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nAlright, so...\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nCan we talk a little bit about this haircut?\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nI know it's not good podcast material\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:42.000\nBut it's nearly military, you look a little bit like Randy Quaid from The Last Detail\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nI got drunk in Chicago with Dino and I...\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nI think how that movie starts too\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:54.000\nAnd I wandered into a stylist salon, Barbershop\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nI don't know the difference between the three\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt had a pointed nose and it laid eggs in dry land\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nSo that's a salon\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nA salon, yeah\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.000\nAnd they were bummed out\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nYou've never seen three gay guys more sad\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nAnd gay guys have it bad\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:17.000\nThey live in a world of bad play\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:23.000\nIllinois is now recently going through their own debacle with marriage rights and things\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nSo I learned while I was there\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nWe've been down that road here in California\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nWe don't even give a shit anymore\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:32.000\nWe're battle weary\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:35.000\nBut in Illinois now, the battle rages on\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.000\nAnd they were not in the mood to cut Charles Manson's hair\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:43.000\nWhen he rolled in off the Chicago streets with Dino\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nI think they maybe were relieved when Dino walked out\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nWhen he was like, I'll see you later\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nAnd they thought he was my partner\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.000\nWhich they should, you know, they should assume that\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nAnd he might as well be\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nAnd we chatted\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nChatted about, you know, I'm down with gay people\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nDid they trim your beard too?\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nIs that what you're doing?\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nThey trimmed my beard\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nThat is laser precision man\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:11.000\nYeah, they made me look like Bob Greenblatt\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:12.000\nThey made me...\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nIt's two trims\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nI've changed\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nI've turned into Darth Vader\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nI am my own, yeah\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nThat's the tragedy\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nHe still works there, right?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nYeah, but give me a break\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI mean, that place is...\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nThat place changes\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nI worked for three people while I was there\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nI got a feeling I'm going to be working for a fourth at some point, right?\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nLook, I don't know how they do their business\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nI saw the animal practice\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nI don't know what decisions...\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nHow they make their decisions\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:46.000\nI saw the billboard with the doctor that had the face in his hands\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nWhat was that called? No holds barred? Do no harm?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nWhat was that?\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:52.000\nIt was a doctor\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:53.000\nHe saw that billboard?\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:54.000\nSomeone greenlit that billboard\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nSomeone looked at that on an easel\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:58.000\nAnd was like, ship it\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nSo I see a doctor\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nHe's got scrubs on\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nBecause you wouldn't be able to tell he's a doctor\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nHe's holding his hands up in the traditional\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nI'm about to go into surgery\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:11.000\nDoctor pose, except that they have to be mushed together\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:14.000\nSo that we could put an evil face on the back of his hands\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nIndicating like a kind of a Jekyll and Hyde thing\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nI'll take four episodes\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nSpeaking of which, you have not watched season four of Community\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nNo, I have not\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nAre you going to have to get down and watch it?\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nYeah, I've got to get down to business and watch it, yes\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:36.000\nAnd Sony, to their credit, they expressed interest in the idea of recording me\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:38.000\nDoing the commentary track\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nThey're so into it that they're starting to make me\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nLike, now I'm not into it anymore\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nLike, that's the thing\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:52.000\nYou know, you tweet something shitty\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nAnd then Sony's like, this is awesome\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nYou can't wait for Comic-Con\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nAnd you're like, fuck you\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:00.000\nThey're invincible, because they're a machine\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nThey're not human\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:02.000\nThey don't have a heart\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.000\nThey have a little cog\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nA little DVD player\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:12.000\nI've said before, by the way, that people that work in special features and stuff like that\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nSony is a gigantic company\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nI think you know that\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nThey make cookies, they make bottle openers\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nThey must make landmines\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nIf any company ever did\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nThey've got to be somehow, some way\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nThere's got to be making landmines\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\nI think that's GE\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nI know, but Sony must have been jealous\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nIt's like, we've got to get in on that racket\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:32.000\nWe're not blowing enough people up\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:35.000\nBut I don't know\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nSo there's a lot of fantastic people there\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:43.000\nCorporations are inhuman and therefore vile by nature\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nBut within them, there are little heroes\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd some of them are the people that make the little Sony DVDs\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nBecause they love making DVDs\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nThey love special features\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nThey love the fans loving special features\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nAnd when the three seasons I was working there\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:59.000\nI made friends with the people in the DVD department\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd we had a lot of fun\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nIt's hard for you to say nice things about those people\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nThat was difficult for you\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nSpencer, what do you think?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:18.000\nWhat about you getting maybe a job back in with the works?\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nI don't know, yeah\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nWhat do you think of my haircut?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nWhat do you think of Chicago?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nWhat do you think of gay people?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.000\nI was discussing it, you know, the haircut\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:33.000\nAnd we landed on like an army guy\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nWhich I enjoy\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nFuck everybody\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nBut yeah, yeah, army guy\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\nAnyway, gay people, great, yeah\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nLike they should have it better in that place\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nDetroit, Chicago?\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:47.000\nChicago, yeah\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:50.000\nChicago, they should have it better there\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nSure, Chicago's a good place\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nI've said it before and I'll say it again\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:58.000\nI don't understand anyone that's not in favor of gay rights\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nBecause it's such a tee-up\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:03.000\nYou can be a hero by not giving a fuck\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nIt's one of the only causes, it's so easy\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:10.000\nLike when are you going to get that opportunity?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:13.000\nEvery other cause demands like a picket sign\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:17.000\nOr like do something, like you can be such a hero\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.000\nBut just standing there and going, I don't care\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nI don't care\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\nJust, I mean, when something comes along like that\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nDo it\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nYou can't help black people by not caring\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nTry it\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nI dare you\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nYou will hurt them by not caring\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nSpeaking of me saying weird things\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nAnd the audience reacting weirdly\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nWe have a lost episode\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nHarmontown has a lost episode, it's our first\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nAudio problems, was it?\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nI think, yeah, the audio problem is that I kept talking about\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nGetting my job back at community\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nAnd I wasn't supposed to yet\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nI'm probably not supposed to now, but we don't have to release this\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nnecessarily tomorrow\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nLike I said, we're in the final stages of making an official\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nAnd I don't know what compromises it\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nI'm not an agent, I don't work in it\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nI don't know what happens, like a corporation is going like\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:22.000\nAll right, should he get $55,000 in a parking space?\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nOr $56,000 and he's got to park his own car\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:31.000\nThis is Jeff Jefferson from parking relations\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:33.000\nAnd we got a parking spot over here\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:36.000\nFor Jason Alexander, we were just promised him\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nSeason two\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nIf I could interrupt there\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nThe key to this operation is going to be synergy\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nWithout a doubt\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:49.000\nWe've said a thousand times, in parking space\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nYou could make a thousand parking spaces\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nIt's not going to make a television show\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:54.000\nSir, I'm sorry, it's a conference call\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:55.000\nWould you identify yourself please?\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:00.000\nThis is just John the janitor\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nBut if this mop could talk\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.000\nIt would tell you\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nYou don't make a show with parking spaces\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:14.000\nThank you John, I think we understand your points\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:17.000\nExcuse me, is that the mop talking now?\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:21.000\nYes, this is Marla the mop\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:26.000\nWe are overextended this fiscal quarter\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:33.000\nI have been squeezed over and over again\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:36.000\nTo the point where we're rearranging deck chairs\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nOn the Titanic\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd mopping the area underneath them\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nWith people like me, mops like me\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nWho cares, edit this out\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nWe're going to have another last episode\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nIf I do enough bad improv\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nIt's a dangerous precedent\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nThis is going to be a test pattern\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nWhen you download this\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\nThis is going to be a recording of an Indian\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nHello\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nYou can't see me right now\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nBut I'm an Indian\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nThe episode you were searching for\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nAudio difficulties\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nThey make me cry\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:18.000\nThere was much talk of black people\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.000\nIn Sony last week\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nMr. Harmon's words were like litter\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nAcross a freeway\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:31.000\nHis improv was like an eagle lost in the wind\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nMr. Harmon, or as we call him\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:38.000\nLimpin' Beaver trying to do make-up-ups\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nAlright\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nWe still have some business\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nThis is a town meeting\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nBy the way, thank you for showing up\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nIn so many numbers, but also, I don't know\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nIsn't there kind of a dark side to that too?\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nLike, fuck you, I guess you just hated me\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nBecause I was fired?\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nAlright\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nThank you\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nThank you\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nThank you\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nThank you\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nLike, I guess you just hated me because I was fired?\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:02.000\nAlright\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:03.000\nWow\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nMaybe you were busy, maybe you were busy\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nI mean, don't feel bad for coming\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nThat would be counterproductive of me to make happen\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nJust think about how I feel sometimes\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nWhen you randomly show up\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nLike when I get fired and then when I get rehired\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nAnd then all the time in between\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nIt's as if my stories about jerking off in my bathtub\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nAren't enough\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nTo bring you out from Tarzana\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nI drop by once in a while\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nI know how many people show up when a real comedian\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nGets up and does material\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nIt hurts my feelings\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:44.000\nIt's like you expect me to write things\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nIn order for me to have value\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nSpeaking of value, big value is going on\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nAt the Harmontown.com store\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nOnline\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nWe are having what's called a flash sale\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nI don't know if that means that it's\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:04.000\nThat you need flash installed\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nTo participate\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nOr if that just means it's like a flash mob derivative\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nLike it's like a sale like super fast\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nI don't know if that means\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nWhat if a bunch of people just showed up somewhere\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nAnd started like conducting like retail business\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nJust like a flash sale\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nLike you just bring a bunch of like garments\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nAnd then people buy them\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nYeah, that would be amazing\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nJust spontaneous acts of capitalism\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nYeah\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nIn the streets\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nIt's a flash sale\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nAnd people like in the outer periphery\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nLike training like like like\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nSomeone makes it a public offering\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nLike on the business going on in there\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:39.000\nSo there's people on the outer rim\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nLike trading stock in the company\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nAnd it's like spreading in the streets\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nIt's just an explosion of capitalism\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nAnd there's a Adam Goldberg with little\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nSuspenders in bow tie on right in the middle of it\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:50.000\nSomeone take it\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:53.000\nWe can call it Wall Street Occupy\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nThere you go\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nIt's like a little reverse\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nLike they take back the night\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nAlright\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nSo if you go to Harmontown.com\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nIn the now\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nDon't do it now\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nWatch the show\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nAnd then go get a t-shirt\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nIt's cheaper now\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nDo we sell them here?\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nDo we bring merchandise here?\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nI don't think we do\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nAnd it's because it gets complicated\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nBecause the Nerdmelt theater\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nThat lets us do stuff here\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nIf you sell merchandise here\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nThen you have to\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nFigure out what the vague is\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nAnd all this stuff\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nYou know you have to like calculate\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nLike consignments and things\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nIt would be perfectly fair to them\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nAnd we're not doing it\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nBecause we're so greedy\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nAnd I don't think anyone's doing anything\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nI'd agree it's just complicated\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nSell our t-shirts online\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nIf that's not true\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nAnd it would be easy to sell them here\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nAnd just give Nerdmelt some money\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.000\nThen let's do it\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nI don't care I'm rich\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nAlright\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nBut I have a feeling we're not doing it\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nBecause it's hard\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nAnd whoever had to sell them\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nWould not be getting paid\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nBut if that's true\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nPay yourself\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nI don't care\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nI won't notice I'm rich\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nI have people\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nI pay people to manage my money\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nSurely they're\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nI hope they're stealing from me\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nIf they're not they should be\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nI have the same account\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nSo I hope that's not true\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nI wouldn't have them steal from you\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nIt's fine\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nAnd I'm sure you keep a tight\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nYou know\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nI'm sure you get out your little\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nScrooge specs at the end of the night\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nYour whale oil lamp\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nI don't know why that's so funny\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nSo go to Harmontown.com\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nYou can buy a t-shirt\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nIt's extra cheap right now\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nIt's like\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nWe made a lot of t-shirts\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nAnd I guess we didn't know\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nNo one would want them\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nSo\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:38.000\nOur bad judgment is\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nYour game\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nThat's capitalism\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nThat's how it works\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:42.000\nEverything must go\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nBecause nothing should have been\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nIt's called supply and lack of demand\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nI think is the principle there\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nSpeaking of capitalism\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nI think now\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nDon't waste a segue that good\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nAlmost top speaking of value\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nHead on down to Harmontown.com\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nThat wasn't that fucking sweet\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nI was like Paul Harvey\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:15.000\nIt was really nice\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.000\nLike in the old days\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:18.000\nLike Jack Benny or something\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.000\nYou know what I was going to say\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.000\nI want to get like a dick head car\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nI've been driving a Prius for\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nI can't even remember\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nThat was the first car I ever bought new\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nWhat's your shame\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nAside\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nSelf-consciousness\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nAside\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nWhat would be the ultimate dick head car\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nTesla\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nI want to get one of these Teslas\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nSee, you hear that response\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nBecause it's a reddit favorite\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:44.000\nThis car\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nLike people just sit on reddit\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nAnd they just watch videos of this car\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nBut they're really fast\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nDo you want a fast car?\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nI don't\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nYou don't strike me as a fast car\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nIf it's fast enough so we can get away\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nMaybe we can make a deal\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nLeave tonight\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nLive and die this way\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nIt's a Tracy Chapman song\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nIt's a Tracy Chapman song\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nI've never felt so old and alone\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nI got so excited when he said it\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nYou want a fast car\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nLike\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nWhich thing is it?\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nAnd then it didn't matter\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nI could have taken forever with it\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nI thought everyone was going to go\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nIt's a fast car\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nIt's like back in the 90s\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nWhenever you said who you're going to call\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:34.000\nOr anything close to it\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:37.000\nI know that song\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:38.000\nBut what it sounded like to me\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nIs a conversation you would have\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nAnd somebody was asking you\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nIf you would help them rob a bank\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nWell, yeah, I don't know what that's\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nI mean, I guess she's poor\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd she's talking to some guy\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nIt's like a romance story\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nIt's a little tragic urban\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nLike slice of life\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nIt's like a hard on her luck girl\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:54.000\nIs taking care of her alcoholic dad\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:57.000\nAnd she's singing to some guy\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nThat has a fast car\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nI don't know why she thinks\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nThat the speed of the car matters\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nI think that she seems like a smart person\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nListening to her sing\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nShe's very in touch with her emotions\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nShe's no doubt cognitive\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nYou know, so she\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.000\nI mean, who cares how fast\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nYou leave a city\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nI mean, it's not like\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nUrban plight is like a tornado\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nIn a Bruckheimer movie\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\nIt's not like chasing you\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nThere's no escape velocity\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nYeah, thank you\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nIt's not like at the end of I.D.4\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nWhen the fat lady hasn't sung yet\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nYou know, you can't speed out of something\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:35.000\nIt's not like the turn of the Jedi\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nWhen you're like maneuvering\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nI think it's metaphorical\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nIs it fast enough so I can\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nSo I can forget\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:46.000\nSo I can break free\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nYeah, I know\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nShe's walking a tightrope\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nA lot of people listening to that song\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nAren't as bright\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nYou know, they're going to be like\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nWho cares how fast your car is\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nJust get on the bus\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nYou got a bus ticket\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nI got a transfer and a duffel bag\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nSo we could save a lot of money\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.000\nSell your fast car and get three bus tickets\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nWe'll take your dog\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:21.000\nYou know, just workshop it a little lady\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nKeep brainstorming\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nSo you want to get a Tesla?\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nI want to get a Tesla\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:28.000\nOkay, so those of you who don't know\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:30.000\nIt's like this crazy nerd car\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nIt's purely electric\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nBut it's a luxury sedan\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nAnd it's just...\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nAll the reasons you're not supposed to get a car\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nAll the things that aren't supposed to\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nMake you want to get a car\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nAll the 12-year-old in you\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:50.000\nIt has these door handles\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nThat are flush with the body\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nAnd when you reach for the door\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nThe handle comes out\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nIt has a screen in it\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:06.000\nSo big that I don't even know what to tell you\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:09.000\nYou can watch Yojimbo on it\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nYeah, you could watch The Little Mermaid on it\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:15.000\nAnd see cleavage, yeah\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nI don't know, I'm sorry that popped out of my head\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nSorry\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nUse your own standards for defining resolution\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nOf a TV screen\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\nDon't go by me\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nI just...\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nHow much is one of these running it?\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:32.000\nDo you know the sticker price?\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:34.000\nIt's a couple hundred grand\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:36.000\nI don't know if it's a hundred grand or 200 grand\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nIt's like, you know\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nIt's more than you should ever spend on a car\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nBecause cars don't gain value\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nReal estate, hey, whatever\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nBuy gold, buy a puppy, you know\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nThese things appreciate\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:48.000\nPuppies, after 10 years? Boy\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nThe resale of those puppies\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:56.000\nYou know, have you seen puppy flippers on Bravo?\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nIt's amazing, like these guys are sharks\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nAnd they just boom, boom, boom\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nPimp my puppy?\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:05.000\nThey buy a puppy, they pimp it, they flip it\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nPuppy pimpin' flippers\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nRight after push-smasters\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nOh, shit, that's fine\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nSmush, smush-mushers\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nBackbracers\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nBackbrace Dynasty\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nOn an all-new season of Backbrace Dynasty\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:32.000\nAdam Goldberg smashes some puss\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:38.000\nYou can't sit here\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nI don't care where in the blip\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nYou think I can sit, mother boop\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nYou tell her I'm gonna sit here\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nMonica has lost her mind\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nOn an all-new push-backbracer\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nSmash your pussers\n\n29:56.000 --> 30:00.000\nAfter that, duck, duck, duck, duck people\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nGuys that work for ducks\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:07.000\nAquarium Masters\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nCarpet\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nMunchers\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nYou knew that one, you got all excited\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nYou don't know Tracy Chapman lyrics, but you...\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nI know it's where the wind blows\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nYou know where your brunch butter is\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:26.000\nAlright\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nI walked the line with some cupcakes\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nAnd I apologize if you were at the back of the line\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nIt's hard to be the back of the line\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nBut that does mean that you didn't have to wait in line\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nAs long as the people in front of the line\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nErin McGathy, who has gone cake-crazy\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nIt is clearly a...\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:42.000\nMore than welcome\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nMisdirection and projection\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nOf some kind of uterine energy\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nShe's living with me now\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nWe got a puppy\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:52.000\nShe's making a million cakes a day\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nI know what this means\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nAnd I'm fine with it\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nShe made like a thousand cupcakes\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nAnd we handed them out in line\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd while I was out there\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:06.000\nA gentleman named Lars\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:08.000\nSaid that he had brought something to share\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:11.000\nWith the audience and that it wasn't a bag of rocks\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nWhich is a reference to our last episode actually\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nHello Lars\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nSo yeah, last week\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nBill brought rocks\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nWhich I thought was a cool souvenir\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:26.000\nNot the coolest thing exactly\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nSo...\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nNo, I thought it was good\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nLars, before you reveal it\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:34.000\nWe have to describe that you're holding\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:36.000\nA very mysterious leather sack right now\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:38.000\nI wanted to keep it quiet\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nSo I made the sack for it\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nNo, the rocks were a good idea\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nIt was a nice souvenir, but they were rocks\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nSo I brought a bag of polyhedral dice\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:48.000\nWait, what are they?\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nPolyhedral dice?\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nYou just brought a bunch of dice\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nOn the rice\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nThere's about a...\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nYes, they're rocks with numbers\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nBill, a passive aggressive\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nBill went from the audience\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nOh, they're rocks with numbers on them\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:08.000\nThat was pretty aggressively aggressive\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nThere's about a hundred in there\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nThere's probably just about enough\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nFor everybody to grab one\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nThey're not all 20 sided\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nThere's some 10s and some 8s\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nProbably some 4s in there\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nI have one complete set\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nIf you want to give that away to someone\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nYou know what, Lars?\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nI'd like to present you with a cup\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nNo, that wouldn't make sense\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nWell, let's give him to Adam Goldberg\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:39.000\nWe made a lot of hay out of his misery\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nAlright, thank you, Lars\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:46.000\nI feel...\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nI feel that that...\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nI was going to say\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nI feel that Adam's back brace\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nIs just him slowly walking us toward him\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nComing in here strapped with explosives\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nSo we're not going to know when it happens\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:03.000\nWe're just going to stop patting him down visually\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nWe've seen him wearing something\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nThat you could not get on a plane with\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nThank you, Lars, these are great\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nNo, he's holding a thumb up\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nIs that the joke you were doing?\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI thought you were holding a thumb up\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nTo further wean us into the idea that\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nHe has a detonator in his hand\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nIt's great! It's great!\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nThere's that back brace guy\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nThat's always voting\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nHis approval on things\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nYou can't sit there!\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nEverybody sits over here by the wall\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nGather around!\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nI'm going to...\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nI'm going to...\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nWhat do you think, Jeff?\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nYou've done more shows than me in your life\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nThe bag of rocks I thought turned out to...\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nThe dispensation of them\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nSeemed to take some energy out of the room\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nIt was noisy and time consuming\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nBut again, I like the rocks\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nThe rocks was a lovely token\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nNo, I'm just saying, as a crowd control thing\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nIs it okay to handle other sacks?\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nFor instance, that lady in the front\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nAre you passing out these dice chair too?\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nEveryone could take a die\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nThere's like a hundred of them in here\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nProbably won't everybody get one\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nProbably won't everybody get one\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nBut I reckon if you take your fail\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nWe'll have also a little good time\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nIt's a nice soft leather pouch\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nThat should mute the...\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nI think Laura's thought of everything in this camp\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nLet's try it!\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nThe dice are being passed about\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nHopefully people in the back\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nWill die, you could do anything with that\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nPut it on your shelf at home\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nPut it between\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nYour R2-D2 pencil sharpener\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nAnd that photo of your dad with the eyes\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nCut out\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nOr the Sears underwear model\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nYou pretend as your dad\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nBecause your mom told you he was a lion tamer\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nAnd he was never around\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nSo you just picked a guy from a magazine\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nAnd used to worship him\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nBut then when you turned 15\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nYou're like, fuck this guy\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nOr make a necklace out of it\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nWhat are you bringing then\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nTo this fifth season of Community\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nWhat emotionally?\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nI'm going to watch the fourth season first\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nAnd everyone keeps saying\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nYou know what you got to do\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nYou can finish this along with me\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nYou should have Abbot come out of the box\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nThat you put him in\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nThinking that at the end of season 3\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nI got a feeling this shit's going to hit the fan\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nLet's put\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nLet's put the weird guy in the box\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nAnd have a bright light flash\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nSo that just in case\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nJust in the weirdest case\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nLike scenario where if I don't come back\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nAnd then an even weirder case\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nA much weirder case\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nI come back for a fifth season\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nYou can just have him come out of the box\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nAnd then go, lame\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nAnd then just\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nAnd then just get started\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nWith a fourth season of Community\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nBut you already all thought of that\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nI've seen you online saying that\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nAnd it sounds to me\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nAnd I can say this now because I haven't seen the fourth season\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nSo I'm just saying from reading the reviews\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nWhich was very healthy of me\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nThat if there was a complaint\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nAmong fans\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nAnd this is kind of ironic\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nAnd something to learn a lesson from\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nI don't know what\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nKeeps coming up\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nThere was what Gina Davis and The Fly\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nWould call a synthetic\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nKind of going through the motions\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nSort of this is what community is\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nSo here it is for you served up on a platter\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nAnd\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nI think that\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nIn a world where everybody\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nSays that and everybody says\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nYou should pretend four seasons was a dream\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nAnd then if I did that\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nThen we're just continuing the cycle of abuse\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nSo the fifth season needs to definitely be\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nA kind of emotional\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nSpiritual reboot\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nIt needs to get back to\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nSome kind of basics\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nI'm going to bring the monkey back\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nI imagine probably\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nThree more monkeys\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nThat's the short answer\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nJust more monkeys\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nAs I've pointed out\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nAnd I'm going to have a doctor with a face in his hands\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nThe back\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nOf his hands\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nI'm talking mop come on the show\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nI could carve myself out a little part\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nCouldn't I? They can't fire me for anything now\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nSo I could just be like\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nHere's Uncle Bill\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nCould you be like the Phantom of the Opera\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nEach episode begins with me\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nUp in an attic going\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nI've been up here for a while\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nOld Annie's had a lot of adventures\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nJust like ruin it\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nAnd just like chum the water\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nOr do like an Andy Rooney\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nJust to camera ending every time\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nYou look to camera and say what you learned\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nWell I could be like Rod Serling\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nCome out and like\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nAt the beginning and end of every episode\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nJust go like wow this looks like it's going to be a good one\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nLooks like they're doing another bottle episode\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nMust have broke the bank on the one before it\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nIt all comes out in the wash here\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nAt the Harmon's Zone\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nThat was pretty badass in Twilight Zone\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nFor the creator of the show just who entered\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nThe cockpit of the plane\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nSmoking!\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nThe guys are flying a plane, there's dinosaurs outside\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nAnd Rod Serling just enters\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nTo the side of the plane and goes\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nHoly shit\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nNot only did I just walk in through the side of a moving plane\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nBut I wrote this\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nI'm here to tell you\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nIf you're not here when the commercial is over\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nYou're going to blow my fucking mind\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nBecause there's dinosaurs outside this plane\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nRod Serling was super badass\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nBy the way, very angry\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nVery\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nOutraged about the\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nBlacklisting and stuff\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nLike he fucking ground heavy duty\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nPaul Bunyan sized axes\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nHe was a creative guy that wanted the audience\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nTo be happy and knew that\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nMcCarthyism was bullshit\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nAnd that the government could\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nSuck his smoking dick\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nHe just came out there and thinly veiled\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nA million metaphors for it\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nConsidered for your approval\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nThis lady thinks she's awesome because she's rich\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nBut she just got hit by a fucking car\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nIn the Twilight Zone\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nHe sued!\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nHe was mad\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nYou know he went home and gave it\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nTo his wife\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nSo much harder than me\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:43.000\nI can't even\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nI just\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nI'm sorry Aaron\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nI can't\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nAre you saying that when Sony\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nYou can have a conference call that you cannot smash\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nI cannot\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nI could maybe move it around a little\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nLike a\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nCroquetball\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nJust knock it around the yard\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nI can't smash it\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nBut you know Rod Serling\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nRod Serling came home\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nYou know Amanda Serling was a happy woman\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nAnd I'm not saying like\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nEven though it was the 50s or 60s\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nOr whatever the hell it was\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nThere were dinosaurs outside the plane\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nSo I don't know if it was\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.000\nI bet she was an activated woman too\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nI bet she was not\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nLike wearing a string of pearls in the kitchen\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nAnd making him roast\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nI bet she\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nDesigned jigsaw puzzles\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nOr\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nWrote novels\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nEven\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nYou're being very generous\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nWith Amanda Serling\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nIt was the 50s\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nSo you have to adjust for cultural inflation\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nAnd say that would be pretty\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nYou see mad men, you know how weird it is\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nWhen a woman does something\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nIt was back then\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nIt's not my fault\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nBut Rod Serling probably didn't put up with it\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nHe probably came home and she was probably like\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nShe was probably wrenching on the car\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nAnd he was like\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nI wish that car was my dick\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nAnd then she was like\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nMaybe it is\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nAnd he's like you're right anything's possible\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nFucking Rod Serling\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nThat's probably where he got half his ideas\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nIt's weird sexual games that they would play\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nShe'd like tie him to the bed\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nAnd go like what if I had a pig face\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nAnd fuck it\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nI gotta write this down\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nYou know what Amanda write it down for me\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nI'll put my name on it because of course\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nWe can't allow you to work in the industry\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nBut\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nYour words will reach America\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nTonight Rod, when you come home\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nI want you to imagine that my pussy\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nIs\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nDinosaur Land\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nAnd that your dick is a lost 747\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nYes\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nYeah\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nSubmitted for your approval\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nEvery night\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nSubmitted to me\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nSubmitted to me\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nYou know what\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nI'm gonna put Sony out of my mind\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nI'm gonna go home tonight\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nAnd I'm gonna get dressed up like Rod Serling\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nAnd I'm gonna give it to Erin Hardin\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nI'm gonna take up smoking again\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:29.000\nAnd get upset about fear of communism\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nWe may have to cut the show short\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nI got a little diamond down here\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nJust thinking about it\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nReally?\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nNo\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nI just can't think of what to do next\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nI know that you refer to your hard penis\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nAs a little diamond\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nI'm never gonna pretend\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nI'm hung like a moose\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nYou can tell from my work\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nThat I'm dealing with something\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nYou're hung like a window at Tiffany's\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nIt's sparkly\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nI make up for the lack of size\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nThe clarity\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nAnd you could use\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nMy dick to break into a house\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nIn a 70's heist movie\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nSo we get you so turned on\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nWe just hold you up to a window\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nAnd you turn me in a circle\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nAnd James Cahn just reaches through\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nAnd opens the door\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nThank you, Dan\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nYou're welcome, James Cahn\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nSorry, I couldn't do it\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nI know your dick's too big, Mr. Cahn\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nYou don't have a little diamond\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nHero's coming all sizes, Dan\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nThank you, Mr. Cahn\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nBut then he gets mad that you use his name\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nIn a robbery and then he has to kill you\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nStop breaking the fourth wall, Harmon\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nSorry, Mr. Cahn\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nYour character's name is Scorpius\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nIn this 70's heist movie\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nWouldn't you be worried that in the third act\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nHe realizes that instead of breaking into stealing things\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nHe should just be smuggling your dick\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nHe should heist your diamond dick\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nAnd then you wake up\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nAnd there's just a little note where your dick used to be\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nAnd it says\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nI got your dick\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nAnd it's just a picture of him on a speedboat\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nWait, did he leave the picture of him on a speedboat?\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nYeah, yeah, so the picture has a polaroid\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nOf him like\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nAnd he's got like a big giant briefcase full of money\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nAnd the world's longest tripod\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nIs that like what?\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nHe had someone\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nHe could afford with the money from the dick\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nBy the time you read this\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nI will have hired Julio to stand on the shore\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nOf Cabo San Lucas\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nWith a polaroid camera\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nWith instructions to mail this to you\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nAnd place it on where your dick used to be\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnd then kill himself\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nBecause no loose ends\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nNo loose ends, that's the name of the movie\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nAnd it's just that the poster's just a picture\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nOf a diamond and like a high heel shoe\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nIt should be a guy\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nWith like a magnifying glass up to his dick\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nLike an inspector using a\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nMaybe call the movie spoilers\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nI don't know\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nDiamond dick\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nNo\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nI think that's something you want to discover in the movie\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nLet's not argue about it\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nWe're having fun tonight\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nLet's play some Dungeons & Dragons\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nUnless there's any more business to attend to\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nLet's get to it\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nLet's bring up Kumail Nanjiani\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:41.000\nAnd Erin McGathy to the stage\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nI'm sorry it's become the tradition\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nThat I talk for an hour and then bring you guys up\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nI always want to bring you guys up earlier\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nCan I make a couple comments\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nOn things you've said tonight?\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nOne, the shirt\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nThe Harmontown shirt\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nIt's so\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nFor some reason, the way it feels on me\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nIt feels like it's amazing\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nIt feels like I'm in the womb\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nIt's so soft\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:11.000\nI looked up the label\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nAnd I ordered just regular plain t-shirts\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nFrom Amazon\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nOf that type\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nI don't know why that's funny already\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nBecause it sounded for a second\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nLike you had engaged in an elaborate attempt\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nTo pirate my shirts\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nNo\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nClearly I'm like terrible at\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nFiguring out what the demand is\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nBecause clearly there's a ton of them sitting around\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nSo I ordered it\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nAnd it was not as good\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nAs the one\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nSomehow the printing process\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nOf you guys' faces on it\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nMakes it really comfortable\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nAlso it's made in Honduras\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nI saw\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nMy prediction is Honduras is going to\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nTake off pretty soon\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nBecause they're sitting on a gold mine of\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nPerfect t-shirts\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nWhat are the Honduras?\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nAre those islands?\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nNobody knows, there's no way to know\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nI wish there was some way to figure it out\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nThere's no way\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nI believe the Honduras is actually a country\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nBut it's not\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nThere's not multiple Honduras\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nYeah, there's Honduras\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nAnd then Honduras is all of them\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nBut you guys know when you go there\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nDon't go to the big island\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nYou gotta go to Hondurito\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nPeople look at it on the map\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nSo let's go to the big island\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nDon't, it's so touristy\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nIt's a Hawaii joke\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nI guess\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nI lost my crowd with the Tracy Chapman\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nReference and of course the\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nUpper tax bracket Hawaii humor\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nYou know\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nThe joke when you're going on vacation in Hawaii\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nWhat's wrong with the big island?\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nI just ate peanut butter on ramen tonight\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nYou have to be like a showrunner\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nOf a season 5\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nShow to get the joke he just made\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nYeah\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nYou have to hit\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\n88 miles per hour in a\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nTesla\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nThen the humor can actually\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nLike soak into your\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nWhy don't you explain to them what the Hawaiian islands are\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nJust so we all know exactly\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nThere's a big one\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nYou're not supposed to go to\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nThat's the big conversation\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nYou go to which island are you going to\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nAnd then they go don't go to the big one\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nI think the big one is actually called Hawaii\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nYou're on the chain\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nWell isn't there like a bazillion but there's like\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nThree main ones\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nThere's Kauai and Maui\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nWhy are you doing this?\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nI just like\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nYou have this smug look in your face like\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nYou're either going to reveal that I don't know a lot about Hawaii\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nOr how much I do\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nI thought you was going to make up false Hawaiian facts\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nOh more bad improv\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nHe's doing you a favor he's making you seem less rich\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nBecause you know less about Hawaii\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nRight\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nThat would make me seem likable if I went there all the time\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nAnd didn't give a fuck about it\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nDo you go there all the time?\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nHave you been actually\n\n48:59.000 -->

I mean no matter what we say\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nIt's going to sound really silly but it's at an animal hospital\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nIt's our dog\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nInteracting with other dogs and people telling us\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nHow cute our dog is\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nI like that you were making fun of animal practice earlier\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nMeanwhile that's kind of your life right now\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nYeah\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nBut I wouldn't expect more than\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\n150 people to be interested in it\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nYeah\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nFor free\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nI thought that his doctor is not an actual monkey\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nWhich I think was the premise of that show\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nWas the doctor a monkey? I don't know\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nAnd the poster it looks like\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nIt looks like the monkey is the star of the show\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nHe's got a little stethoscope\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nAt the beginning of the show a doctor gets cursed\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nBy an angry patient and he turns into a monkey\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nIs that a Sony show too?\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nAnimal practice was that? I believe it is\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nI like to think\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nJason and Alexander directed a bunch of them\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nI bet\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nThat's where he got\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nMost of the initial foundation\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nOf his hair\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nI just like to think\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nThat they were like\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nWhen they were green lighting that show\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nThat they were like\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nFucking Harmon\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nYou have a monkey on your show\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nFucking use it right\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nIs it the same monkey or a different monkey?\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nYeah, it's crystal, the hangover monkey\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nYou\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nYou're starstruck\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nThere's just like one great monkey in the world\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nYeah, no, you better believe it\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nCrystal? How old is crystal?\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nI don't know\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nBy the way, this is a weird fact\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nI found out, this is true, you can look it up\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nLobsters are immortal\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nThey only die\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nIf you kill them or if they get a disease\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nThey would otherwise live forever\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nAnd I heard there's a kind of jellyfish\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nThat it's technically never has to die\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nBut it eventually will bump into enough things\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nThat it will die or will get eaten at some point\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nMaybe crystal is like a lobster in disguise\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nOr like one of\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nJesus\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nI was caught up with the\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nBecause the gesture you made\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nThat Jason Alexander used to kill a man in college\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nWas a lobster kind of gesture\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nI'm just connecting too many dots\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nThis is like an episode of Twilight Zone\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nActually\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nSubmit it for your boredom\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nAaron,

got drunk the other night\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nSpencer and I have been\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nThreatening to go out and have a drink\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nWith each other\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\n911\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nOkay\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nDon't scare me like that, man\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nI see 9-11 every day\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nTwice a day\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nI look at the clock\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nWhat's happening here is Dan hates\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nThe Jeff claims that he sees it on the clock\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nSo now I see it more than anyone\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nAnd every time I do\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nI sarcastically point it out\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nYou're making me see it now\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nI know\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nYou win again\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nWait, wait, this is a problem you have\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nYou don't like what I say that I see 9-11 all the time?\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nProbably\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nThat's a strong word\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nIt's adorable\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nI don't believe in the theory\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nIt's bullshit\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nI see 11-11 every day\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nYou just think you do\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nBecause that resonates\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nThank you, that must have been hard for you to say\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nWhat the fuck\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nI let you say that I'm much more fascinating\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nThan I actually am\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nI thought you believed in magic more\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nThan you do\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nSomething about Al-Qaeda's attack on the United States\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nLike had a mystical\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nYou've been looking, you've been noticing\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nThat times since high school\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nFor some reason\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nIf I get in the car and have a digital thing\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nYou always see 9-11?\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nIt's that way you picked that day\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nYou can't pin nothing on me, see\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nThis is another lost episode\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nWe just accidentally\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nStumble into\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nI'm on Dan's side with this, by the way\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nI don't have a big fucking hang-up about it\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nI used to see it a lot\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nAnd then on 9-11\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\n9-11, 9-11 happened\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nYou were seeing it before 9-11\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nSince I was a kid\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nAnd you were just going, oh that's the number for emergency\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nYeah, I would always see 9-11\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nAnd then 9-11 happened\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nI didn't really connect those dots until later\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nBut you remember\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nI had that crazy panic attack on the morning\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nThat all happened\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nYeah, I was so rough for you that day\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nI'm sorry\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\n9-11 really was your 9-11\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nI will treat your ass like a pussy\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nAnd smash the hell out of it\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nAw, that's romantic\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nAw, right?\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nYeah, I'll orgasm all over these walls\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nWhat color are your walls?\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nWell, they will be pink\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nI woke up at 6am\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nWhich is around 9am\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nWhen the planes hit the buildings\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nAnd I woke up screaming and freaking out in my bed\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nIn LA\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nAnd I've never had a panic attack in my life\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nBut I woke up just after 6am\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nIn my little apartment\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nI used to live in then\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nAnd I was screaming at the top of my lungs\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nAnd bawling crying\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nI didn't know why, I was wide awake\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nBut I felt like the walls were going to fall in on me\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nAnd I kept looking at the walls\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nLike I was afraid that the walls in my place\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nWere going to fall in and crush me\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nAnd that was in danger\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nThere was a lot of people on the other side of the world\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nThat were really, really in danger\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nAnd I was screaming for a half hour\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nWait, you had a psychic vision\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nI'm not trying to be fun\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nYou had a psychic vision of 9-11\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nI have them all my life\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nI dream about...\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nWhy is this not every episode?\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nThank you, Camille\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nYou guys are talking about me\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nDo you believe in magic?\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nYou guys are talking about K-9 kindergarten\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nAsk yourself this question\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nWhy was he so put off\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nBy my insinuation\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nThat he believed in magic?\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nImagine the power you have\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nIt's revealed that you have a little bone to pick up\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nDoes anyone wish they would fight last?\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nYou know what I like?\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nI like the idea of a psychic\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nWho just doesn't have the confidence\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nBecause his friends always make it funny\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nTo prevent horrible disasters\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nIf I lived\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nIn a little more supportive environment\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nA lot of lives would be saved\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nThere would not have been any 9-11\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nYou would have been like Mark Wahlberg\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nThe problem is\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nThe times...\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nI have vivid dreams\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nAbout things that happened\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nWithin hours\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nThere's no time to save\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nI dreamt about this\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nThe big...\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nWhen was it? 90?\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nThe San Francisco earthquake\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nWalking around San Francisco\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nThe houses\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nFull house houses\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nWalking down the street\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nWith whoopie Goldberg\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nWalking down the road\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nAll of a sudden, the ground starts shaking up\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nAll the houses fall\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nThe giant cracks on the ground\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nBig fires go on\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nThe next morning, San Francisco earthquake\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nI like that you've just been sitting on these\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nYou're like a...\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nNow you're a bad guy\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nYou could have prevented\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nWhen I wake up in the morning, I turn a TV on\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nRob Schrab called me\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nAfter I'd finally come out of my freakout\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nOn 9-11\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nHe's like, hey Jeff, turn on your TV\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nThe White House got blown up\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nHe got it all wrong\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nThat was Rob's description of\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nListen, we've relayed\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nThe events of 9-11 from our own perspective\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nOne of them is that Rob called me\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nWhenever it was happening\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nAnd this is how Rob Schrab describes 9-11\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nI have to back off the mic\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nBecause this is how loud\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nSchraub was\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nJesus fucking Christ, turn on the TV\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nThe fucking world's blowing up\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nThe White House blew up\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nThe Pentagon blew up\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nThe World Trade Center blew up\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nFucking missiles flying out of the sky\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nAnd then Jeff is like, I knew it\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nYeah, Jeff's like\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nThat explains\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nThat explains why I didn't have another dream\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nAbout San Francisco\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nI had one dream one day\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nI woke up one morning and got out of bed\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nAnd I remembered this dream that I just had\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nAnd I was like, it was really vivid\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nAnd I was like, okay, that fucking happened\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nBecause that felt like one of those ones\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nIt felt like this one happened\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nSo there's a feeling to the ones that are real\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nOtherwise it would be like, oh there's going to be\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nA big peanut butter dog\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nEvery morning\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nThere's going to be a\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nI'm going to be naked\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nOutside\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nI'm going to take deal sets again\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nYou guys are my mom here in an elevator\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nBut she wasn't really my mom, but I think she was\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nThat's your curse is that\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nEvery dream feels\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nLike a lot of...\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nIf that were true then I would have felt like today I was going to wake up\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nAnd I would have gone deep sea diving with Stuart Copeland\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nFrom police\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nYou also did the theme to the equalizer\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nThis felt real\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nI had a dream and I woke up\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nAnd I had my hands in the morning and I looked in the mirror\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nAnd I had this little thing like, oh fuck, that thing happened\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nI guarantee it\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nAnd so I go out to meet my brother for lunch\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nAnd I drove out to Venice where he lives\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nBy the beach\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nAnd I pick him up and he's like\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nIs this one of those, your brother's been dead for 20 years stories?\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nBecause I want to be mostly ready for this\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nHe had to find out\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nFrom a train conductor\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nFor some reason\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nYour brother's been dead for 20 years\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nSo he goes\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nAre you watching this thing that's happening right now\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nAbout this Chechnyan\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nHostage thing happening in this theater in Russia right now\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nYou get real specific\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nI had a dream\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nA bunch of people were held hostage in a theater\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nAnd the police came in and there was a standoff\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nAnd they gasped the place\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nAnd they killed all the people too\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nThey killed the terrorists and the hostages\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAll as one\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nBecause they put too much gas and there was something like that\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nAnd there was one American that died\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nIn that thing\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nThat's your side\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nIf there's one American then you have a link to it\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nI had a dream\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nI had a dream that I was in a theater\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nAnd it was like in the lobby of a theater\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nAnd we're all waiting to go into the seated part of the theater\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nWe're in the lobby and there's a bunch of people\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nAnd everybody's speaking a different European language\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nIt's all European\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nAnd I'm lost and I don't know where I am\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nAll of a sudden they're screaming from the outside in gunfire\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nAnd everybody starts running into the theater\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nLike into the seated part\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nAnd hiding and I duck under a table\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nWhy is this not every episode?\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nI duck under a table and hold on to a guy's leg\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nAnd he looks like\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nThe image of this guy in my dream\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nHe looked like a big Cossack\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nLike the big flowing pants and the big curvy sword\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nHe's got a scimitar\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nA scimitar\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nBut he also had an AK-47\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nLike a Russian\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nYou don't know what the vibe of the fight is\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nYou don't know what the vibe of the fight is\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nHe looked like a Cossack basically\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nAnd on the outside\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nYou don't want to bring a scimitar to an AK-47 fight\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nThat's not the Chicago way\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nBut there was a guy's all dressed in black\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nLike paramilitary people running around the outside\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nAnd I could see him running around by windows\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nAnd I didn't know if this guy was on my side or not\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nBut I tug on his pants, I'm hiding on her table\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nAnd he's standing there with his gun out\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nAnd I see these paramilitary guys run by a window\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nAnd I see they're coming toward a door\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nLike in the lobby area\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nAnd I tug his leg and I point at that door\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nAnd they come in and they're all in black\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nLike paramilitary\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nAnd he shoots them all, and then I wake up\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAnd I remember early in the dream\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nI was the only American in this room\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nAnd all this stuff, but like\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nOh, you were the guy that died\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nI'm having a very difficult time with this, Jeff\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nI mean, shouldn't he sleep more often?\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nThe world?\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nYou should be just taking Xanax\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nAnd pre-cog, like you should be sleeping in a hot tub\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nYou should be in a hot tub all the time\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nGo to Dan's house\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nI've been saying this for years\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nIt's not a hard note to take\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nEvery time you're awake\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nRight now, you're kind of killing people\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nBecause somewhere you could be\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nWhat I like is that God picked you\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nAnd he's like, oh, I fucked up picking this guy\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nHe's still hungover\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nAnd he's just running on to the stage in Prodigy\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nYeah, you're like doing improv\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nHey, I had a dream that 14 women\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nWere raped in a cellar\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nHey, everybody!\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nWelcome! Can I get a suggestion of a fart noise?\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nYeah!\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nI did just using it for your improvs\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nGod's like, man, alright\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nI fucked up\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nJeff, your improv is really rape-centric\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nYeah\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nYou brought up rape, not me\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nIt would be awesome if there was somebody in the audience\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nLike, have you ever seen Jeff doing improv?\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nThe next day, it's in the news\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nI mean, it's never particular\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nIt's always very grim scene work\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nIt's not like, oh, hangover too did better than expected\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nYou know, there's a lot of comics\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nThat like, you know, you're laughing on the way home\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nBecause they're geniuses\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nHis improv shows are like\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nYou kind of sit there in an uncomfortable\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nPuzzled silence\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nBut the next morning, you're like\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nOh!\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nFuck\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nWhy is this not like\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nI've known you for like a year\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nI've had a bunch, there'll be times\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nWhen I'll wake up and I'll have a dream and I'll go\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nI'll just get online and I'll look and I'll just type in\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nBackyard helicopter crash\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nAnd it'll be just like my dreams\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nThere'll be a picture, exactly\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nThe amount of people that got hurt or the thing that happened\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nOr if nobody got hurt, they'll just say\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nI'll just type in, I'll Google some of this shit\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nThat happens in my dreams and there's an image of it\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nBy the way, four people dead tonight\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nI'll do the audience tonight\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nThat's the Davis Guarantee\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nOnly the Americans\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nOnly the Americans count\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nThat is amazing\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nHow long has this been a...\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nIt doesn't happen as much as it used to be\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nIf you ever have a dream where I'm in it\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nAnd something shitty happens to me\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nWell dude, don't\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nChechnya me\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nBut he doesn't have time, he wakes up and it happened\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nThat's why I'm saying\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nHe should be asleep all the time\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nAnd people should wake him up every two hours\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nHe'll always be pissed, but it's the least he can do\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nIt's literally the least you could do\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nAnd then just wake him up and he's always\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nCranky, you know\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nJust checking like anything\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nI don't know, marshmallows, crocodiles\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nGoogle it\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nGo to the Everglades\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nGo to every campsite in Everglades\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nI'm like sleepy lassie\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nAw, sleepy lassie\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nThat's cute\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nThat is amazing Jeff\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nSo what do you think is going on?\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nI don't know, I feel like it's\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nLike I used to have constantly deja vu\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nLike every day\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nThe only thing, this is where I am right now\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nBecause I'm like very\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nYou know science and all of that\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nIs that how you word that scientifically?\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nI'm like just a science guy, you know\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nThis is what I'm saying\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nI have two options right now\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nWe're friends and you're like a very\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nNormal, grounded guy\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nI have to either believe that you're a little bit\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nCrazy, or that everything I know\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nIs lies\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nThose are my two options right now\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nI used to have deja vu all the time\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nWhen I'd walk into a room\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nAnd I would literally\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nLike go into like a restaurant\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nAnd I would be like so\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nIt was a deja vu that was happening\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nBut I'd be a little ahead of it\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nAnd I'd go that glass is going to fall off that table\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nAnd it would fall off the table and I'd go\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nAnd there's going to be a fight in like 10 seconds\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nAnd then over and under\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nYou're like in Groundhog Day\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nBut they say that's like a thing where it's like\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nSome people say deja vu is an iron deficiency\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nWhere brain synapses are\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nWhat?\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nBrain synapses are firing twice\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nBut it fired once and you store something\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nAs a memory that you don't remember where it's from\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nSo it feels like a distant memory\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nBut it's all kind of happening at once\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nSo you're kind of double firing at once\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nSo your brain is kind of lying\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nI used to walk into places and go like\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nWe have to get out of here right now\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nBecause bad shit's about to happen\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nAnd bad shit would happen in there\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nI don't like what's about to happen\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nI haven't seen that\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nDon't you know what it's about already?\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nIt's not happening\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nOh my god, wow\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nI just got that\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nThat's amazing\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nWhat do you think of it, Dan?\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nYour joke? No, no, no\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nIt was fucking great, I laughed\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nIt took me a while, 40\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nThe joke is great\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nLook\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nCan we retrace our steps here?\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nI did a callback to a kind of\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nRunning joke where Jeff has talked\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nAbout in this podcast with the 9-11 thing\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nEvery time he looks at the clock it says 9-11\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nNot every time he looks at the clock, he sees 9-11\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nAnd it runs out of time\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nAs a guy who like yourself, I believe the phrase he used was\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nI'm very like science and all that\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nI also am very like science and all that\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nAlthough I am\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nThe foremost proponent of having\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nA relationship with the unknown\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nAnd the idea that life is mysterious\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nAnd that there's a consciousness to the universe\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nAnd oblivity blah\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nBut that's philosophy\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nAnd kind of like when it comes to\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nAbe Lincoln might be in your dining room\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nAnd the numerology\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nAnd the ability of people to\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nThis doesn't sound very sciencey\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nI'm saying when it comes to that stuff\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nWhen it comes to that stuff, I'm skeptical\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nBy default because it's dangerous\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nTo bother to believe something\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nBy default\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nWe've talked about that here\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nSo as a skeptic\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nLike Jeff\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nBecause there's a clock next to Jeff's head\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nSo every time I do the show\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nI see Jeff's face and I see a big red\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nNumbers and it says\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\n9-11 which is once during the show\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nLately because we had that conversation\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nJeff look what time it is\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nWhich is both a callback and it's also kind of like\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nI don't know if I'm like proving it's wrong\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nOr whatever\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nWe talked about that\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nMy imagination or did he get a little\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nYou got a little like you thought I was like\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nMaking you\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nI thought it was being revealed\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nThat was a bur in your boot\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nI'd said that\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nLike literally that\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nExtreme\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nA bur in my boot\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nI own it, I don't care\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nIt doesn't make me\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nI don't go like Jeff's hurting my foot\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nIt's a bur in my boot\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nBur is too strong\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nIs there a micro bur?\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nI've heard of micro buries\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nIs that what that is?\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nSo here's the thing\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nI just want to like my sense of justice\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nBecause I felt like Jeff got mad at me\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nFor just a second\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nLike I can read his body language in his face\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nBecause I was like well Jeff you believe\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nThat you see 9-11 on the clock all the time\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nAnd wasn't he just for a second\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nHe was kind of like what\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nNo I'm not that into that\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nAnd then proceeded to reveal\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nThat he is the plot of a CW show\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nThat every night he goes to sleep\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nAnd werewolves come to him\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nAnd the reason I get angry\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nIs because I didn't choose this power\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nLet's play D&D shall we?\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nSpencer if you would\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nLast time\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nOn Harmontown\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nD&D\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nOur heroes were in the midst\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nOf a decisive duel with deadly doppelgangers\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nExcept not real doppelgangers\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nThey were the gang's own shadows\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nThere's a difference\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nAfter 30 solid episodes\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nAbout that long of combat\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nThe gang had been pushed to the brink of destruction\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nWounded and bleeding\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nChristopher was dying\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nSharpie saved the singer\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nSwinging the soul of Rope\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nTo soothe the savagely sundered sneak\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nDown but not out\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nThe foes regrouped\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nWeapons were used\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nSome things happened\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nAnd then the shadows were dead\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nAs they stood above the broken corpse\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nOf their slain shadows\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nThe dark sun pulsed\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nAnd they were back in their home\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nIn the canny forest\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nThe end\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nThe last episode\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nAnd now we're back\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nIn our own\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nNot back in our own world\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nI can't remember\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nBefore we got sucked to the shadow plane\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nWhere were we before we went to the shadow plane\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nLet's take a trick\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nWe were in a fish but the fish blew up\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nAnd we crashed\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nStarting plane\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nThe material plane\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nThat's the homeworld\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nEating by the infinite fish\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nWho took you through time and space\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nAnd everything kind of takes you through time and space though\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nIn a way like yeah\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nExisting would take you through time\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nThe earth takes us through space\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nYeah\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nFair play\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nI mean not really the time\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nTo nitpick\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nI'm sorry\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nGuys here to give us clarity\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nNo I know we're all on the same page\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nYou two are fighting\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nWe're just all defining reality\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nAlright so\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nYou're just saying he took us through the plane of Twilight?\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nYeah the plane of Twilight\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nWhich was sometimes Twilight\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nBut not always\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nThat was the foresty place\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nYou met Christopher there\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nHe took you to the soul of growth\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nWe've been through so much\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nYou guys did this stuff\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nI used it like crazy in the last episode\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nI'm not kidding I can't\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nBeef fungus bill came up and played for you\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nThanks\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nI thought you were saying thanks to me\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nFor letting him play you\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nNo thanks beef\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nHe reminded me\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nDo you have the soul of growth\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nIt pretty much kept us at death's door\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nWhen I use it\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nIt's kind of like a heal\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nHeal all\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nLike it gives us all a little glass of lemonade\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nAnyway\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nThe plane of Twilight took you to the plane of shadow\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nNow you're back to the plane of\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nMaterial plane\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nWe're just back to where my dad was\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nIn the burned ruins of the Connie\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nForest\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nWhat are we going somewhere\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nWhat are we doing\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nThere's a good chance what we were doing\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nWas asking what we were doing\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nBecause we've done that a lot too\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nBut really\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nOverall what are we trying to achieve\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nAdventure\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nNo\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nAlright\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nWell I'm going to put some\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nMeat all over my body\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nAnd just run around in circles\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nYou can ask in your own day to day life\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nThe answer is no more clear than it is\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nWhat did we do today\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nWhy did we go to puppy kindergarten\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nIs that our mission when we're done with that\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nDo we just blow our brains out\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nIt's a\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nOne of you does\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nAhhhh\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nI don't think it would be me\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nMy nose starts bleeding like firestarter\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nIt is taking so much effort\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nOn my part to not just\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nTalk to Jeff about it\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nWell we genuinely asked\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nTell me about it\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nOne of us was to commit suicide who would it be\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nI mean that's a very dark topic\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nDefinitely me, what are you talking about\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nYeah, I mean, what? I hope that answer gives you the happiness you need to carry on.\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nNo, but it doesn't help me any.\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nThat's a bad or some.\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nAlright, so can I go back to the game?\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nI'm sorry, can I ask something and we'll go back to D&D real quick?\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nSo you guys, you knew about this.\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nWell, I'm always so drunk when I'm with him that the line between my friend being crazy and my friend being psychic is like pointless.\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nLike it's like jukeboxes are become important, you know, like I start crying about my dad because I hear, you know, a country western song.\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nThese are things that when you wake up in the morning, you're like, what was that?\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nOkay, reality is a little fluid.\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nDid Jeff say he was psychic last night?\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nYeah, but I don't believe in psychic.\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nI don't think psychic is the thing.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000\nWhat?\n\n01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nWhat is it?\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nIs it the P word to you? You guys don't know what to call that.\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nI prefer to call myself temporarily advanced.\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nI mean, I don't believe in ghosts necessarily either.\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000\nI think there's something to people having certain encounters and stuff like that.\n\n01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nI don't think you, I don't think there's spooky ghost running around.\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nStan Lee here, please see podcast episode 38 where Jeff talks about ghosts for, like you had a ghost, you have a ghost story.\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nI have a fucking, I have a couple of goodies of ghost stories.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000\nThat apartment was haunted.\n\n01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000\nYeah, the Rob Schrab's current apartment is or was haunted when I lived there.\n\n01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nI believe in psychic ability.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nI think that we don't, we don't know what we're capable of and I believe you.\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nI feel like, I'm not saying I don't believe you.\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nI just want to know more.\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nI feel like, like there are a lot of people, I talked to other people that on 9-11 that that morning.\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000\nI mean, honestly, like the meeting of the temporarily advanced, like, oh, we fucked up again.\n\n01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nIt's just, everyone stands up and deals with their guilt of like, yeah, I shouldn't have slept in.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nYeah, jeez.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nI was eating toast.\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nI was doing an improv show in Montreal.\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nThey're all improv comedians.\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nI like the idea that there's a class system where there are the people who just know what's going to happen like two hours before.\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nI felt like there was a time in my life when I actually had like, like visions and voices and stuff like, like,\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nnothing that meaningful about it.\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nI don't, I don't want to be mean, but this is like such a shitty use of your powers being here right now.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nIs it?\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nYes.\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nOkay.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nThank you.\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000\nThere was like a diversion path where like one prevents 9-11 and one you're comp-trolling.\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nI just felt, there was a time in my life when I was, especially when I was really broke and being evicted and I didn't know what was going to happen to me.\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nI felt very like in the moment at all times.\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nThere was no past, there was no future.\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nEvery, from moment to moment, I didn't know what was going to happen.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nAnd I really felt there was like a, there was a couple years in my life where I felt like I could point to where the lightning was about to strike.\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nLike if there was a storm out there.\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nAnd I felt, it was like, you know, like when Ken Casey and Ashley talked about that, it was like, you're so in the moment that past and future kind of are all touching.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nIt's all one thing.\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nSo like, you're just kind of so in the moment that everything, it's all kind of happening together.\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000\nOr like someone coming to a show and being like, I think I'm going to play Dungeons and Dragons with Dan Harmon and then that night we go,\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nwe're going to, is there anyone who's a dungeon master here?\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nThere's a little bit of magic to.\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nSure, but that's a big leap from knowing 9-11 is going to happen.\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nJeff, Jeff, have you ever.\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nOnly to the 9-11 people.\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nYou said that.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nYou said that you.\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nFor those 3,000 people.\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nThese premonitions were stronger when you were younger.\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nDid you ever wonder if you caused them?\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nDid you ever get nervous about them?\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nMy mom, who passed away when I was 13, she had a recording.\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nShe went to a psychic when she was pregnant with my brother.\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nAnd she wasn't like, like into mysticism and stuff.\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nBut she went to, like, had a psychic reading that was recorded.\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nAnd everything that she said about my brother, pretty accurate.\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nAnd she said about me that I would be psychic.\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nAnd then I've been with friends.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nWay to bury the meat, bro.\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nJeff is going to start flying around the room and be like, no, I'm not.\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nI'm not psychic.\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000\nI just have some ideas.\n\n01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nMy mom's crazy.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nShe predicted I would be psychic and now I am.\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nBut she wasn't into mysticism.\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nLike everyone does, she had a recording.\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nI was at a coffee place with my friend Michael Pollock, a piano player.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nI am your disciple.\n\n01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000\nWe're getting coffee and he was going through a bad business thing with some stuff.\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nAnd he's totally skeptical, like absolutely a psychic on all kinds of things, I guess.\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nAnd there was a woman doing terror readings.\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nI'm going to go get a terror reading over there.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nSo he sat down and he didn't act like, come on, show me what's up.\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nAnd so she sat down and she does this terror stuff.\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000\nI don't know how it all works.\n\n01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000\nIt seems like you might.\n\n01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nSo we're sitting there and the first two things she says, she goes, this is about business.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nThere's a woman that you work with.\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000\nNo, sorry, it's a guy that you work with that's fucking you out or something right now.\n\n01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nThat's why you sat down right now.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nHe's like, that's exactly why I sat down.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nSo, okay, now I'm on board.\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nAnd she got another thing.\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000\nLike right before he even said anything, she said two things about it right on it.\n\n01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nAnd the third thing she says was, as I was sitting next to him, she goes, I'm sorry,\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000\ncan your friend leave?\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nHe's freaking me out right now.\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nI'm like, what?\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nAnd she goes, you're really psychic and it's fucking throwing me off.\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nAre these stories so old for you?\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nYou know, like, have you talked about this with him before?\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nI feel like I have.\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nJeff can't pass the butter without being special.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nLike, there is...\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nHoly shit, holy shit, holy shit.\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nThere's, his stories are like, he...\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nSo funny you literally go, there's Jeff again.\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nI'm not saying that in a punitive way.\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nI'm like, I'm his best friend.\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nI've been hanging out with him forever.\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nIf you're asking me if I'm bored hearing about how remarkable he is.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nA little bit.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nI mean, I'm familiar with it.\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nI know that he is.\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nI know that he has a lot of...\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nBut your mom predicted you were going to be psychic.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nShe had, there's this old, like, old tape.\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nThere's a tape of this?\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000\nAnd the woman that gives her the reading tells her that I'm going to be psychic.\n\n01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nThere's an actual tape of this?\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000\nWhat?\n\n01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nWell, I mean, we have a podcast, so I guess we should...\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nI wish there was some way we could share about the world.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nIf my sister would have it, if anybody has it, I'll try to find it.\n\n01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nYour sister that disappeared in Roswell?\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nBy the way, Jeff's 80.\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nYeah, so we're on the material...\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nLook, you've been around here long enough to hear that he can't go out for drinks without meeting Vince fucking Neil.\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nIt's everywhere he goes.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nHe goes to Las Vegas and Neil Diamond goes like,\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nHey, wait, sorry, I gotta stop singing.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000\nWho's in the audience?\n\n01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nHey, you get over here.\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nAnd he just goes and hangs out with Neil Diamond.\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nIt's not lies.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nHe's not lying.\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nNo, he's like a real life...\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nIt's just like, after a while, it's like, ay, ay, ay.\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nYeah.\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nHe's like a real life forest gump.\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nThere should be footage of him like...\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nI don't want it to stop, but I'm not like, what the fuck?\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nI bet six years ago, there was one point where he was like,\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nIt's all about community, and then he walked away.\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nWell, he did...\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nI mean, he is like...\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nWhen I first moved to LA, the reason Jeff and I are such good friends is because we were both fucking broke-ass.\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nVagabonds, and all we would do was go out for drinks and tell each other how talented we were.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nI mean, you're such a good actor.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nYou're like, I know you're such a good writer.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nAnd Jeff was like, I see good things for you.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nWe believed it enough.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nI look back on how bad a writer I was when Jeff was telling me I was a good writer,\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nand I realized that I owe my entire life to being convinced by it.\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nI don't know if it's... there's something sad about it, isn't it?\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nThat was an amazing time.\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nIt's either Dumbo's Feather or it's like...\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nDan used to pay my bills, and then when he had money, then he was broke, and I paid his bills for a while,\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nand it kind of went back and forth, and we really were keeping each other alive.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nDude, I don't know how to say this because I'm proud.\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nCan I borrow $2,000? I'm going to get evicted.\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nNo, here you go, here you go. I'm so sorry.\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nAnd then both back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nAnd every time, what one person would say to the other is,\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nlook, it's not that big a favor.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nI have money right now, you don't, but I know you're going to\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nbecause I know that you're a special, wonderful person.\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nI mean, that's beautiful, but now are you bummed out because you know that he knew...\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nthat he could have planned...\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nOh my God, I just got that.\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nHe was cheating.\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000\nI was an actual good person.\n\n01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nAnd he just knew.\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nDan, I had to wait until you're ready to learn that to fire that up for yourself.\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nI fire fire arrows.\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nI mean, I guess what's the difference, though, between faith and prognostication?\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nI mean, what is that?\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nIf you say to your friend, I know that you're going to be president of the United States.\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nLike, are you a dick if you're psychic and you actually know more than you are?\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nMaybe cost them to become the president because you already knew what was going to happen.\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nAnd then you told them...\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nI'm telling you, like, I was really hacky when I was 26.\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nI was not. I was like...\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nMonster House had to be rewritten by the lady that did Willy Wonka's whatever adventures.\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nI sat there for two years, tried to write a movie about a house\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nwith children on trick-or-treat and couldn't get through it without having a fucking nervous breakdown.\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nMy head so far up my ass, I never would have gotten through anything.\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nBut I would go out for drinks with this guy that would go like, you know, you're right, you're right.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nI bet we'll find a picture at some point of the Civil War and Jeff is there like talking to Lincoln.\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nHey, here's an idea. I don't want to be crazy, but...\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nIt's a picture of me in bed the day he gets shot and I was late for the theater.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nI had a ticket.\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nTwo tickets to my American cousin on the nightstand and you're just like fucking some flapper.\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nI was going to say flapper.\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nMy knowledge of history and women only goes back.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nHe just means a woman who talks a lot.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nI was so prescient that I predicted the fads of 60 years in the future\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nof what women would be doing and dressing like.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nAll your hair is going to be short. You're going to be doing the Charleston.\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nDid you know he was going to have a haircut when he showed up today?\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nYes, because I saw him yesterday.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nOkay.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nSee, he's not saying it anymore because he has Instagram. He doesn't care.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nOkay.\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nWell, and Jeff, you have kind of a weird relationship with this ability.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nYou sometimes embrace it and sometimes...\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nWell, you know, there was a time...\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nI was talking to our friend Sam Christensen about it because this is when it was all happening\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nand it happened quite a lot and it actually kind of warmed me out a little bit.\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nThere was times when I felt like I actually felt guilty when the tsunami happened\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nand I didn't dream about it. I felt guilty about it.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nBut even if you hadn't dreamed about it, you would have done fucking nothing about it.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nBecause it would have been...\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nI actually went to this place.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nI should have dreamt about that.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nI'm a bad person.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nI couldn't meet my wave blocker 3000.\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nIn a way, that's the most narcissistic thing I've ever heard.\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nIn a way?\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nI felt like I'm losing touch.\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nI've lost that thing.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nBut Sam Christensen is kind of why his sage friend of ours is great.\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nHe's like, you're in a place right now where a lot is happening for you\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nand you're kind of in a strange moment.\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nHe goes, you don't want to be in this place forever.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nIt's going to take a lot out of you.\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nBut when I was really, really broke, I really had...\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000\nI would hear voices and stuff.\n\n01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nI think it's weird to me. I imagine you being broke and being like,\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nI wish I could somehow make money.\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nThat glass is going to fall. The helicopter is going to crash.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nI wish there was some way.\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nI guess I'll go on audition.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nWhat is pilot season?\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nTime to reach my brain across time and see which blood donation clinic\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nis paying the most tomorrow.\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nWhat is pilot season? That pilot is going to fly into a building.\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nIt stopped happening.\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nBut once in a while, I'll still have dreams where I'll like,\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nin the dream, I'll wonder,\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nyou can kind of navigate your dreams.\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nYou can kind of pick...\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nI want to try to steer left into that part of the dream or go backwards.\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nI don't have that. I just have...\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nMy dreams are on rails.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nThere were times when things would be happening.\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nActually, I would say out loud...\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nThe helicopter went right... I woke up in the morning.\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nI said out loud to myself before I went to bed as an experiment.\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nI said, have one of your dreams tonight.\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nHave one. Have a dream about something that happens tomorrow.\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nI assume you were single at the time.\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000\nI was.\n\n01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nHave one of your dreams tonight.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nWhat was that, baby?\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nWhat?\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nI have to go.\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nI was very single.\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nJeff, do you have premonitions about anybody here?\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nNo, never people. Never people.\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nMy dream life is really...\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nI wouldn't trade my dream life for anything.\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nI woke up in the morning and I really went to the computer.\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nIt was the first time I had money to have a computer.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nI went to the computer and I typed in\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nMexican backyard helicopter crash.\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nAnd there was a helicopter crash that killed three in a backyard.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nThey just fell into some residential neighborhood.\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nIt was exactly what I dreamt.\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nAnd I was like, that doesn't help anybody.\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nThat's the stupidest power in the world.\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nIt seems like if you'd worked on it...\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nI mean, listen, it's probably today.\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nI'm lazy.\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nIt doesn't happen as much anymore.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nBut there was a time and it was pretty wild.\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nMy favorite memories of us, Dan,\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nwas when you were writing Monster House and you were just drawing them\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nand you'd just be sobbing, crying\n\n01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nbecause you couldn't finish the script about\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nthe house that is a monster.\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000\nAnd you were so broke one time.\n\n01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nI was like, Dan, you were really broke.\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nWhich is amazing. You'd make like $300,000.\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nAnd then six months later, penniless.\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nBut you had a Pac-Man and a Centipede in your house.\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nOr in your apartment.\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000\nYeah, I wasn't six months. It was a couple of years.\n\n01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nWhat happened to that Pac-Man and that Centipede?\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000\nThey're at my studio.\n\n01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nWhat studio?\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000\nI make cartoons.\n\n01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nI was imagining a pied-de-taire.\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000\nThat's what I was thinking.\n\n01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nThey're at my...\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nThey're in Puerto Vallarta.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nAt the summer home.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nDo you remember when I told you...\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nI said, you wouldn't finish the script you were writing.\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000\nAnd I said, write me the first 40 pages of it\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000\nand I'll pay your rent.\n\n01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nAnd you're like, I'll take you up on that.\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nBecause that's where you were.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nAnd you wouldn't finish it.\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nYou wouldn't get it out.\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nYou wouldn't click print on anything.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nLike feature stuff.\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nAnd I was like, you're so broke.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nI'll pay your rent for the next two months if you give me the script.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nAnd I won't show it to anybody.\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nAnd you're like, I actually will take you up on that.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nAnd you still didn't do it.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nNo, I gave you pages.\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000\nI didn't read it.\n\n01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nHe knew there was shit.\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nI gave you a manila envelope with the pages.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000\nIt was the best.\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nIt was the best time.\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nI still think you need to make that movie.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nWell, I'm going to.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nBy the way, the movie that you're thinking of writing,\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nthat you've been thinking of writing since you were 25,\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nput it off till you're 40.\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nYou will get so much more work done.\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000\nDon't try.\n\n01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nThe thing that you were thinking of when you were 15\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nand you were listening to the Pink Floyd\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nand they're like, oh, I can see the whole thing.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nI'm going to move out to L.A. and I'm going to be a screenwriter\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nbecause I got this idea.\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nIt's a fine idea, but fuck you, you can't write it.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nBy the way, this Don't Try philosophy\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nexactly explains why Jeff never did anything.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nBecause he's friends with you\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nand you were like, don't try.\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nAnd he's like, you're right.\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nWell, no, but I'm saying\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nto the young writers in the audience,\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000\nI'm saying the ideas that you have,\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000\nthe screenplays that you think that you're destined to write,\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nmaybe you are destined to write them,\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nbut much like the relationships you're destined to have,\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000\nyou might not be the writer\n\n01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nthat is supposed to be
