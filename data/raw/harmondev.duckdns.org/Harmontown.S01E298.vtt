{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:12.720\nGoddamn right, how are you tonight?\n\n00:12.720 --> 00:20.280\nHormontown is now in session, let me hear you at home.\n\n00:20.280 --> 00:22.280\nMake them jealous though.\n\n00:22.280 --> 00:23.280\nYeah!\n\n00:23.280 --> 00:28.320\nWe're so glad you're here, welcome to the Dynasty Typewriter, thank you so much for\n\n00:28.320 --> 00:30.500\ncoming all the way downtown.\n\n00:30.500 --> 00:35.800\nLet me bring to the stage someone you know and love, Spencer Crittenden!\n\n00:35.800 --> 00:43.520\nHe's no joke, Game Master Jordanair.\n\n00:43.520 --> 00:48.520\nComing back from his sold out all over the city tour, from place to place, but mostly\n\n00:48.520 --> 00:52.400\nhis couch, the mayor of Hormontown, Dan Hormont!\n\n00:52.400 --> 01:01.000\nI am your Comptroller, my name is Brandon Johnson, have a good night.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:11.760\nYeah, yeah, hip, yo, hip, hop, yo, hip, hop, got the rhythm, got the soul, got your mama's\n\n01:11.760 --> 01:20.240\npussy in a bowl, pouring it like cereal, and now out, I'm going out to rock and roll.\n\n01:20.240 --> 01:26.360\nI fucked your daddy too, gender equality, whatcha gonna do, here's some gender fluidity,\n\n01:26.360 --> 01:30.840\nI fucked your sister, even though next week she's gonna be a mister.\n\n01:30.840 --> 01:32.840\nA family treat!\n\n01:32.840 --> 01:37.360\nSo that was my pitch for gender equality, but it turned into like a classic, like kind\n\n01:37.360 --> 01:40.720\nof tranny joke from the 90s.\n\n01:40.720 --> 01:45.360\nYou played yourself!\n\n01:45.360 --> 01:49.560\nI think everybody should be able to say whatever the fuck they, whoever they are, I don't care,\n\n01:49.560 --> 01:52.000\nI don't care anymore.\n\n01:52.000 --> 02:00.800\nI'm listening to this book on tape, Sapiens, let me, thank you, I'm assuming that was for\n\n02:00.800 --> 02:02.960\nthe author and he can't be here.\n\n02:02.960 --> 02:03.960\nOr just Homo Sapiens?\n\n02:03.960 --> 02:05.480\nRight, that's what I thought.\n\n02:05.480 --> 02:10.200\nWell that's the interesting thing, I was kind of afraid to go get back into anthropology\n\n02:10.200 --> 02:15.960\nbecause I think the last book I read on anthropology was like a 1967 book, The Naked Ape by Desmond\n\n02:15.960 --> 02:20.800\nMorris and I think like, I've always been kind of an armchair anthropology fan, but\n\n02:20.800 --> 02:24.440\nit's different from being passionate about anthropology because those people read stuff\n\n02:24.440 --> 02:31.000\nand learn stuff, but the thing is anthropology is like a real loaded gun, like it's just\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:38.400\nfilled with like, the can just says flavor, it doesn't say what flavor, it may not comfort\n\n02:38.400 --> 02:42.960\nyou, like an anthropologist may say things like this guy at one point is riffing and\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:48.480\njust says like, well actually brain size has decreased since the days of foraging because\n\n02:48.480 --> 02:53.480\nhumanity's ability to create culture made room for an imbecile class, and you're just\n\n02:53.480 --> 02:57.760\nlike, whoa, what the, what?\n\n02:57.760 --> 03:04.320\nAnd it's like a, you know, like, whoa, loaded gun, baby.\n\n03:04.320 --> 03:09.920\nBut yeah, you know, things like before we were agrarian and when every single person,\n\n03:09.920 --> 03:14.200\nlike, like basically when you couldn't, everyone was just running around like, oh, there's\n\n03:14.200 --> 03:16.680\na mushroom, I guess I'll live for another hour.\n\n03:16.680 --> 03:21.200\nThere's a, there's a frog, there's a, there's a, there's a piece of bacon, I don't know\n\n03:21.200 --> 03:23.200\nhow bacon works.\n\n03:23.200 --> 03:26.960\nIt must come from some plant or something, right?\n\n03:26.960 --> 03:33.200\nForaging gives you all this nutritional variety and it like, it also demands this incredible\n\n03:33.200 --> 03:35.080\nversatility in your brain.\n\n03:35.080 --> 03:40.480\nAnd so he was talking about how this idea of like, look, if you're like, the whole,\n\n03:40.480 --> 03:44.640\nthe whole books, I haven't even scratched the surface yet, but the book seems to start\n\n03:44.640 --> 03:50.000\nto tell the story of how, all right, what is it that made human beings like ravage the\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nearth?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:57.760\nLike, why are we the, the human species of which there are at least like six or so that\n\n03:57.760 --> 04:02.600\nhave walked the earth, many of whom at the same time, like Homo erectus, Neanderthals,\n\n04:02.600 --> 04:03.600\nall that stuff.\n\n04:03.600 --> 04:04.600\nYou've heard of that before.\n\n04:04.600 --> 04:08.680\nLike, like, we're, we're, we're, we're not only cut, we're cousins with gorillas and\n\n04:08.680 --> 04:13.640\nchimps and orangutans, but we're, we have siblings that are gone and their blood is\n\n04:13.640 --> 04:14.640\non our hands.\n\n04:14.640 --> 04:18.280\nLike, like, and that's actually weird.\n\n04:18.280 --> 04:21.920\nThere's a million kinds of fox, there's a million kinds of bear.\n\n04:21.920 --> 04:26.520\nThere's only one kind of human and it's not because they all don't work.\n\n04:26.520 --> 04:31.760\nLike there's room for a lot of kind of bear and it's like, oh, like one species of human\n\n04:31.760 --> 04:36.080\nHomo sapien, as opposed to Homo erectus, which I always thought was like, I always thought\n\n04:36.080 --> 04:37.600\nthere was like that, you know, lineage.\n\n04:37.600 --> 04:40.320\nI thought Neanderthals died out because they were dumb.\n\n04:40.320 --> 04:41.320\nBut they're not.\n\n04:41.320 --> 04:42.320\nI mean, they were dumb in certain ways.\n\n04:42.320 --> 04:47.120\nI think that we used to think that they didn't simultaneously exist on the earth and that\n\n04:47.120 --> 04:51.080\nchain, that understanding has changed such that we think that probably three or four\n\n04:51.080 --> 04:53.440\nwere kind of hanging out at the same time, right?\n\n04:53.440 --> 05:01.200\nThere was a, there was, there was at least a half a dozen Homo, a human, human species.\n\n05:01.200 --> 05:02.200\nWhich is new now.\n\n05:02.200 --> 05:05.400\nSo Homo erectus is a completely different species from us.\n\n05:05.400 --> 05:08.240\nI like Homo habilis.\n\n05:08.240 --> 05:12.200\nThey, first of all, use the example of like horses and donkeys.\n\n05:12.200 --> 05:16.220\nSo horses and donkeys are separate species, but they can mate.\n\n05:16.220 --> 05:20.240\nSo they, you know, they talk about, well, we, we may have mated with Neanderthals.\n\n05:20.240 --> 05:25.560\nLike there's that idea of you have one percent Neanderthal in your genes and stuff, but horses\n\n05:25.560 --> 05:30.080\ndon't really, donkeys and horses, they're not, it's not the first thing that would come\n\n05:30.080 --> 05:32.560\ninto their head if you put them in a pen together.\n\n05:32.560 --> 05:38.720\nYou have to get aggressive about, it's suggesting that they do it or, or the, or the horse has\n\n05:38.720 --> 05:43.480\nto be, you know, have issues that demand, that it's more about anger than I don't know\n\n05:43.480 --> 05:44.480\nwhat.\n\n05:44.480 --> 05:47.440\nBut, and ultimately they produce an offspring that's not even fertile.\n\n05:47.440 --> 05:51.480\nAnd then you take like, but that's different from like, like, like there's a million kinds\n\n05:51.480 --> 05:54.480\nof dog, but they're all the same species because they happily, like you put them in a room\n\n05:54.480 --> 05:58.400\ntogether, you go away, you have a popsicle, you come back, you get fucking weird ass and\n\n05:58.400 --> 06:03.080\na boxer and it's looking, it's shaped like a slinky.\n\n06:03.080 --> 06:11.040\nWe, we, we, we had, we, we walked this earth like, with all these different like specialized\n\n06:11.040 --> 06:13.600\nbrands of human.\n\n06:13.600 --> 06:17.000\nHomo erectus was like really good at making tools.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.280\nSo good at making tools that it's all they fucking did.\n\n06:20.280 --> 06:22.880\nIt was in their genes to make tools.\n\n06:22.880 --> 06:27.060\nThe way when you throw a ball, your golden retriever like knows how to do something better\n\n06:27.060 --> 06:31.880\nthan like maybe your mutt or your, or, or, or like a bull or like a Jack Russell who's\n\n06:31.880 --> 06:32.880\nlike, well, that's not a mouse.\n\n06:32.880 --> 06:38.120\nSo I'm going to stare at the electrical outlet and lick your face until you have no more\n\n06:38.120 --> 06:41.320\nfriends coming over.\n\n06:41.320 --> 06:43.880\nJack Russell's are the worst.\n\n06:43.880 --> 06:46.920\nBut you have to like respect them because you're like, you were mentally ill.\n\n06:46.920 --> 06:51.480\nLike, if you know anything about mental illness and you meet a Jack Russell, you, you're just\n\n06:51.480 --> 06:52.680\nlike, I can't judge you.\n\n06:52.680 --> 06:53.680\nYou're clearly sick.\n\n06:53.680 --> 06:56.280\nYou have a sickness that's been bred into you.\n\n06:56.280 --> 06:58.680\nTerrier by some person who wanted less rats.\n\n06:58.680 --> 06:59.680\nThat's not cool.\n\n06:59.680 --> 07:03.600\nThe dog is like, we just stare at the corner of a coffee table because they think it might\n\n07:03.600 --> 07:07.360\nturn into a mouse one day.\n\n07:07.360 --> 07:08.360\nThey're insane.\n\n07:08.360 --> 07:14.640\nAnyways, but, but, sorry, but, but, but, but Homo erectus, like we, is it like, okay,\n\n07:14.640 --> 07:18.440\nthey made like these flint tools or they, they have these tools, but they actually like\n\n07:18.440 --> 07:20.360\nkind of like it was bred into them.\n\n07:20.360 --> 07:26.560\nThey walked to the earth for two million years making these dumb ass tools.\n\n07:26.560 --> 07:33.640\nThey never turned that into making tool tools or tool, tool, tool tools, which we are good\n\n07:33.640 --> 07:34.640\nat.\n\n07:34.640 --> 07:39.920\nHomo sapiens, the book implies, now I'm, I'm, I'm extrapolating a lot for listening for\n\n07:39.920 --> 07:45.680\nan hour and a half car ride to this book that's like, it's a 15 hour book.\n\n07:45.680 --> 07:52.400\nAnd I heard someone wrote it down somewhere and you could, with the eyeballs, but, but\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:55.640\nthe implication is that it's like, we're no better or no worse.\n\n07:55.640 --> 08:01.840\nLike, it's like, like brain size, whatever, like, like, if, if truly if brain size and\n\n08:01.840 --> 08:08.600\nlike, like, if it was just raw intelligence that like made you dominate the earth, of\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:14.400\ncourse by now there would have been ants with giant heads or he doesn't say that because\n\n08:14.400 --> 08:18.880\nhe's a scientist and you debunk that I'm making that up, but there'd be like dogs or something\n\n08:18.880 --> 08:21.680\nthat would be like, like, it would just be like the thing that you always go to.\n\n08:21.680 --> 08:26.440\nWe kind of have that mythology in our heads, literally that, that, that, that it's like,\n\n08:26.440 --> 08:29.160\noh, it's all about that brain, you got to get to that brain.\n\n08:29.160 --> 08:32.280\nBut the brain is like really hit or miss as an evolutionary trait.\n\n08:32.280 --> 08:35.000\nIt was like just betting double zero on a roulette.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:42.000\nEven that's a miss, misconstruer as coined it.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:46.800\nHe said a misconstruer the other day really made me misconstrue some stuff.\n\n08:46.800 --> 08:47.800\nJust talk.\n\n08:47.800 --> 08:56.360\nAll right, sapiens like are different.\n\n08:56.360 --> 08:58.600\nThe thing that separated us out.\n\n08:58.600 --> 08:59.600\nSo get this.\n\n08:59.600 --> 09:04.360\nThis is, this is the uplifting thing slash biggest bummer in the fucking world.\n\n09:04.360 --> 09:10.400\nThis guy implies that the reason why we ended up wiping everybody out, whether that meant\n\n09:10.400 --> 09:19.680\nfucking them and absorbing them and or eating them out hunting them, just, just, just making\n\n09:19.680 --> 09:25.880\nthem feel unwelcome until they, they deleted their Neanderthal accounts and like went away\n\n09:25.880 --> 09:29.080\nbecause they're like, I don't like where this is going.\n\n09:29.080 --> 09:33.640\nIf this is what it takes to survive, I'm going to go have a giant brain and live in the pine\n\n09:33.640 --> 09:36.000\ntrees and fucking go to sleep.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:38.480\nThat's what happened to Homo habilis.\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:41.040\nWait, which one is habilis, is that?\n\n09:41.040 --> 09:49.720\nThey were excellent listeners.\n\n09:49.720 --> 09:50.720\nIt was great.\n\n09:50.720 --> 09:51.720\nIt was great.\n\n09:51.720 --> 09:52.720\nIt just didn't win the war.\n\n09:52.720 --> 10:01.160\nIt was a good skill to have at the time, but didn't win a lot of contests.\n\n10:01.160 --> 10:03.160\nThey won a few important contests.\n\n10:03.160 --> 10:11.160\nRight, but they lost the tell me more passive aggressive wars of 30 million BC when the\n\n10:11.160 --> 10:13.560\nCro-Magnons eventually said, go on.\n\n10:13.560 --> 10:16.400\nAnd they were like, I'm out.\n\n10:16.400 --> 10:27.640\nBut the idea put forth in this book is that what we are good at, all of us, is the cynical\n\n10:27.640 --> 10:35.280\nwould call it lying, which is not, it's not unique to us, a primate lie.\n\n10:35.280 --> 10:37.280\nPrimate lie.\n\n10:37.280 --> 10:43.320\nDon't let me stop you.\n\n10:43.320 --> 10:47.920\nThe writers among us, if that we're interested in justifying our jobs or getting through\n\n10:47.920 --> 10:52.000\ntomorrow with a spring under step would say, we'd call it mythology, that's what we're\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\ngood at.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:59.640\nA corporate lawyer would call it the ability to handle a contract, essentially it's all\n\n10:59.640 --> 11:06.120\nthe same thing, basically what sapiens are good at that gets us past the topping out\n\n11:06.120 --> 11:10.840\npoint of primate sophistication, which tops out, as all of us who have ever watched a\n\n11:10.840 --> 11:16.560\nsitcom or hung out in a room this size know, it tops out at 100 primates.\n\n11:16.560 --> 11:20.480\nYour ability to function as a group, nobody in here, there's no cops in here, but if somebody\n\n11:20.480 --> 11:26.880\njumped up and was like, hail Satan, we'd get confused and we'd eventually figure out\n\n11:26.880 --> 11:30.280\nwhat to do, but it probably won't happen because there's 100 of us.\n\n11:30.280 --> 11:33.800\nIf there are 1,000 of us, there's going to be 10 people going, hail Satan, and they're\n\n11:33.800 --> 11:37.040\ngoing to get lost in the, they're going to actually be encouraged by the fact that there's\n\n11:37.040 --> 11:42.640\n1,000 people to, and also we're all going to start going, that's someone else's problem,\n\n11:42.640 --> 11:44.760\nchaos, chaos.\n\n11:44.760 --> 11:50.720\nSo what we, that's where a neanderthal can't handle it, like 500 neanderthals, they can't\n\n11:50.720 --> 11:57.360\ndo anything, 500 homo erectus, sapiens perfected the art of, like we have the lobes in our\n\n11:57.360 --> 12:02.240\nbrain necessary to believe in shit that ain't real.\n\n12:02.240 --> 12:09.520\nWe were able to watch Seinfeld and hear 100 people and pretend that those 100 people represent\n\n12:09.520 --> 12:14.680\na million people and just go, oh, Seinfeld's great, even though Seinfeld didn't come over\n\n12:14.680 --> 12:18.640\nto my house and tell me he's going to help me out tomorrow.\n\n12:18.640 --> 12:23.400\nBut I'm in Seinfeld's corner, like Seinfeld's a flag, Seinfeld's a religion, Seinfeld's\n\n12:23.400 --> 12:30.120\na meme, Seinfeld's a, it's symbolism, it's this idea, we can create like a connectivity\n\n12:30.120 --> 12:36.360\nbetween strangers that will never meet each other to Serbians that will never meet, can\n\n12:36.360 --> 12:42.840\nboth have been taught from childhood about the importance of being a Serb and identify\n\n12:42.840 --> 12:48.280\nthat with a flag and they'll see the right flag on each other's arm patch or whatever\n\n12:48.280 --> 12:53.280\nin the middle of a situation, somebody might take a bullet for somebody else, chimpanzees\n\n12:53.280 --> 12:59.440\ncan't do that, you can't, like no other even human species, all of which are now extinct\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:00.440\ncan do that.\n\n13:00.440 --> 13:06.480\nSo we basically, it's kind of, it's a bummer, a little bit of a bummer, this is what we're\n\n13:06.480 --> 13:11.120\ngood at, this is why we're here, we're good at this giant mess that we've created, that's\n\n13:11.120 --> 13:12.120\nwhat we're good at.\n\n13:12.120 --> 13:15.680\nSo you're saying we're the first monkeys with imagination?\n\n13:15.680 --> 13:19.520\nThat's too fucking beautiful, that's too poetic.\n\n13:19.520 --> 13:27.840\nBut yeah, I guess that, we're the first human species, the first Homo, in the Homo genus,\n\n13:27.840 --> 13:37.920\nwe're the ones that got really good at sharing ideas that never have to be true, that can\n\n13:37.920 --> 13:44.400\nbe so, things that never have to be concretized but can be the most important thing in the\n\n13:44.400 --> 13:45.400\nworld.\n\n13:45.400 --> 13:56.920\nThe ability to wake up in bed and say, because I am blank, a member of an invisible tribe,\n\n13:56.920 --> 14:09.160\na corporation, a country, a fandom, a political leaning, a gender, a race, a type of person.\n\n14:09.160 --> 14:16.720\nBecause I am a quality of life person, because I am there, I'm going to do this today and\n\n14:16.720 --> 14:20.680\nit will actually supersede things that for other primates and even other human species\n\n14:20.680 --> 14:26.160\nthat are now extinct, they would be like, I'm not going to harvest corn based on, what\n\n14:26.160 --> 14:28.400\ndid you say, Mickey Mouse exists?\n\n14:28.400 --> 14:32.680\nI don't do it, and then they starve, and then the people that believe in Mickey Mouse come\n\n14:32.680 --> 14:37.560\nover the hills and they say, how are they having 800,000 people with spears, I give\n\n14:37.560 --> 14:40.240\nup, I give up, take me to jail.\n\n14:40.240 --> 14:43.160\nOr teach me to learn about corn.\n\n14:43.160 --> 14:50.200\nOr if you can reproduce with me, I mean, they're done, these people, they're done, the ones\n\n14:50.200 --> 14:55.160\nthat are like, their children are being raised in this environment of like, no, it's called\n\n14:55.160 --> 14:59.360\nculture, it's called mythology, it's called religion, it's called lies, it's called, depending\n\n14:59.360 --> 15:03.040\non what mood you're in, it's called all kinds of things, but it's basically like, the fact\n\n15:03.040 --> 15:08.600\nthat we can sustain a life based on nothing, based on no, like, and we sometimes get frustrated\n\n15:08.600 --> 15:11.680\nby that and go like, God damn it, you know, you're getting that fight club red pill mood\n\n15:11.680 --> 15:15.920\nand you go, Jesus Christ, well, this fucking fact is, I've got a big set of balls full\n\n15:15.920 --> 15:19.960\nof comb and if I wanted to, I could fuck this fucking whole dollar store into fucking,\n\n15:19.960 --> 15:25.000\nI could make it a whole pregnant, yeah, I'm going to, who hasn't said that?\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:29.480\nI mean, you could and you couldn't, you could, if you could somehow figure out a way to hack\n\n15:29.480 --> 15:37.120\nsymbology and mythology to reduce all of civilization to a basically non-sapien mindset, like, you\n\n15:37.120 --> 15:41.640\ncould turn us into animals again, like, you know, we're the only species that has the\n\n15:41.640 --> 15:44.480\npower to do that, we have a self-destruct mechanism.\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:49.240\nI was thinking that, like, this is like a meditation I've had on murder, like, we can't,\n\n15:49.240 --> 15:53.880\nlike, I've had a lot of meditations on murder, I'll be, do some shows.\n\n15:53.880 --> 15:58.080\nOh, Habilis is also famous for that, for suppressing their murder meditations.\n\n15:58.080 --> 16:03.880\nThey love suppressing violence, no, but, like, just one of the humans, obviously, they kill\n\n16:03.880 --> 16:09.840\npeople, but at the same time, like, you can't kill someone in existent society, so, like,\n\n16:09.840 --> 16:15.400\nwe have to be able to turn people into killers and then also turn them back from killers\n\n16:15.400 --> 16:19.880\ninto normal people who can, like, function in society, because otherwise, anytime someone\n\n16:19.880 --> 16:24.640\nwould kill, they would become, like, essentially an unhinged zombie monster, you know, like,\n\n16:24.640 --> 16:28.360\nthe fact that you can have their regret is, like, this weird thing, but what that means\n\n16:28.360 --> 16:34.880\nis that we can use words and ideas to work ourselves into a literally a lethal frenzy\n\n16:34.880 --> 16:39.240\nthat's only a temporary state of hypnosis that renders us capable of doing things we're\n\n16:39.240 --> 16:44.600\nnot normally capable of and wouldn't be capable of if we weren't conceiving of this construct\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:49.200\nthat we invented in our minds, and, like, that is, like, it's a very human thing, but\n\n16:49.200 --> 16:53.640\nthat's, like, it's very crazy, because otherwise, you know, if that didn't exist, then all of\n\n16:53.640 --> 16:57.720\nsociety would break down, but because that exists, like, sociopaths exist, kind of.\n\n16:57.720 --> 16:58.720\nI don't know.\n\n16:58.720 --> 16:59.720\nIt's really fucked up and scary.\n\n16:59.720 --> 17:00.720\nYeah.\n\n17:00.720 --> 17:01.720\nYeah.\n\n17:01.720 --> 17:02.720\nWe all live a lie.\n\n17:02.720 --> 17:06.640\nI mean, it's like when you examine currency and you go, like, well, the dollar's backed\n\n17:06.640 --> 17:13.200\nby nothing or whatever, like, like, everything is a lie, I mean, why are we, yeah, anything\n\n17:13.200 --> 17:19.120\nthat goes beyond any Charles Manson level, like, like, that's why I think we're, we're\n\n17:19.120 --> 17:24.080\nfascinated with mob mythology or, you know, organized crime stuff is because there's a\n\n17:24.080 --> 17:28.000\ntribal mindset there, and actually things actually start clicking for us.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.280\nWhen we watch the Sopranos and we go, I get it, Pauline Walnuts can't tell Lieutenant\n\n17:32.280 --> 17:36.080\nPeck or Pickle what to do.\n\n17:36.080 --> 17:39.840\nI don't have to have a memory, I have imagination.\n\n17:39.840 --> 17:46.200\nAnyways, let's bring out, that's why tonight's show is all based in anthropology, we've got\n\n17:46.200 --> 17:51.680\nonly the most top qualified experts, I've planned this out, the show is meticulously\n\n17:51.680 --> 17:57.200\nplanned and scheduled, I've got the perfect guests, let's first bring out Coco the Gorilla.\n\n17:57.200 --> 18:01.080\nOh, poor Harambe's wife.\n\n18:01.080 --> 18:02.080\nToo soon.\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:03.080\nToo soon.\n\n18:03.080 --> 18:04.080\nI guess we'll bring out Jeff Davis first.\n\n18:04.080 --> 18:14.600\nJeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis, Jeff Davis extraordinaire, extraordinaire.\n\n18:14.600 --> 18:17.800\nHe could have been anywhere in the world tonight, ladies and gentlemen, but he chose to be\n\n18:17.800 --> 18:18.800\nhere.\n\n18:18.800 --> 18:19.800\nJeff Davis.\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:22.800\nSchrab-involved visual bit.\n\n18:22.800 --> 18:23.800\nHard to explain.\n\n18:23.800 --> 18:28.280\nWell, they both did a bit, like, it made me feel like, it feels like the Milwaukee public\n\n18:28.280 --> 18:35.000\nzoo and you're like waiting for the, the lions to come out in the winter, let you go to\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.560\nthe zoo and you're like, how come the lions aren't out?\n\n18:37.560 --> 18:40.800\nBecause you're, are you freezing your ass off?\n\n18:40.800 --> 18:44.320\nThey're in the tiny heated room eating hay.\n\n18:44.320 --> 18:45.320\nBut they're lions.\n\n18:45.320 --> 18:46.320\nThat's how cold they are.\n\n18:46.320 --> 18:51.440\nI don't know that I would compare these motherfuckers to lions, but...\n\n18:51.440 --> 18:53.440\nLadies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis.\n\n18:53.440 --> 18:54.440\nSee?\n\n18:54.440 --> 18:58.440\nNo, it's coming out now.\n\n18:58.440 --> 18:59.440\nSee?\n\n18:59.440 --> 19:00.440\nSee?\n\n19:00.440 --> 19:01.440\nBecause a lion would have come out.\n\n19:01.440 --> 19:02.440\nThis is a bluff.\n\n19:02.440 --> 19:03.440\nI'm happy to call it.\n\n19:03.440 --> 19:04.440\nAll right.\n\n19:04.440 --> 19:05.440\nThey picked me on the wrong night, man.\n\n19:05.440 --> 19:06.440\nI'll do a hug.\n\n19:06.440 --> 19:17.120\nI know, you do, you do have enough in you, I feel like, to talk about without these dudes.\n\n19:17.120 --> 19:18.120\nYeah.\n\n19:18.120 --> 19:19.120\nAll right.\n\n19:19.120 --> 19:24.480\nAnother thing about those humans and our ability to create murder and stuff.\n\n19:24.480 --> 19:27.720\nI think someone almost just got shot by a microphone accessory.\n\n19:27.720 --> 19:28.720\nWhat was that?\n\n19:28.720 --> 19:32.920\nI pulled on the mic cord and then a piece of plastic shot out and almost hit that dude\n\n19:32.920 --> 19:35.040\nin the face.\n\n19:35.040 --> 19:36.160\nJust toss it up here.\n\n19:36.160 --> 19:41.600\nAnd I will do it again.\n\n19:41.600 --> 19:45.120\nYou ever asked for someone to toss you something and just let it land?\n\n19:45.120 --> 19:46.120\nYeah.\n\n19:46.120 --> 19:48.440\nIt's one of the coolest fucking moves.\n\n19:48.440 --> 19:51.680\nI'm going to tell you right now that shit was a preemptive strike.\n\n19:51.680 --> 19:56.720\nI was like, that dude needs a piece of this microphone.\n\n19:56.720 --> 19:57.720\nThank you for your help.\n\n19:57.720 --> 19:58.720\nSo much help.\n\n19:58.720 --> 19:59.720\nThank you.\n\n19:59.720 --> 20:00.720\nSarcasm.\n\n20:00.720 --> 20:01.720\nGod damn it.\n\n20:01.720 --> 20:03.360\nI did a lot of driving with Cody.\n\n20:03.360 --> 20:07.320\nYeah, I'll tell you another, a book we listened to, another book on tape, Elizabeth Smart's\n\n20:07.320 --> 20:09.840\nstory, her autobiography.\n\n20:09.840 --> 20:10.840\nRemember her?\n\n20:10.840 --> 20:11.840\nDo you know who Elizabeth Smart is?\n\n20:11.840 --> 20:12.840\nAre you two young?\n\n20:12.840 --> 20:13.840\nShe was a true crime person.\n\n20:13.840 --> 20:14.840\nYeah.\n\n20:14.840 --> 20:15.840\nYeah.\n\n20:15.840 --> 20:16.840\nI don't, I don't follow those stories.\n\n20:16.840 --> 20:17.840\nWell, I don't remember the stories.\n\n20:17.840 --> 20:18.840\nI follow them like when they happen.\n\n20:18.840 --> 20:23.280\nI remember the story, I can't remember what, now I can't remember what year it was when\n\n20:23.280 --> 20:24.280\nit happened.\n\n20:24.280 --> 20:28.920\nBut I do, I was fascinated with the story because I remember she, it became a story\n\n20:28.920 --> 20:29.920\nbecause she had returned.\n\n20:29.920 --> 20:30.920\nYeah.\n\n20:30.920 --> 20:31.920\nIt was like a big thing.\n\n20:31.920 --> 20:38.760\nI vaguely remember that the vagaries and the weird insinuations or questions, it was sort\n\n20:38.760 --> 20:44.560\nof like, my consciousness was like, oh, is that that girl that got abducted?\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:49.480\nBut she got abducted by a guy that may or may not have, you know, it was like the press\n\n20:49.480 --> 20:52.440\nwas like, oh, she's back, but she may not have been abducted.\n\n20:52.440 --> 20:56.760\nMaybe she, it was like, it was like, it was like, so it was really like therapeutic to\n\n20:56.760 --> 21:03.920\nlisten to her, her book because it was like, oh God, like ridiculous, like the narrative\n\n21:03.920 --> 21:06.520\nof, yeah, of course you're not going to get that right.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:13.840\nLike, this guy just like came into her room, she was 14 years old, he's got a fucking\n\n21:13.840 --> 21:17.960\nbuoy knife and he's like, get up and get out of bed and come with me.\n\n21:17.960 --> 21:23.720\nAnd it's like, it's this crazy experiment and like, what if you were a good girl and\n\n21:23.720 --> 21:28.560\nyou just didn't, like, what if you just didn't want your family to get hurt and what if you\n\n21:28.560 --> 21:34.960\njust always, what if you just kept doing what you thought was the smartest, healthiest spiritual\n\n21:34.960 --> 21:35.960\nthing to do?\n\n21:35.960 --> 21:40.080\nAnd the answer is this fucking creep who actually turns out to be like the three stooges of\n\n21:40.080 --> 21:45.800\nCharles Manson's, like, it's actually kind of a, you know, if you detach yourself from\n\n21:45.800 --> 21:52.040\nher plight, like the guy emerges as a sort of comedic character because he keeps, while\n\n21:52.040 --> 21:58.520\nhe's with her, he takes her, he takes her, like, out of her house and like, walks with\n\n21:58.520 --> 22:04.440\nher through thistles and brambles for seven hours where he's got a camp set up where he\n\n22:04.440 --> 22:09.280\ndoes the things that you would be afraid that he would do, it's all there and it's all in\n\n22:09.280 --> 22:13.400\nhis head, it's all about, oh, he's a prophet and he needs a new wife and all this shit.\n\n22:13.400 --> 22:21.760\nBut, you know, and she goes there tastefully but also like, she's really very healthy,\n\n22:21.760 --> 22:26.600\nshe's 25 at the time she's writing the book and it's very healthy, very inspiring how,\n\n22:26.600 --> 22:31.920\nlike, fucking, like, she's just like, yeah, then that happened and like, it's odd, it's\n\n22:31.920 --> 22:32.920\nhonestly odd.\n\n22:32.920 --> 22:34.400\nI think she's Mormon too, right?\n\n22:34.400 --> 22:39.400\nI think so, and that is true that when they found her, she wasn't resistant, it wasn't\n\n22:39.400 --> 22:44.400\nthat she, it wasn't that she was complacent about being there.\n\n22:44.400 --> 22:48.040\nThere's these moments that we don't understand in the story where, like, there's a cop that\n\n22:48.040 --> 22:54.440\ncomes up in the public library and she's sitting there and she's like, the cop is like, tell\n\n22:54.440 --> 22:59.880\nme your name and there, and like, she, we just use logic to go, oh, well, of course,\n\n22:59.880 --> 23:05.200\nnow is the time to do this, but it's like, she's abused and she's terrified.\n\n23:05.200 --> 23:09.480\nThe interesting thing about her book is that she swears, like, she's very adamant about\n\n23:09.480 --> 23:13.240\nthe fact that this is different from Stockholm syndrome, like, and she's trying to make the\n\n23:13.240 --> 23:18.840\npoint, she's a victim's rights advocate now, and she's like very, very adamant about this,\n\n23:18.840 --> 23:21.360\nwhich I think is just incredibly interesting.\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:25.000\nIf I thought I was a good interviewer at all, and I didn't think that I was going to like,\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:30.040\nlike, I was such an interesting person to talk to, but I would never want to go near\n\n23:30.040 --> 23:35.360\nsomebody that I could ever, like, accidentally hurt with my insensitivity, but she just seems\n\n23:35.360 --> 23:40.320\nso fucking robust and so great, greatest revenge.\n\n23:40.320 --> 23:43.560\nBut she's like, she's like, I was never, it's not Stockholm, it's like, I never had\n\n23:43.560 --> 23:45.680\nempathy for this fucking dunce.\n\n23:45.680 --> 23:49.520\nI think she makes fun of him for the whole book, and it's like, I was just, I took him\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:53.920\nat his word, I was 14, and he was the guy with the knife, and he kept saying over and\n\n23:53.920 --> 24:10.920\nover again, if this ever ends...\n\n24:10.920 --> 24:13.680\nJust ignore it.\n\n24:13.680 --> 24:17.680\nTrying to tell you about a horrible abduction that lasted a year.\n\n24:17.680 --> 24:24.320\nBut I took him at his word that if this ever ends, and it's at all your fault, like, if\n\n24:24.320 --> 24:30.480\nyou ever drop the dime on me, you know, like, I will figure out a way to kill your family,\n\n24:30.480 --> 24:34.440\nI'll kill your little brother, you know, just over and over again telling her that.\n\n24:34.440 --> 24:38.000\nSo that's what she's experiencing in these moments when people are coming up to her and\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\ngoing, hey, are you this kidnapped girl?\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:48.520\nAnd she's like, she's screaming in her head, don't involve me in this shit, fucking save\n\n24:48.520 --> 24:49.520\nme.\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:50.520\nIt's very interesting.\n\n24:50.520 --> 24:56.400\nIt's also a little bit of a backstory, perhaps, about the community that she was raised in\n\n24:56.400 --> 25:02.960\nand the fact that if you are already mildly abused, or if you've already been in a society\n\n25:02.960 --> 25:07.480\nthat denigrates women, when someone comes to abduct you, you may play along.\n\n25:07.480 --> 25:17.480\nYeah, I mean, her advocacy afterwards sounds like it's a brand to do that.\n\n25:17.480 --> 25:27.040\nNow, you know, it's a throw, it's a throw.\n\n25:27.040 --> 25:28.520\nI'm proud of you guys.\n\n25:28.520 --> 25:35.640\nThat was a good taper, like, obviously we can't coordinate total silence.\n\n25:35.640 --> 25:40.480\nAnd you know, some of you come here because you hate me, but if you want to make me fucking\n\n25:40.480 --> 25:49.240\nproud, let them stew and just try as hard as you can, just fucking abject silence.\n\n25:49.240 --> 25:52.040\nThey really should have to work for your love at this point.\n\n25:52.040 --> 25:57.600\nBut don't do it because you think, oh, you want me to win.\n\n25:57.600 --> 25:58.680\nI know you love them.\n\n25:58.680 --> 26:02.200\nIf you love them, teach them a lesson.\n\n26:02.200 --> 26:07.080\nTeach them a lesson about stagecraft and respect.\n\n26:07.080 --> 26:12.080\nNow, back to Elizabeth Smart.\n\n26:12.080 --> 26:16.680\nBut I really want to address that because it's like, I mean, that's the thing is like,\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:20.640\nI believe her family was Mormon, but it's noteworthy that you wouldn't know that from reading the\n\n26:20.640 --> 26:24.440\nbook because I think her faith, you know, she was never like, well, because of my magic\n\n26:24.440 --> 26:26.680\nunderwear, it was protected or all this stuff.\n\n26:26.680 --> 26:31.560\nIt's very clear that the dude is Mormon, that the psycho is Mormon, and that he's abusing\n\n26:31.560 --> 26:35.000\nall these tenets of Mormonism that he's twisted it.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:39.880\nThe only thing that's clear with her is that she's basically like the American goal.\n\n26:39.880 --> 26:44.840\nI think that's what's important is that we think, oh, we want our 14-year-old daughters\n\n26:44.840 --> 26:52.360\nto be unsoiled and never have had any thoughts into their head.\n\n26:52.360 --> 26:56.680\nIt's sort of an interesting kind of Christ myth when you're listening to it because you're\n\n26:56.680 --> 27:02.680\nlike, well, this is supposedly the American dream as far as what you want your family\n\n27:02.680 --> 27:08.080\nto have this white picket fence and all these things, and it's like, there is this thought\n\n27:08.080 --> 27:15.800\nin your head that goes like, well, and then she's so pure and modest and humble and so\n\n27:15.800 --> 27:26.960\nthat this doofus who has no right, he doesn't, he's exploiting it.\n\n27:26.960 --> 27:32.440\nShe doesn't know she's being exploited and she's not, yeah, it's a real roller coaster\n\n27:32.440 --> 27:37.160\nthat you go through when you're listening to the story, which I kind of, it was kind\n\n27:37.160 --> 27:40.680\nof eye-opening to me because the other half of the time all you're thinking is as in that\n\n27:40.680 --> 27:45.600\nSouth Park episode where they meet the Mormon, it's like the other half of the time you're\n\n27:45.600 --> 27:49.120\ngoing, Jesus Christ, I've got to convert to this fucking religion because this is some\n\n27:49.120 --> 27:55.200\npowerful shit, like this girl survived some crazy shit and it was specifically because\n\n27:55.200 --> 27:57.600\nof her faith.\n\n27:57.600 --> 28:03.360\nThese brand names get us fucked up, Christianity, Catholicism, the names get us fucked up.\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:05.800\nYeah, her faith is a thing that...\n\n28:05.800 --> 28:09.000\nShe thought that there was a God with her the whole time and she's not shoving that\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:13.000\ndown your throat in case you want to listen to the book, it's not like she's selling that\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:20.600\nto you, but she uses the force a couple times in the story and she doesn't, she's not obnoxious\n\n28:20.600 --> 28:21.600\nabout it.\n\n28:21.600 --> 28:25.000\nI think it's really interesting, it's also, she narrates her own audio book which is like\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:31.720\ncool because she's like sort of like, it's like amateur, like she's like, her inflection\n\n28:31.720 --> 28:37.040\nis like, this is the real person and she's like, I didn't know, she's describing this\n\n28:37.040 --> 28:42.000\nlike doofus going like, today I'm gonna, she's like mocking him with her voice and then\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:46.480\nhe came back to her, well I just decided that God wants me to do this and I'm like, all\n\n28:46.480 --> 28:47.480\nright, whatever.\n\n28:47.480 --> 28:55.000\nYou're trying to tell me that Selena Gomez could play this role.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:59.760\nI think the feeling that left me when I'm net positive was like, wow, you could be a\n\n28:59.760 --> 29:04.360\n14 year old girl and have the worst possible fucking thing happen to you for a year of\n\n29:04.360 --> 29:11.480\nyour life and you could emerge, she was like, she's just a regular person and she actually\n\n29:11.480 --> 29:15.600\nkeeps pointing out, she's like, actually, she doesn't want to say, I'm glad this happened,\n\n29:15.600 --> 29:20.400\nbut she's like, I'm grateful for, she's like, if it hadn't happened, what would I be?\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:23.320\nSome schnook that doesn't know how bad it can get?\n\n29:23.320 --> 29:27.920\nAlso, statistically, she's very lucky to be alive.\n\n29:27.920 --> 29:36.000\nSo, as far as, yeah, the percentage of people who have had a dude come into their bedroom\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:45.960\nwith a knife, yeah, she's one of the, it's a pretty short book, it's kind of interesting.\n\n29:45.960 --> 29:49.520\nIt's such a weird, it's like the three stooges of abductions.\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:52.880\nAnd it is inspirational because somebody actually lived through it.\n\n29:52.880 --> 29:59.080\nBecause of her, because it's inspirational because she's like, yeah, she's on her own\n\n29:59.080 --> 30:05.320\nand she just survives and it's a bummer, a culture where survival is the new success,\n\n30:05.320 --> 30:11.760\nbut sometimes that's the thing you need to remind yourself of, I guess, I don't know.\n\n30:11.760 --> 30:20.040\nMy personal journey has gone from, I am happy in spite of you, you being you, listening,\n\n30:20.040 --> 30:23.400\nand I crossed a threshold at a certain point and I am happy because of you and that was\n\n30:23.400 --> 30:26.440\nglorious, that was great.\n\n30:26.440 --> 30:34.680\nAnd I am now entering my third active, I am now again happy in spite of you.\n\n30:34.680 --> 30:39.960\nAnd I know that if you are a fan of mine, you don't blame me for that and that's why\n\n30:39.960 --> 30:47.560\nI love you, but like, I can't keep coming to you for happiness, I gotta be 45 years\n\n30:47.560 --> 30:50.080\nold and be like, here's how you're happy.\n\n30:50.080 --> 30:57.520\nIf a 14 year old girl can do that in a fucking tent where she's actually being like, I really\n\n30:57.520 --> 31:06.120\nfeel you truly believed that everyone should feel that way.\n\n31:06.120 --> 31:12.480\nThat was true belief applause, that was not, that was not like Beastie Boy's irony generation\n\n31:12.480 --> 31:13.480\napplause.\n\n31:13.480 --> 31:20.040\nI am shocked that you all did not help your boy out.\n\n31:20.040 --> 31:23.040\nBut don't feel shame because you're fine the way you are.\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:28.680\nNext time sit at the back of the house, then they'll all hear and be like, if you do it\n\n31:28.680 --> 31:34.560\ndown front, people are like, look at this dumb motherfucker.\n\n31:34.560 --> 31:39.440\nHe was the one who was like excited that you were embracing internal forms of motivation\n\n31:39.440 --> 31:44.000\nand everyone else like they didn't clap at all because they weren't similarly internally\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.400\nmotivated to clap.\n\n31:46.400 --> 31:51.360\nYou know, it does make you internally motivated to clap, me undies.\n\n31:51.360 --> 31:53.960\nWould you be wearing me undies this evening?\n\n31:53.960 --> 31:54.960\nOh, of course.\n\n31:54.960 --> 32:01.440\nI've been wearing them like much like first class travel, I have never gone back.\n\n32:01.440 --> 32:03.920\nIs it the softness or the fit?\n\n32:03.920 --> 32:06.440\nIt's the cockpit.\n\n32:06.440 --> 32:09.480\nThey should call it the cockpit.\n\n32:09.480 --> 32:16.320\nThey could call it me undies if you're listening, the cockpit, the diamond pouch, call it the\n\n32:16.320 --> 32:17.320\ncockpit.\n\n32:17.320 --> 32:18.480\nIt's good.\n\n32:18.480 --> 32:20.080\nI'm wearing them right now.\n\n32:20.080 --> 32:24.960\nI've never worn them before today and I'm wearing them on my body and I got to tell\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:29.040\nyou, it feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.\n\n32:29.040 --> 32:30.040\nNothing at all.\n\n32:30.040 --> 32:32.040\nI'd be interested to talk to it.\n\n32:32.040 --> 32:33.040\nNothing at all.\n\n32:33.040 --> 32:34.040\nWhat did you think?\n\n32:34.040 --> 32:39.760\nWhy don't you like to meet a person that had tried me undies and then was like, no, I'm\n\n32:39.760 --> 32:44.720\ngoing back to regular, what kind of monster is that?\n\n32:44.720 --> 32:51.120\nA person who doesn't like just the right amount of support and comfort.\n\n32:51.120 --> 32:53.800\nThe kind of person who says caviar is too salty.\n\n32:53.800 --> 32:54.800\nWe're not even going to look back.\n\n32:54.800 --> 32:57.680\nWe're not even going to look behind us.\n\n32:57.680 --> 33:01.680\nAnd we don't need to because coming through the house.\n\n33:01.680 --> 33:02.680\nWhoa.\n\n33:02.680 --> 33:05.800\nNow they're coming in from the back.\n\n33:05.800 --> 33:06.800\nSo proud of you.\n\n33:06.800 --> 33:07.800\nSo proud of you.\n\n33:07.800 --> 33:08.800\nWhich is impossible to do.\n\n33:08.800 --> 33:14.800\nThis is actually really good job guys.\n\n33:14.800 --> 33:18.800\nOh, you broke at the end.\n\n33:18.800 --> 33:23.800\nYou held out for a while.\n\n33:23.800 --> 33:28.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n33:28.800 --> 33:37.800\nThis is why you can subscribe to the Harmontown feed and see what's happening because it's\n\n33:37.800 --> 33:41.800\nlike, this is why they're not trustworthy.\n\n33:41.800 --> 33:52.200\nNo, but these guys, I mean, when I said don't clap, you guys, that was amazing.\n\n33:52.200 --> 33:54.480\nYeah, you did so much better.\n\n33:54.480 --> 33:56.360\nI was the first one to cry uncle.\n\n33:56.360 --> 33:59.320\nI was like, oh, that feels so harsh.\n\n33:59.320 --> 34:06.400\nLike the music started and I was like, well, why aren't you, oh, oh, right.\n\n34:06.400 --> 34:11.520\nAnd you guys are like, no, we're fucking like, it was like, wow, that is, that's homo sapiens.\n\n34:11.520 --> 34:13.480\nThat's how we beat the Neanderthals.\n\n34:13.480 --> 34:21.920\nThat's also, also children of divorce because they were like, I know how to be pit against\n\n34:21.920 --> 34:24.520\nanother adult.\n\n34:24.520 --> 34:30.800\nI want to, I want to watch any tree fall hand me an axe.\n\n34:30.800 --> 34:35.760\nMy joy comes from the two damage to submit.\n\n34:35.760 --> 34:36.760\nWe can't conform.\n\n34:36.760 --> 34:38.760\nWe're freaking out.\n\n34:38.760 --> 34:45.240\nYeah, I can't wait to, I can't wait to hear the rest of that, that, that sapiens book.\n\n34:45.240 --> 34:47.120\nDo you want to talk about the dog door?\n\n34:47.120 --> 34:50.680\nYeah, because I didn't want to talk about it for a while.\n\n34:50.680 --> 34:55.200\nWell, it was going on just because I didn't want to advertise that my house had a malfunctioning\n\n34:55.200 --> 34:56.720\ndog door out of any kind.\n\n34:56.720 --> 34:57.720\nRight.\n\n34:57.720 --> 35:01.720\nBecause I didn't want people to be like, some guys like sharpening his knife on a whetstone.\n\n35:01.720 --> 35:06.480\nAnd he's like, did you hear episode three 21?\n\n35:06.480 --> 35:11.640\nHe says the back door has a piece of plexiglass on it that keeps coming up every time the dog\n\n35:11.640 --> 35:12.720\ncomes near it.\n\n35:12.720 --> 35:17.760\nAnd then, and they just have all these posters of me on the wall with like the eyes cut out.\n\n35:17.760 --> 35:24.520\nTry not to, try not to hit his garage this time.\n\n35:24.520 --> 35:28.960\nBut now that, now the old, the old doors back installed and I, I don't know.\n\n35:28.960 --> 35:31.120\nI thought it was such a funny.\n\n35:31.120 --> 35:34.560\nI, yeah, I feel like you might want to at least take lead.\n\n35:34.560 --> 35:39.600\nI mean, I'll fill in and add and take, take, pick up the slack, but I don't know what angle\n\n35:39.600 --> 35:42.320\nyou're coming at this from.\n\n35:42.320 --> 35:47.160\nI had this thought in my head that, which maybe some of you have, which I'd be happy\n\n35:47.160 --> 35:52.600\nthat I can relieve you of, which is the idea that with money comes this ability to like\n\n35:52.600 --> 35:59.080\njust sort of like, like, make things happen, like, like, like, like, like, without, without,\n\n35:59.080 --> 36:00.600\nwithout caring about them.\n\n36:00.600 --> 36:03.680\nSo they're like, well, I'm, I'm rich now.\n\n36:03.680 --> 36:06.800\nSo the dog door is not perfect.\n\n36:06.800 --> 36:10.880\nLike I, I, and now I can't even remember what wasn't perfect about the dog door because\n\n36:10.880 --> 36:14.240\nnow I'm, I want to kiss the dog door I have.\n\n36:14.240 --> 36:21.960\nBut it, it, it, I was like, why can't there be a dog door that doesn't need batteries\n\n36:21.960 --> 36:29.200\nchanged in it and doesn't require batteries to be changed in a fob in the dog's collars\n\n36:29.200 --> 36:32.200\nbecause they make these dog doors where the dog gets close to the dog door and that's\n\n36:32.200 --> 36:37.720\nwhen the dog door opens or unlocks and this is kind of a list of shit.\n\n36:37.720 --> 36:42.240\nAnd also I was like, and inevitably, like, I'd like it to be electronic also because\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:46.280\nI have a Crestron system, like a home automation system, which has also never worked.\n\n36:46.280 --> 36:50.640\nBut one day I have this idea that I'll be sitting in my bed and I'll be like, did you\n\n36:50.640 --> 36:51.640\nhear that, honey?\n\n36:51.640 --> 36:52.640\nWhat was that?\n\n36:52.640 --> 37:10.760\nSounds like coyotes, by the way, that's exactly what coyotes sound like.\n\n37:10.760 --> 37:13.640\nThat's why they're fucking terrifying because they don't sound like an animal.\n\n37:13.640 --> 37:20.680\nThey sound like a fucking, like dude at Target, like arguing with his girlfriend.\n\n37:20.680 --> 37:23.280\nYou're just like, what's going on out there?\n\n37:23.280 --> 37:28.200\nWhy is there a gang of dudes upset about a sale?\n\n37:28.200 --> 37:32.120\nAnd then you listen and they're like, oh, God, it's coyotes.\n\n37:32.120 --> 37:36.360\nAnd then the scariest thing about it is that then your dogs, they hear the coyotes and\n\n37:36.360 --> 37:44.440\nthey're like, they react in these random fucking ways, sometimes sexually, uh-huh.\n\n37:44.440 --> 37:45.960\nYou can't tell the difference.\n\n37:45.960 --> 37:48.160\nYou know how your dog reacts to a skunk or a raccoon?\n\n37:48.160 --> 37:49.160\nThey get excited.\n\n37:49.160 --> 37:56.120\nIf there's a fucking coyote out there, the dogs are like, they're like the call of the\n\n37:56.120 --> 37:57.120\nwild.\n\n37:57.120 --> 37:58.120\nThey're like, I want to go with the circus.\n\n37:58.120 --> 38:00.920\nI'm like, these motherfuckers want to eat you.\n\n38:00.920 --> 38:02.440\nThey're not going to fuck you.\n\n38:02.440 --> 38:05.120\nIf they do fuck you, they're going to eat you after.\n\n38:05.120 --> 38:06.120\nThey don't give a shit.\n\n38:06.120 --> 38:11.600\nThese are hungry ass wild cave dogs from like the fucking last millennia come down here\n\n38:11.600 --> 38:17.880\nto fucking eat squirrels and chihuahuas, but the dogs are like, they hear it and they're\n\n38:17.880 --> 38:18.880\nlike, I want to go out there.\n\n38:18.880 --> 38:19.880\nI want to go out there.\n\n38:19.880 --> 38:25.080\nAnd it's the scariest thing in the world to hear.\n\n38:25.080 --> 38:29.080\nThey're like, I want to go out there.\n\n38:29.080 --> 38:35.040\nSo anyways, I'm just saying, my fantasy was to deal with that and then hit a button and\n\n38:35.040 --> 38:37.680\nbe like, okay, that's enough of that.\n\n38:37.680 --> 38:42.120\nI'm not letting my dogs out, or they sometimes smell a little skunk in the air and then your\n\n38:42.120 --> 38:46.040\ndogs are like, there's a skunk out there and they're like, that means it's time for\n\n38:46.040 --> 38:50.120\nme to go attack the skunk and then you can bathe me for eight hours and then you can\n\n38:50.120 --> 38:55.360\nchange your cushions and then you go, no, it means it's time to lock the door.\n\n38:55.360 --> 38:57.000\nSo I had this fantasy.\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:04.200\nSo it was like electronic and dog collar activated so they could pick and choose when they want\n\n39:04.200 --> 39:06.440\nto go outside.\n\n39:06.440 --> 39:11.960\nBut if I want to seal them in for the evening because of mother nature, I hit the button.\n\n39:11.960 --> 39:12.960\nOkay.\n\n39:12.960 --> 39:14.200\nAll of that from my bed.\n\n39:14.200 --> 39:19.640\nSo Spencer like the whole time for like, for like the last two years, it seems like Spencer\n\n39:19.640 --> 39:21.440\nis like, I got it.\n\n39:21.440 --> 39:26.480\nThis is technically Spencer's job, but it's not really fair to Spencer.\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:27.800\nIt's just long term.\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:30.840\nIt's hard to crack one of these things out really quick.\n\n39:30.840 --> 39:32.680\nSo as a result, it's like, I don't know.\n\n39:32.680 --> 39:33.680\nYeah.\n\n39:33.680 --> 39:38.120\nIt's like, leave these in charge of like the calendar and the finances and all that shit.\n\n39:38.120 --> 39:44.040\nSpencer's like my friend, but yeah, also like, it's like, oh, it's like, oh, it's like,\n\n39:44.040 --> 39:45.360\noh, there's a video game.\n\n39:45.360 --> 39:47.640\nCan you get it for me or something like that?\n\n39:47.640 --> 39:55.320\nIt's not like I'm ever like, Spencer's fucking up because there's not a thing.\n\n39:55.320 --> 40:01.920\nAnd Spencer also knows, I'm not going to bug my friend about the thing and like for a year\n\n40:01.920 --> 40:02.920\nand a half or something.\n\n40:02.920 --> 40:07.880\nI'm like, what about this dog door and then you'd come in and you'd go, okay, so I found\n\n40:07.880 --> 40:09.240\nthis dog door.\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:12.200\nSo it meets your specifications and I'm always like, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n40:12.200 --> 40:13.200\nThat's great.\n\n40:13.200 --> 40:17.680\nAnd then, and then sometimes you'd think back in my head and you're like, yeah, it's kind\n\n40:17.680 --> 40:18.680\nof big.\n\n40:18.680 --> 40:19.680\nAnd I'm like, yeah, whatever.\n\n40:19.680 --> 40:20.680\nMy dog's big.\n\n40:20.680 --> 40:24.720\nAnd then like, it kind of sticks out from the door.\n\n40:24.720 --> 40:28.600\nLike when you install it, I'm like, whatever, I don't, I'm not a fucking, I'm not Martha\n\n40:28.600 --> 40:29.600\nStewart.\n\n40:29.600 --> 40:30.920\nI don't care.\n\n40:30.920 --> 40:31.920\nFunction over form.\n\n40:31.920 --> 40:35.680\nLet's Elon Musk this dog door.\n\n40:35.680 --> 40:38.000\nCut to the dog door is installed finally.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:42.760\nLike it's like, he's the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.\n\n40:42.760 --> 40:45.680\nIt was this giant, like picture a back door.\n\n40:45.680 --> 40:50.560\nSo first of all, the back door had to be completely replaced because the dog door is so big that\n\n40:50.560 --> 40:58.560\nno door, no normal door can contain it, because it's basically the size of a door.\n\n40:58.560 --> 41:03.080\nThe dog door is so big that if Spencer and I like, we're going out for the evening, we\n\n41:03.080 --> 41:08.240\nmight, and we were wearing collars, we might just actually put less energy into leaving\n\n41:08.240 --> 41:10.960\nthe house by ducking down and moving through the door.\n\n41:10.960 --> 41:12.520\nThat's how big the dog door is.\n\n41:12.520 --> 41:18.240\nI compared it to the size of a not many fridge.\n\n41:18.240 --> 41:19.240\nI'd say it's close.\n\n41:19.240 --> 41:20.740\nSo it's a lobby.\n\n41:20.740 --> 41:24.760\nIt's like a fridge in size hanging off the door.\n\n41:24.760 --> 41:33.160\nIt's certainly the size of a chubby criminal, a full on adult, hasn't even earned being\n\n41:33.160 --> 41:37.880\nin your house because he's not even, he's fat from his last robbery.\n\n41:37.880 --> 41:42.400\nAnd he's just like, well, you know, as long as I'm here, I will maintain.\n\n41:42.400 --> 41:45.920\nI feel like your dog is almost, is also that size.\n\n41:45.920 --> 41:46.920\nYes.\n\n41:46.920 --> 41:47.920\nThat's the problem.\n\n41:47.920 --> 41:48.920\nYeah.\n\n41:48.920 --> 41:50.720\nBut my dog ain't going to do shit about the robber.\n\n41:50.720 --> 41:51.720\nYeah.\n\n41:51.720 --> 41:54.600\nI mean, you know, do you ever think about a fence?\n\n41:54.600 --> 41:56.200\nOh, we have one.\n\n41:56.200 --> 41:59.000\nI got fences to beat the band.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:00.000\nOkay.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:01.000\nOkay.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:06.640\nLike, like, before you don't, you know, like, if I've learned one thing, it's that I should\n\n42:06.640 --> 42:11.520\nhave been happy with just being a caveman and letting my fucking Dino out into the backyard.\n\n42:11.520 --> 42:12.520\nIt's a Bronto burger.\n\n42:12.520 --> 42:14.280\nIt's like, I get it now.\n\n42:14.280 --> 42:19.600\nBut I thought in my head, I thought, oh, you get money and then you start doing this James\n\n42:19.600 --> 42:23.440\nBond thing where you're like, you can like weave your, you do the minority report in\n\n42:23.440 --> 42:28.200\nyour bed and then your dog is like happier than if you were a regular dog owner.\n\n42:28.200 --> 42:29.200\nIt's all untrue.\n\n42:29.200 --> 42:30.200\nIt's not true.\n\n42:30.200 --> 42:34.120\nLike no matter how much money you get, you can't, you can't, your dog just needs to be\n\n42:34.120 --> 42:40.800\nlet out and then let in after it shits and yet you gotta care about a living thing.\n\n42:40.800 --> 42:41.800\nAll right.\n\n42:41.800 --> 42:42.800\nThere's no end run around it.\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:44.360\nI'm sorry to tell you.\n\n42:44.360 --> 42:47.600\nSo you may as well go back to your shitty job tomorrow and have a big smile on your\n\n42:47.600 --> 42:50.440\nface because no matter how many promotions you get, you're never going to get to stop\n\n42:50.440 --> 42:55.200\ncaring about fucking people.\n\n42:55.200 --> 42:56.920\nWeird when you don't laugh at shit like that.\n\n42:56.920 --> 43:00.000\nIt's like, I think, why did you buy a ticket?\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:09.080\nI thought you liked my lack of empathy anyways, but the fucking, so Nigel fucking loves the\n\n43:09.080 --> 43:10.080\nthing.\n\n43:10.080 --> 43:14.520\nHe's like the shitty little dog that doesn't need anything because Nigel will find a way\n\n43:14.520 --> 43:15.960\nout of anything.\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:19.880\nLike Nigel, you could just, you could raise him in an environment that was like hermetically\n\n43:19.880 --> 43:23.400\nsealed, but like we, like he'd figure out how to get out anyway.\n\n43:23.400 --> 43:24.400\nYeah.\n\n43:24.400 --> 43:28.880\nNo, I sent Nigel up for pizza the other day and Nigel just like, so he like loves it.\n\n43:28.880 --> 43:40.920\nHe walks up to it, this giant plexiglass guillotine goes, it's nine feet tall, Nigel like looks\n\n43:40.920 --> 43:43.800\nat it, walks right through and he goes and shits and pisses and does what he eats his\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:47.640\nfucking rocks and twigs so that I'll have to give him unnecessary surgery later.\n\n43:47.640 --> 43:58.160\nHe comes back, Harvey is like, Harvey, Harvey spent the three weeks that this thing was\n\n43:58.160 --> 44:03.520\ninstalled just like shitting everywhere in the house.\n\n44:03.520 --> 44:07.880\nWhile Nigel just ran in and out, I would let the both of them out, like Nigel would\n\n44:07.880 --> 44:13.320\ncome back in and Harvey would just sit there and go, poof, poof, poof, like please.\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:19.400\nAnd then I, I, like, like, and he, like, he can't, like the thing makes a sound that\n\n44:19.400 --> 44:21.600\nmakes him like cower away from it.\n\n44:21.600 --> 44:22.880\nI can't say I blame him.\n\n44:22.880 --> 44:25.440\nI mean, it looks like a guillotine.\n\n44:25.440 --> 44:29.160\nHe thinks Harvey is, he thinks Harvey or Nigel is going to another world.\n\n44:29.160 --> 44:33.520\nHe's like, I am not going into that portal at all.\n\n44:33.520 --> 44:38.320\nMy heart is like, if you ever, I don't know if, you know, some of you may have kids and\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:41.320\nlike, I know parents, like I've talked to parents and I know that they always secretly\n\n44:41.320 --> 44:43.680\nhave a favorite if they have two kids.\n\n44:43.680 --> 44:47.120\nI know it's a thing that you don't admit and that you can't because legally with the\n\n44:47.120 --> 44:51.880\nparent guilt, there's two kids and I know that parents with two kids, they always go\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:55.280\nlike, well, Monica's like, she's the jam.\n\n44:55.280 --> 45:00.840\nAnd Toby's kind of a prick, but we love them because he's our kid.\n\n45:00.840 --> 45:04.560\nLike you get that when you have a kid, I get from parents that they go like, you know what,\n\n45:04.560 --> 45:07.560\none of the great things about being a parent is you realize that your job is just to bring\n\n45:07.560 --> 45:09.320\nanother shithead into the world.\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:14.440\nLike you quickly get over this idea that you're like, well, I'm Leopold the third.\n\n45:14.440 --> 45:19.680\nI can't wait for Leopold the fourth to prove I was right about my thirding.\n\n45:19.680 --> 45:21.440\nYou're quickly like, okay, what's that?\n\n45:21.440 --> 45:22.680\nI eat cardboard.\n\n45:22.680 --> 45:24.680\nOkay, fine.\n\n45:24.680 --> 45:26.440\nI guess that's what you were going to do.\n\n45:26.440 --> 45:31.480\nNo matter where you were raised, like I'll just keep you from getting arrested.\n\n45:31.480 --> 45:35.640\nAnd so anyway, so that's why parents, like after a few margaritas, they'll go, yeah,\n\n45:35.640 --> 45:40.520\nI like our daughter, but I don't like our son.\n\n45:40.520 --> 45:45.960\nAnd I get it having two dogs because I'm like, Nigel, my parents are going to hate you for\n\n45:45.960 --> 45:46.960\nthat.\n\n45:46.960 --> 45:48.800\nThey can hate me all I want.\n\n45:48.800 --> 45:51.320\nThey are hating.\n\n45:51.320 --> 45:52.320\nThey're ashamed.\n\n45:52.320 --> 45:53.320\nThey're ashamed.\n\n45:53.320 --> 45:57.240\nIf you're a parent and you're out there and you're like, I love my kids equally, well,\n\n45:57.240 --> 46:00.600\nthen I guess I'm not talking about you.\n\n46:00.600 --> 46:03.440\nSo why are you mad?\n\n46:03.440 --> 46:11.720\nYou know, like, suck my daddy dick, no kid dick.\n\n46:11.720 --> 46:13.320\nHere I am on my throne of no kids.\n\n46:13.320 --> 46:17.520\nI'm telling you, you hate your kids.\n\n46:17.520 --> 46:20.200\nNo one knows that better than me.\n\n46:20.200 --> 46:21.200\nI got dogs.\n\n46:21.200 --> 46:29.360\nI'm just saying, I get like Harvey, Harvey is the smartest dog I've ever met in my life.\n\n46:29.360 --> 46:31.760\nHe watches television.\n\n46:31.760 --> 46:37.800\nWhen he sees things on television that are supposed to excite him, he gets excited.\n\n46:37.800 --> 46:39.280\nI can't get mad at him.\n\n46:39.280 --> 46:42.440\nHe's like, it's like, it's like, ho, ho, ho, here's reindeer.\n\n46:42.440 --> 46:48.360\nAnd he's like, there's deer, there's deer, there's a whole shit trying to deer.\n\n46:48.360 --> 46:51.720\nAnd I'm like, Harvey, Harvey, take it easy and he's like, you take it easy.\n\n46:51.720 --> 46:58.080\nThere's a fucking window with deer and I can't, I can't get mad at him because it's like,\n\n46:58.080 --> 47:02.440\nwell, Nigel's just like, what, what, he gets mad at, he just starts barking at Harvey.\n\n47:02.440 --> 47:08.240\nNigel doesn't, Nigel's just like, his eyes don't move at the same framerate or, I don't\n\n47:08.240 --> 47:12.640\nknow what the, I try, I tried to get clarity on this from scientists and Nigel probably\n\n47:12.640 --> 47:13.640\njust knows it's TV.\n\n47:13.640 --> 47:23.520\nAnd he's like, hey, Harvey, it's a television show.\n\n47:23.520 --> 47:28.360\nNigel seems a little more attuned to like the audio, like podcasts and stuff, maybe.\n\n47:28.360 --> 47:29.360\nI don't know.\n\n47:29.360 --> 47:30.360\nI'm trying to give him credit.\n\n47:30.360 --> 47:34.520\nBut the thing is, it's like, Nigel's the jock, like Nigel like can catch a ball, you throw\n\n47:34.520 --> 47:38.600\nit in the air, like Nigel like gets everything, like Nigel like hacks everything.\n\n47:38.600 --> 47:39.600\nHe's a mutt.\n\n47:39.600 --> 47:43.980\nHe's like, he's like a little grimy little street urchin.\n\n47:43.980 --> 47:48.120\nAnd so he should be, you want, I want him to be me, I want to be a carbon copy of me.\n\n47:48.120 --> 47:49.600\nI want to be like, I'm punky Brewster.\n\n47:49.600 --> 47:50.600\nHe's punky Brewster.\n\n47:50.600 --> 47:51.600\nHe's my adopted kid.\n\n47:51.600 --> 47:53.640\nI want to be, I want to have that bond.\n\n47:53.640 --> 47:56.400\nBut no, Harvey's my kid because he's homeschooled.\n\n47:56.400 --> 47:57.720\nHe's from a breeder.\n\n47:57.720 --> 48:03.280\nHe's afraid of, of not being liked to the point where he's, he can figure out way before\n\n48:03.280 --> 48:09.280\nanyone not likes him, like, that he's so sad that he should like maybe piss in a fountain,\n\n48:09.280 --> 48:12.440\nlike when you come home, he's like, oh, sorry, I did that now.\n\n48:12.440 --> 48:18.160\nHe's like so sensitive and intelligent and intuitive that he's, he's got this little\n\n48:18.160 --> 48:23.400\nbrother that gets to eat before him and like, like, he's like, eh, like, like, I love, I\n\n48:23.400 --> 48:29.160\nmean, like, have you ever, if you have two kids, is it the one that reminds you the most\n\n48:29.160 --> 48:31.480\nof yourself that you like the least?\n\n48:31.480 --> 48:33.840\nThat's my question.\n\n48:33.840 --> 48:35.840\nSend your emails to...\n\n48:35.840 --> 48:40.560\nDude, why is this happening to me, dot dad?\n\n48:40.560 --> 48:42.800\nThat's a great question.\n\n48:42.800 --> 48:44.800\nThat is a really great question.\n\n48:44.800 --> 48:49.640\nBecause like, I think if your kid's created and funny, and that's what you think you are,\n\n48:49.640 --> 48:50.880\nyou love that kid.\n\n48:50.880 --> 48:55.080\nBut if you're not funny, then you hate that kid.\n\n48:55.080 --> 49:00.360\nBut like also the ideal, right, is that you get your shit so together that you're like,\n\n49:00.360 --> 49:02.400\nokay, I got a kid now.\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:07.040\nAnd you're like, eh, I live my life, like, that's the ideal parent.\n\n49:07.040 --> 49:12.160\nYou're not supposed to like, like, oh, he's a little soccer player, Amy, you're a little\n\n49:12.160 --> 49:13.480\nsoccer player.\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:17.960\nAnd then like get mad, like, that they're like, I don't know, soccer's okay, but I like\n\n49:17.960 --> 49:18.960\nthe trombone.\n\n49:18.960 --> 49:24.280\nAnd you're like, what's that fucking dick flute you're playing?\n\n49:24.280 --> 49:27.600\nYou don't even know you're doing it, like that's the cartoonish example, like none of\n\n49:27.600 --> 49:30.040\nus would do that, we're Angelitos.\n\n49:30.040 --> 49:34.160\nSome people really have a set goal for their kids, what they want them to do, they put them\n\n49:34.160 --> 49:36.000\nin shit, they give them little jobs.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:39.360\nAnd some people don't, and they get a president out of it.\n\n49:39.360 --> 49:45.120\nThe one thing we all know is that you can't, it's hands off, you just hope that they don't\n\n49:45.120 --> 49:46.800\nget a gun and a rifle tower.\n\n49:46.800 --> 49:52.400\nI gotta say, I'm really impressed with, I've said it before, like, the only reason I think\n\n49:52.400 --> 49:56.440\nI have the capacity to have kids is because of Cody's sister, she's got her kids.\n\n49:56.440 --> 50:01.600\nAnd like, I swear, I was like, when they were younger, I was like, you can't fucking raise\n\n50:01.600 --> 50:06.280\na kid like that, you kidding me, like talking to them like they're an equal and that's the\n\n50:06.280 --> 50:13.880\nproblem with our society and all this shit, but it's like, no, it's like these consequences\n\n50:13.880 --> 50:18.520\nand rule, like the kids understand the rules, and they also understand the most important\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:22.480\nthing about rules is that actually, if it's a fucking, if you really are, if you really\n\n50:22.480 --> 50:27.320\ngot a bunch of sand in your crack, you can, well, you really want to bend those rules\n\n50:27.320 --> 50:31.680\nbecause they're negotiable on the back end of the front end, like, like, like, like,\n\n50:31.680 --> 50:35.240\nyou gotta tell me what the rules about the sand and the crack are.\n\n50:35.240 --> 50:36.240\nWhat?\n\n50:36.240 --> 50:39.560\nNo, I'm saying, like, if your kids, like, it's, it's, it's, it's avoiding the because\n\n50:39.560 --> 50:42.880\nI said so thing, because, because I said so, that ain't no rule.\n\n50:42.880 --> 50:44.360\nThat's not even a rule in prison.\n\n50:44.360 --> 50:48.040\nBecause I said so, don't even apply in prison, like, like, they don't even, like, like you're\n\n50:48.040 --> 50:52.320\nin prison and you know that, like, you can, well, if you really fucking want it, you can\n\n50:52.320 --> 50:55.400\nget whatever you, you know, like, you can bend the rules.\n\n50:55.400 --> 50:58.160\nSo like, and that's where we send the people that we hate the most, that we don't even\n\n50:58.160 --> 51:01.760\ncare if they ever learn anything, like, we were really unfair to those people, we're\n\n51:01.760 --> 51:05.160\nlike, oh, well, you're going to the pits of hell where you should just fucking suffer\n\n51:05.160 --> 51:06.640\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n51:06.640 --> 51:10.520\nAnd even there, like, if you, if you want a cigarette, you can get a cigarette, if you\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:16.280\nwant a lockpick, you can get a lockpick, and like, it, it, it, so, like, it, it's that,\n\n51:16.280 --> 51:20.360\nthat, I, I like that, like, those conversations where, like, parents are having with their\n\n51:20.360 --> 51:24.640\nkids where they're like, hey, like, what, what are you, what are you complaining about?\n\n51:24.640 --> 51:30.280\nLike, I want to watch Peppa Pig, you know, and, like, well, so, and so, and so, you wanted\n\n51:30.280 --> 51:33.280\nto watch Peppa Pig so bad, you did, what did you just do?\n\n51:33.280 --> 51:36.200\nWhy am I, why, why are we having this conversation?\n\n51:36.200 --> 51:40.440\nI hit someone in the head with a fire truck.\n\n51:40.440 --> 51:44.320\nAnd so, so do you think we're going to watch Peppa Pig now because of that?\n\n51:44.320 --> 51:47.920\nLike, like, just having these conversations, it's kind of like, kind of sounds fun.\n\n51:47.920 --> 51:54.600\nIt's almost like, it, it, it is better that we don't baby talk like we used to.\n\n51:54.600 --> 51:57.720\nThere used to be that thing where we talked down to kids, and now you really do look at\n\n51:57.720 --> 52:05.920\na kid and you go, do you want the Picardi, or do you want the, it's easier on everybody\n\n52:05.920 --> 52:09.000\nif we can just have a conversation versus this code switch.\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:12.160\nAnd I think there has to be kind of a line there, like, like, like, probably says the\n\n52:12.160 --> 52:18.480\nparental expert on his podcast about, but, but it's, that, that guy that I never want\n\n52:18.480 --> 52:22.400\nto be, and that put me off of kids is that guy behind me on the airplane.\n\n52:22.400 --> 52:27.400\nIt's the, it's the working class Chris Pratt dad that's flying first class, and it has\n\n52:27.400 --> 52:28.400\nthat kid with them.\n\n52:28.400 --> 52:32.600\nAnd you just hear this, like, almost one-sided dialogue where this guy is just like, well,\n\n52:32.600 --> 52:33.840\nhey, bro, what do you want?\n\n52:33.840 --> 52:34.840\nWhat do you want?\n\n52:34.840 --> 52:35.840\nOh, you want to do that, bro?\n\n52:35.840 --> 52:36.840\nWhat do you think, dude?\n\n52:36.840 --> 52:37.840\nHey, guy, what do you think?\n\n52:37.840 --> 52:38.840\nOh, that'd be awesome.\n\n52:38.840 --> 52:39.840\nOh, yeah.\n\n52:39.840 --> 52:40.840\nWhat is your shoe?\n\n52:40.840 --> 52:41.840\nA spaceship?\n\n52:41.840 --> 52:42.840\nOh, that's amazing.\n\n52:42.840 --> 52:46.480\nOh, and it's just kind of, I, I feel like kids pick up on insincerity before they pick\n\n52:46.480 --> 52:47.480\nup on language.\n\n52:47.480 --> 52:50.200\nLike the kids, like, too, he's like, I think my dad's a dick.\n\n52:50.200 --> 52:54.600\nI don't have the, I don't have the words for it yet, but I think I'm being raised by,\n\n52:54.600 --> 52:56.760\nlike, Chris Pratt, and I don't like it.\n\n52:56.760 --> 53:01.200\nLike, that's all I know about you is that you're a fucking, like, mock enthusiast about\n\n53:01.200 --> 53:04.960\nevery fucking thing I do, like, I don't know what to trust, like, what, what, what, what\n\n53:04.960 --> 53:08.400\nis it that I do that's actually gratifying my shoes a spaceship?\n\n53:08.400 --> 53:10.400\nGo suck my...\n\n53:10.400 --> 53:13.120\nSuck my tiny little...\n\n53:13.120 --> 53:18.280\nNo, they do, they, look, they do, we, as a society, we sort of roll out the red carpet\n\n53:18.280 --> 53:20.280\nfor the first 10 years.\n\n53:20.280 --> 53:23.880\nFor the first 10, and then after 10, we're like, motherfucker, get a job.\n\n53:23.880 --> 53:26.840\nYou'll see me, you'll see me asking you for shit.\n\n53:26.840 --> 53:30.440\nThat's not fair, too, but that's also, that's the problem is, like, when the kids get gangly\n\n53:30.440 --> 53:32.520\nand then we start being like, fuck you.\n\n53:32.520 --> 53:36.560\nLike, that's a, that's a big problem, because it reinforces the thing is, like, we could,\n\n53:36.560 --> 53:42.000\nlike, blend it a little bit, like, where it's like, hey, like, look, I'm not, yeah, it's\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:45.080\nlike, like, look, you just talked to him like a fucking dude.\n\n53:45.080 --> 53:50.240\nI think the baby talk is instinctive to us, because literally, like, I think there's a,\n\n53:50.240 --> 53:54.240\nI think the reason why we look at a baby, we go, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,\n\n53:54.240 --> 54:00.080\nis because we, we, because the babies, like, are like the CPU that's like fucking booting,\n\n54:00.080 --> 54:04.360\nand like, we know that they actually, if we didn't do that, if you raised a baby in an\n\n54:04.360 --> 54:08.680\nenvironment where they weren't surrounded by hominid faces that were constantly going,\n\n54:08.680 --> 54:11.880\nhey, don't be, don't be, don't be, don't be, don't, like, that they wouldn't start going\n\n54:11.880 --> 54:15.560\npeep-op, but, you know, that they're experimenting with it, and then, and then, and then they,\n\n54:15.560 --> 54:22.960\nthey turn two, and then they go past the salt, and, whoa, yeah, that is true.\n\n54:22.960 --> 54:26.120\nIf you don't talk to your babies, they don't start talking, and you can tell kids that\n\n54:26.120 --> 54:27.120\nhaven't been spoken to.\n\n54:27.120 --> 54:33.480\nOh, look who's here, speaking of babies that need to be spoken to, maybe we can try some\n\n54:33.480 --> 54:34.480\nof these techniques.\n\n54:34.480 --> 54:36.600\nAre you ready to come out?\n\n54:36.600 --> 54:43.000\nDid you, did you, did you have a good time in your, uh, special place, Rob?\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.480\nExcuse me.\n\n54:45.480 --> 54:49.120\nDid you, do, are you feeling better now?\n\n54:49.120 --> 54:50.120\nAbout.\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:59.640\nAbout, uh, stage time, and when to come out, and, yeah, I'm okay with it, I'm all right.\n\n54:59.640 --> 55:01.640\nOkay.\n\n55:01.640 --> 55:02.640\nI love you.\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:05.640\nI love, I love you too, Daniel.\n\n55:05.640 --> 55:11.160\nMaybe tomorrow we'll go to the sunflower patch.\n\n55:11.160 --> 55:17.200\nAll right, I'm trying to think of what kids like.\n\n55:17.200 --> 55:23.480\nI'm trying to go down the list of, like, what I would hate to ever do.\n\n55:23.480 --> 55:24.480\nYeah.\n\n55:24.480 --> 55:25.480\nYeah, that sounds awful.\n\n55:25.480 --> 55:26.480\nDisney land.\n\n55:26.480 --> 55:27.480\nThat sounds worse.\n\n55:27.480 --> 55:32.600\nWhat if you could just have a kid that was into Minecraft, like, out of the box?\n\n55:32.600 --> 55:42.440\nLike an old box, an unfortunate figure out of the, from the get go.\n\n55:42.440 --> 55:46.240\nLike if they were like, they were just like, and then you're like Minecraft, and they're\n\n55:46.240 --> 55:49.240\nlike Minecraft.\n\n55:49.240 --> 55:54.840\nI would, I just saw a baby that would like sit on a laptop next to me and it'd be like,\n\n55:54.840 --> 55:57.000\nwhat are you, what are you doing over there?\n\n55:57.000 --> 56:00.920\nAnd they'd be like, I'm making a wheat garden and I'd be like, cool, can I, do you want\n\n56:00.920 --> 56:08.920\nme to help you with stuff because I'll, I can simulate being a father or that would be,\n\n56:08.920 --> 56:09.920\nthat would be so cool.\n\n56:09.920 --> 56:10.920\nThat'd be great.\n\n56:10.920 --> 56:14.760\nThat would be so cool.\n\n56:14.760 --> 56:19.840\nMy post production supervisor at community, he had two kids and he said when I was, he\n\n56:19.840 --> 56:23.480\nwould go, he said, oh, I'm into Minecraft because he saw me playing it while I was editing\n\n56:23.480 --> 56:24.480\ncommunity.\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:25.480\nThat's right.\n\n56:25.480 --> 56:36.840\nWell, and then also in addition to that, probably wrote a blog in my head, be amazed, go ahead.\n\n56:36.840 --> 56:40.880\nBut he was like, oh, Minecraft and he's like, I play that with my kids and he had to like\n\n56:40.880 --> 56:44.280\na server at his home and he would go home and play with his kids.\n\n56:44.280 --> 56:50.480\nIt was like a digital sandbox, a dad playing with his two kids Minecraft, you know, you\n\n56:50.480 --> 56:52.760\ncan drink with them too.\n\n56:52.760 --> 56:58.480\nOnce they, well, once they stop caring about Minecraft, but that I would be like, yeah,\n\n56:58.480 --> 57:03.600\nI'd be like, don't, that would be my big thing with my kid would be like, I don't like Minecraft.\n\n57:03.600 --> 57:04.600\nI want to drink.\n\n57:04.600 --> 57:10.320\nI'm like, dude, what do you think I've been doing the whole time?\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:16.160\nGet a drink and come back and play Minecraft.\n\n57:16.160 --> 57:17.320\nDrinking's my Minecraft.\n\n57:17.320 --> 57:21.680\nDon't ever say that again.\n\n57:21.680 --> 57:22.680\nMinecraft was your drinking.\n\n57:22.680 --> 57:25.680\nDid I get that right?\n\n57:25.680 --> 57:28.200\nHe needs more ice.\n\n57:28.200 --> 57:29.200\nSchrab.\n\n57:29.200 --> 57:31.480\nSchrab, do you have nieces and nephews?\n\n57:31.480 --> 57:33.920\nYeah, I think so.\n\n57:33.920 --> 57:36.280\nAnd bull parked me on their ages.\n\n57:36.280 --> 57:37.280\nWhat's that?\n\n57:37.280 --> 57:38.280\nBull parked me on their ages.\n\n57:38.280 --> 57:40.080\nHow old am I?\n\n57:40.080 --> 57:42.720\nI think I have one that's three ish.\n\n57:42.720 --> 57:43.720\nOkay.\n\n57:43.720 --> 57:46.800\nAnd the other one that's five ish.\n\n57:46.800 --> 57:52.960\nSchrab, you want to talk about this guy, this guy, I think the video doesn't really, but\n\n57:52.960 --> 57:56.240\ndo you want to talk about this guy outside your apartment?\n\n57:56.240 --> 57:57.240\nIt's been weird.\n\n57:57.240 --> 57:58.240\nIt's been a weird couple of days.\n\n57:58.240 --> 58:04.760\nLike, I don't know what planet we're in retrograde.\n\n58:04.760 --> 58:07.360\nI think there's five planets in retrograde.\n\n58:07.360 --> 58:10.120\nI think there's five planets.\n\n58:10.120 --> 58:12.680\nThere was.\n\n58:12.680 --> 58:14.560\nI think they went back.\n\n58:14.560 --> 58:19.640\nI mean, is that what retro means?\n\n58:19.640 --> 58:21.240\nRetrograde means they went back.\n\n58:21.240 --> 58:25.200\nThey went back a grade.\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:30.120\nAnd I think that's happened because like, for the past couple of days, things have been\n\n58:30.120 --> 58:33.120\nf'd up.\n\n58:33.120 --> 58:35.360\nMy Spotify got hacked.\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:38.280\nYour Spotify got hacked.\n\n58:38.280 --> 58:40.240\nBy far my weakest password.\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:42.200\nLike, the weakest password.\n\n58:42.200 --> 58:44.080\nCar got broken into.\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:45.080\nWow.\n\n58:45.080 --> 58:54.560\nAnd my keys, my car keys, that didn't have Kate's car key on it, we're in it.\n\n58:54.560 --> 59:00.000\nWe walked on the beach, left the keys, my keys, because I didn't want to carry them,\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:07.560\nbecause I only have two pockets, so I kept my keys in Kate's car, came back, opened up\n\n59:07.560 --> 59:11.080\nthe door, and Kate was like, you must have lost your keys.\n\n59:11.080 --> 59:15.720\nI go, I must have lost my keys, because I lose things, and I lost my keys.\n\n59:15.720 --> 59:22.040\nBut then, when I went to the gym this morning, they said, oh, somebody tried to use your\n\n59:22.040 --> 59:31.720\nLA fitness membership yesterday, but got rejected, which made me feel like the guy was like,\n\n59:31.720 --> 59:37.400\nexcuse me, I would like to use my membership to get inside your gym.\n\n59:37.400 --> 59:42.800\nAnd they went, okay, let me take this, beep, wait a minute, this isn't you.\n\n59:42.800 --> 59:49.280\nAnd they went, fuck, and then ran into the gym, and was like, sir, sir, you have to\n\n59:49.280 --> 59:55.360\ngo, no, no, no, no, he was trying to like, work out, and they were just dragging him\n\n59:55.360 --> 59:58.760\nout, and he was like, no, no, no.\n\n59:58.760 --> 01:00:05.720\nI was trying to figure out, really, he's rowing, sir, that's not a boat, we're still here.\n\n01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.800\nNo, sir, get out of here, you have to get, you put that weight down, put those weights\n\n01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800\nup, no, no.\n\n01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.760\nI was trying to figure out the most damage someone could do by hacking my Spotify account,\n\n01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.120\nthey were sitting on for a week, and I was like, I think actually the only thing would\n\n01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.000\nbe a net positive, because I think Spotify will be like, oh, you listened to Tori Amos\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.520\nand Marshmallow?\n\n01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.720\nYou should come to this VIP party.\n\n01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.320\nWhere is, is that all that happened to you?\n\n01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320\nOr is there more?\n\n01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:41.200\nWell, hey guys, I hacked Dan's Spotify account, what, no, no, I was shooting you a look because\n\n01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.400\nI, I did that bit in a text message with you, I was shooting you the, the comedians look\n\n01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.200\nof like, well, that didn't work, because I thought we were being really funny in my text\n\n01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.120\nmessage conversation with Spencer about my Spotify account, I got hacked, all right, continue.\n\n01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.480\nIt went over better on the text.\n\n01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:05.560\nMy trunk got broken, unrelated, my trunk got broken.\n\n01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.480\nHow do you know it's unrelated?\n\n01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:16.480\nBecause, because it wasn't related, I mean it's related that we were in the same grade\n\n01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:26.040\nthat was retroactive, and it was a vehicle, but my trunk got broken, and at the car wash,\n\n01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.160\nthe car wash man said, oh, I can glue that for you, and I go, you broke my trunk, and\n\n01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:39.360\nhe goes, oh, this brand of car, oh, we get broken, I go, but it wasn't.\n\n01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.080\nAnd he said, why are you coughing?\n\n01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.320\nAre you okay, sir?\n\n01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:54.840\nWhere did you and Jeff go to punish me for, no, no, wait, wait, wait, listen, and I go,\n\n01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:00.640\nno, I can fix it, I can fix it, and I'm going, well, somebody better fix it, because it\n\n01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.280\nwasn't broke when I came here, and now it's broken.\n\n01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.160\nAnd he goes, I can glue it, I can glue it, please.\n\n01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.280\nYeah, borderline, borderline, you don't have to look at you.\n\n01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:19.800\nSo I'm sitting down, I'm sitting down, I'm sorry, out in the heat, this man is gluing\n\n01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.440\nmy trunk together, and I'm like, what kind of glue are you using?\n\n01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.480\nBecause it's hot outside, I don't know if it'll affect it.\n\n01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.880\nLet me look at the package, and I put on my glasses that I'm reading, and I'm just, I'm\n\n01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.600\njust turned into my mother.\n\n01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.480\nWhat kind of glue are you using?\n\n01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:50.000\nWell, if you keep screwing around, and screwing around, of course it's going to break.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.200\nSo you screw around, and you screw around, and you screw around, and you broke the trunk,\n\n01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.600\nand now you're going to glue it with this gorilla glue.\n\n01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.520\nI hope it works, or you'll be seeing me at nine o'clock tomorrow.\n\n01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:17.960\nBut give us a snapshot of this guy, Rob lives on this intersection in Los Angeles, I said\n\n01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:25.680\nthe second most populated city in the United States.\n\n01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:39.760\nSo his gym membership username is, you've been living there forever, and it's like this\n\n01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.680\nintersection where clearly, the government has decided that putting a stop sign there\n\n01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.000\ncreates a, they looked at it from a bird's eye, they're like, well if you put a stop\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.080\nsign there, the city will shut down.\n\n01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.560\nIt's like putting a clot in a thing, and they're like, well how many car accidents\n\n01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560\nare there?\n\n01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560\nEight a day.\n\n01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560\nThe most ever?\n\n01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560\nEight a day.\n\n01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.280\nOkay, but per year, so on average they look at the whole circulatory system of the city,\n\n01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.760\nand they're like, so keep letting there be car accidents and let the insurance companies\n\n01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.240\npay, because unlike a stop sign, those only happen once in a while, but it is the most.\n\n01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:28.320\nSo I'm replying to my emails, and I'm replying, and I'm replying, and I'm replying, and all\n\n01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:39.640\nof a sudden I hear, ahhh, Michael Winslow is outside your door.\n\n01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.240\nHe's now a UPS man.\n\n01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:58.760\nThree seconds later I hear, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, and Kate's like, Jesus\n\n01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.320\nfucking Christ, what did you do?\n\n01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.240\nAnd I'm like, I'm just replying to email.\n\n01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240\nWhich ones did you reply to?\n\n01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.240\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.240\nThe ones that say do not reply?\n\n01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240\nYeah.\n\n01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240\nThey say do not reply.\n\n01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:17.240\nLook, I got enough shit going on with Mercury doing whatever it's fucking doing up in the\n\n01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:23.440\nsky, breaking my trunk, stealing your car keys.\n\n01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.240\nI got enough shit to work out.\n\n01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.720\nWell let's investigate, let's look outside the window.\n\n01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:36.040\nWe see a three car piled up, Schrab.el everywhere, and we see an Armenian woman going, oh my\n\n01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.160\ngoodness, oh my goodness, we're going back and forth, and this other guy going, oh my\n\n01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:47.480\nGod, oh my God, you ruined my life, you ruined my life.\n\n01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.200\nI had this car for three days.\n\n01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:57.520\nI can't make a living without my car, and you ruined my life, you ruined my life.\n\n01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:06.440\nCut two, three hours later, oh my God, you ruined my life, you ruined my life.\n\n01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.280\nI can't make a living without my car, you ruined my life.\n\n01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:18.120\nI was like, oh God, what if he was a marathon runner and his leg was broken or anything?\n\n01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.040\nHe's a pianist and his fingers are shattered.\n\n01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.040\nPianist got hurt.\n\n01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:29.320\nIf he was Dr. Strange and his knuckles, I needed voodoo magic too.\n\n01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.000\nI don't think Dr. Strange was strange enough.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.840\nI know you worked on the movie.\n\n01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.680\nHe seemed pretty normal.\n\n01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.360\nHe was like, believe me, I was brought in there.\n\n01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.960\nExcuse me, pardon me, how are you, sir?\n\n01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.240\nI was thinking he would be doing some Howie Mandel shit, putting the glove on, he's going\n\n01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:55.560\nI know you're doing a bit, but I actually consider that my job.\n\n01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:01.080\nI was like, in the sequence where he's like, why don't you have a Dr. Strange from Austin\n\n01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.840\nand come in and he's like, hey, what am I doing, what am I doing, why are you from Austin?\n\n01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.400\nI thought I was in there because I was the Rick and Morty guy.\n\n01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400\nHe's Dr. Strange.\n\n01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400\nMake him Strange.\n\n01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400\nYou are.\n\n01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400\nAnyways.\n\n01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.400\nDoesn't matter now.\n\n01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.400\nYou never have to.\n\n01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.000\nSo you were like saying, he comes in wearing green pants and an orange t-shirt.\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nCome on.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.520\nCan we not get sidetracked by this?\n\n01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.520\nWe have two big foam hands.\n\n01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.400\nBut you said number one on it.\n\n01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.280\nYou said you heard a crash.\n\n01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280\nHello.\n\n01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.280\nYou said you heard a crash.\n\n01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280\nNo.\n\n01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280\nThe Dr. Strange.\n\n01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.000\nHe ain't in.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.200\nI was like, look, one of these days this guy is going to meet Tony Stark, how are we going\n\n01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200\nto know the difference between them?\n\n01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.200\nThe answer has to be that they have different motivations.\n\n01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200\nThe amount of strangeness.\n\n01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200\nAll right.\n\n01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:57.200\nTony's got the weird sideburns, Dr. Strange has the cape.\n\n01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:08.480\nSo you said you heard a crash and then you hear a guy going, oh my God, you were in my\n\n01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.480\nlife.\n\n01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.520\nAnd I'm thinking, oh my God, can you imagine all the permutations about like if you were\n\n01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.640\na ballerina and like your ankles are sprained or whatever, it's like the slightest like\n\n01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640\nphysical thing.\n\n01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.720\nLike somebody or like an actor even.\n\n01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.720\nClearly he was an actor.\n\n01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720\nBut we don't like beautiful people.\n\n01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.760\nLike what if your face gets sliced by your thing or your nose gets broken.\n\n01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.400\nAnd I was like, oh God, I wonder what that was.\n\n01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.800\nBut then the guy was out there for three hours and he was out there so long yelling about\n\n01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.240\nhow his life was ruined that it became very clear that his life was not ruined.\n\n01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.760\nBecause he had the ability to stand outside and yell about how his life was ruined and\n\n01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.000\nhe went into great detail.\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.400\nBut I was really focused on his car.\n\n01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:53.800\nAnd he's like, I can't make money if I don't have my car, if my car can't make money, I\n\n01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.600\ncan't make payments on my car.\n\n01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.360\nSo it's like over time you're like, this doesn't, it sounds like you're doing pretty\n\n01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360\ngood.\n\n01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.320\nLike I don't think you were on your way to like a Forbes meeting.\n\n01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.120\nThe poor lady that was being yelled at by this man who already felt bad, you know, is\n\n01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.040\nbeing yelled at, being yelled at, being yelled at, being yelled at.\n\n01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:20.800\nThe tow truck picks up her car first and leaves the guy and he's like, goodbye, thanks\n\n01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.960\nfor ruining my life.\n\n01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.760\nI don't have anybody to pick me up.\n\n01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.760\nI don't have any friends.\n\n01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.120\nWell, at least he has an audience.\n\n01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.720\nI wonder why.\n\n01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720\nWhich is his worst nightmare.\n\n01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720\nYou seem pretty.\n\n01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.160\nI mean, I'm sure the guy was having a bad day.\n\n01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.760\nI'm sure it wasn't his fault.\n\n01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.080\nI'd love to see like that guy, the rest of that guy's life.\n\n01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.120\nHe might just be like, hold on, hey guys, I just am getting a new car.\n\n01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120\nIt's so exciting.\n\n01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120\nIt's going to be great.\n\n01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.120\nI'm going to be able to make all this money with my car, guys.\n\n01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120\nThat's exactly what I said.\n\n01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120\nYeah.\n\n01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120\nI'll take the end.\n\n01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120\nI'm so happy.\n\n01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.120\nThanks.\n\n01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.120\nThank you, everybody.\n\n01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.120\nThank you.\n\n01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120\nThank you.\n\n01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120\nThank you, God.\n\n01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120\nThanks, boy.\n\n01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.120\nI'm going to make so much money because of this car.\n\n01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.800\nIt's a stepping stone to a greater life.\n\n01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.800\nI'm so grateful for it.\n\n01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.800\nOh, God.\n\n01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.800\nOh, God.\n\n01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.800\nYeah.\n\n01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800\nYeah.\n\n01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800\nNot a fucking chance.\n\n01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800\nAnd I don't say that.\n\n01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.800\nI don't say that like he deserved it.\n\n01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800\nOrder in the court.\n\n01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800\nOrder in the court.\n\n01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800\nJesus.\n\n01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.800\nThe defendant will please rise.\n\n01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.800\nYes.\n\n01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800\nYes, your honor.\n\n01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.800\nDid you, madam, run into this poor man's car?\n\n01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800\nYes, I did.\n\n01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800\nOkay.\n\n01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800\nYou may sit down.\n\n01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.800\nLet's talk to the other guy, sir.\n\n01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.800\nWill you please state your case?\n\n01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.800\nOh, my life is short.\n\n01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800\nMy life is short.\n\n01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.800\nYou're in my life.\n\n01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800\nYou're in my life.\n\n01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.800\nHey, does that give me the limit?\n\n01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.800\nHell yeah.\n\n01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.800\nYour honor, if I could read the tape back.\n\n01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.800\nBut just a moment.\n\n01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800\nBrenda, sorry.\n\n01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800\nI know.\n\n01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800\nBrandon.\n\n01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.600\nApplying gender to your occupation.\n\n01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.040\nI'm part of the problem.\n\n01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.360\nI'm a temp, but I look like the other one.\n\n01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.840\nSo I'm racist too.\n\n01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.360\nNo, you're fine, your honor.\n\n01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.480\nLadies and gentlemen, if I could just read back,\n\n01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.640\nyou're ruining

life.\n\n01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.960\nYou're ruining his life, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.640\nExcuse me, Mr. Kensington, you're not in charge.\n\n01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.880\nI'm talking to Brandon. I'm the jury.\n\n01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.640\nIf I could please... Sir, I will hold you\n\n01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.920\nin contempt of Corey. I am not a lawyer.\n\n01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.400\nI am not a part of this.\n\n01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.320\nI just want to use the gym membership.\n\n01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.760\nBecause I have a problem with my back right now.\n\n01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.960\nAnd if I could just...\n\n01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.720\nI'm just gonna lift these. Wait.\n\n01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.280\nOh, no. God damn it.\n\n01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.880\nThat's the oldest scam of the book.\n\n01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.280\nHow does the court keep...\n\n01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.680\nSir, you're gonna have to put those pounds back on\n\n01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.200\nbefore you leave.\n\n01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.200\nTake these Cheetos.\n\n01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.400\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.680\nCan I leave now? Can I leave?\n\n01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.080\nCan I leave now that I'm fat and gross again?\n\n01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.680\nBut I will try, because you sent me the video.\n\n01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.400\nI don't... We promised nothing, but I'll try.\n\n01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.800\nMaybe we can hear this guy,\n\n01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.520\nbecause this is Rob's wife recording it\n\n01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520\nfrom the apartment near the glass.\n\n01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.280\nKate! Her name is Kate.\n\n01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.920\nOkay.\n\n01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.160\nI don't...

Every baby... Every...\n\n01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560\nIt's quiet.\n\n01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.560\nYeah, he's not talking.\n\n01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.560\nHi! Thanks for leaving my fucking wife!\n\n01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.560\nI don't get a ride. It's not like it's me to ride.\n\n01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.560\nI... I mean, he was saying that so much\n\n01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560\nthat you were able to hear it,\n\n01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.560\nand then someone got out their phone at some point, like...\n\n01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560\nYeah, I mean, he was saying it for a long time.\n\n01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.560\nYeah.\n\n01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.560\nI mean, the guy's... The video, he's hopping around.\n\n01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.560\nLike, that's the thing.\n\n01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560\nIt's okay to make fun of his tragedy,\n\n01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.560\nnot because he deserves to have misfortune,\n\n01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.560\nbut because he's fine physically.\n\n01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.560\nLike, in all the ways that his mishap could hurt him permanently.\n\n01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.560\nHe's fine, and he's... I just...\n\n01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560\nHe's jumping up and down yelling,\n\n01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.560\nmy life is ruined.\n\n01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.560\nI... I... I ran out of steam pretty quickly.\n\n01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.560\nYou know this.\n\n01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.560\nLike, I'm like... If I show up in a public place,\n\n01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.560\nI'm like, uh, okay, yeah, I'm done.\n\n01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.560\nAll right, goodbye, Lyft. Goodbye.\n\n01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.560\nYou never see me again.\n\n01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560\nSo... But this guy, for three hours,\n\n01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560\nscreaming at the time,\n\n01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.560\nyou ruined my life, you ruined my life.\n\n01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.560\nI get him.\n\n01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560\nYou ruined my life, you ruined my life.\n\n01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560\nYou ruined my life of the commitment.\n\n01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.560\nI was jealous.\n\n01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560\nI could be... I was that guy.\n\n01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560\nI'm this guy.\n\n01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560\nBut...\n\n01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:36.560\nNo.\n\n01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.560\nI don't think you're that guy.\n\n01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560\nI've never seen you like that.\n\n01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560\nWith I was 30 years old, and shit would befall me.\n\n01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.640\nI was like, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.560\nAnd I would like, you could wind me up\n\n01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.120\nand I would be in the Glendale Galleria,\n\n01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.560\nlike making a, like, I would just,\n\n01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.920\nlike, I would have this thing like,\n\n01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.760\nwhen were you ever like that?\n\n01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.400\nWell, you would never see it,\n\n01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.880\nexcept like once in a while,\n\n01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.080\nI was like, but if a telemarketer called me,\n\n01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.360\nlike, why is my phone ringing?\n\n01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.840\nI would like enter the exchange,\n\n01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.760\nlike, why is this happening to me?\n\n01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.240\nLike, I was Christ, you know?\n\n01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.400\nLike, what's with this ripple in my perfect world\n\n01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.520\nthat my father created?\n\n01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.840\nYou know, they're like, hello?\n\n01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.160\nMr. Harmon, this is a courtesy call,\n\n01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.800\nthey're like, who are you?\n\n01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.360\nAnd why are you calling me?\n\n01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.200\nYou know, it's just like,\n\n01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.880\nyou just get this righteousness about you.\n\n01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.760\nLike, I don't know, when I was like 30,\n\n01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.720\nI was like, are you, like, well, still,\n\n01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.960\nyeah, I'm not, I don't mean to imply\n\n01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.240\nthat I'm mellow and zen now,\n\n01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.800\nbut like, I just got,\n\n01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.560\nI just got filled within a fat that I was like,\n\n01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.720\nI'm tired, like this piggy needs to roll over and die.\n\n01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.160\nI think being in the arts, when you're super creative\n\n01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.520\nand you have some language\n\n01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.400\nand you know how to fucking act a little bit,\n\n01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.240\nyou are the worst person to run into.\n\n01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.200\nYou're the worst person to run into\n\n01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.520\nwhen it comes to shit like that.\n\n01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.520\nBut I do, yeah, I do think,\n\n01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.880\nI think outrage is helpful, like,\n\n01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.520\nI actually don't, I don't wanna see less people\n\n01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.720\nbe so fucking like, unfamiliar with,\n\n01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.080\nwith bullshit that they're outraged.\n\n01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.760\nI don't, like, we talk about outrage culture\n\n01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.720\nand like, we want to, like, dissolve it,\n\n01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.880\nlike a wart with nitrous or whatever the shit\n\n01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.840\nthat they would burn your warts away with.\n\n01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.680\nLiquid nitrogen.\n\n01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.080\nLiquid nitrogen.\n\n01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.200\nI don't, I don't think that's tall.\n\n01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.040\nAcid!\n\n01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.200\nI think outrage is great.\n\n01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.200\nI think it's amazing for somebody to wake up one morning\n\n01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.200\nand be like, you know what,\n\n01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.120\nI haven't been treated like a fucking human being today.\n\n01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.800\nI, let alone the princess or the prince that I am\n\n01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.000\nor the fucking king or the,\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.440\nlike, and to like enter every exchange that you have\n\n01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.040\nwith an expectation that is like fucking like,\n\n01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.960\nbecause what's the alternative to that?\n\n01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.880\nTo like take your cues from, from a society\n\n01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.800\nthat thinks you're a piece of shit,\n\n01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.920\nlike how you should be treated.\n\n01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.960\nSome people have to invert that shit\n\n01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.200\nand sometimes that, that takes the form of a tantrum,\n\n01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.680\nyou know, like some people would be like,\n\n01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.600\nyou know what, I woke up this morning and I'm like,\n\n01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.280\nwhy am I not being treated like a fucking human being?\n\n01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.760\nTuck your fucking keys!\n\n01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.600\nDo you mean like that?\n\n01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.000\nHow come I can't unlock every door\n\n01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.520\nthat I walk towards?\n\n01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.360\nBut sort of like that situation where you just pop off.\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.880\nAnd I think that's a, that's a,\n\n01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.280\nI know, I think that guy just had to take a giant shit.\n\n01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.880\nI don't know.\n\n01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.720\nI'm trying to run that.\n\n01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.520\nWell, what could have made that guy mad?\n\n01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.720\nThat's literally, I was literally advocating for\n\n01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.280\nspecifically him if he was leaving because he was mad.\n\n01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.120\nNo, he has to take a shit.\n\n01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.960\nI think it's okay to get mad.\n\n01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.800\nFuck this!\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.880\nI think it's okay to pop off now and then\n\n01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.800\nand be a fucking reposer,\n\n01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.000\na fucking crazy hypocritical, fucking punk rock activist.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:37.840\nFuck you!\n\n01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.400\nThere is something about living in,\n\n01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.080\nwhen you live in Los Angeles,\n\n01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.800\npeople tend to get out of their cars\n\n01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.160\nand rant at you more than other cities.\n\n01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.040\nAnd it is, is it the heat?\n\n01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.720\nWell, it could be, also though, remember Los Angeles\n\n01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.640\nis like a beautiful city to walk into traffic in.\n\n01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.000\nLike Los Angeles is very kind to the fucking pedestrian.\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.440\nYou step into the street coming out of JFK\n\n01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.200\nand like you get a very harsh reminder of like,\n\n01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.200\noh shit, it's legal to kill me here.\n\n01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.000\nLike they're aiming for me and that makes New York run.\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.240\nBut LA, like everyone's coming from different countries\n\n01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.200\nand all this shit, but we somehow get it pounded into us\n\n01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.800\nthat if somebody steps into the street,\n\n01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.560\neven if they're drunk and wandering in,\n\n01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.320\nlike it's on you if you hit them.\n\n01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.160\nSo that could be, that could create tension\n\n01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.400\nfor a almost New York-sized city\n\n01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.840\nwhere like everyone's gotta get somewhere\n\n01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.480\nand it's like, fuck, you know,\n\n01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480\neverything's on me if I make a mistake.\n\n01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.480\nLike that could create like fucking, you know,\n\n01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.320\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.880\nIt could ruin your life.\n\n01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.880\nYeah.\n\n01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.320\nIt could ruin your life.\n\n01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.480\nThe other thing I think is like,\n\n01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.760\nif a guy is screaming, this ruined my life,\n\n01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.480\nif a car accident ruined your life,\n\n01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.760\nthe first thing I'm thinking\n\n01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.240\nif I'm overhearing that is uninsured.\n\n01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.360\nLike, which he has my support because it's like,\n\n01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.680\nI would be screaming on the sidewalk like,\n\n01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.240\nwhy the fuck is it mandatory for me to have a fuck?\n\n01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.520\nLike if somebody hit me and I was uninsured for a week\n\n01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.600\nbecause I was between jobs and all that shit,\n\n01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.880\nthat would fucking send me over.\n\n01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.320\nI think the deal was just being real big, honestly,\n\n01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.000\nbecause I think if you're fucked, you're really quiet.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.640\nWhen shit pops off, that makes your life really in.\n\n01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.720\nBut also if it was super his fault, I think it'd be,\n\n01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.440\nlike, I think, like, look, it could be,\n\n01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.240\nit could be the other driver's fault.\n\n01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.240\nDon't you think that would send him over like more?\n\n01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.080\nI'm saying, I'm saying.\n\n01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.400\nCause he's like, I did nothing wrong,\n\n01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.800\nbut I was like, I'm going to go to the gap.\n\n01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.800\nAnd like, I, like, they told me, they told me don't,\n\n01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.480\nthey told me you can't drive uninsured and all this shit.\n\n01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:42.160\nLike he took, he took his little canoe out into the canal.\n\n01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.800\nI was like, I'm going to catch some fish.\n\n01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.440\nI'm going to come back with them.\n\n01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.240\nI'm going to make my village proud.\n\n01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.240\nI'm like, I'm, and for that to be taken away from him\n\n01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.560\nbecause somebody like went, it was their fault.\n\n01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:56.080\nTechnically it's his fault, but only on paper.\n\n01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.480\nBut the woman ran into him.\n\n01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.800\nHe, he got sandwiched between two cars.\n\n01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.640\nSo then, so then, he got the worst of,\n\n01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.240\nso then I understand the outrage.\n\n01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.480\nI don't, I don't, I don't like, I just get it.\n\n01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.840\nLike, I just, like, like, if you're-\n\n01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.360\nPeople kept yelling at him, insurance.\n\n01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.800\nShe's got insurance.\n\n01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.640\nRight.\n\n01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.600\nInsurance.\n\n01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.040\nAnd he's like, you can't get insurance\n\n01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.120\nunless you sell enough pizzas and I can't sell pizzas\n\n01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.600\nunless people like me and no one likes me\n\n01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600\nbecause I don't have a car.\n\n01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.720\nAnd I understand that.\n\n01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.560\nI do.\n\n01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.880\nAnd I will vote for him when he runs for,\n\n01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.320\nbecause he's, I don't know if that anger goes somewhere.\n\n01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320\nI get it.\n\n01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.160\nYeah.\n\n01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.040\nIt went into my ears.\n\n01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:44.960\nWell, I'm trying to reply to my emails\n\n01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.360\nand I'm hearing this, I don't know, outside.\n\n01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.520\nIt was distracting.\n\n01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.360\nBut that's-\n\n01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.200\nI had to make fun of it.\n\n01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200\nThat's what you're talking about.\n\n01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.000\nHomo sapiens versus Neanderthals, Neanderthals would be like,\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.640\nwait, someone's, someone's life is ruined?\n\n01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.800\nDid you say homeless sapiens?\n\n01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.640\nHomo sapiens.\n\n01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.440\nHomo, Homo neanderthalus.\n\n01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.680\nHomo sapiens are the only species capable of going,\n\n01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.960\noh, there's a guy, here a guy screaming my life is ruined.\n\n01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.480\nSounds like a job for the mythical thing\n\n01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.920\nI've constructed in my head called the DMV,\n\n01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.120\nthe state of California, the rule of law,\n\n01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.720\nthe responsibility, Barack Obama.\n\n01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.040\nI don't know what that meant.\n\n01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.600\nUnivision, I don't know.\n\n01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.400\nLike you have all these constructs in your head\n\n01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.240\nand you're like, I would do more harm than good\n\n01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.320\nif I even go to the window and look out of it.\n\n01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.440\nBut if you were in a tribe of 150 people\n\n01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.040\nand you were like, you heard one of your best friends\n\n01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.840\ngoing, my life is ruined, you'd be like,\n\n01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.440\nwell, it's the shitty part of me that's gonna sleep in.\n\n01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.480\nBut we are capable of creating cultures\n\n01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.280\nwhere we're like, it's actually a pretty good job today.\n\n01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.160\nHeard a guy screaming, my life is ruined,\n\n01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.080\ndidn't run to the window to take a picture.\n\n01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.000\nI'm doing pretty good today.\n\n01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.800\nLike we kind of pat ourselves on the back\n\n01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.120\nfor a little bit of numbness,\n\n01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.360\nbecause that's how you get through.\n\n01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.360\nOh, a plane goes down with 300 of your fellow species\n\n01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.200\nand you don't-\n\n01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.320\nI don't know, are you on my side or not?\n\n01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.160\nAre you, what do you-\n\n01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.480\nNothing happened to you.\n\n01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.560\nWhat, what?\n\n01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.720\nI'm on your side?\n\n01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.400\nNothing happened to you.\n\n01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.200\nYou're saying, well, 300 people died in a plane crash\n\n01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.920\nand you're taking pictures of this.\n\n01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.760\nNo, no, no, I didn't mean-\n\n01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.520\nHe just did an Elizabeth Smart version of you.\n\n01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.000\nI think it's good that you-\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.200\nI'm so, they're so happy.\n\n01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.320\nThat guy would be so happy.\n\n01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.520\nIf you could put him in a chamber\n\n01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.360\nthat sucked all of his misfortune out\n\n01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.000\nand then you told him,\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.680\nsomeone recorded you screaming, my life is ruined, goodbye.\n\n01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.040\nAnd 150 people, well, that's still 120.\n\n01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:49.040\nAll right, guys, I get it,\n\n01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.800\nit's downtown, it's Monday, whatever.\n\n01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.200\nBut if you could separate his consciousness,\n\n01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.920\nhe would go like, oh, that's cool.\n\n01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.000\nThat my tragedy made these people happy for a second,\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.840\nbecause they weren't like, what an animal.\n\n01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.560\nHe should be stuck with a spear until he dies.\n\n01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.000\nAlthough I do, again, I will say maybe that dude deserved it.\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:11.840\nI was-\n\n01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.440\nThat's another huge thing that the sapiens guy talks about.\n\n01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.840\nThat's why everybody needs to read this book,\n\n01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.480\nbecause he talks about gossip.\n\n01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.800\nHere's the thing, is this woman who,\n\n01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.000\nit was her fault, she even said,\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.520\nit's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault.\n\n01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.600\nWas sitting there, she was being screamed at by this guy.\n\n01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.400\nEverybody in the neighborhood was huddled around her,\n\n01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.080\nlike, are you okay?\n\n01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:33.920\nDo you need a-\n\n01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.920\nBut this guy was going, nobody's caring about me.\n\n01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.920\nHe probably had a neck injury, he got hit really hard.\n\n01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.920\nOr it triggered, it might have triggered some loss\n\n01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.440\nfor that dude, obviously.\n\n01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.280\nYeah.\n\n01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.480\nBecause he really-\n\n01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.280\nWell, it sounds like it ruined his life.\n\n01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.480\nWell, if we can take him at his word.\n\n01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.320\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.520\nPeople kept saying, calm down,\n\n01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.800\nand people kept avoiding him,\n\n01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.800\nbecause he just was, he was at a 10 and stayed there,\n\n01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:05.920\nand never-\n\n01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.440\nWhich always makes you feel great.\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.760\nYeah, everybody knows that.\n\n01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.160\nAt no point, he went, at one point,\n\n01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.560\nI heard him talking quietly, and I went,\n\n01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.600\noh, okay, well, this is the part

energy back\n\n01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.720\nto scream at her as he was driving home to her family,\n\n01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.080\nand home, and warm bed.\n\n01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.600\nWell,

through.\n\n01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.200\nAnd, and she, and so she recaps it,\n\n01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.440\nshe has this like sort of bon vivant style,\n\n01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.760\nlike, like, kind of like, like she, she chucks it off,\n\n01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.600\nlike, like, she's like, she's like,\n\n01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.120\nthis is what happened to me and this is what happened\n\n01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:08.960\nto me and this is what happened.\n\n01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.960\nAnd you know what, every single time\n\n01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.680\nsomething bad started happening to me,\n\n01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.480\nI kept thinking, well, it can never get any worse than this.\n\n01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.040\nAnd every time I thought that, it kept getting fucking worse.\n\n01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.480\nAnd so I started to learn after a while,\n\n01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.320\nit can get worse than this.\n\n01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.520\nAnd that's when it started to get better.\n\n01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.760\nAnd I was like, all right, I got, like, that's like,\n\n01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.120\nlike, she was like, I hacked the spiritual system.\n\n01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.120\nShe was like, well, I, I, oh, I've gotten to a place where I,\n\n01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.280\nit's sort of, but the other half of you goes, yeah,\n\n01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.120\nbut that's how we're all conditioned by things like\n\n01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.080\norganized religion to suffer abuse, you know?\n\n01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.880\nLike, like, that's, it's a very fascinating.\n\n01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.600\nIt's also a bit of a survival skill though.\n\n01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.360\nI won't trash it too much.\n\n01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.200\nIt's not conditioning.\n\n01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.040\nIt literally is the thing that keeps us.\n\n01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.680\nThat's, and it makes us different.\n\n01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.920\nLike the, the, the Homo sapiens, like we're able to believe\n\n01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.280\nin the shit that doesn't, isn't real.\n\n01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.680\nBut the important asterisk on that is that real doesn't matter\n\n01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.160\nbecause once you get like, like the species,\n\n01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.320\nwe make the unreal real.\n\n01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.400\nSo the corporations, they're just real.\n\n01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.960\nLike if Disney's a corporation, like, and everyone believes\n\n01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.200\nthat Disney's a corporation, which it is,\n\n01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.000\neven though that doesn't mean anything,\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.520\nWalt Disney isn't alive, there isn't anything.\n\n01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.880\nLike Disney's just a belief.\n\n01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.360\nIt exists of like a bunch of like,\n\n01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.200\njust like a tribe.\n\n01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.800\nScriptures that you have on record and things.\n\n01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.440\nBut ultimately, like, hey, well, you know,\n\n01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.760\nit's like several thousand people like, like,\n\n01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.440\noh, I got, I got fired today.\n\n01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.080\nI don't want, like, because this belief in the system,\n\n01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.800\nlike the belief matters.\n\n01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.560\nThe belief in the dollar, the belief in your taxes,\n\n01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.560\nthe belief that you are a citizen of a country.\n\n01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.560\nLike, it's almost an understatement to say that,\n\n01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.600\noh, so much of our life is based on these, like,\n\n01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.480\nfabrications that have nothing to do with reality,\n\n01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.640\nbecause that would be the most,\n\n01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.880\nwhen you really think about it, it's like,\n\n01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.520\nwell, what did you do today?\n\n01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.200\nWhat governed your life today that had anything to do\n\n01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.440\nwith biological reality?\n\n01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.040\nYou took a shit.\n\n01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.480\nYou sneezed.\n\n01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.520\nI, like, like, everything that had anything\n\n01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.120\nthat you culturally, like, registered.\n\n01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.400\nAnything that would actually meant anything to you,\n\n01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.160\nyour self-esteem, like, most importantly,\n\n01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.520\nlike, whether or not you think you're a good person,\n\n01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.000\nlike, it all had to do with, like, fucking crazy,\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.280\nlike, shit that doesn't, it doesn't exist.\n\n01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.400\nBut it does exist.\n\n01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.000\nThat's the, it's not, I don't think the important thing\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.800\nis for us to realize it doesn't exist,\n\n01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.120\nbecause I think that's what a raccoon would do.\n\n01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.400\nThat's why a raccoon keeps going through your garbage,\n\n01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.680\nno matter how many times you tell it, it's against the law.\n\n01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.240\nAnd the raccoon will just look at you and go,\n\n01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.520\nthat doesn't mean anything.\n\n01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.520\nThat doesn't make the raccoon a hero or a villain.\n\n01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.360\nIt just, like, makes, it means the raccoon would die.\n\n01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.840\nMakes it a raccoon.\n\n01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:03.920\nBut the truth for that raccoon is that if it doesn't stop\n\n01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.400\nfucking with the wrong person's garbage, it's gonna die.\n\n01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.600\nBecause of a belief system that that human has, like,\n\n01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.440\ndecided on.\n\n01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.160\nLike, okay, it's okay for me to poison you,\n\n01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.400\nbecause the city of whatever I live in doesn't care.\n\n01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.240\nAnd it's just.\n\n01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.080\nNevada.\n\n01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:21.360\nNevada's fine, it's.\n\n01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.360\nIt's, Jeff, what went on with you and Jeff backstage?\n\n01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:31.360\nNow tell us.\n\n01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.440\nNow reward us for our patience.\n\n01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.480\nWhat went on back there?\n\n01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.680\nWhat was your strategy?\n\n01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.020\nBecause ours won.\n\n01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.840\nI don't think so.\n\n01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.840\nBecause we were having a ball.\n\n01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.360\nWell, I think we had a pretty good time too,\n\n01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.560\ndidn't we, kids?\n\n01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.400\nYay!\n\n01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.080\nI love, I love, like, the people I didn't see clap.\n\n01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:56.920\nWe're like.\n\n01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:57.760\nNah, nah.\n\n01:31:59.080 --> 01:31:59.920\nWell, there's no feeling.\n\n01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.760\nI'm sorry, dad.\n\n01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.680\nMom picked me up on Tuesday and got ice cream.\n\n01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.080\nThat's fine, I love them too.\n\n01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.840\nI don't demand fealty.\n\n01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.680\nThat's right.\n\n01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:17.680\nWhat makes me different from your fake gods?\n\n01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.840\nI'm the first god to say to you.\n\n01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.920\nYou know what, I'd like to earn it.\n\n01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.960\nThat's your first and last commandment.\n\n01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.840\nLet me earn it.\n\n01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.120\nStop it, stop it.\n\n01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.040\nWhat, you're afraid I'm gonna become a cult leader now?\n\n01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.160\nIt's a little late for that concern.\n\n01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.480\nIt's just so.\n\n01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.800\nWhat? Tideous.\n\n01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.920\nIt's like walking uphill.\n\n01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.480\nThat's what Kate said to me one time.\n\n01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.760\nLike, I would, because I do bits, you know,\n\n01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.480\nwhen we're driving in the car.\n\n01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.520\nYou remember those?\n\n01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.560\nYeah.\n\n01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.640\nTrob car bits?\n\n01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.880\nYeah.\n\n01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.960\nIt's like me testing out material.\n\n01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:07.000\nUsually it's me singing the names of the signs that I,\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.760\nyou know, say, I have a 25 miles an hour shop code.\n\n01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.200\nYou know, like stuff like that, you know, like that.\n\n01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.680\nAnd at one point, like it was like silent for a while.\n\n01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.520\nAnd then Kate goes, ugh.\n\n01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.600\nYou know, it's like talking to you is like walking a pill.\n\n01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.120\nAnd I was like, and I started like almost crying.\n\n01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.880\nAnd she just started laughing her ass off.\n\n01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.560\nAnd I'm like, that's not funny.\n\n01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.120\nAnd then I started laughing because it was pretty funny.\n\n01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.000\nBut it was funny because it hurt my feelings.\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.680\nI didn't, like, that's like a vitamin in small doses.\n\n01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.080\nLike, it's not a representation of your union.\n\n01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.360\nBut like also that's like your best partner will.\n\n01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.960\nI had a girlfriend once who said, I just,\n\n01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.600\nI was almost so proud of this.\n\n01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.640\nIt was an insult, like, because we were sitting\n\n01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.080\nat an airport gate.\n\n01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.760\nAnd I was like, I said, I was like, I was joking.\n\n01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.960\nBecause I paid for first class tickets.\n\n01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.560\nAnd then they were like, we're now\n\n01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.240\nadmitting people who need to sit first and whatever.\n\n01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.760\nAnd I was like new to first class.\n\n01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.560\nAnd I was like, there was a guy literally with a cane\n\n01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.160\nthat was clearly blind.\n\n01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.120\nAnd I said as a joke, but, you know,\n\n01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.760\nI lean into my jokes when I'm in private.\n\n01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.960\nI was like, oh, great.\n\n01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.080\nSo what do I got to do to really sit first?\n\n01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.960\nYou know, I blind myself.\n\n01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.560\nWhat?\n\n01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.440\nWhat did you say?\n\n01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440\nWhat do I got to do?\n\n01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.920\nI was just making the joke.\n\n01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.600\nI was, it didn't matter what I said.\n\n01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.560\nIt was like the joke was, I'm first class,\n\n01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560\nbut the blind guy gets to get on the plane first.\n\n01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.560\nHe paid with his sight.\n\n01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.800\nWhat did you pay?\n\n01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.360\nI am aware of the God damn irony,\n\n01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.680\nor I wouldn't have said something.\n\n01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.520\nIf he would have traded, he would.\n\n01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.200\nMy girlfriend.\n\n01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:56.720\nGo first.\n\n01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.520\nCan I see my baby?\n\n01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.320\nMy girlfriend, like, you don't know\n\n01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.280\nthat he got blind doing something cool.\n\n01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.040\nHe could have been an asshole.\n\n01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:13.600\nHe might have poked out an eye, a microscope that\n\n01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.480\nis designed to make Ebola.\n\n01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.800\nI was like, well, he was so enthusiastic about making Ebola.\n\n01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.760\nHe's like, ow, ow.\n\n01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.160\nI can't see.\n\n01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.400\nThank God.\n\n01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:32.480\nMy point was, you remember these zingers,\n\n01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.160\nbecause they're actually like, my girlfriend at the time\n\n01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.640\nsaid, you're like a watchdog group for one.\n\n01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.200\nAnd I thought it was really funny and scathing.\n\n01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.280\nIt was like, yeah, I really am like the most\n\n01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.080\nridiculously horrible narcissistic person.\n\n01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.960\nBut it was also like an expression of like, wow.\n\n01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.520\nIt's like, for a partner to be like, you are awful.\n\n01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.320\nIt's part of it.\n\n01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.760\nBut at the same time, and I think the reason I started\n\n01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:14.720\nlaughing is because we talked about it for a long time,\n\n01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.000\njust dissecting why we were both laughing.\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.360\nAnd she said, the reason is you were trying as hard as you\n\n01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.880\ncan to make it feel like I was walking uphill.\n\n01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:25.360\nRight.\n\n01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.160\nListen to this.\n\n01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:31.520\nYou were trying as hard as you could to be a horrible person.\n\n01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.960\nWe succeeded.\n\n01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.480\nYeah.\n\n01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.720\nWhich is what couples do.\n\n01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.120\nBut the shortcut to that is you can\n\n01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.160\nbe pleasant with each other about everything else\n\n01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.400\nif you just take the lid off the fart rule.\n\n01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.400\nJust fart with each other.\n\n01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.160\nBecause then you can be like, you're awful,\n\n01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.200\nbecause that was awful.\n\n01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.320\nAnd then you can both be like, yeah, that was bad.\n\n01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:58.240\nAnd then you're like, oh, let's get back to our partnership.\n\n01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.000\nIn all other matters, we're best friends.\n\n01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.160\nBut don't do that again.\n\n01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:05.760\nI won't.\n\n01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.000\nYeah, I'm from Missouri.\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.240\nSo if you want me to show you a fart.\n\n01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.720\nNo.\n\n01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.000\nSo we don't really fart in front of one another ever.\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.320\nI've done both.\n\n01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.000\nI think I've talked about that before.\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.200\nI think Sarah, I don't think she'd mind me saying this,\n\n01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.720\nbecause Sarah was going out with Jimmy.\n\n01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720\nSarah Silverman going out with Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.680\nYou'd think, OK, these two are comedians.\n\n01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.840\nThey're artists or whatever.\n\n01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.280\nI remember we were talking about farting,\n\n01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.720\nand she was like, yeah, Jimmy and I don't fart around each other.\n\n01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.160\nAnd I was like, you guys don't fart around each other?\n\n01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.840\nAnd so me and Megathi, we did a whole marriage.\n\n01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.440\nIt was like, yeah, the only thing I learned from it\n\n01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.240\nis that that's a thing you can do.\n\n01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.040\nThat's a total option.\n\n01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.040\nIt didn't make it worse.\n\n01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:54.800\nIt didn't make it better.\n\n01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.360\nRight.\n\n01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:58.840\nBut it's a distinctive decision.\n\n01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.200\nI think actually what it taught me\n\n01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.720\nis when I was a 25-year-old kid who was like, oh,\n\n01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.880\nI associated farting in front of each other\n\n01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.280\nas with a threshold of intimacy, that actually\n\n01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.080\nhad to do with abuse.\n\n01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.000\nWell, that word is too heavy.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.560\nBut that it was like, oh, you're family now,\n\n01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.520\nwhich means you're like, I don't respect you now.\n\n01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.480\nWe're not.\n\n01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.440\nIt's like when the farting becomes,\n\n01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.960\nwhen it signifies, well, you don't matter to me.\n\n01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.600\nThat's what you don't want to enter your head.\n\n01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.000\nIsn't the problem kind of making farts symbolic in any sense\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.120\nfor the relationship?\n\n01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:39.880\nThat could be.\n\n01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.640\nBecause when it means something,\n\n01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.040\nwhether you're doing it in front of each other or not doing it,\n\n01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.440\nmaking it mean something, that seems like, well, what are we\n\n01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.960\ndoing?\n\n01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.840\nI think you may be the most right and most wrong\n\n01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.960\nabout this, because you're right.\n\n01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.120\nFirst of all, good luck making farts not mean something.\n\n01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.600\nNot mean the wrong thing.\n\n01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.840\nWell, just because getting to that place where it's just,\n\n01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.520\nwell, farts are just when air is expelled from your anus,\n\n01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.960\nlike, come on, good luck.\n\n01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.000\nThey're hilarious.\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.280\nBut at any given time, it's like, it\n\n01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.880\ncould be like if someone's saying they love you\n\n01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.960\nand then you fart, the timing means you don't love them\n\n01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.920\nor whatever, or if they're farting more than you,\n\n01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.360\nbecause they're lactose intolerant.\n\n01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.800\nI don't want to open that door.\n\n01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.360\nThat all sounds like madness.\n\n01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360\nRight.\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.520\nSo I do think you're right in that if you maintain the idea\n\n01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.120\nthat, well, farts happen, so they don't have power over us.\n\n01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:42.040\nSo if I do fart next to you, it can't possibly mean by itself\n\n01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:42.880\nthat I don't love you.\n\n01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.480\nIt's certainly not supposed to.\n\n01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.560\nThat's not the point of doing that.\n\n01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.560\nAny more than exhaling or lightning striking,\n\n01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.280\nbecause really, it's just may as well be weather.\n\n01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.880\nBut the big, I think when I was younger,\n\n01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.480\nI think growing up blue collar and kind of midwestern\n\n01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.600\nand just sort of cultural things, it's like,\n\n01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.080\nI think I had it in my relationships.\n\n01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.080\nIf you're listening to this, and I doubt you are,\n\n01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.480\nand you dated me when I was 19, I don't think you're listening\n\n01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.080\nto this podcast.\n\n01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.840\nLet's go ahead and bring Katie out.\n\n01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.560\nBut I think I was like, oh, yeah, I was like, yeah,\n\n01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.760\nI was flowers and candy.\n\n01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.080\nAnd then we started farting in front of each other.\n\n01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.680\nAnd then it turned into kind of trailer park,\n\n01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.440\nlike, well, we're balling, chaining each other.\n\n01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.200\nBut that has nothing to do with the fart.\n\n01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.160\nIt has to do with the symbolism that you project onto it.\n\n01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.080\nWhich is that's probably the real problem.\n\n01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:35.760\nYeah.\n\n01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.200\nWhereas Cody and I fart all over each other constantly.\n\n01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.480\nI'm saving one up for her right now,\n\n01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.920\nbecause it means I love you.\n\n01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.680\nThat is.\n\n01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:55.160\nYour dad kept a big barrel of pretzels next to his recliner.\n\n01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:55.920\nDo you remember that?\n\n01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.640\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.720\nHe would have like a big Costco's big thing of pretzels.\n\n01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.440\nWe're all dried out, nasty.\n\n01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.840\nNext to his recliner.\n\n01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.720\nRemember that?\n\n01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:07.720\nYeah.\n\n01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.840\nTry to stop eating them, though, right?\n\n01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.720\nI would eat them.\n\n01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.200\nYeah.\n\n01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.040\nAnd you'd eat more.\n\n01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.000\nAnd you'd be like, this dry ass giant brick pretzel.\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.480\nAnd then you'd keep eating them.\n\n01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.280\nYou would eat them?\n\n01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.160\nI would eat them.\n\n01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.720\nI'm assuming your dad would eat them.\n\n01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.400\nAnd it was always full.\n\n01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.400\nIt was always full.\n\n01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.920\nBecause he would get another barrel, yeah.\n\n01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.520\nYeah.\n\n01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.800\nAnd I think one time I went out into the garage\n\n01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.640\nwhere there was the jukebox or whatever that he had or whatever.\n\n01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.000\nAnd there were all these barrels of pretzels.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000\nYour dad liked big fucking pretzels.\n\n01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nThey were big ones.\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nThey weren't little like giant pretzels.\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000\nBarrels of them.\n\n01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nIt's making me love my dad, bro.\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nDog biscuit pretzels.\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000\nHe got it.\n\n01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nHe gets it.\n\n01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000\nMy dad gets it.\n\n01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000\nHe fucking nailed it.\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nHe had the recliner, the remote control, and the pretzels\n\n01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nin arms reach and backup pretzels in the chamber.\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000\nNext to the jukebox.\n\n01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000\nBecause he probably noticed, probably like one day he came home\n\n01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nand he was like, who ate my pretzels?\n\n01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nWhat are we doing?\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nAnd then he was like, wait, I have money?\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000\nA billion pretzels.\n\n01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nIf you love pretzels that much, get a billion pretzels.\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nHow much for one?\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nWell, it's about $15.\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000\nI'll take everything you got.\n\n01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nHere's my address.\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000\nHow much to ship it to my place?\n\n01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000\nIt'll take those like, fuck it.\n\n01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nHere's my credit card information.\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000\nMeet me.\n\n01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000\nMeet me there in 15 minutes.\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000\nWe used to make fun of my dad because my dad was, he subscribed\n\n01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000\nto this company called Blair.\n\n01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000\nThat was like, basically all his clothes came through the mail.\n\n01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000\nAnd we just made fun of him because he was like, oh, your dad,\n\n01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nyour clothes come through the mail.\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nCome on, cut to half of our sponsors.\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000\nYeah, fell.\n\n01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000\nOh, socks are us.\n\n01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000\nWould be happy to put you in a pair of socks.\n\n01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nJust sign up to Warby Soccer and we'll put some socks on you.\n\n01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000\nIt's like, I'm Billabooty and Butterjic Chico.\n\n01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000\nYes, it is.\n\n01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000\nWe would make so much fun of my dad because it was like,\n\n01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000\ndad, what do you get your clothes in a box from a delivery man\n\n01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000\nfor?\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000\nHe's like, ah, what are you making fun of me?\n\n01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000\nWhat am I going to pick the best shirt in the world at a store?\n\n01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000\nAll of a sudden, everyone's going to start respecting me, right?\n\n01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.000\nLike, oh, here's an idea.\n\n01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000\nHere's the shirt size.\n\n01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000\nHere's the pant size.\n\n01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000\nFucking mail me pants and shirts and I'll go to work.\n\n01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000\nPerfect human.\n\n01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000\nDo we have a little D&D?\n\n01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000\nYeah.\n\n01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000\nIt's close.\n\n01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000\nWe've got about nine minutes of D&D.\n\n01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000\nWe should bring Jeff Davis out for the D&D.\n\n01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000\nJeff is either waiting or at my bed is not waiting because Jeff thinks\n\n01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nthat his final revenge is going to be in the form of us going,\n\n01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000\nJeff, where are you?\n\n01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000\nWhere are you?\n\n01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000\nTo silence.\n\n01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000\nDon't you think he's not back there?\n\n01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000\nI think he's still back there because he's Jeff Davis.\n\n01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000\nHe's a reasonably loyal dude.\n\n01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000\nWell, I'll go look.\n\n01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:24.000\nYeah, because what I won't do is beg for it.\n\n01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000\nWon't do it.\n\n01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000\nIs to earn it.\n\n01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000\nHe doesn't have to earn it because I wouldn't do that to another person,\n\n01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000\nbut I won't have it done to me.\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000\nI introduced him.\n\n01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000\nHe made a bit out of it.\n\n01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000\nNow he's going to lay in that bed.\n\n01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000\nI'm willing to be even Steven.\n\n01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.000\nI'm not going to take revenge or be like, I want all I want is friendship\n\n01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000\nand equality.\n\n01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000\nThat's all I've ever wanted.\n\n01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000\nYeah, you sound dangerous right now.\n\n01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.000\nI need to just come up to my tent for nine months and worship Mormon Christ.\n\n01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000\nCan you just say you're sorry?\n\n01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000\nCan you just say you're sorry?\n\n01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000\nHave you ever weaponized that, think back through your life going like,\n\n01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000\noh, just say you're sorry.\n\n01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000\nIt would be so hard to say you're sorry.\n\n01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000\nIt is hard to say you're sorry.\n\n01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000\nAnd it should be.\n\n01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000\nThat should be a big deal.\n\n01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000\nGod damn it, we keep pissing that guy off.\n\n01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000\nThe only thing he doesn't like is human fidelity.\n\n01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000\nHe doesn't care if I'm breaking through to the inner rage.\n\n01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000\nGod damn it, I don't find it.\n\n01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000\nI wanted to hear when season four is coming out.\n\n01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000\nI don't know what it is.\n\n01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000\nWhen it's done, I can't say.\n\n01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000\nOh, I can read a...\n\n01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000\nI'll read an S&P note.\n\n01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000\nWe got our first S&P note from Rick and Morty.\n\n01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000\nOh yeah.\n\n01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000\nAnd it seems kind of harmless to read it, I think.\n\n01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000\nLet's see.\n\n01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000\nMorty's butt is simply too large.\n\n01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000\nGive us a beat.\n\n01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000\nIt's so much more...\n\n01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000\nI don't know if I just typed Rick and Morty.\n\n01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000\nWhat's that?\n\n01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000\nI like that you looked at me.\n\n01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000\nI can't...\n\n01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000\nRead these notes to a beat.\n\n01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000\nRead these notes to a beat.\n\n01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000\nDelivery status.\n\n01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000\nLet's talk about...\n\n01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.000\nMy new favorite thing is Canadian Horror Podcasts.\n\n01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000\nThis podcast is called The No Sleep Podcast.\n\n01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000\nWhy are you guys...\n\n01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000\nYou're just fans of it too.\n\n01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000\nThere's 11 seasons of it and I'm on season four.\n\n01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000\nThe guy sounds exactly like Scott Thompson from Kids in the Hall.\n\n01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000\nIt's so Canadian and it's so funny.\n\n01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000\nI swear.\n\n01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000\nI said to David Cummings, host of that podcast,\n\n01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000\nI want to just ask you this because I don't like it when people hit people.\n\n01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000\nDan Harmon made fun of you in his podcast or whatever.\n\n01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000\nThe guy that was up and disappeared or whatever.\n\n01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:23.000\nI will fly you first class to Los Angeles to be on the show and celebrate you.\n\n01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000\nI love your podcast.\n\n01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000\nI go to sleep to it every night.\n\n01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000\nNow here's the part where maybe I'm teasing but I just love this.\n\n01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000\nIt's this creepy pasta podcast and it just starts with this creepy music\n\n01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000\nand this guy that sounds like Scott Thompson from Kids in the Hall\n\n01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000\ngoes like, as the darkness descends into the wilderness\n\n01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000\nand your heart's nightmares come out to play,\n\n01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000\nit's time to surrender to the horror.\n\n01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000\nBecause tonight there will be no sleep.\n\n01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.000\nI just find it fascinating that there is absolutely no way to be effectively scary\n\n01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000\nwhen you're that Canadian, which I want.\n\n01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:25.000\nAt the top of everything it's like, he's like, this is welcome to episode seven\n\n01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000\nof season three of the No Sleep podcast.\n\n01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000\nA few orders of business.\n\n01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000\nWe're raising the price on the Patreon silver package\n\n01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:47.000\nuntil tonight's chingly spine tingling terrors of terror are about 73 cents per spine tingle.\n\n01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000\nIt's so fucking Canadian.\n\n01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000\nHe's so cost effective.\n\n01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000\nYou all remember Otis Redis from our last thing.\n\n01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000\nHe's having some trouble without going into too much detail.\n\n01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000\nHe needs some help.\n\n01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000\nThere's a GoFundMe page but the GoFundMe will always be like a weird Canadian version of GoFundMe.\n\n01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000\nThere's a Royal Federation Super PAC page.\n\n01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000\nSign in to help guys.\n\n01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000\nWhat?\n\n01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000\nOh no.\n\n01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000\nWithout further ado, it's time for the terrifying tales.\n\n01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000\nIt's called the No Sleep podcast.\n\n01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000\nWe literally sleep to it because it's so comforting.\n\n01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000\nHe's adorable.\n\n01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000\nI don't know if he wants to be adorable.\n\n01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000\nBecause I'm starting back.\n\n01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000\nI have seven seasons to go before I'm caught up.\n\n01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000\nI'm still at the era where he's like a new advent of the podcast.\n\n01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000\nYou'll notice on the website we have something new called trigger warnings.\n\n01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000\nFor those who don't know, trigger warnings are well, they're a spoiler free advisory\n\n01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:13.000\nabout the type of content that you may encounter during a scary tale designed to tingle your spine.\n\n01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000\nWe always seek to frighten and terrify, but in a safe way that makes everyone happy.\n\n01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000\nDon't forget, Bowling League is next Tuesday.\n\n01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000\nIf that guy, I love him so much.\n\n01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000\nI hope everyone's going to be like, oh, he did an impression of you and all this stuff in the hill.\n\n01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nSo I'm saying, please come on the podcast.\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nI will rose petals for you.\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nI love you.\n\n01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000\nIt's such a great combination.\n\n01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.000\nCanadian accent and terrifying tales.\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nBecause they're not just generic monkey pastries.\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nThey're creepy pastas.\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000\nA lot of them are like fucking hardcore.\n\n01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:13.000\nIt's like this next scary tale comes to us from a neighbor who thinks maybe when you're planting in your garden,\n\n01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:21.000\nyou ought to be careful for, as our next narrator says, the carrots in the soul.\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000\nAnd then some music will come in.\n\n01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000\nBut then he'll affect some like, he's always talking about who needs more narrators and he's always apologizing.\n\n01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000\nWe could use some more narrators, but I'll do this next one anyway.\n\n01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000\nAnd then he'll do like, here, I've been planting carrots for a long time.\n\n01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000\nHe just gets the sense of like, come on, you're a pig and shit, stop.\n\n01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000\nYou don't need anybody.\n\n01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000\nJust fucking do it, baby.\n\n01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000\nI want to hear all your accents.\n\n01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000\nHe's like, sometimes he doesn't like, I'm from Chicago.\n\n01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:59.000\nAnd I like that one time people told me to watch a channel six and can make people jump off a building.\n\n01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000\nOh, that was a scary one.\n\n01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000\nThis next one's about a pussy of fire.\n\n01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000\nOkay.\n\n01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000\nAnyways, what was, yeah, I know that confused me too.\n\n01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000\nWhy would the next one be about a pussy of fire?\n\n01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000\nThe answer is because it's time to end the show.\n\n01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:24.000\nOh, and he says at the end, he's like, oh, that's the end of our episode.\n\n01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000\nYou don't have to tell people that.\n\n01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000\nI mean, it's ending.\n\n01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000\nHe starts it with so much business.\n\n01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000\nOh, the subscription plan has changed.\n\n01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nIt's like, it's like getting on a bus.\n\n01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000\nAnd a lot of the stories are Canadian too, and they're so charming.\n\n01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000\nThey're like, oh, this next one, they got, oh, what went down by the lake?\n\n01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:54.000\nAnd what went down by the lake is a dude lit up a joint, sat on a bench and he saw something scary and he never forgot it.\n\n01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000\nThat's fucking it.\n\n01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000\nLike, oh, yeah, you mean privilege?\n\n01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.000\nOh, he'll never forget the day by the pine tree lake.\n\n01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000\nOh, it's a splash and a ghost was splashing.\n\n01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000\nIt wasn't a raccoon.\n\n01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000\nOh boy, the cops came over and they gave me a wag of the finger.\n\n01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nThey gifted my joint underneath the park bench, said, you know, a lot of people wouldn't believe your story,\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000\nbut it ain't my job to judge you.\n\n01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:36.000\nAnd he walked away, but I'll never forget that spooky bench by the lake.\n\n01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000\nBut then they're interspersed with totally American, just like, I got raped on the dark web because I clicked on the wrong thing\n\n01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000\nand it came in the window and raped my fucking rape flesh.\n\n01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000\nBut they're red in the same place, like, oh, and the rape and the rape flesh in my rape.\n\n01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000\nWell, that brings us to the end of our stories.\n\n01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nIt's a glorious, podcasting is the last section of the internet to have any fucking health to it.\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000\nI am out of the rest of it.\n\n01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000\nAll right, what else do we have to do?\n\n01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000\nLet's just sign off and see people next week.\n\n01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000\nCan I please just, because people think I'm kidding, but I just got to...\n\n01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nWell, yeah, well, because I feel like, okay, just let me...\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000\nWell, talk about something.\n\n01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nBrandon, do you want to have children?\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nTalk about that for a second.\n\n01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000\nI do want to have children.\n\n01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000\nWhy don't you yet?\n\n01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000\nWhat's wrong?\n\n01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000\nI'm sure that I do somewhere.\n\n01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nEvery time I tape a TV show, I'm like, are you sure this is going to be on TV?\n\n01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000\nBecause my children will find me.\n\n01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000\nI don't have children because I date interracially.\n\n01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000\nWhat?\n\n01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000\nI just...\n\n01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000\nI don't want to do that to a white person's family.\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000\nOh, scary next tale.\n\n01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000\nA little bit of misogyny can be a fine time for an upstanding citizen.\n\n01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000\nBut our next story tells the cautionary tale of when race mixing goes wrong.\n\n01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:20.000\nJoin narrator, Brandon Johnson, for the story of how I fucked an Indian girl.\n\n01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000\nNo, that's...\n\n01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000\nWe didn't...\n\n01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000\nOkay, sorry.\n\n01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000\nWhat?\n\n01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000\nNo, you and children, sorry.\n\n01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000\nI didn't mean to...\n\n01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000\nYeah, why don't we just casually talk about me and my lack of children?\n\n01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000\nWe started with the cats.\n\n01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000\nOnce you get over two, you pretty much know it's not going to happen for you.\n\n01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000\nThere is that.\n\n01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000\nThere's also poverty.\n\n01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000\nThere's abject poverty.\n\n01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000\nI don't want to make more poor black people.\n\n01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000\nReally is the case.\n\n01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000\nSo I didn't have kids.\n\n01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000\nDid you find it yet?\n\n01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000\nDoesn't having kids seem like an irresponsible move right now?\n\n01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000\nBack in Sparta, it was probably a bad move to have a kid just to toss off a cliff.\n\n01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000\nIt feels like that.\n\n01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000\nIt does feel like that.\n\n01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000\nI would have kids, I think, that would be okay, but we'll never know.\n\n01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000\nSo a way to bring that down.\n\n01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000\nSparm doesn't seem to work.\n\n01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000\nI don't know if it's no internet or it's just things like that.\n\n01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:30.000\nDan has AT&T, and AT&T seems like it's even worse than Verizon in this exact location.\n\n01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000\nHowever, in some of their judgments, a really judicious company, I think that...\n\n01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000\nWe love the shows that they buy.\n\n01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000\nTheir recent purchase of the entire Turner Network.\n\n01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000\nYes.\n\n01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000\nOh, so wonderful.\n\n01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000\nWell, it's the widest network in the country.\n\n01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000\nThe conversion to headlines about pedophilia, I think, are a fantastic decision.\n\n01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:59.000\nI will exchange my fucking life and soul for whatever they want to go.\n\n01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.000\nThis next tale comes from a man trapped by his plans for retirement.\n\n01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000\nIn a tale called, Why the fuck is everyone bent out of shape about this?\n\n01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:20.000\nDidn't I come to this internet to do exactly this?\n\n01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000\nWait, why can't I just click on a thing and...\n\n01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000\nI'm not asking you guys that.\n\n01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000\nThat's what I want, I know.\n\n01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nIt's just...\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000\nAll right, whatever.\n\n01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000\nCanadian creepypasta.\n\n01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000\nPlease tune into creepypasta and tell us all goodnight.\n\n01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000\nThat is Harmontown.\n\n01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000\nWe miss you so much, Jeff Davis, wherever you are.\n\n01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:48.000\nShout out to Rob Schrab, Spencer Crittenden, Dan Harmon, and the food Chris Foreoff.\n\n01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000\nThank you.\n\n01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000\nJack McKeever, Sarah Hill.\n\n01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000\nThis has been the Dynasty Typewriter.\n\n01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000\nTuck your keys.\n\n01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000\nShots out to church.\n\n01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000\nWe love you all.\n\n01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:23.000\nGood night.\n\n01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000\nDid you get any of that?\n\n01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:32.000\nIt's a good show.\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[168348]}
