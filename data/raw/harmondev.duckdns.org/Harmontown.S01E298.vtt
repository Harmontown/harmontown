WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Goddamn right, how are you tonight?

00:12.720 --> 00:20.280
Hormontown is now in session, let me hear you at home.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.280
Make them jealous though.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
Yeah!

00:23.280 --> 00:28.320
We're so glad you're here, welcome to the Dynasty Typewriter, thank you so much for

00:28.320 --> 00:30.500
coming all the way downtown.

00:30.500 --> 00:35.800
Let me bring to the stage someone you know and love, Spencer Crittenden!

00:35.800 --> 00:43.520
He's no joke, Game Master Jordanair.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.520
Coming back from his sold out all over the city tour, from place to place, but mostly

00:48.520 --> 00:52.400
his couch, the mayor of Hormontown, Dan Hormont!

00:52.400 --> 01:01.000
I am your Comptroller, my name is Brandon Johnson, have a good night.

01:01.000 --> 01:11.760
Yeah, yeah, hip, yo, hip, hop, yo, hip, hop, got the rhythm, got the soul, got your mama's

01:11.760 --> 01:20.240
pussy in a bowl, pouring it like cereal, and now out, I'm going out to rock and roll.

01:20.240 --> 01:26.360
I fucked your daddy too, gender equality, whatcha gonna do, here's some gender fluidity,

01:26.360 --> 01:30.840
I fucked your sister, even though next week she's gonna be a mister.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.840
A family treat!

01:32.840 --> 01:37.360
So that was my pitch for gender equality, but it turned into like a classic, like kind

01:37.360 --> 01:40.720
of tranny joke from the 90s.

01:40.720 --> 01:45.360
You played yourself!

01:45.360 --> 01:49.560
I think everybody should be able to say whatever the fuck they, whoever they are, I don't care,

01:49.560 --> 01:52.000
I don't care anymore.

01:52.000 --> 02:00.800
I'm listening to this book on tape, Sapiens, let me, thank you, I'm assuming that was for

02:00.800 --> 02:02.960
the author and he can't be here.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.960
Or just Homo Sapiens?

02:03.960 --> 02:05.480
Right, that's what I thought.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.200
Well that's the interesting thing, I was kind of afraid to go get back into anthropology

02:10.200 --> 02:15.960
because I think the last book I read on anthropology was like a 1967 book, The Naked Ape by Desmond

02:15.960 --> 02:20.800
Morris and I think like, I've always been kind of an armchair anthropology fan, but

02:20.800 --> 02:24.440
it's different from being passionate about anthropology because those people read stuff

02:24.440 --> 02:31.000
and learn stuff, but the thing is anthropology is like a real loaded gun, like it's just

02:31.000 --> 02:38.400
filled with like, the can just says flavor, it doesn't say what flavor, it may not comfort

02:38.400 --> 02:42.960
you, like an anthropologist may say things like this guy at one point is riffing and

02:42.960 --> 02:48.480
just says like, well actually brain size has decreased since the days of foraging because

02:48.480 --> 02:53.480
humanity's ability to create culture made room for an imbecile class, and you're just

02:53.480 --> 02:57.760
like, whoa, what the, what?

02:57.760 --> 03:04.320
And it's like a, you know, like, whoa, loaded gun, baby.

03:04.320 --> 03:09.920
But yeah, you know, things like before we were agrarian and when every single person,

03:09.920 --> 03:14.200
like, like basically when you couldn't, everyone was just running around like, oh, there's

03:14.200 --> 03:16.680
a mushroom, I guess I'll live for another hour.

03:16.680 --> 03:21.200
There's a, there's a frog, there's a, there's a, there's a piece of bacon, I don't know

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
how bacon works.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.960
It must come from some plant or something, right?

03:26.960 --> 03:33.200
Foraging gives you all this nutritional variety and it like, it also demands this incredible

03:33.200 --> 03:35.080
versatility in your brain.

03:35.080 --> 03:40.480
And so he was talking about how this idea of like, look, if you're like, the whole,

03:40.480 --> 03:44.640
the whole books, I haven't even scratched the surface yet, but the book seems to start

03:44.640 --> 03:50.000
to tell the story of how, all right, what is it that made human beings like ravage the

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
earth?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.760
Like, why are we the, the human species of which there are at least like six or so that

03:57.760 --> 04:02.600
have walked the earth, many of whom at the same time, like Homo erectus, Neanderthals,

04:02.600 --> 04:03.600
all that stuff.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
You've heard of that before.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.680
Like, like, we're, we're, we're, we're not only cut, we're cousins with gorillas and

04:08.680 --> 04:13.640
chimps and orangutans, but we're, we have siblings that are gone and their blood is

04:13.640 --> 04:14.640
on our hands.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.280
Like, like, and that's actually weird.

04:18.280 --> 04:21.920
There's a million kinds of fox, there's a million kinds of bear.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.520
There's only one kind of human and it's not because they all don't work.

04:26.520 --> 04:31.760
Like there's room for a lot of kind of bear and it's like, oh, like one species of human

04:31.760 --> 04:36.080
Homo sapien, as opposed to Homo erectus, which I always thought was like, I always thought

04:36.080 --> 04:37.600
there was like that, you know, lineage.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.320
I thought Neanderthals died out because they were dumb.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.320
But they're not.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.320
I mean, they were dumb in certain ways.

04:42.320 --> 04:47.120
I think that we used to think that they didn't simultaneously exist on the earth and that

04:47.120 --> 04:51.080
chain, that understanding has changed such that we think that probably three or four

04:51.080 --> 04:53.440
were kind of hanging out at the same time, right?

04:53.440 --> 05:01.200
There was a, there was, there was at least a half a dozen Homo, a human, human species.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
Which is new now.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.400
So Homo erectus is a completely different species from us.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.240
I like Homo habilis.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.200
They, first of all, use the example of like horses and donkeys.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.220
So horses and donkeys are separate species, but they can mate.

05:16.220 --> 05:20.240
So they, you know, they talk about, well, we, we may have mated with Neanderthals.

05:20.240 --> 05:25.560
Like there's that idea of you have one percent Neanderthal in your genes and stuff, but horses

05:25.560 --> 05:30.080
don't really, donkeys and horses, they're not, it's not the first thing that would come

05:30.080 --> 05:32.560
into their head if you put them in a pen together.

05:32.560 --> 05:38.720
You have to get aggressive about, it's suggesting that they do it or, or the, or the horse has

05:38.720 --> 05:43.480
to be, you know, have issues that demand, that it's more about anger than I don't know

05:43.480 --> 05:44.480
what.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.440
But, and ultimately they produce an offspring that's not even fertile.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.480
And then you take like, but that's different from like, like, like there's a million kinds

05:51.480 --> 05:54.480
of dog, but they're all the same species because they happily, like you put them in a room

05:54.480 --> 05:58.400
together, you go away, you have a popsicle, you come back, you get fucking weird ass and

05:58.400 --> 06:03.080
a boxer and it's looking, it's shaped like a slinky.

06:03.080 --> 06:11.040
We, we, we, we had, we, we walked this earth like, with all these different like specialized

06:11.040 --> 06:13.600
brands of human.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.000
Homo erectus was like really good at making tools.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.280
So good at making tools that it's all they fucking did.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.880
It was in their genes to make tools.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.060
The way when you throw a ball, your golden retriever like knows how to do something better

06:27.060 --> 06:31.880
than like maybe your mutt or your, or, or, or like a bull or like a Jack Russell who's

06:31.880 --> 06:32.880
like, well, that's not a mouse.

06:32.880 --> 06:38.120
So I'm going to stare at the electrical outlet and lick your face until you have no more

06:38.120 --> 06:41.320
friends coming over.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.880
Jack Russell's are the worst.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.920
But you have to like respect them because you're like, you were mentally ill.

06:46.920 --> 06:51.480
Like, if you know anything about mental illness and you meet a Jack Russell, you, you're just

06:51.480 --> 06:52.680
like, I can't judge you.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.680
You're clearly sick.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.280
You have a sickness that's been bred into you.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.680
Terrier by some person who wanted less rats.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.680
That's not cool.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.600
The dog is like, we just stare at the corner of a coffee table because they think it might

07:03.600 --> 07:07.360
turn into a mouse one day.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.360
They're insane.

07:08.360 --> 07:14.640
Anyways, but, but, sorry, but, but, but, but Homo erectus, like we, is it like, okay,

07:14.640 --> 07:18.440
they made like these flint tools or they, they have these tools, but they actually like

07:18.440 --> 07:20.360
kind of like it was bred into them.

07:20.360 --> 07:26.560
They walked to the earth for two million years making these dumb ass tools.

07:26.560 --> 07:33.640
They never turned that into making tool tools or tool, tool, tool tools, which we are good

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
at.

07:34.640 --> 07:39.920
Homo sapiens, the book implies, now I'm, I'm, I'm extrapolating a lot for listening for

07:39.920 --> 07:45.680
an hour and a half car ride to this book that's like, it's a 15 hour book.

07:45.680 --> 07:52.400
And I heard someone wrote it down somewhere and you could, with the eyeballs, but, but

07:52.400 --> 07:55.640
the implication is that it's like, we're no better or no worse.

07:55.640 --> 08:01.840
Like, it's like, like brain size, whatever, like, like, if, if truly if brain size and

08:01.840 --> 08:08.600
like, like, if it was just raw intelligence that like made you dominate the earth, of

08:08.600 --> 08:14.400
course by now there would have been ants with giant heads or he doesn't say that because

08:14.400 --> 08:18.880
he's a scientist and you debunk that I'm making that up, but there'd be like dogs or something

08:18.880 --> 08:21.680
that would be like, like, it would just be like the thing that you always go to.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.440
We kind of have that mythology in our heads, literally that, that, that, that it's like,

08:26.440 --> 08:29.160
oh, it's all about that brain, you got to get to that brain.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.280
But the brain is like really hit or miss as an evolutionary trait.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.000
It was like just betting double zero on a roulette.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
Even that's a miss, misconstruer as coined it.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.800
He said a misconstruer the other day really made me misconstrue some stuff.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.800
Just talk.

08:47.800 --> 08:56.360
All right, sapiens like are different.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.600
The thing that separated us out.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
So get this.

08:59.600 --> 09:04.360
This is, this is the uplifting thing slash biggest bummer in the fucking world.

09:04.360 --> 09:10.400
This guy implies that the reason why we ended up wiping everybody out, whether that meant

09:10.400 --> 09:19.680
fucking them and absorbing them and or eating them out hunting them, just, just, just making

09:19.680 --> 09:25.880
them feel unwelcome until they, they deleted their Neanderthal accounts and like went away

09:25.880 --> 09:29.080
because they're like, I don't like where this is going.

09:29.080 --> 09:33.640
If this is what it takes to survive, I'm going to go have a giant brain and live in the pine

09:33.640 --> 09:36.000
trees and fucking go to sleep.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.480
That's what happened to Homo habilis.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.040
Wait, which one is habilis, is that?

09:41.040 --> 09:49.720
They were excellent listeners.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.720
It was great.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.720
It was great.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
It just didn't win the war.

09:52.720 --> 10:01.160
It was a good skill to have at the time, but didn't win a lot of contests.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.160
They won a few important contests.

10:03.160 --> 10:11.160
Right, but they lost the tell me more passive aggressive wars of 30 million BC when the

10:11.160 --> 10:13.560
Cro-Magnons eventually said, go on.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.400
And they were like, I'm out.

10:16.400 --> 10:27.640
But the idea put forth in this book is that what we are good at, all of us, is the cynical

10:27.640 --> 10:35.280
would call it lying, which is not, it's not unique to us, a primate lie.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.280
Primate lie.

10:37.280 --> 10:43.320
Don't let me stop you.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.920
The writers among us, if that we're interested in justifying our jobs or getting through

10:47.920 --> 10:52.000
tomorrow with a spring under step would say, we'd call it mythology, that's what we're

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
good at.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.640
A corporate lawyer would call it the ability to handle a contract, essentially it's all

10:59.640 --> 11:06.120
the same thing, basically what sapiens are good at that gets us past the topping out

11:06.120 --> 11:10.840
point of primate sophistication, which tops out, as all of us who have ever watched a

11:10.840 --> 11:16.560
sitcom or hung out in a room this size know, it tops out at 100 primates.

11:16.560 --> 11:20.480
Your ability to function as a group, nobody in here, there's no cops in here, but if somebody

11:20.480 --> 11:26.880
jumped up and was like, hail Satan, we'd get confused and we'd eventually figure out

11:26.880 --> 11:30.280
what to do, but it probably won't happen because there's 100 of us.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.800
If there are 1,000 of us, there's going to be 10 people going, hail Satan, and they're

11:33.800 --> 11:37.040
going to get lost in the, they're going to actually be encouraged by the fact that there's

11:37.040 --> 11:42.640
1,000 people to, and also we're all going to start going, that's someone else's problem,

11:42.640 --> 11:44.760
chaos, chaos.

11:44.760 --> 11:50.720
So what we, that's where a neanderthal can't handle it, like 500 neanderthals, they can't

11:50.720 --> 11:57.360
do anything, 500 homo erectus, sapiens perfected the art of, like we have the lobes in our

11:57.360 --> 12:02.240
brain necessary to believe in shit that ain't real.

12:02.240 --> 12:09.520
We were able to watch Seinfeld and hear 100 people and pretend that those 100 people represent

12:09.520 --> 12:14.680
a million people and just go, oh, Seinfeld's great, even though Seinfeld didn't come over

12:14.680 --> 12:18.640
to my house and tell me he's going to help me out tomorrow.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.400
But I'm in Seinfeld's corner, like Seinfeld's a flag, Seinfeld's a religion, Seinfeld's

12:23.400 --> 12:30.120
a meme, Seinfeld's a, it's symbolism, it's this idea, we can create like a connectivity

12:30.120 --> 12:36.360
between strangers that will never meet each other to Serbians that will never meet, can

12:36.360 --> 12:42.840
both have been taught from childhood about the importance of being a Serb and identify

12:42.840 --> 12:48.280
that with a flag and they'll see the right flag on each other's arm patch or whatever

12:48.280 --> 12:53.280
in the middle of a situation, somebody might take a bullet for somebody else, chimpanzees

12:53.280 --> 12:59.440
can't do that, you can't, like no other even human species, all of which are now extinct

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
can do that.

13:00.440 --> 13:06.480
So we basically, it's kind of, it's a bummer, a little bit of a bummer, this is what we're

13:06.480 --> 13:11.120
good at, this is why we're here, we're good at this giant mess that we've created, that's

13:11.120 --> 13:12.120
what we're good at.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.680
So you're saying we're the first monkeys with imagination?

13:15.680 --> 13:19.520
That's too fucking beautiful, that's too poetic.

13:19.520 --> 13:27.840
But yeah, I guess that, we're the first human species, the first Homo, in the Homo genus,

13:27.840 --> 13:37.920
we're the ones that got really good at sharing ideas that never have to be true, that can

13:37.920 --> 13:44.400
be so, things that never have to be concretized but can be the most important thing in the

13:44.400 --> 13:45.400
world.

13:45.400 --> 13:56.920
The ability to wake up in bed and say, because I am blank, a member of an invisible tribe,

13:56.920 --> 14:09.160
a corporation, a country, a fandom, a political leaning, a gender, a race, a type of person.

14:09.160 --> 14:16.720
Because I am a quality of life person, because I am there, I'm going to do this today and

14:16.720 --> 14:20.680
it will actually supersede things that for other primates and even other human species

14:20.680 --> 14:26.160
that are now extinct, they would be like, I'm not going to harvest corn based on, what

14:26.160 --> 14:28.400
did you say, Mickey Mouse exists?

14:28.400 --> 14:32.680
I don't do it, and then they starve, and then the people that believe in Mickey Mouse come

14:32.680 --> 14:37.560
over the hills and they say, how are they having 800,000 people with spears, I give

14:37.560 --> 14:40.240
up, I give up, take me to jail.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.160
Or teach me to learn about corn.

14:43.160 --> 14:50.200
Or if you can reproduce with me, I mean, they're done, these people, they're done, the ones

14:50.200 --> 14:55.160
that are like, their children are being raised in this environment of like, no, it's called

14:55.160 --> 14:59.360
culture, it's called mythology, it's called religion, it's called lies, it's called, depending

14:59.360 --> 15:03.040
on what mood you're in, it's called all kinds of things, but it's basically like, the fact

15:03.040 --> 15:08.600
that we can sustain a life based on nothing, based on no, like, and we sometimes get frustrated

15:08.600 --> 15:11.680
by that and go like, God damn it, you know, you're getting that fight club red pill mood

15:11.680 --> 15:15.920
and you go, Jesus Christ, well, this fucking fact is, I've got a big set of balls full

15:15.920 --> 15:19.960
of comb and if I wanted to, I could fuck this fucking whole dollar store into fucking,

15:19.960 --> 15:25.000
I could make it a whole pregnant, yeah, I'm going to, who hasn't said that?

15:25.000 --> 15:29.480
I mean, you could and you couldn't, you could, if you could somehow figure out a way to hack

15:29.480 --> 15:37.120
symbology and mythology to reduce all of civilization to a basically non-sapien mindset, like, you

15:37.120 --> 15:41.640
could turn us into animals again, like, you know, we're the only species that has the

15:41.640 --> 15:44.480
power to do that, we have a self-destruct mechanism.

15:44.480 --> 15:49.240
I was thinking that, like, this is like a meditation I've had on murder, like, we can't,

15:49.240 --> 15:53.880
like, I've had a lot of meditations on murder, I'll be, do some shows.

15:53.880 --> 15:58.080
Oh, Habilis is also famous for that, for suppressing their murder meditations.

15:58.080 --> 16:03.880
They love suppressing violence, no, but, like, just one of the humans, obviously, they kill

16:03.880 --> 16:09.840
people, but at the same time, like, you can't kill someone in existent society, so, like,

16:09.840 --> 16:15.400
we have to be able to turn people into killers and then also turn them back from killers

16:15.400 --> 16:19.880
into normal people who can, like, function in society, because otherwise, anytime someone

16:19.880 --> 16:24.640
would kill, they would become, like, essentially an unhinged zombie monster, you know, like,

16:24.640 --> 16:28.360
the fact that you can have their regret is, like, this weird thing, but what that means

16:28.360 --> 16:34.880
is that we can use words and ideas to work ourselves into a literally a lethal frenzy

16:34.880 --> 16:39.240
that's only a temporary state of hypnosis that renders us capable of doing things we're

16:39.240 --> 16:44.600
not normally capable of and wouldn't be capable of if we weren't conceiving of this construct

16:44.600 --> 16:49.200
that we invented in our minds, and, like, that is, like, it's a very human thing, but

16:49.200 --> 16:53.640
that's, like, it's very crazy, because otherwise, you know, if that didn't exist, then all of

16:53.640 --> 16:57.720
society would break down, but because that exists, like, sociopaths exist, kind of.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
I don't know.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.720
It's really fucked up and scary.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
Yeah.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.720
Yeah.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.720
We all live a lie.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.640
I mean, it's like when you examine currency and you go, like, well, the dollar's backed

17:06.640 --> 17:13.200
by nothing or whatever, like, like, everything is a lie, I mean, why are we, yeah, anything

17:13.200 --> 17:19.120
that goes beyond any Charles Manson level, like, like, that's why I think we're, we're

17:19.120 --> 17:24.080
fascinated with mob mythology or, you know, organized crime stuff is because there's a

17:24.080 --> 17:28.000
tribal mindset there, and actually things actually start clicking for us.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.280
When we watch the Sopranos and we go, I get it, Pauline Walnuts can't tell Lieutenant

17:32.280 --> 17:36.080
Peck or Pickle what to do.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.840
I don't have to have a memory, I have imagination.

17:39.840 --> 17:46.200
Anyways, let's bring out, that's why tonight's show is all based in anthropology, we've got

17:46.200 --> 17:51.680
only the most top qualified experts, I've planned this out, the show is meticulously

17:51.680 --> 17:57.200
planned and scheduled, I've got the perfect guests, let's first bring out Coco the Gorilla.

17:57.200 --> 18:01.080
Oh, poor Harambe's wife.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.080
Too soon.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.080
Too soon.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.080
I guess we'll bring out Jeff Davis first.

18:04.080 --> 18:14.600
Jeff Davis, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis, Jeff Davis extraordinaire, extraordinaire.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.800
He could have been anywhere in the world tonight, ladies and gentlemen, but he chose to be

18:17.800 --> 18:18.800
here.

18:18.800 --> 18:19.800
Jeff Davis.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.800
Schrab-involved visual bit.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
Hard to explain.

18:23.800 --> 18:28.280
Well, they both did a bit, like, it made me feel like, it feels like the Milwaukee public

18:28.280 --> 18:35.000
zoo and you're like waiting for the, the lions to come out in the winter, let you go to

18:35.000 --> 18:37.560
the zoo and you're like, how come the lions aren't out?

18:37.560 --> 18:40.800
Because you're, are you freezing your ass off?

18:40.800 --> 18:44.320
They're in the tiny heated room eating hay.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.320
But they're lions.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.320
That's how cold they are.

18:46.320 --> 18:51.440
I don't know that I would compare these motherfuckers to lions, but...

18:51.440 --> 18:53.440
Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Davis.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.440
See?

18:54.440 --> 18:58.440
No, it's coming out now.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
See?

18:59.440 --> 19:00.440
See?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.440
Because a lion would have come out.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
This is a bluff.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.440
I'm happy to call it.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.440
All right.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.440
They picked me on the wrong night, man.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.440
I'll do a hug.

19:06.440 --> 19:17.120
I know, you do, you do have enough in you, I feel like, to talk about without these dudes.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
Yeah.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
All right.

19:19.120 --> 19:24.480
Another thing about those humans and our ability to create murder and stuff.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.720
I think someone almost just got shot by a microphone accessory.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.720
What was that?

19:28.720 --> 19:32.920
I pulled on the mic cord and then a piece of plastic shot out and almost hit that dude

19:32.920 --> 19:35.040
in the face.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.160
Just toss it up here.

19:36.160 --> 19:41.600
And I will do it again.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.120
You ever asked for someone to toss you something and just let it land?

19:45.120 --> 19:46.120
Yeah.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.440
It's one of the coolest fucking moves.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.680
I'm going to tell you right now that shit was a preemptive strike.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.720
I was like, that dude needs a piece of this microphone.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.720
Thank you for your help.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.720
So much help.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.720
Thank you.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.720
Sarcasm.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.720
God damn it.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.360
I did a lot of driving with Cody.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.320
Yeah, I'll tell you another, a book we listened to, another book on tape, Elizabeth Smart's

20:07.320 --> 20:09.840
story, her autobiography.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.840
Remember her?

20:10.840 --> 20:11.840
Do you know who Elizabeth Smart is?

20:11.840 --> 20:12.840
Are you two young?

20:12.840 --> 20:13.840
She was a true crime person.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.840
Yeah.

20:14.840 --> 20:15.840
Yeah.

20:15.840 --> 20:16.840
I don't, I don't follow those stories.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
Well, I don't remember the stories.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.840
I follow them like when they happen.

20:18.840 --> 20:23.280
I remember the story, I can't remember what, now I can't remember what year it was when

20:23.280 --> 20:24.280
it happened.

20:24.280 --> 20:28.920
But I do, I was fascinated with the story because I remember she, it became a story

20:28.920 --> 20:29.920
because she had returned.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.920
Yeah.

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
It was like a big thing.

20:31.920 --> 20:38.760
I vaguely remember that the vagaries and the weird insinuations or questions, it was sort

20:38.760 --> 20:44.560
of like, my consciousness was like, oh, is that that girl that got abducted?

20:44.560 --> 20:49.480
But she got abducted by a guy that may or may not have, you know, it was like the press

20:49.480 --> 20:52.440
was like, oh, she's back, but she may not have been abducted.

20:52.440 --> 20:56.760
Maybe she, it was like, it was like, it was like, so it was really like therapeutic to

20:56.760 --> 21:03.920
listen to her, her book because it was like, oh God, like ridiculous, like the narrative

21:03.920 --> 21:06.520
of, yeah, of course you're not going to get that right.

21:06.520 --> 21:13.840
Like, this guy just like came into her room, she was 14 years old, he's got a fucking

21:13.840 --> 21:17.960
buoy knife and he's like, get up and get out of bed and come with me.

21:17.960 --> 21:23.720
And it's like, it's this crazy experiment and like, what if you were a good girl and

21:23.720 --> 21:28.560
you just didn't, like, what if you just didn't want your family to get hurt and what if you

21:28.560 --> 21:34.960
just always, what if you just kept doing what you thought was the smartest, healthiest spiritual

21:34.960 --> 21:35.960
thing to do?

21:35.960 --> 21:40.080
And the answer is this fucking creep who actually turns out to be like the three stooges of

21:40.080 --> 21:45.800
Charles Manson's, like, it's actually kind of a, you know, if you detach yourself from

21:45.800 --> 21:52.040
her plight, like the guy emerges as a sort of comedic character because he keeps, while

21:52.040 --> 21:58.520
he's with her, he takes her, he takes her, like, out of her house and like, walks with

21:58.520 --> 22:04.440
her through thistles and brambles for seven hours where he's got a camp set up where he

22:04.440 --> 22:09.280
does the things that you would be afraid that he would do, it's all there and it's all in

22:09.280 --> 22:13.400
his head, it's all about, oh, he's a prophet and he needs a new wife and all this shit.

22:13.400 --> 22:21.760
But, you know, and she goes there tastefully but also like, she's really very healthy,

22:21.760 --> 22:26.600
she's 25 at the time she's writing the book and it's very healthy, very inspiring how,

22:26.600 --> 22:31.920
like, fucking, like, she's just like, yeah, then that happened and like, it's odd, it's

22:31.920 --> 22:32.920
honestly odd.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.400
I think she's Mormon too, right?

22:34.400 --> 22:39.400
I think so, and that is true that when they found her, she wasn't resistant, it wasn't

22:39.400 --> 22:44.400
that she, it wasn't that she was complacent about being there.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.040
There's these moments that we don't understand in the story where, like, there's a cop that

22:48.040 --> 22:54.440
comes up in the public library and she's sitting there and she's like, the cop is like, tell

22:54.440 --> 22:59.880
me your name and there, and like, she, we just use logic to go, oh, well, of course,

22:59.880 --> 23:05.200
now is the time to do this, but it's like, she's abused and she's terrified.

23:05.200 --> 23:09.480
The interesting thing about her book is that she swears, like, she's very adamant about

23:09.480 --> 23:13.240
the fact that this is different from Stockholm syndrome, like, and she's trying to make the

23:13.240 --> 23:18.840
point, she's a victim's rights advocate now, and she's like very, very adamant about this,

23:18.840 --> 23:21.360
which I think is just incredibly interesting.

23:21.360 --> 23:25.000
If I thought I was a good interviewer at all, and I didn't think that I was going to like,

23:25.000 --> 23:30.040
like, I was such an interesting person to talk to, but I would never want to go near

23:30.040 --> 23:35.360
somebody that I could ever, like, accidentally hurt with my insensitivity, but she just seems

23:35.360 --> 23:40.320
so fucking robust and so great, greatest revenge.

23:40.320 --> 23:43.560
But she's like, she's like, I was never, it's not Stockholm, it's like, I never had

23:43.560 --> 23:45.680
empathy for this fucking dunce.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.520
I think she makes fun of him for the whole book, and it's like, I was just, I took him

23:49.520 --> 23:53.920
at his word, I was 14, and he was the guy with the knife, and he kept saying over and

23:53.920 --> 24:10.920
over again, if this ever ends...

24:10.920 --> 24:13.680
Just ignore it.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.680
Trying to tell you about a horrible abduction that lasted a year.

24:17.680 --> 24:24.320
But I took him at his word that if this ever ends, and it's at all your fault, like, if

24:24.320 --> 24:30.480
you ever drop the dime on me, you know, like, I will figure out a way to kill your family,

24:30.480 --> 24:34.440
I'll kill your little brother, you know, just over and over again telling her that.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.000
So that's what she's experiencing in these moments when people are coming up to her and

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
going, hey, are you this kidnapped girl?

24:41.000 --> 24:48.520
And she's like, she's screaming in her head, don't involve me in this shit, fucking save

24:48.520 --> 24:49.520
me.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.520
It's very interesting.

24:50.520 --> 24:56.400
It's also a little bit of a backstory, perhaps, about the community that she was raised in

24:56.400 --> 25:02.960
and the fact that if you are already mildly abused, or if you've already been in a society

25:02.960 --> 25:07.480
that denigrates women, when someone comes to abduct you, you may play along.

25:07.480 --> 25:17.480
Yeah, I mean, her advocacy afterwards sounds like it's a brand to do that.

25:17.480 --> 25:27.040
Now, you know, it's a throw, it's a throw.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.520
I'm proud of you guys.

25:28.520 --> 25:35.640
That was a good taper, like, obviously we can't coordinate total silence.

25:35.640 --> 25:40.480
And you know, some of you come here because you hate me, but if you want to make me fucking

25:40.480 --> 25:49.240
proud, let them stew and just try as hard as you can, just fucking abject silence.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.040
They really should have to work for your love at this point.

25:52.040 --> 25:57.600
But don't do it because you think, oh, you want me to win.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.680
I know you love them.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.200
If you love them, teach them a lesson.

26:02.200 --> 26:07.080
Teach them a lesson about stagecraft and respect.

26:07.080 --> 26:12.080
Now, back to Elizabeth Smart.

26:12.080 --> 26:16.680
But I really want to address that because it's like, I mean, that's the thing is like,

26:16.680 --> 26:20.640
I believe her family was Mormon, but it's noteworthy that you wouldn't know that from reading the

26:20.640 --> 26:24.440
book because I think her faith, you know, she was never like, well, because of my magic

26:24.440 --> 26:26.680
underwear, it was protected or all this stuff.

26:26.680 --> 26:31.560
It's very clear that the dude is Mormon, that the psycho is Mormon, and that he's abusing

26:31.560 --> 26:35.000
all these tenets of Mormonism that he's twisted it.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.880
The only thing that's clear with her is that she's basically like the American goal.

26:39.880 --> 26:44.840
I think that's what's important is that we think, oh, we want our 14-year-old daughters

26:44.840 --> 26:52.360
to be unsoiled and never have had any thoughts into their head.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.680
It's sort of an interesting kind of Christ myth when you're listening to it because you're

26:56.680 --> 27:02.680
like, well, this is supposedly the American dream as far as what you want your family

27:02.680 --> 27:08.080
to have this white picket fence and all these things, and it's like, there is this thought

27:08.080 --> 27:15.800
in your head that goes like, well, and then she's so pure and modest and humble and so

27:15.800 --> 27:26.960
that this doofus who has no right, he doesn't, he's exploiting it.

27:26.960 --> 27:32.440
She doesn't know she's being exploited and she's not, yeah, it's a real roller coaster

27:32.440 --> 27:37.160
that you go through when you're listening to the story, which I kind of, it was kind

27:37.160 --> 27:40.680
of eye-opening to me because the other half of the time all you're thinking is as in that

27:40.680 --> 27:45.600
South Park episode where they meet the Mormon, it's like the other half of the time you're

27:45.600 --> 27:49.120
going, Jesus Christ, I've got to convert to this fucking religion because this is some

27:49.120 --> 27:55.200
powerful shit, like this girl survived some crazy shit and it was specifically because

27:55.200 --> 27:57.600
of her faith.

27:57.600 --> 28:03.360
These brand names get us fucked up, Christianity, Catholicism, the names get us fucked up.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.800
Yeah, her faith is a thing that...

28:05.800 --> 28:09.000
She thought that there was a God with her the whole time and she's not shoving that

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
down your throat in case you want to listen to the book, it's not like she's selling that

28:13.000 --> 28:20.600
to you, but she uses the force a couple times in the story and she doesn't, she's not obnoxious

28:20.600 --> 28:21.600
about it.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.000
I think it's really interesting, it's also, she narrates her own audio book which is like

28:25.000 --> 28:31.720
cool because she's like sort of like, it's like amateur, like she's like, her inflection

28:31.720 --> 28:37.040
is like, this is the real person and she's like, I didn't know, she's describing this

28:37.040 --> 28:42.000
like doofus going like, today I'm gonna, she's like mocking him with her voice and then

28:42.000 --> 28:46.480
he came back to her, well I just decided that God wants me to do this and I'm like, all

28:46.480 --> 28:47.480
right, whatever.

28:47.480 --> 28:55.000
You're trying to tell me that Selena Gomez could play this role.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.760
I think the feeling that left me when I'm net positive was like, wow, you could be a

28:59.760 --> 29:04.360
14 year old girl and have the worst possible fucking thing happen to you for a year of

29:04.360 --> 29:11.480
your life and you could emerge, she was like, she's just a regular person and she actually

29:11.480 --> 29:15.600
keeps pointing out, she's like, actually, she doesn't want to say, I'm glad this happened,

29:15.600 --> 29:20.400
but she's like, I'm grateful for, she's like, if it hadn't happened, what would I be?

29:20.400 --> 29:23.320
Some schnook that doesn't know how bad it can get?

29:23.320 --> 29:27.920
Also, statistically, she's very lucky to be alive.

29:27.920 --> 29:36.000
So, as far as, yeah, the percentage of people who have had a dude come into their bedroom

29:36.000 --> 29:45.960
with a knife, yeah, she's one of the, it's a pretty short book, it's kind of interesting.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.520
It's such a weird, it's like the three stooges of abductions.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.880
And it is inspirational because somebody actually lived through it.

29:52.880 --> 29:59.080
Because of her, because it's inspirational because she's like, yeah, she's on her own

29:59.080 --> 30:05.320
and she just survives and it's a bummer, a culture where survival is the new success,

30:05.320 --> 30:11.760
but sometimes that's the thing you need to remind yourself of, I guess, I don't know.

30:11.760 --> 30:20.040
My personal journey has gone from, I am happy in spite of you, you being you, listening,

30:20.040 --> 30:23.400
and I crossed a threshold at a certain point and I am happy because of you and that was

30:23.400 --> 30:26.440
glorious, that was great.

30:26.440 --> 30:34.680
And I am now entering my third active, I am now again happy in spite of you.

30:34.680 --> 30:39.960
And I know that if you are a fan of mine, you don't blame me for that and that's why

30:39.960 --> 30:47.560
I love you, but like, I can't keep coming to you for happiness, I gotta be 45 years

30:47.560 --> 30:50.080
old and be like, here's how you're happy.

30:50.080 --> 30:57.520
If a 14 year old girl can do that in a fucking tent where she's actually being like, I really

30:57.520 --> 31:06.120
feel you truly believed that everyone should feel that way.

31:06.120 --> 31:12.480
That was true belief applause, that was not, that was not like Beastie Boy's irony generation

31:12.480 --> 31:13.480
applause.

31:13.480 --> 31:20.040
I am shocked that you all did not help your boy out.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.040
But don't feel shame because you're fine the way you are.

31:23.040 --> 31:28.680
Next time sit at the back of the house, then they'll all hear and be like, if you do it

31:28.680 --> 31:34.560
down front, people are like, look at this dumb motherfucker.

31:34.560 --> 31:39.440
He was the one who was like excited that you were embracing internal forms of motivation

31:39.440 --> 31:44.000
and everyone else like they didn't clap at all because they weren't similarly internally

31:44.000 --> 31:46.400
motivated to clap.

31:46.400 --> 31:51.360
You know, it does make you internally motivated to clap, me undies.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.960
Would you be wearing me undies this evening?

31:53.960 --> 31:54.960
Oh, of course.

31:54.960 --> 32:01.440
I've been wearing them like much like first class travel, I have never gone back.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.920
Is it the softness or the fit?

32:03.920 --> 32:06.440
It's the cockpit.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.480
They should call it the cockpit.

32:09.480 --> 32:16.320
They could call it me undies if you're listening, the cockpit, the diamond pouch, call it the

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
cockpit.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.480
It's good.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.080
I'm wearing them right now.

32:20.080 --> 32:24.960
I've never worn them before today and I'm wearing them on my body and I got to tell

32:24.960 --> 32:29.040
you, it feels like I'm wearing nothing at all.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.040
Nothing at all.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.040
I'd be interested to talk to it.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.040
Nothing at all.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.040
What did you think?

32:34.040 --> 32:39.760
Why don't you like to meet a person that had tried me undies and then was like, no, I'm

32:39.760 --> 32:44.720
going back to regular, what kind of monster is that?

32:44.720 --> 32:51.120
A person who doesn't like just the right amount of support and comfort.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.800
The kind of person who says caviar is too salty.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.800
We're not even going to look back.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.680
We're not even going to look behind us.

32:57.680 --> 33:01.680
And we don't need to because coming through the house.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.680
Whoa.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.800
Now they're coming in from the back.

33:05.800 --> 33:06.800
So proud of you.

33:06.800 --> 33:07.800
So proud of you.

33:07.800 --> 33:08.800
Which is impossible to do.

33:08.800 --> 33:14.800
This is actually really good job guys.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.800
Oh, you broke at the end.

33:18.800 --> 33:23.800
You held out for a while.

33:23.800 --> 33:28.800
I'm sorry.

33:28.800 --> 33:37.800
This is why you can subscribe to the Harmontown feed and see what's happening because it's

33:37.800 --> 33:41.800
like, this is why they're not trustworthy.

33:41.800 --> 33:52.200
No, but these guys, I mean, when I said don't clap, you guys, that was amazing.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.480
Yeah, you did so much better.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.360
I was the first one to cry uncle.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.320
I was like, oh, that feels so harsh.

33:59.320 --> 34:06.400
Like the music started and I was like, well, why aren't you, oh, oh, right.

34:06.400 --> 34:11.520
And you guys are like, no, we're fucking like, it was like, wow, that is, that's homo sapiens.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.480
That's how we beat the Neanderthals.

34:13.480 --> 34:21.920
That's also, also children of divorce because they were like, I know how to be pit against

34:21.920 --> 34:24.520
another adult.

34:24.520 --> 34:30.800
I want to, I want to watch any tree fall hand me an axe.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.760
My joy comes from the two damage to submit.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.760
We can't conform.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.760
We're freaking out.

34:38.760 --> 34:45.240
Yeah, I can't wait to, I can't wait to hear the rest of that, that, that sapiens book.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.120
Do you want to talk about the dog door?

34:47.120 --> 34:50.680
Yeah, because I didn't want to talk about it for a while.

34:50.680 --> 34:55.200
Well, it was going on just because I didn't want to advertise that my house had a malfunctioning

34:55.200 --> 34:56.720
dog door out of any kind.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.720
Right.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.720
Because I didn't want people to be like, some guys like sharpening his knife on a whetstone.

35:01.720 --> 35:06.480
And he's like, did you hear episode three 21?

35:06.480 --> 35:11.640
He says the back door has a piece of plexiglass on it that keeps coming up every time the dog

35:11.640 --> 35:12.720
comes near it.

35:12.720 --> 35:17.760
And then, and they just have all these posters of me on the wall with like the eyes cut out.

35:17.760 --> 35:24.520
Try not to, try not to hit his garage this time.

35:24.520 --> 35:28.960
But now that, now the old, the old doors back installed and I, I don't know.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.120
I thought it was such a funny.

35:31.120 --> 35:34.560
I, yeah, I feel like you might want to at least take lead.

35:34.560 --> 35:39.600
I mean, I'll fill in and add and take, take, pick up the slack, but I don't know what angle

35:39.600 --> 35:42.320
you're coming at this from.

35:42.320 --> 35:47.160
I had this thought in my head that, which maybe some of you have, which I'd be happy

35:47.160 --> 35:52.600
that I can relieve you of, which is the idea that with money comes this ability to like

35:52.600 --> 35:59.080
just sort of like, like, make things happen, like, like, like, like, like, without, without,

35:59.080 --> 36:00.600
without caring about them.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.680
So they're like, well, I'm, I'm rich now.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.800
So the dog door is not perfect.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.880
Like I, I, and now I can't even remember what wasn't perfect about the dog door because

36:10.880 --> 36:14.240
now I'm, I want to kiss the dog door I have.

36:14.240 --> 36:21.960
But it, it, it, I was like, why can't there be a dog door that doesn't need batteries

36:21.960 --> 36:29.200
changed in it and doesn't require batteries to be changed in a fob in the dog's collars

36:29.200 --> 36:32.200
because they make these dog doors where the dog gets close to the dog door and that's

36:32.200 --> 36:37.720
when the dog door opens or unlocks and this is kind of a list of shit.

36:37.720 --> 36:42.240
And also I was like, and inevitably, like, I'd like it to be electronic also because

36:42.240 --> 36:46.280
I have a Crestron system, like a home automation system, which has also never worked.

36:46.280 --> 36:50.640
But one day I have this idea that I'll be sitting in my bed and I'll be like, did you

36:50.640 --> 36:51.640
hear that, honey?

36:51.640 --> 36:52.640
What was that?

36:52.640 --> 37:10.760
Sounds like coyotes, by the way, that's exactly what coyotes sound like.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.640
That's why they're fucking terrifying because they don't sound like an animal.

37:13.640 --> 37:20.680
They sound like a fucking, like dude at Target, like arguing with his girlfriend.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.280
You're just like, what's going on out there?

37:23.280 --> 37:28.200
Why is there a gang of dudes upset about a sale?

37:28.200 --> 37:32.120
And then you listen and they're like, oh, God, it's coyotes.

37:32.120 --> 37:36.360
And then the scariest thing about it is that then your dogs, they hear the coyotes and

37:36.360 --> 37:44.440
they're like, they react in these random fucking ways, sometimes sexually, uh-huh.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.960
You can't tell the difference.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.160
You know how your dog reacts to a skunk or a raccoon?

37:48.160 --> 37:49.160
They get excited.

37:49.160 --> 37:56.120
If there's a fucking coyote out there, the dogs are like, they're like the call of the

37:56.120 --> 37:57.120
wild.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.120
They're like, I want to go with the circus.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.920
I'm like, these motherfuckers want to eat you.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.440
They're not going to fuck you.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.120
If they do fuck you, they're going to eat you after.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.120
They don't give a shit.

38:06.120 --> 38:11.600
These are hungry ass wild cave dogs from like the fucking last millennia come down here

38:11.600 --> 38:17.880
to fucking eat squirrels and chihuahuas, but the dogs are like, they hear it and they're

38:17.880 --> 38:18.880
like, I want to go out there.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.880
I want to go out there.

38:19.880 --> 38:25.080
And it's the scariest thing in the world to hear.

38:25.080 --> 38:29.080
They're like, I want to go out there.

38:29.080 --> 38:35.040
So anyways, I'm just saying, my fantasy was to deal with that and then hit a button and

38:35.040 --> 38:37.680
be like, okay, that's enough of that.

38:37.680 --> 38:42.120
I'm not letting my dogs out, or they sometimes smell a little skunk in the air and then your

38:42.120 --> 38:46.040
dogs are like, there's a skunk out there and they're like, that means it's time for

38:46.040 --> 38:50.120
me to go attack the skunk and then you can bathe me for eight hours and then you can

38:50.120 --> 38:55.360
change your cushions and then you go, no, it means it's time to lock the door.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.000
So I had this fantasy.

38:57.000 --> 39:04.200
So it was like electronic and dog collar activated so they could pick and choose when they want

39:04.200 --> 39:06.440
to go outside.

39:06.440 --> 39:11.960
But if I want to seal them in for the evening because of mother nature, I hit the button.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
Okay.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.200
All of that from my bed.

39:14.200 --> 39:19.640
So Spencer like the whole time for like, for like the last two years, it seems like Spencer

39:19.640 --> 39:21.440
is like, I got it.

39:21.440 --> 39:26.480
This is technically Spencer's job, but it's not really fair to Spencer.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.800
It's just long term.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.840
It's hard to crack one of these things out really quick.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.680
So as a result, it's like, I don't know.

39:32.680 --> 39:33.680
Yeah.

39:33.680 --> 39:38.120
It's like, leave these in charge of like the calendar and the finances and all that shit.

39:38.120 --> 39:44.040
Spencer's like my friend, but yeah, also like, it's like, oh, it's like, oh, it's like,

39:44.040 --> 39:45.360
oh, there's a video game.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.640
Can you get it for me or something like that?

39:47.640 --> 39:55.320
It's not like I'm ever like, Spencer's fucking up because there's not a thing.

39:55.320 --> 40:01.920
And Spencer also knows, I'm not going to bug my friend about the thing and like for a year

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
and a half or something.

40:02.920 --> 40:07.880
I'm like, what about this dog door and then you'd come in and you'd go, okay, so I found

40:07.880 --> 40:09.240
this dog door.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.200
So it meets your specifications and I'm always like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.200
That's great.

40:13.200 --> 40:17.680
And then, and then sometimes you'd think back in my head and you're like, yeah, it's kind

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
of big.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
And I'm like, yeah, whatever.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.680
My dog's big.

40:20.680 --> 40:24.720
And then like, it kind of sticks out from the door.

40:24.720 --> 40:28.600
Like when you install it, I'm like, whatever, I don't, I'm not a fucking, I'm not Martha

40:28.600 --> 40:29.600
Stewart.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.920
I don't care.

40:30.920 --> 40:31.920
Function over form.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.680
Let's Elon Musk this dog door.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.000
Cut to the dog door is installed finally.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.760
Like it's like, he's the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.680
It was this giant, like picture a back door.

40:45.680 --> 40:50.560
So first of all, the back door had to be completely replaced because the dog door is so big that

40:50.560 --> 40:58.560
no door, no normal door can contain it, because it's basically the size of a door.

40:58.560 --> 41:03.080
The dog door is so big that if Spencer and I like, we're going out for the evening, we

41:03.080 --> 41:08.240
might, and we were wearing collars, we might just actually put less energy into leaving

41:08.240 --> 41:10.960
the house by ducking down and moving through the door.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.520
That's how big the dog door is.

41:12.520 --> 41:18.240
I compared it to the size of a not many fridge.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.240
I'd say it's close.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.740
So it's a lobby.

41:20.740 --> 41:24.760
It's like a fridge in size hanging off the door.

41:24.760 --> 41:33.160
It's certainly the size of a chubby criminal, a full on adult, hasn't even earned being

41:33.160 --> 41:37.880
in your house because he's not even, he's fat from his last robbery.

41:37.880 --> 41:42.400
And he's just like, well, you know, as long as I'm here, I will maintain.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.920
I feel like your dog is almost, is also that size.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.920
Yes.

41:46.920 --> 41:47.920
That's the problem.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.920
Yeah.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.720
But my dog ain't going to do shit about the robber.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
Yeah.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.600
I mean, you know, do you ever think about a fence?

41:54.600 --> 41:56.200
Oh, we have one.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.000
I got fences to beat the band.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Okay.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Okay.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.640
Like, like, before you don't, you know, like, if I've learned one thing, it's that I should

42:06.640 --> 42:11.520
have been happy with just being a caveman and letting my fucking Dino out into the backyard.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.520
It's a Bronto burger.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.280
It's like, I get it now.

42:14.280 --> 42:19.600
But I thought in my head, I thought, oh, you get money and then you start doing this James

42:19.600 --> 42:23.440
Bond thing where you're like, you can like weave your, you do the minority report in

42:23.440 --> 42:28.200
your bed and then your dog is like happier than if you were a regular dog owner.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.200
It's all untrue.

42:29.200 --> 42:30.200
It's not true.

42:30.200 --> 42:34.120
Like no matter how much money you get, you can't, you can't, your dog just needs to be

42:34.120 --> 42:40.800
let out and then let in after it shits and yet you gotta care about a living thing.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.800
All right.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.800
There's no end run around it.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.360
I'm sorry to tell you.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.600
So you may as well go back to your shitty job tomorrow and have a big smile on your

42:47.600 --> 42:50.440
face because no matter how many promotions you get, you're never going to get to stop

42:50.440 --> 42:55.200
caring about fucking people.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.920
Weird when you don't laugh at shit like that.

42:56.920 --> 43:00.000
It's like, I think, why did you buy a ticket?

43:00.000 --> 43:09.080
I thought you liked my lack of empathy anyways, but the fucking, so Nigel fucking loves the

43:09.080 --> 43:10.080
thing.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.520
He's like the shitty little dog that doesn't need anything because Nigel will find a way

43:14.520 --> 43:15.960
out of anything.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.880
Like Nigel, you could just, you could raise him in an environment that was like hermetically

43:19.880 --> 43:23.400
sealed, but like we, like he'd figure out how to get out anyway.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.400
Yeah.

43:24.400 --> 43:28.880
No, I sent Nigel up for pizza the other day and Nigel just like, so he like loves it.

43:28.880 --> 43:40.920
He walks up to it, this giant plexiglass guillotine goes, it's nine feet tall, Nigel like looks

43:40.920 --> 43:43.800
at it, walks right through and he goes and shits and pisses and does what he eats his

43:43.800 --> 43:47.640
fucking rocks and twigs so that I'll have to give him unnecessary surgery later.

43:47.640 --> 43:58.160
He comes back, Harvey is like, Harvey, Harvey spent the three weeks that this thing was

43:58.160 --> 44:03.520
installed just like shitting everywhere in the house.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.880
While Nigel just ran in and out, I would let the both of them out, like Nigel would

44:07.880 --> 44:13.320
come back in and Harvey would just sit there and go, poof, poof, poof, like please.

44:13.320 --> 44:19.400
And then I, I, like, like, and he, like, he can't, like the thing makes a sound that

44:19.400 --> 44:21.600
makes him like cower away from it.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.880
I can't say I blame him.

44:22.880 --> 44:25.440
I mean, it looks like a guillotine.

44:25.440 --> 44:29.160
He thinks Harvey is, he thinks Harvey or Nigel is going to another world.

44:29.160 --> 44:33.520
He's like, I am not going into that portal at all.

44:33.520 --> 44:38.320
My heart is like, if you ever, I don't know if, you know, some of you may have kids and

44:38.320 --> 44:41.320
like, I know parents, like I've talked to parents and I know that they always secretly

44:41.320 --> 44:43.680
have a favorite if they have two kids.

44:43.680 --> 44:47.120
I know it's a thing that you don't admit and that you can't because legally with the

44:47.120 --> 44:51.880
parent guilt, there's two kids and I know that parents with two kids, they always go

44:51.880 --> 44:55.280
like, well, Monica's like, she's the jam.

44:55.280 --> 45:00.840
And Toby's kind of a prick, but we love them because he's our kid.

45:00.840 --> 45:04.560
Like you get that when you have a kid, I get from parents that they go like, you know what,

45:04.560 --> 45:07.560
one of the great things about being a parent is you realize that your job is just to bring

45:07.560 --> 45:09.320
another shithead into the world.

45:09.320 --> 45:14.440
Like you quickly get over this idea that you're like, well, I'm Leopold the third.

45:14.440 --> 45:19.680
I can't wait for Leopold the fourth to prove I was right about my thirding.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.440
You're quickly like, okay, what's that?

45:21.440 --> 45:22.680
I eat cardboard.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.680
Okay, fine.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.440
I guess that's what you were going to do.

45:26.440 --> 45:31.480
No matter where you were raised, like I'll just keep you from getting arrested.

45:31.480 --> 45:35.640
And so anyway, so that's why parents, like after a few margaritas, they'll go, yeah,

45:35.640 --> 45:40.520
I like our daughter, but I don't like our son.

45:40.520 --> 45:45.960
And I get it having two dogs because I'm like, Nigel, my parents are going to hate you for

45:45.960 --> 45:46.960
that.

45:46.960 --> 45:48.800
They can hate me all I want.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.320
They are hating.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.320
They're ashamed.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.320
They're ashamed.

45:53.320 --> 45:57.240
If you're a parent and you're out there and you're like, I love my kids equally, well,

45:57.240 --> 46:00.600
then I guess I'm not talking about you.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.440
So why are you mad?

46:03.440 --> 46:11.720
You know, like, suck my daddy dick, no kid dick.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.320
Here I am on my throne of no kids.

46:13.320 --> 46:17.520
I'm telling you, you hate your kids.

46:17.520 --> 46:20.200
No one knows that better than me.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.200
I got dogs.

46:21.200 --> 46:29.360
I'm just saying, I get like Harvey, Harvey is the smartest dog I've ever met in my life.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.760
He watches television.

46:31.760 --> 46:37.800
When he sees things on television that are supposed to excite him, he gets excited.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.280
I can't get mad at him.

46:39.280 --> 46:42.440
He's like, it's like, it's like, ho, ho, ho, here's reindeer.

46:42.440 --> 46:48.360
And he's like, there's deer, there's deer, there's a whole shit trying to deer.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.720
And I'm like, Harvey, Harvey, take it easy and he's like, you take it easy.

46:51.720 --> 46:58.080
There's a fucking window with deer and I can't, I can't get mad at him because it's like,

46:58.080 --> 47:02.440
well, Nigel's just like, what, what, he gets mad at, he just starts barking at Harvey.

47:02.440 --> 47:08.240
Nigel doesn't, Nigel's just like, his eyes don't move at the same framerate or, I don't

47:08.240 --> 47:12.640
know what the, I try, I tried to get clarity on this from scientists and Nigel probably

47:12.640 --> 47:13.640
just knows it's TV.

47:13.640 --> 47:23.520
And he's like, hey, Harvey, it's a television show.

47:23.520 --> 47:28.360
Nigel seems a little more attuned to like the audio, like podcasts and stuff, maybe.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.360
I don't know.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.360
I'm trying to give him credit.

47:30.360 --> 47:34.520
But the thing is, it's like, Nigel's the jock, like Nigel like can catch a ball, you throw

47:34.520 --> 47:38.600
it in the air, like Nigel like gets everything, like Nigel like hacks everything.

47:38.600 --> 47:39.600
He's a mutt.

47:39.600 --> 47:43.980
He's like, he's like a little grimy little street urchin.

47:43.980 --> 47:48.120
And so he should be, you want, I want him to be me, I want to be a carbon copy of me.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.600
I want to be like, I'm punky Brewster.

47:49.600 --> 47:50.600
He's punky Brewster.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.600
He's my adopted kid.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.640
I want to be, I want to have that bond.

47:53.640 --> 47:56.400
But no, Harvey's my kid because he's homeschooled.

47:56.400 --> 47:57.720
He's from a breeder.

47:57.720 --> 48:03.280
He's afraid of, of not being liked to the point where he's, he can figure out way before

48:03.280 --> 48:09.280
anyone not likes him, like, that he's so sad that he should like maybe piss in a fountain,

48:09.280 --> 48:12.440
like when you come home, he's like, oh, sorry, I did that now.

48:12.440 --> 48:18.160
He's like so sensitive and intelligent and intuitive that he's, he's got this little

48:18.160 --> 48:23.400
brother that gets to eat before him and like, like, he's like, eh, like, like, I love, I

48:23.400 --> 48:29.160
mean, like, have you ever, if you have two kids, is it the one that reminds you the most

48:29.160 --> 48:31.480
of yourself that you like the least?

48:31.480 --> 48:33.840
That's my question.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.840
Send your emails to...

48:35.840 --> 48:40.560
Dude, why is this happening to me, dot dad?

48:40.560 --> 48:42.800
That's a great question.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.800
That is a really great question.

48:44.800 --> 48:49.640
Because like, I think if your kid's created and funny, and that's what you think you are,

48:49.640 --> 48:50.880
you love that kid.

48:50.880 --> 48:55.080
But if you're not funny, then you hate that kid.

48:55.080 --> 49:00.360
But like also the ideal, right, is that you get your shit so together that you're like,

49:00.360 --> 49:02.400
okay, I got a kid now.

49:02.400 --> 49:07.040
And you're like, eh, I live my life, like, that's the ideal parent.

49:07.040 --> 49:12.160
You're not supposed to like, like, oh, he's a little soccer player, Amy, you're a little

49:12.160 --> 49:13.480
soccer player.

49:13.480 --> 49:17.960
And then like get mad, like, that they're like, I don't know, soccer's okay, but I like

49:17.960 --> 49:18.960
the trombone.

49:18.960 --> 49:24.280
And you're like, what's that fucking dick flute you're playing?

49:24.280 --> 49:27.600
You don't even know you're doing it, like that's the cartoonish example, like none of

49:27.600 --> 49:30.040
us would do that, we're Angelitos.

49:30.040 --> 49:34.160
Some people really have a set goal for their kids, what they want them to do, they put them

49:34.160 --> 49:36.000
in shit, they give them little jobs.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.360
And some people don't, and they get a president out of it.

49:39.360 --> 49:45.120
The one thing we all know is that you can't, it's hands off, you just hope that they don't

49:45.120 --> 49:46.800
get a gun and a rifle tower.

49:46.800 --> 49:52.400
I gotta say, I'm really impressed with, I've said it before, like, the only reason I think

49:52.400 --> 49:56.440
I have the capacity to have kids is because of Cody's sister, she's got her kids.

49:56.440 --> 50:01.600
And like, I swear, I was like, when they were younger, I was like, you can't fucking raise

50:01.600 --> 50:06.280
a kid like that, you kidding me, like talking to them like they're an equal and that's the

50:06.280 --> 50:13.880
problem with our society and all this shit, but it's like, no, it's like these consequences

50:13.880 --> 50:18.520
and rule, like the kids understand the rules, and they also understand the most important

50:18.520 --> 50:22.480
thing about rules is that actually, if it's a fucking, if you really are, if you really

50:22.480 --> 50:27.320
got a bunch of sand in your crack, you can, well, you really want to bend those rules

50:27.320 --> 50:31.680
because they're negotiable on the back end of the front end, like, like, like, like,

50:31.680 --> 50:35.240
you gotta tell me what the rules about the sand and the crack are.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.240
What?

50:36.240 --> 50:39.560
No, I'm saying, like, if your kids, like, it's, it's, it's, it's avoiding the because

50:39.560 --> 50:42.880
I said so thing, because, because I said so, that ain't no rule.

50:42.880 --> 50:44.360
That's not even a rule in prison.

50:44.360 --> 50:48.040
Because I said so, don't even apply in prison, like, like, they don't even, like, like you're

50:48.040 --> 50:52.320
in prison and you know that, like, you can, well, if you really fucking want it, you can

50:52.320 --> 50:55.400
get whatever you, you know, like, you can bend the rules.

50:55.400 --> 50:58.160
So like, and that's where we send the people that we hate the most, that we don't even

50:58.160 --> 51:01.760
care if they ever learn anything, like, we were really unfair to those people, we're

51:01.760 --> 51:05.160
like, oh, well, you're going to the pits of hell where you should just fucking suffer

51:05.160 --> 51:06.640
for the rest of your life.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.520
And even there, like, if you, if you want a cigarette, you can get a cigarette, if you

51:10.520 --> 51:16.280
want a lockpick, you can get a lockpick, and like, it, it, it, so, like, it, it's that,

51:16.280 --> 51:20.360
that, I, I like that, like, those conversations where, like, parents are having with their

51:20.360 --> 51:24.640
kids where they're like, hey, like, what, what are you, what are you complaining about?

51:24.640 --> 51:30.280
Like, I want to watch Peppa Pig, you know, and, like, well, so, and so, and so, you wanted

51:30.280 --> 51:33.280
to watch Peppa Pig so bad, you did, what did you just do?

51:33.280 --> 51:36.200
Why am I, why, why are we having this conversation?

51:36.200 --> 51:40.440
I hit someone in the head with a fire truck.

51:40.440 --> 51:44.320
And so, so do you think we're going to watch Peppa Pig now because of that?

51:44.320 --> 51:47.920
Like, like, just having these conversations, it's kind of like, kind of sounds fun.

51:47.920 --> 51:54.600
It's almost like, it, it, it is better that we don't baby talk like we used to.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.720
There used to be that thing where we talked down to kids, and now you really do look at

51:57.720 --> 52:05.920
a kid and you go, do you want the Picardi, or do you want the, it's easier on everybody

52:05.920 --> 52:09.000
if we can just have a conversation versus this code switch.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.160
And I think there has to be kind of a line there, like, like, like, probably says the

52:12.160 --> 52:18.480
parental expert on his podcast about, but, but it's, that, that guy that I never want

52:18.480 --> 52:22.400
to be, and that put me off of kids is that guy behind me on the airplane.

52:22.400 --> 52:27.400
It's the, it's the working class Chris Pratt dad that's flying first class, and it has

52:27.400 --> 52:28.400
that kid with them.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.600
And you just hear this, like, almost one-sided dialogue where this guy is just like, well,

52:32.600 --> 52:33.840
hey, bro, what do you want?

52:33.840 --> 52:34.840
What do you want?

52:34.840 --> 52:35.840
Oh, you want to do that, bro?

52:35.840 --> 52:36.840
What do you think, dude?

52:36.840 --> 52:37.840
Hey, guy, what do you think?

52:37.840 --> 52:38.840
Oh, that'd be awesome.

52:38.840 --> 52:39.840
Oh, yeah.

52:39.840 --> 52:40.840
What is your shoe?

52:40.840 --> 52:41.840
A spaceship?

52:41.840 --> 52:42.840
Oh, that's amazing.

52:42.840 --> 52:46.480
Oh, and it's just kind of, I, I feel like kids pick up on insincerity before they pick

52:46.480 --> 52:47.480
up on language.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.200
Like the kids, like, too, he's like, I think my dad's a dick.

52:50.200 --> 52:54.600
I don't have the, I don't have the words for it yet, but I think I'm being raised by,

52:54.600 --> 52:56.760
like, Chris Pratt, and I don't like it.

52:56.760 --> 53:01.200
Like, that's all I know about you is that you're a fucking, like, mock enthusiast about

53:01.200 --> 53:04.960
every fucking thing I do, like, I don't know what to trust, like, what, what, what, what

53:04.960 --> 53:08.400
is it that I do that's actually gratifying my shoes a spaceship?

53:08.400 --> 53:10.400
Go suck my...

53:10.400 --> 53:13.120
Suck my tiny little...

53:13.120 --> 53:18.280
No, they do, they, look, they do, we, as a society, we sort of roll out the red carpet

53:18.280 --> 53:20.280
for the first 10 years.

53:20.280 --> 53:23.880
For the first 10, and then after 10, we're like, motherfucker, get a job.

53:23.880 --> 53:26.840
You'll see me, you'll see me asking you for shit.

53:26.840 --> 53:30.440
That's not fair, too, but that's also, that's the problem is, like, when the kids get gangly

53:30.440 --> 53:32.520
and then we start being like, fuck you.

53:32.520 --> 53:36.560
Like, that's a, that's a big problem, because it reinforces the thing is, like, we could,

53:36.560 --> 53:42.000
like, blend it a little bit, like, where it's like, hey, like, look, I'm not, yeah, it's

53:42.000 --> 53:45.080
like, like, look, you just talked to him like a fucking dude.

53:45.080 --> 53:50.240
I think the baby talk is instinctive to us, because literally, like, I think there's a,

53:50.240 --> 53:54.240
I think the reason why we look at a baby, we go, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

53:54.240 --> 54:00.080
is because we, we, because the babies, like, are like the CPU that's like fucking booting,

54:00.080 --> 54:04.360
and like, we know that they actually, if we didn't do that, if you raised a baby in an

54:04.360 --> 54:08.680
environment where they weren't surrounded by hominid faces that were constantly going,

54:08.680 --> 54:11.880
hey, don't be, don't be, don't be, don't be, don't, like, that they wouldn't start going

54:11.880 --> 54:15.560
peep-op, but, you know, that they're experimenting with it, and then, and then, and then they,

54:15.560 --> 54:22.960
they turn two, and then they go past the salt, and, whoa, yeah, that is true.

54:22.960 --> 54:26.120
If you don't talk to your babies, they don't start talking, and you can tell kids that

54:26.120 --> 54:27.120
haven't been spoken to.

54:27.120 --> 54:33.480
Oh, look who's here, speaking of babies that need to be spoken to, maybe we can try some

54:33.480 --> 54:34.480
of these techniques.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.600
Are you ready to come out?

54:36.600 --> 54:43.000
Did you, did you, did you have a good time in your, uh, special place, Rob?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.480
Excuse me.

54:45.480 --> 54:49.120
Did you, do, are you feeling better now?

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
About.

54:50.120 --> 54:59.640
About, uh, stage time, and when to come out, and, yeah, I'm okay with it, I'm all right.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.640
Okay.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.640
I love you.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.640
I love, I love you too, Daniel.

55:05.640 --> 55:11.160
Maybe tomorrow we'll go to the sunflower patch.

55:11.160 --> 55:17.200
All right, I'm trying to think of what kids like.

55:17.200 --> 55:23.480
I'm trying to go down the list of, like, what I would hate to ever do.

55:23.480 --> 55:24.480
Yeah.

55:24.480 --> 55:25.480
Yeah, that sounds awful.

55:25.480 --> 55:26.480
Disney land.

55:26.480 --> 55:27.480
That sounds worse.

55:27.480 --> 55:32.600
What if you could just have a kid that was into Minecraft, like, out of the box?

55:32.600 --> 55:42.440
Like an old box, an unfortunate figure out of the, from the get go.

55:42.440 --> 55:46.240
Like if they were like, they were just like, and then you're like Minecraft, and they're

55:46.240 --> 55:49.240
like Minecraft.

55:49.240 --> 55:54.840
I would, I just saw a baby that would like sit on a laptop next to me and it'd be like,

55:54.840 --> 55:57.000
what are you, what are you doing over there?

55:57.000 --> 56:00.920
And they'd be like, I'm making a wheat garden and I'd be like, cool, can I, do you want

56:00.920 --> 56:08.920
me to help you with stuff because I'll, I can simulate being a father or that would be,

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
that would be so cool.

56:09.920 --> 56:10.920
That'd be great.

56:10.920 --> 56:14.760
That would be so cool.

56:14.760 --> 56:19.840
My post production supervisor at community, he had two kids and he said when I was, he

56:19.840 --> 56:23.480
would go, he said, oh, I'm into Minecraft because he saw me playing it while I was editing

56:23.480 --> 56:24.480
community.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.480
That's right.

56:25.480 --> 56:36.840
Well, and then also in addition to that, probably wrote a blog in my head, be amazed, go ahead.

56:36.840 --> 56:40.880
But he was like, oh, Minecraft and he's like, I play that with my kids and he had to like

56:40.880 --> 56:44.280
a server at his home and he would go home and play with his kids.

56:44.280 --> 56:50.480
It was like a digital sandbox, a dad playing with his two kids Minecraft, you know, you

56:50.480 --> 56:52.760
can drink with them too.

56:52.760 --> 56:58.480
Once they, well, once they stop caring about Minecraft, but that I would be like, yeah,

56:58.480 --> 57:03.600
I'd be like, don't, that would be my big thing with my kid would be like, I don't like Minecraft.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.600
I want to drink.

57:04.600 --> 57:10.320
I'm like, dude, what do you think I've been doing the whole time?

57:10.320 --> 57:16.160
Get a drink and come back and play Minecraft.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.320
Drinking's my Minecraft.

57:17.320 --> 57:21.680
Don't ever say that again.

57:21.680 --> 57:22.680
Minecraft was your drinking.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.680
Did I get that right?

57:25.680 --> 57:28.200
He needs more ice.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.200
Schrab.

57:29.200 --> 57:31.480
Schrab, do you have nieces and nephews?

57:31.480 --> 57:33.920
Yeah, I think so.

57:33.920 --> 57:36.280
And bull parked me on their ages.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.280
What's that?

57:37.280 --> 57:38.280
Bull parked me on their ages.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.080
How old am I?

57:40.080 --> 57:42.720
I think I have one that's three ish.

57:42.720 --> 57:43.720
Okay.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.800
And the other one that's five ish.

57:46.800 --> 57:52.960
Schrab, you want to talk about this guy, this guy, I think the video doesn't really, but

57:52.960 --> 57:56.240
do you want to talk about this guy outside your apartment?

57:56.240 --> 57:57.240
It's been weird.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.240
It's been a weird couple of days.

57:58.240 --> 58:04.760
Like, I don't know what planet we're in retrograde.

58:04.760 --> 58:07.360
I think there's five planets in retrograde.

58:07.360 --> 58:10.120
I think there's five planets.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.680
There was.

58:12.680 --> 58:14.560
I think they went back.

58:14.560 --> 58:19.640
I mean, is that what retro means?

58:19.640 --> 58:21.240
Retrograde means they went back.

58:21.240 --> 58:25.200
They went back a grade.

58:25.200 --> 58:30.120
And I think that's happened because like, for the past couple of days, things have been

58:30.120 --> 58:33.120
f'd up.

58:33.120 --> 58:35.360
My Spotify got hacked.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.280
Your Spotify got hacked.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.240
By far my weakest password.

58:40.240 --> 58:42.200
Like, the weakest password.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.080
Car got broken into.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.080
Wow.

58:45.080 --> 58:54.560
And my keys, my car keys, that didn't have Kate's car key on it, we're in it.

58:54.560 --> 59:00.000
We walked on the beach, left the keys, my keys, because I didn't want to carry them,

59:00.000 --> 59:07.560
because I only have two pockets, so I kept my keys in Kate's car, came back, opened up

59:07.560 --> 59:11.080
the door, and Kate was like, you must have lost your keys.

59:11.080 --> 59:15.720
I go, I must have lost my keys, because I lose things, and I lost my keys.

59:15.720 --> 59:22.040
But then, when I went to the gym this morning, they said, oh, somebody tried to use your

59:22.040 --> 59:31.720
LA fitness membership yesterday, but got rejected, which made me feel like the guy was like,

59:31.720 --> 59:37.400
excuse me, I would like to use my membership to get inside your gym.

59:37.400 --> 59:42.800
And they went, okay, let me take this, beep, wait a minute, this isn't you.

59:42.800 --> 59:49.280
And they went, fuck, and then ran into the gym, and was like, sir, sir, you have to

59:49.280 --> 59:55.360
go, no, no, no, no, he was trying to like, work out, and they were just dragging him

59:55.360 --> 59:58.760
out, and he was like, no, no, no.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:05.720
I was trying to figure out, really, he's rowing, sir, that's not a boat, we're still here.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.800
No, sir, get out of here, you have to get, you put that weight down, put those weights

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
up, no, no.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.760
I was trying to figure out the most damage someone could do by hacking my Spotify account,

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.120
they were sitting on for a week, and I was like, I think actually the only thing would

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.000
be a net positive, because I think Spotify will be like, oh, you listened to Tori Amos

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.520
and Marshmallow?

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.720
You should come to this VIP party.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.320
Where is, is that all that happened to you?

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320
Or is there more?

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:41.200
Well, hey guys, I hacked Dan's Spotify account, what, no, no, I was shooting you a look because

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.400
I, I did that bit in a text message with you, I was shooting you the, the comedians look

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.200
of like, well, that didn't work, because I thought we were being really funny in my text

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.120
message conversation with Spencer about my Spotify account, I got hacked, all right, continue.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.480
It went over better on the text.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:05.560
My trunk got broken, unrelated, my trunk got broken.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.480
How do you know it's unrelated?

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:16.480
Because, because it wasn't related, I mean it's related that we were in the same grade

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:26.040
that was retroactive, and it was a vehicle, but my trunk got broken, and at the car wash,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.160
the car wash man said, oh, I can glue that for you, and I go, you broke my trunk, and

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:39.360
he goes, oh, this brand of car, oh, we get broken, I go, but it wasn't.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.080
And he said, why are you coughing?

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.320
Are you okay, sir?

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:54.840
Where did you and Jeff go to punish me for, no, no, wait, wait, wait, listen, and I go,

01:01:54.840 --> 01:02:00.640
no, I can fix it, I can fix it, and I'm going, well, somebody better fix it, because it

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.280
wasn't broke when I came here, and now it's broken.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.160
And he goes, I can glue it, I can glue it, please.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.280
Yeah, borderline, borderline, you don't have to look at you.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:19.800
So I'm sitting down, I'm sitting down, I'm sorry, out in the heat, this man is gluing

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.440
my trunk together, and I'm like, what kind of glue are you using?

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.480
Because it's hot outside, I don't know if it'll affect it.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.880
Let me look at the package, and I put on my glasses that I'm reading, and I'm just, I'm

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.600
just turned into my mother.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.480
What kind of glue are you using?

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:50.000
Well, if you keep screwing around, and screwing around, of course it's going to break.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.200
So you screw around, and you screw around, and you screw around, and you broke the trunk,

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.600
and now you're going to glue it with this gorilla glue.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.520
I hope it works, or you'll be seeing me at nine o'clock tomorrow.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:17.960
But give us a snapshot of this guy, Rob lives on this intersection in Los Angeles, I said

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:25.680
the second most populated city in the United States.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:39.760
So his gym membership username is, you've been living there forever, and it's like this

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:47.680
intersection where clearly, the government has decided that putting a stop sign there

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.000
creates a, they looked at it from a bird's eye, they're like, well if you put a stop

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.080
sign there, the city will shut down.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.560
It's like putting a clot in a thing, and they're like, well how many car accidents

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560
are there?

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560
Eight a day.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560
The most ever?

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560
Eight a day.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.280
Okay, but per year, so on average they look at the whole circulatory system of the city,

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.760
and they're like, so keep letting there be car accidents and let the insurance companies

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.240
pay, because unlike a stop sign, those only happen once in a while, but it is the most.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:28.320
So I'm replying to my emails, and I'm replying, and I'm replying, and I'm replying, and all

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:39.640
of a sudden I hear, ahhh, Michael Winslow is outside your door.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.240
He's now a UPS man.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:58.760
Three seconds later I hear, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, and Kate's like, Jesus

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.320
fucking Christ, what did you do?

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.240
And I'm like, I'm just replying to email.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240
Which ones did you reply to?

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.240
What are you talking about?

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.240
The ones that say do not reply?

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240
Yeah.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240
They say do not reply.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:17.240
Look, I got enough shit going on with Mercury doing whatever it's fucking doing up in the

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:23.440
sky, breaking my trunk, stealing your car keys.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.240
I got enough shit to work out.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.720
Well let's investigate, let's look outside the window.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:36.040
We see a three car piled up, Schrab.el everywhere, and we see an Armenian woman going, oh my

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.160
goodness, oh my goodness, we're going back and forth, and this other guy going, oh my

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:47.480
God, oh my God, you ruined my life, you ruined my life.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.200
I had this car for three days.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:57.520
I can't make a living without my car, and you ruined my life, you ruined my life.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:06.440
Cut two, three hours later, oh my God, you ruined my life, you ruined my life.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:11.280
I can't make a living without my car, you ruined my life.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:18.120
I was like, oh God, what if he was a marathon runner and his leg was broken or anything?

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:21.040
He's a pianist and his fingers are shattered.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.040
Pianist got hurt.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:29.320
If he was Dr. Strange and his knuckles, I needed voodoo magic too.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.000
I don't think Dr. Strange was strange enough.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.840
I know you worked on the movie.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.680
He seemed pretty normal.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.360
He was like, believe me, I was brought in there.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.960
Excuse me, pardon me, how are you, sir?

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.240
I was thinking he would be doing some Howie Mandel shit, putting the glove on, he's going

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:55.560
I know you're doing a bit, but I actually consider that my job.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:01.080
I was like, in the sequence where he's like, why don't you have a Dr. Strange from Austin

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.840
and come in and he's like, hey, what am I doing, what am I doing, why are you from Austin?

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840
I don't know.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.400
I thought I was in there because I was the Rick and Morty guy.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400
He's Dr. Strange.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400
Make him Strange.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400
You are.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
Anyways.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.400
Doesn't matter now.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.400
You never have to.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.000
So you were like saying, he comes in wearing green pants and an orange t-shirt.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Come on.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.520
Can we not get sidetracked by this?

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.520
We have two big foam hands.

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.400
But you said number one on it.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.280
You said you heard a crash.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280
Hello.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.280
You said you heard a crash.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280
No.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.280
The Dr. Strange.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.000
He ain't in.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.200
I was like, look, one of these days this guy is going to meet Tony Stark, how are we going

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200
to know the difference between them?

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.200
The answer has to be that they have different motivations.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200
The amount of strangeness.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200
All right.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:57.200
Tony's got the weird sideburns, Dr. Strange has the cape.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:08.480
So you said you heard a crash and then you hear a guy going, oh my God, you were in my

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.480
life.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.520
And I'm thinking, oh my God, can you imagine all the permutations about like if you were

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.640
a ballerina and like your ankles are sprained or whatever, it's like the slightest like

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.640
physical thing.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.720
Like somebody or like an actor even.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.720
Clearly he was an actor.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720
But we don't like beautiful people.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:27.760
Like what if your face gets sliced by your thing or your nose gets broken.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.400
And I was like, oh God, I wonder what that was.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.800
But then the guy was out there for three hours and he was out there so long yelling about

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.240
how his life was ruined that it became very clear that his life was not ruined.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.760
Because he had the ability to stand outside and yell about how his life was ruined and

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.000
he went into great detail.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.400
But I was really focused on his car.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:53.800
And he's like, I can't make money if I don't have my car, if my car can't make money, I

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.600
can't make payments on my car.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.360
So it's like over time you're like, this doesn't, it sounds like you're doing pretty

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360
good.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.320
Like I don't think you were on your way to like a Forbes meeting.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.120
The poor lady that was being yelled at by this man who already felt bad, you know, is

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.040
being yelled at, being yelled at, being yelled at, being yelled at.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:20.800
The tow truck picks up her car first and leaves the guy and he's like, goodbye, thanks

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.960
for ruining my life.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.760
I don't have anybody to pick me up.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.760
I don't have any friends.

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.120
Well, at least he has an audience.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.720
I wonder why.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720
Which is his worst nightmare.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720
You seem pretty.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.160
I mean, I'm sure the guy was having a bad day.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.760
I'm sure it wasn't his fault.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.080
I'd love to see like that guy, the rest of that guy's life.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.120
He might just be like, hold on, hey guys, I just am getting a new car.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120
It's so exciting.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120
It's going to be great.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.120
I'm going to be able to make all this money with my car, guys.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120
That's exactly what I said.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120
Yeah.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120
I'll take the end.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120
I'm so happy.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.120
Thanks.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.120
Thank you, everybody.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.120
Thank you.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120
Thank you.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120
Thank you, God.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120
Thanks, boy.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.120
I'm going to make so much money because of this car.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.800
It's a stepping stone to a greater life.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.800
I'm so grateful for it.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.800
Oh, God.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.800
Oh, God.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.800
Yeah.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.800
Yeah.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
Not a fucking chance.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800
And I don't say that.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.800
I don't say that like he deserved it.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800
What the fuck?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800
Order in the court.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800
Order in the court.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800
Jesus.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.800
The defendant will please rise.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.800
Yes.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800
Yes, your honor.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.800
Did you, madam, run into this poor man's car?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800
Yes, I did.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800
Okay.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.800
You may sit down.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.800
Let's talk to the other guy, sir.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.800
Will you please state your case?

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.800
Oh, my life is short.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.800
My life is short.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.800
You're in my life.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800
You're in my life.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.800
Hey, does that give me the limit?

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.800
Hell yeah.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.800
Your honor, if I could read the tape back.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.800
But just a moment.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.800
Brenda, sorry.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.800
I know.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.800
I'm sorry.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.800
Brandon.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.600
Applying gender to your occupation.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.040
I'm part of the problem.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.360
I'm a temp, but I look like the other one.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.840
So I'm racist too.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.360
No, you're fine, your honor.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.480
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could just read back,

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.640
you're ruining my life.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.080
You're ruining my life.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.480
Ah, ah, ah, you're ruining my life.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.720
You're ruining my life.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.960
You're ruining his life, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.640
Excuse me, Mr. Kensington, you're not in charge.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.880
I'm talking to Brandon. I'm the jury.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.640
If I could please... Sir, I will hold you

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.920
in contempt of Corey. I am not a lawyer.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.400
I am not a part of this.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.320
I just want to use the gym membership.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.760
Because I have a problem with my back right now.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.960
And if I could just...

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.720
I'm just gonna lift these. Wait.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.280
Oh, no. God damn it.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.880
That's the oldest scam of the book.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.280
How does the court keep...

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.680
Sir, you're gonna have to put those pounds back on

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.200
before you leave.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.200
Take these Cheetos.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm sorry.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.400
No, no, no.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.680
Can I leave now? Can I leave?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.080
Can I leave now that I'm fat and gross again?

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.680
But I will try, because you sent me the video.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.400
I don't... We promised nothing, but I'll try.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.800
Maybe we can hear this guy,

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.520
because this is Rob's wife recording it

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520
from the apartment near the glass.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.280
Kate! Her name is Kate.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.920
Okay.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.160
I don't... Kate!

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.960
You married us.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.120
Well, then she's my wife, too.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.480
So I can dehumanize her as much as I want.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.640
It looks like somebody's Mormon.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.480
Yeah.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.560
Okay, so...

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.560
Every baby... Every baby... Every...

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.560
It's quiet.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.560
Yeah, he's not talking.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:12.560
Hi! Thanks for leaving my fucking wife!

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.560
I don't get a ride. It's not like it's me to ride.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.560
I... I mean, he was saying that so much

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560
that you were able to hear it,

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.560
and then someone got out their phone at some point, like...

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560
Yeah, I mean, he was saying it for a long time.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.560
Yeah.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.560
I mean, the guy's... The video, he's hopping around.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.560
Like, that's the thing.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.560
It's okay to make fun of his tragedy,

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.560
not because he deserves to have misfortune,

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:42.560
but because he's fine physically.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.560
Like, in all the ways that his mishap could hurt him permanently.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.560
He's fine, and he's... I just...

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.560
He's jumping up and down yelling,

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.560
my life is ruined.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.560
I... I... I ran out of steam pretty quickly.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.560
You know this.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.560
Like, I'm like... If I show up in a public place,

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.560
I'm like, uh, okay, yeah, I'm done.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.560
All right, goodbye, Lyft. Goodbye.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.560
You never see me again.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.560
So... But this guy, for three hours,

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.560
screaming at the time,

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.560
you ruined my life, you ruined my life.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.560
I get him.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560
You ruined my life, you ruined my life.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560
You ruined my life of the commitment.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.560
I was jealous.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.560
I could be... I was that guy.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560
I'm this guy.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560
But...

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:36.560
No.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.560
I don't think you're that guy.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560
I've never seen you like that.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.560
With I was 30 years old, and shit would befall me.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.640
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.560
And I would like, you could wind me up

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.120
and I would be in the Glendale Galleria,

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.560
like making a, like, I would just,

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.920
like, I would have this thing like,

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.760
when were you ever like that?

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.400
Well, you would never see it,

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.880
except like once in a while,

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.080
I was like, but if a telemarketer called me,

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.360
like, why is my phone ringing?

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.840
I would like enter the exchange,

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.760
like, why is this happening to me?

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.240
Like, I was Christ, you know?

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:11.400
Like, what's with this ripple in my perfect world

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.520
that my father created?

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.840
You know, they're like, hello?

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.160
Mr. Harmon, this is a courtesy call,

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.800
they're like, who are you?

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:22.360
And why are you calling me?

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.200
You know, it's just like,

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.880
you just get this righteousness about you.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.760
Like, I don't know, when I was like 30,

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.720
I was like, are you, like, well, still,

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.960
yeah, I'm not, I don't mean to imply

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.240
that I'm mellow and zen now,

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.800
but like, I just got,

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.560
I just got filled within a fat that I was like,

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.720
I'm tired, like this piggy needs to roll over and die.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.160
I think being in the arts, when you're super creative

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.520
and you have some language

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.400
and you know how to fucking act a little bit,

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.240
you are the worst person to run into.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.200
You're the worst person to run into

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.520
when it comes to shit like that.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.520
But I do, yeah, I do think,

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.880
I think outrage is helpful, like,

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.520
I actually don't, I don't wanna see less people

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.720
be so fucking like, unfamiliar with,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.080
with bullshit that they're outraged.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.760
I don't, like, we talk about outrage culture

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.720
and like, we want to, like, dissolve it,

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.880
like a wart with nitrous or whatever the shit

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.840
that they would burn your warts away with.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.680
Liquid nitrogen.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.080
Liquid nitrogen.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.200
I don't, I don't think that's tall.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.040
Acid!

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.200
I think outrage is great.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.200
I think it's amazing for somebody to wake up one morning

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.200
and be like, you know what,

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.120
I haven't been treated like a fucking human being today.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.800
I, let alone the princess or the prince that I am

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.000
or the fucking king or the,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.440
like, and to like enter every exchange that you have

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.040
with an expectation that is like fucking like,

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.960
because what's the alternative to that?

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.880
To like take your cues from, from a society

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.800
that thinks you're a piece of shit,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.920
like how you should be treated.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.960
Some people have to invert that shit

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.200
and sometimes that, that takes the form of a tantrum,

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.680
you know, like some people would be like,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.600
you know what, I woke up this morning and I'm like,

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.280
why am I not being treated like a fucking human being?

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.760
Tuck your fucking keys!

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.600
Do you mean like that?

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.000
How come I can't unlock every door

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.520
that I walk towards?

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.360
But sort of like that situation where you just pop off.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.880
And I think that's a, that's a,

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.280
I know, I think that guy just had to take a giant shit.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.880
I don't know.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.720
I'm trying to run that.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.520
Well, what could have made that guy mad?

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.720
That's literally, I was literally advocating for

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.280
specifically him if he was leaving because he was mad.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.120
No, he has to take a shit.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.960
I think it's okay to get mad.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.800
Fuck this!

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.880
I think it's okay to pop off now and then

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.800
and be a fucking reposer,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.000
a fucking crazy hypocritical, fucking punk rock activist.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:37.840
Fuck you!

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.400
There is something about living in,

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.080
when you live in Los Angeles,

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.800
people tend to get out of their cars

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.160
and rant at you more than other cities.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.040
And it is, is it the heat?

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.720
Well, it could be, also though, remember Los Angeles

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.640
is like a beautiful city to walk into traffic in.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.000
Like Los Angeles is very kind to the fucking pedestrian.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.440
You step into the street coming out of JFK

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.200
and like you get a very harsh reminder of like,

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.200
oh shit, it's legal to kill me here.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.000
Like they're aiming for me and that makes New York run.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.240
But LA, like everyone's coming from different countries

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.200
and all this shit, but we somehow get it pounded into us

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.800
that if somebody steps into the street,

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.560
even if they're drunk and wandering in,

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.320
like it's on you if you hit them.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.160
So that could be, that could create tension

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.400
for a almost New York-sized city

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.840
where like everyone's gotta get somewhere

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.480
and it's like, fuck, you know,

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480
everything's on me if I make a mistake.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.480
Like that could create like fucking, you know,

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.320
I don't know.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.880
It could ruin your life.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.880
Yeah.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.320
It could ruin your life.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.480
The other thing I think is like,

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.760
if a guy is screaming, this ruined my life,

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.480
if a car accident ruined your life,

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.760
the first thing I'm thinking

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.240
if I'm overhearing that is uninsured.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.360
Like, which he has my support because it's like,

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.680
I would be screaming on the sidewalk like,

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.240
why the fuck is it mandatory for me to have a fuck?

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.520
Like if somebody hit me and I was uninsured for a week

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.600
because I was between jobs and all that shit,

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.880
that would fucking send me over.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.320
I think the deal was just being real big, honestly,

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.000
because I think if you're fucked, you're really quiet.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.640
When shit pops off, that makes your life really in.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.720
But also if it was super his fault, I think it'd be,

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.440
like, I think, like, look, it could be,

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.240
it could be the other driver's fault.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.240
Don't you think that would send him over like more?

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.080
I'm saying, I'm saying.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.400
Cause he's like, I did nothing wrong,

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.800
but I was like, I'm going to go to the gap.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.800
And like, I, like, they told me, they told me don't,

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.480
they told me you can't drive uninsured and all this shit.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:42.160
Like he took, he took his little canoe out into the canal.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.800
I was like, I'm going to catch some fish.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.440
I'm going to come back with them.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.240
I'm going to make my village proud.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.240
I'm like, I'm, and for that to be taken away from him

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.560
because somebody like went, it was their fault.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:56.080
Technically it's his fault, but only on paper.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.480
But the woman ran into him.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.800
He, he got sandwiched between two cars.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.640
So then, so then, he got the worst of,

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.240
so then I understand the outrage.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.480
I don't, I don't, I don't like, I just get it.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.840
Like, I just, like, like, if you're-

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.360
People kept yelling at him, insurance.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.800
She's got insurance.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.640
Right.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.600
Insurance.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.040
And he's like, you can't get insurance

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:22.120
unless you sell enough pizzas and I can't sell pizzas

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.600
unless people like me and no one likes me

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600
because I don't have a car.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.720
And I understand that.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.560
I do.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.880
And I will vote for him when he runs for,

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.320
because he's, I don't know if that anger goes somewhere.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.320
I get it.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.160
Yeah.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.040
It went into my ears.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:44.960
Well, I'm trying to reply to my emails

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.360
and I'm hearing this, I don't know, outside.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.520
It was distracting.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.360
But that's-

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.200
I had to make fun of it.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200
That's what you're talking about.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.000
Homo sapiens versus Neanderthals, Neanderthals would be like,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.640
wait, someone's, someone's life is ruined?

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.800
Did you say homeless sapiens?

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.640
Homo sapiens.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.440
Homo, Homo neanderthalus.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.680
Homo sapiens are the only species capable of going,

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.960
oh, there's a guy, here a guy screaming my life is ruined.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.480
Sounds like a job for the mythical thing

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.920
I've constructed in my head called the DMV,

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:21.120
the state of California, the rule of law,

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.720
the responsibility, Barack Obama.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.040
I don't know what that meant.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.600
Univision, I don't know.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.400
Like you have all these constructs in your head

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.240
and you're like, I would do more harm than good

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.320
if I even go to the window and look out of it.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.440
But if you were in a tribe of 150 people

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.040
and you were like, you heard one of your best friends

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.840
going, my life is ruined, you'd be like,

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.440
well, it's the shitty part of me that's gonna sleep in.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.480
But we are capable of creating cultures

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.280
where we're like, it's actually a pretty good job today.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.160
Heard a guy screaming, my life is ruined,

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.080
didn't run to the window to take a picture.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.000
I'm doing pretty good today.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.800
Like we kind of pat ourselves on the back

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.120
for a little bit of numbness,

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:04.360
because that's how you get through.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.360
Oh, a plane goes down with 300 of your fellow species

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.200
and you don't-

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.320
I don't know, are you on my side or not?

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.160
Are you, what do you-

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.480
Nothing happened to you.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.560
What, what?

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:16.720
I'm on your side?

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.400
Nothing happened to you.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.200
You're saying, well, 300 people died in a plane crash

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.920
and you're taking pictures of this.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.760
No, no, no, I didn't mean-

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.520
He just did an Elizabeth Smart version of you.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.000
I think it's good that you-

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.200
I'm so, they're so happy.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.320
That guy would be so happy.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.520
If you could put him in a chamber

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.360
that sucked all of his misfortune out

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.000
and then you told him,

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.680
someone recorded you screaming, my life is ruined, goodbye.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.040
And 150 people, well, that's still 120.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:49.040
All right, guys, I get it,

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.800
it's downtown, it's Monday, whatever.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.200
But if you could separate his consciousness,

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.920
he would go like, oh, that's cool.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.000
That my tragedy made these people happy for a second,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.840
because they weren't like, what an animal.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.560
He should be stuck with a spear until he dies.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.000
Although I do, again, I will say maybe that dude deserved it.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:11.840
I was-

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.440
That's another huge thing that the sapiens guy talks about.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.840
That's why everybody needs to read this book,

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.480
because he talks about gossip.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.800
Here's the thing, is this woman who,

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.000
it was her fault, she even said,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.520
it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.600
Was sitting there, she was being screamed at by this guy.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.400
Everybody in the neighborhood was huddled around her,

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.080
like, are you okay?

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:33.920
Do you need a-

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.920
But this guy was going, nobody's caring about me.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:43.920
He probably had a neck injury, he got hit really hard.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.920
Or it triggered, it might have triggered some loss

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.440
for that dude, obviously.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.280
Yeah.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.480
Because he really-

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.280
Well, it sounds like it ruined his life.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.480
Well, if we can take him at his word.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.520
People kept saying, calm down,

01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.800
and people kept avoiding him,

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.800
because he just was, he was at a 10 and stayed there,

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:05.920
and never-

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.440
Which always makes you feel great.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.760
Yeah, everybody knows that.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.160
At no point, he went, at one point,

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.560
I heard him talking quietly, and I went,

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:16.600
oh, okay, well, this is the part where he goes,

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.800
okay, blew up to there, I'm really sorry,

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.920
but I just, whatever, if we could exchange

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.280
our insurance information, I think,

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.600
but no, he was going, just say you're sorry,

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.120
just say you're sorry, just say you're sorry,

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.080
you ruined my life.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.600
He was just saying it quietly.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.920
Yeah, he was just getting enough energy back

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.720
to scream at her as he was driving home to her family,

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.080
and home, and warm bed.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:45.600
Well, that doesn't, yeah, now, I mean,

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.400
not that I was on his side, but I mean,

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.040
just say you're sorry, like, it's like, well-

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:51.880
He was screaming.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.560
Like, there's no, it's like, what does sorry mean to you?

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.840
Yeah, yeah, I mean, whatever, he's 20.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.880
Like, he's so lucky, he's not decapitated,

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:04.720
that's all I can-

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.920
Yeah, I think you were like saying,

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.320
when you really are fucked, you just sit there going,

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.440
shit, shit, you know?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.280
I mean, you don't like-

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.000
It's a terrible, like, you get a fender bender,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.880
and you're like, you don't know what the fuck,

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.200
like, what do you do, like, no one tells you,

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.440
they tell you in, like, Driver's Ed class, or whatever,

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.520
but like, come on, like, even it's just a slight tap,

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.800
in Milwaukee, like, the roads are icy

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.560
for nine months of the year, and it's like,

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.240
through no fault of your own, you just like, bump,

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.880
you just, you tap someone's bumper,

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.560
and it's really up to both of you, collectively,

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.280
whether or not all of a sudden pull over,

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.880
and exchange the information, and you just feel like such a,

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.280
like, no one leaves their house prepared for that,

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.880
it's great, like-

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.160
And here's the thing, there was a third person involved

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.840
with this accident, so everybody was huddled around

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.520
the woman who was, it was her fault,

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.520
everybody was avoiding, like, the plague,

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.420
the guy screaming up and down, and here's this guy,

01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:06.600
that's just kind of, oh, okay, oh.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:11.100
So that's the third guy?

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.800
Yeah, he's just like, all right, all right.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.960
That's homo habilis.

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:16.680
Yeah, it's like, I'm over here, too.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.680
All right, I guess the squeaky wheel gets on it.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.160
That's everybody in this audience, that's all of us, right?

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.800
Yeah, oh yeah, that would have been me going,

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.080
okay, well, if you tell me I'm a bad person,

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.800
I'll be happy to be ashamed of myself.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.160
I'll take my cues from you, I didn't get out of bed

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.040
to not fuck around with society.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.480
At the same time, I will draw a line,

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.840
we don't know where it is, but I will draw it.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:49.840
Yeah, I got 12 people that'll pick me up right now,

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.760
but I don't know, what am I supposed to do?

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.960
Yeah, well, prayers out to every single person

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.680
in that accident, it sounds like everybody

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.680
got away, god damn, that expression of it could be worse,

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.400
like it always feels like a terrible thing

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.600
to take solace in, like if you're in a bad situation.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.160
Silver linings do not help you, you know,

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.240
well, at least you didn't lose a foot, fuck off.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.360
But I gotta say, Elizabeth Smartfucking,

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.920
she sold me on the, it could be worse, philosophy.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.960
Give me a, give me a, for instance.

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.560
She's ruling my show.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:38.120
She, Elizabeth Smart broke it down to game theory

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.720
about it could be worse, cause she was like,

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.720
look, I'll tell you what, I got, you know, look,

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.960
I don't want to use harsh language and like,

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.120
cause it'll sound like I'm making light, cause like,

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.280
whatever, but this girl was through the worst year

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.120
of 14 year old girl's life, aside from getting murdered

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.880
afterward, you could ever be through.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:59.200
And, and she, and so she recaps it,

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.440
she has this like sort of bon vivant style,

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.760
like, like, kind of like, like she, she chucks it off,

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.600
like, like, she's like, she's like,

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.120
this is what happened to me and this is what happened

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:08.960
to me and this is what happened.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.960
And you know what, every single time

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.680
something bad started happening to me,

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:17.480
I kept thinking, well, it can never get any worse than this.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.040
And every time I thought that, it kept getting fucking worse.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.480
And so I started to learn after a while,

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.320
it can get worse than this.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.520
And that's when it started to get better.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.760
And I was like, all right, I got, like, that's like,

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.120
like, she was like, I hacked the spiritual system.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.120
She was like, well, I, I, oh, I've gotten to a place where I,

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.280
it's sort of, but the other half of you goes, yeah,

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.120
but that's how we're all conditioned by things like

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.080
organized religion to suffer abuse, you know?

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.880
Like, like, that's, it's a very fascinating.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.600
It's also a bit of a survival skill though.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:53.360
I won't trash it too much.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.200
It's not conditioning.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.040
It literally is the thing that keeps us.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:57.680
That's, and it makes us different.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.920
Like the, the, the Homo sapiens, like we're able to believe

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.280
in the shit that doesn't, isn't real.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.680
But the important asterisk on that is that real doesn't matter

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.160
because once you get like, like the species,

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.320
we make the unreal real.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.400
So the corporations, they're just real.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.960
Like if Disney's a corporation, like, and everyone believes

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.200
that Disney's a corporation, which it is,

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.000
even though that doesn't mean anything,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.520
Walt Disney isn't alive, there isn't anything.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.880
Like Disney's just a belief.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.360
It exists of like a bunch of like,

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.200
just like a tribe.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.800
Scriptures that you have on record and things.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.440
But ultimately, like, hey, well, you know,

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.760
it's like several thousand people like, like,

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.440
oh, I got, I got fired today.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.080
I don't want, like, because this belief in the system,

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.800
like the belief matters.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.560
The belief in the dollar, the belief in your taxes,

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.560
the belief that you are a citizen of a country.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.560
Like, it's almost an understatement to say that,

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.600
oh, so much of our life is based on these, like,

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.480
fabrications that have nothing to do with reality,

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.640
because that would be the most,

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.880
when you really think about it, it's like,

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.520
well, what did you do today?

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.200
What governed your life today that had anything to do

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.440
with biological reality?

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.040
You took a shit.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.480
You sneezed.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:18.520
I, like, like, everything that had anything

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.120
that you culturally, like, registered.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.400
Anything that would actually meant anything to you,

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.160
your self-esteem, like, most importantly,

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.520
like, whether or not you think you're a good person,

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.000
like, it all had to do with, like, fucking crazy,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.280
like, shit that doesn't, it doesn't exist.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.400
But it does exist.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.000
That's the, it's not, I don't think the important thing

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.800
is for us to realize it doesn't exist,

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.120
because I think that's what a raccoon would do.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.400
That's why a raccoon keeps going through your garbage,

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.680
no matter how many times you tell it, it's against the law.

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.240
And the raccoon will just look at you and go,

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.520
that doesn't mean anything.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.520
That doesn't make the raccoon a hero or a villain.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.360
It just, like, makes, it means the raccoon would die.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.840
Makes it a raccoon.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:03.920
But the truth for that raccoon is that if it doesn't stop

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.400
fucking with the wrong person's garbage, it's gonna die.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.600
Because of a belief system that that human has, like,

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.440
decided on.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.160
Like, okay, it's okay for me to poison you,

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.400
because the city of whatever I live in doesn't care.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.240
And it's just.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.080
Nevada.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:21.360
Nevada's fine, it's.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.360
It's, Jeff, what went on with you and Jeff backstage?

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:31.360
Now tell us.

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.440
Now reward us for our patience.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.480
What went on back there?

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.680
What was your strategy?

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.020
Because ours won.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.840
I don't think so.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.840
Because we were having a ball.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.360
Well, I think we had a pretty good time too,

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.560
didn't we, kids?

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.400
Yay!

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.080
I love, I love, like, the people I didn't see clap.

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:56.920
We're like.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:57.760
Nah, nah.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:31:59.920
Well, there's no feeling.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.760
I'm sorry, dad.

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.680
Mom picked me up on Tuesday and got ice cream.

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.080
That's fine, I love them too.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.840
I don't demand fealty.

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:10.680
That's right.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:17.680
What makes me different from your fake gods?

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.840
I'm the first god to say to you.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.920
You know what, I'd like to earn it.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.960
That's your first and last commandment.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.840
Let me earn it.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.120
Stop it, stop it.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.040
What, you're afraid I'm gonna become a cult leader now?

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.160
It's a little late for that concern.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.480
It's just so.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.800
What? Tideous.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.920
It's like walking uphill.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.480
That's what Kate said to me one time.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.760
Like, I would, because I do bits, you know,

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:54.480
when we're driving in the car.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.520
You remember those?

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.560
Yeah.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.640
Trob car bits?

01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:58.880
Yeah.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.960
It's like me testing out material.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:07.000
Usually it's me singing the names of the signs that I,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.760
you know, say, I have a 25 miles an hour shop code.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.200
You know, like stuff like that, you know, like that.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.680
And at one point, like it was like silent for a while.

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.520
And then Kate goes, ugh.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.600
You know, it's like talking to you is like walking a pill.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.120
And I was like, and I started like almost crying.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.880
And she just started laughing her ass off.

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.560
And I'm like, that's not funny.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:39.120
And then I started laughing because it was pretty funny.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.000
But it was funny because it hurt my feelings.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.680
I didn't, like, that's like a vitamin in small doses.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.080
Like, it's not a representation of your union.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:51.360
But like also that's like your best partner will.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.960
I had a girlfriend once who said, I just,

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.600
I was almost so proud of this.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.640
It was an insult, like, because we were sitting

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.080
at an airport gate.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.760
And I was like, I said, I was like, I was joking.

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.960
Because I paid for first class tickets.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.560
And then they were like, we're now

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.240
admitting people who need to sit first and whatever.

01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.760
And I was like new to first class.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:19.560
And I was like, there was a guy literally with a cane

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.160
that was clearly blind.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.120
And I said as a joke, but, you know,

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.760
I lean into my jokes when I'm in private.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.960
I was like, oh, great.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.080
So what do I got to do to really sit first?

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.960
You know, I blind myself.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.560
What?

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.440
What did you say?

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440
What do I got to do?

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.920
I was just making the joke.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.600
I was, it didn't matter what I said.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.560
It was like the joke was, I'm first class,

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.560
but the blind guy gets to get on the plane first.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.560
He paid with his sight.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.800
What did you pay?

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.360
I am aware of the God damn irony,

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.680
or I wouldn't have said something.

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.520
If he would have traded, he would.

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.200
My girlfriend.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:56.720
Go first.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.520
Can I see my baby?

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.320
My girlfriend, like, you don't know

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.280
that he got blind doing something cool.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:06.040
He could have been an asshole.

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:13.600
He might have poked out an eye, a microscope that

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.480
is designed to make Ebola.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.800
I was like, well, he was so enthusiastic about making Ebola.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.760
He's like, ow, ow.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.160
I can't see.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.400
Thank God.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:32.480
My point was, you remember these zingers,

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.160
because they're actually like, my girlfriend at the time

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:41.640
said, you're like a watchdog group for one.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:46.200
And I thought it was really funny and scathing.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.280
It was like, yeah, I really am like the most

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.080
ridiculously horrible narcissistic person.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.960
But it was also like an expression of like, wow.

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.520
It's like, for a partner to be like, you are awful.

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.320
It's part of it.

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.760
But at the same time, and I think the reason I started

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:14.720
laughing is because we talked about it for a long time,

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:17.000
just dissecting why we were both laughing.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.360
And she said, the reason is you were trying as hard as you

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.880
can to make it feel like I was walking uphill.

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:25.360
Right.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.160
Listen to this.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:31.520
You were trying as hard as you could to be a horrible person.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.960
We succeeded.

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.480
Yeah.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.720
Which is what couples do.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.120
But the shortcut to that is you can

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.160
be pleasant with each other about everything else

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.400
if you just take the lid off the fart rule.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.400
Just fart with each other.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.160
Because then you can be like, you're awful,

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.200
because that was awful.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.320
And then you can both be like, yeah, that was bad.

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:58.240
And then you're like, oh, let's get back to our partnership.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.000
In all other matters, we're best friends.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.160
But don't do that again.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:05.760
I won't.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.000
Yeah, I'm from Missouri.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.240
So if you want me to show you a fart.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.720
No.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.000
So we don't really fart in front of one another ever.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.320
I've done both.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.000
I think I've talked about that before.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.200
I think Sarah, I don't think she'd mind me saying this,

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.720
because Sarah was going out with Jimmy.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.720
Sarah Silverman going out with Jimmy Kimmel.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.680
You'd think, OK, these two are comedians.

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.840
They're artists or whatever.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.280
I remember we were talking about farting,

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.720
and she was like, yeah, Jimmy and I don't fart around each other.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.160
And I was like, you guys don't fart around each other?

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.840
And so me and Megathi, we did a whole marriage.

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.440
It was like, yeah, the only thing I learned from it

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.240
is that that's a thing you can do.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.040
That's a total option.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.040
It didn't make it worse.

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:54.800
It didn't make it better.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.360
Right.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:58.840
But it's a distinctive decision.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.200
I think actually what it taught me

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.720
is when I was a 25-year-old kid who was like, oh,

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.880
I associated farting in front of each other

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.280
as with a threshold of intimacy, that actually

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.080
had to do with abuse.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.000
Well, that word is too heavy.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.560
But that it was like, oh, you're family now,

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.520
which means you're like, I don't respect you now.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.480
We're not.

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.440
It's like when the farting becomes,

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.960
when it signifies, well, you don't matter to me.

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.600
That's what you don't want to enter your head.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.000
Isn't the problem kind of making farts symbolic in any sense

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.120
for the relationship?

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:39.880
That could be.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.640
Because when it means something,

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.040
whether you're doing it in front of each other or not doing it,

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.440
making it mean something, that seems like, well, what are we

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.960
doing?

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.840
I think you may be the most right and most wrong

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.960
about this, because you're right.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.120
First of all, good luck making farts not mean something.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.600
Not mean the wrong thing.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:04.840
Well, just because getting to that place where it's just,

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:07.520
well, farts are just when air is expelled from your anus,

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.960
like, come on, good luck.

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.000
They're hilarious.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.280
But at any given time, it's like, it

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.880
could be like if someone's saying they love you

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.960
and then you fart, the timing means you don't love them

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.920
or whatever, or if they're farting more than you,

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.360
because they're lactose intolerant.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.800
I don't want to open that door.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.360
That all sounds like madness.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.360
Right.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:32.520
So I do think you're right in that if you maintain the idea

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:37.120
that, well, farts happen, so they don't have power over us.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:42.040
So if I do fart next to you, it can't possibly mean by itself

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:42.880
that I don't love you.

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.480
It's certainly not supposed to.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.560
That's not the point of doing that.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:49.560
Any more than exhaling or lightning striking,

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.280
because really, it's just may as well be weather.

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.880
But the big, I think when I was younger,

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:58.480
I think growing up blue collar and kind of midwestern

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:02.600
and just sort of cultural things, it's like,

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.080
I think I had it in my relationships.

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.080
If you're listening to this, and I doubt you are,

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.480
and you dated me when I was 19, I don't think you're listening

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:12.080
to this podcast.

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.840
Let's go ahead and bring Katie out.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.560
But I think I was like, oh, yeah, I was like, yeah,

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.760
I was flowers and candy.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.080
And then we started farting in front of each other.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.680
And then it turned into kind of trailer park,

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:26.440
like, well, we're balling, chaining each other.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440
You know what I mean?

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.200
But that has nothing to do with the fart.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.160
It has to do with the symbolism that you project onto it.

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.080
Which is that's probably the real problem.

01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:35.760
Yeah.

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.200
Whereas Cody and I fart all over each other constantly.

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.480
I'm saving one up for her right now,

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.920
because it means I love you.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.680
That is.

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:55.160
Your dad kept a big barrel of pretzels next to his recliner.

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:55.920
Do you remember that?

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:56.640
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.720
He would have like a big Costco's big thing of pretzels.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.440
We're all dried out, nasty.

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.840
Next to his recliner.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:06.720
Remember that?

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:07.720
Yeah.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.840
Try to stop eating them, though, right?

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:10.720
I would eat them.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:11.200
Yeah.

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.040
And you'd eat more.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.000
And you'd be like, this dry ass giant brick pretzel.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.480
And then you'd keep eating them.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:17.280
You would eat them?

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.160
I would eat them.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.720
I'm assuming your dad would eat them.

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.400
And it was always full.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.400
It was always full.

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.920
Because he would get another barrel, yeah.

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.520
Yeah.

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.800
And I think one time I went out into the garage

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.640
where there was the jukebox or whatever that he had or whatever.

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.000
And there were all these barrels of pretzels.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Your dad liked big fucking pretzels.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
They were big ones.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
They weren't little like giant pretzels.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Barrels of them.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
It's making me love my dad, bro.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Dog biscuit pretzels.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
He got it.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
He gets it.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
My dad gets it.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
He fucking nailed it.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
He had the recliner, the remote control, and the pretzels

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000
in arms reach and backup pretzels in the chamber.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Next to the jukebox.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Because he probably noticed, probably like one day he came home

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
and he was like, who ate my pretzels?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.000
What are we doing?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And then he was like, wait, I have money?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
A billion pretzels.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
If you love pretzels that much, get a billion pretzels.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
How much for one?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Well, it's about $15.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I'll take everything you got.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Here's my address.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
How much to ship it to my place?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
It'll take those like, fuck it.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Here's my credit card information.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Meet me.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Meet me there in 15 minutes.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
We used to make fun of my dad because my dad was, he subscribed

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
to this company called Blair.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
That was like, basically all his clothes came through the mail.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And we just made fun of him because he was like, oh, your dad,

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
your clothes come through the mail.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Come on, cut to half of our sponsors.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Yeah, fell.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Oh, socks are us.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Would be happy to put you in a pair of socks.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Just sign up to Warby Soccer and we'll put some socks on you.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000
It's like, I'm Billabooty and Butterjic Chico.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Yes, it is.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
We would make so much fun of my dad because it was like,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
dad, what do you get your clothes in a box from a delivery man

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
for?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
He's like, ah, what are you making fun of me?

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
What am I going to pick the best shirt in the world at a store?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
All of a sudden, everyone's going to start respecting me, right?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Like, oh, here's an idea.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Here's the shirt size.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Here's the pant size.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Fucking mail me pants and shirts and I'll go to work.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Perfect human.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Do we have a little D&D?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Yeah.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
It's close.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
We've got about nine minutes of D&D.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
We should bring Jeff Davis out for the D&D.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Jeff is either waiting or at my bed is not waiting because Jeff thinks

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
that his final revenge is going to be in the form of us going,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Jeff, where are you?

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Where are you?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
To silence.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Don't you think he's not back there?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I think he's still back there because he's Jeff Davis.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
He's a reasonably loyal dude.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Well, I'll go look.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Yeah, because what I won't do is beg for it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Won't do it.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Is to earn it.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
He doesn't have to earn it because I wouldn't do that to another person,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
but I won't have it done to me.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I introduced him.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
He made a bit out of it.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Now he's going to lay in that bed.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'm willing to be even Steven.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I'm not going to take revenge or be like, I want all I want is friendship

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
and equality.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
That's all I've ever wanted.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Yeah, you sound dangerous right now.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I need to just come up to my tent for nine months and worship Mormon Christ.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Can you just say you're sorry?

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Can you just say you're sorry?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Have you ever weaponized that, think back through your life going like,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
oh, just say you're sorry.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
It would be so hard to say you're sorry.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
It is hard to say you're sorry.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And it should be.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
That should be a big deal.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
God damn it, we keep pissing that guy off.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
The only thing he doesn't like is human fidelity.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000
He doesn't care if I'm breaking through to the inner rage.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
God damn it, I don't find it.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
I wanted to hear when season four is coming out.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I don't know what it is.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
When it's done, I can't say.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Oh, I can read a...

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I'll read an S&P note.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
We got our first S&P note from Rick and Morty.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Oh yeah.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And it seems kind of harmless to read it, I think.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Let's see.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Morty's butt is simply too large.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Give us a beat.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
It's so much more...

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I don't know if I just typed Rick and Morty.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
What's that?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000
I like that you looked at me.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I don't know.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I can't...

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Read these notes to a beat.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Read these notes to a beat.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Delivery status.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Let's talk about...

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:42.000
My new favorite thing is Canadian Horror Podcasts.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
This podcast is called The No Sleep Podcast.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Why are you guys...

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
You're just fans of it too.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
There's 11 seasons of it and I'm on season four.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
The guy sounds exactly like Scott Thompson from Kids in the Hall.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
It's so Canadian and it's so funny.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I swear.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I said to David Cummings, host of that podcast,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I want to just ask you this because I don't like it when people hit people.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Dan Harmon made fun of you in his podcast or whatever.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
The guy that was up and disappeared or whatever.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I will fly you first class to Los Angeles to be on the show and celebrate you.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
I love your podcast.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I go to sleep to it every night.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Now here's the part where maybe I'm teasing but I just love this.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It's this creepy pasta podcast and it just starts with this creepy music

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
and this guy that sounds like Scott Thompson from Kids in the Hall

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000
goes like, as the darkness descends into the wilderness

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000
and your heart's nightmares come out to play,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000
it's time to surrender to the horror.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Because tonight there will be no sleep.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I just find it fascinating that there is absolutely no way to be effectively scary

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.000
when you're that Canadian, which I want.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:25.000
At the top of everything it's like, he's like, this is welcome to episode seven

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
of season three of the No Sleep podcast.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
A few orders of business.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000
We're raising the price on the Patreon silver package

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:47.000
until tonight's chingly spine tingling terrors of terror are about 73 cents per spine tingle.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It's so fucking Canadian.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
He's so cost effective.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
You all remember Otis Redis from our last thing.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
He's having some trouble without going into too much detail.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
He needs some help.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
There's a GoFundMe page but the GoFundMe will always be like a weird Canadian version of GoFundMe.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000
There's a Royal Federation Super PAC page.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Sign in to help guys.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
What?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Oh no.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Without further ado, it's time for the terrifying tales.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
It's called the No Sleep podcast.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
We literally sleep to it because it's so comforting.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
He's adorable.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I don't know if he wants to be adorable.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Because I'm starting back.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I have seven seasons to go before I'm caught up.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I'm still at the era where he's like a new advent of the podcast.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000
You'll notice on the website we have something new called trigger warnings.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:04.000
For those who don't know, trigger warnings are well, they're a spoiler free advisory

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:13.000
about the type of content that you may encounter during a scary tale designed to tingle your spine.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:21.000
We always seek to frighten and terrify, but in a safe way that makes everyone happy.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Don't forget, Bowling League is next Tuesday.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000
If that guy, I love him so much.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I hope everyone's going to be like, oh, he did an impression of you and all this stuff in the hill.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:43.000
So I'm saying, please come on the podcast.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
I will rose petals for you.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
I love you.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
It's such a great combination.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Canadian accent and terrifying tales.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Because they're not just generic monkey pastries.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
They're creepy pastas.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
A lot of them are like fucking hardcore.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:13.000
It's like this next scary tale comes to us from a neighbor who thinks maybe when you're planting in your garden,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:21.000
you ought to be careful for, as our next narrator says, the carrots in the soul.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And then some music will come in.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
But then he'll affect some like, he's always talking about who needs more narrators and he's always apologizing.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
We could use some more narrators, but I'll do this next one anyway.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000
And then he'll do like, here, I've been planting carrots for a long time.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
He just gets the sense of like, come on, you're a pig and shit, stop.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000
You don't need anybody.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Just fucking do it, baby.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I want to hear all your accents.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
He's like, sometimes he doesn't like, I'm from Chicago.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:59.000
And I like that one time people told me to watch a channel six and can make people jump off a building.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Oh, that was a scary one.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
This next one's about a pussy of fire.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Okay.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Anyways, what was, yeah, I know that confused me too.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Why would the next one be about a pussy of fire?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
The answer is because it's time to end the show.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Oh, and he says at the end, he's like, oh, that's the end of our episode.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
You don't have to tell people that.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I mean, it's ending.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
He starts it with so much business.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Oh, the subscription plan has changed.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
It's like, it's like getting on a bus.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And a lot of the stories are Canadian too, and they're so charming.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.000
They're like, oh, this next one, they got, oh, what went down by the lake?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:54.000
And what went down by the lake is a dude lit up a joint, sat on a bench and he saw something scary and he never forgot it.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
That's fucking it.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Like, oh, yeah, you mean privilege?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Oh, he'll never forget the day by the pine tree lake.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Oh, it's a splash and a ghost was splashing.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
It wasn't a raccoon.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Oh boy, the cops came over and they gave me a wag of the finger.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:23.000
They gifted my joint underneath the park bench, said, you know, a lot of people wouldn't believe your story,

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
but it ain't my job to judge you.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And he walked away, but I'll never forget that spooky bench by the lake.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000
But then they're interspersed with totally American, just like, I got raped on the dark web because I clicked on the wrong thing

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.000
and it came in the window and raped my fucking rape flesh.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000
But they're red in the same place, like, oh, and the rape and the rape flesh in my rape.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Well, that brings us to the end of our stories.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:03.000
It's a glorious, podcasting is the last section of the internet to have any fucking health to it.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I am out of the rest of it.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
All right, what else do we have to do?

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Let's just sign off and see people next week.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Can I please just, because people think I'm kidding, but I just got to...

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Well, yeah, well, because I feel like, okay, just let me...

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Well, talk about something.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Brandon, do you want to have children?

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Talk about that for a second.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I do want to have children.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Why don't you yet?

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
What's wrong?

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I'm sure that I do somewhere.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Every time I tape a TV show, I'm like, are you sure this is going to be on TV?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Because my children will find me.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I don't have children because I date interracially.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
What?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I just...

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
I don't want to do that to a white person's family.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Oh, scary next tale.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:00.000
A little bit of misogyny can be a fine time for an upstanding citizen.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000
But our next story tells the cautionary tale of when race mixing goes wrong.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Join narrator, Brandon Johnson, for the story of how I fucked an Indian girl.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Oh, sorry.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
No, that's...

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
We didn't...

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Okay, sorry.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
What?

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
No, you and children, sorry.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
I didn't mean to...

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Yeah, why don't we just casually talk about me and my lack of children?

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000
We started with the cats.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Once you get over two, you pretty much know it's not going to happen for you.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
There is that.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
There's also poverty.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000
There's abject poverty.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I don't want to make more poor black people.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Really is the case.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
So I didn't have kids.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Did you find it yet?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Doesn't having kids seem like an irresponsible move right now?

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Back in Sparta, it was probably a bad move to have a kid just to toss off a cliff.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
It feels like that.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000
It does feel like that.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I would have kids, I think, that would be okay, but we'll never know.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
So a way to bring that down.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Sparm doesn't seem to work.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
I don't know if it's no internet or it's just things like that.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Dan has AT&T, and AT&T seems like it's even worse than Verizon in this exact location.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000
However, in some of their judgments, a really judicious company, I think that...

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
We love the shows that they buy.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Their recent purchase of the entire Turner Network.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Yes.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Oh, so wonderful.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Well, it's the widest network in the country.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000
The conversion to headlines about pedophilia, I think, are a fantastic decision.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I will exchange my fucking life and soul for whatever they want to go.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.000
This next tale comes from a man trapped by his plans for retirement.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000
In a tale called, Why the fuck is everyone bent out of shape about this?

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Didn't I come to this internet to do exactly this?

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Wait, why can't I just click on a thing and...

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I'm not asking you guys that.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
That's what I want, I know.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It's just...

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
All right, whatever.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Canadian creepypasta.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Please tune into creepypasta and tell us all goodnight.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
That is Harmontown.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
We miss you so much, Jeff Davis, wherever you are.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Shout out to Rob Schrab, Spencer Crittenden, Dan Harmon, and the food Chris Foreoff.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Thank you.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Jack McKeever, Sarah Hill.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
This has been the Dynasty Typewriter.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Tuck your keys.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Shots out to church.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
We love you all.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Good night.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Did you get any of that?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:32.000
It's a good show.
