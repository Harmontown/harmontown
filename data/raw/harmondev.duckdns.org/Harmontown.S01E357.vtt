00:00.000 --> 00:11.320
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.120
I am Brandon Johnson, sitting in for Jeff Davis.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.360
We love you, Jeff Davis.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.160
Make some noise for Jeff.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.080
God knows where he is.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.000
Let's get right to it.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
There's so much show.

00:23.000 --> 00:23.720
You know him.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.440
You love him.

00:24.440 --> 00:32.800
Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.800
Dungeon Master of Disaster.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.520
You know how we get down, ladies and gentlemen,

00:39.520 --> 00:44.000
welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harbour.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Mr. Dan Harbour!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah!

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yeah!

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Yeah!

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Been drinking since 10 AM.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Been drinking since 10 AM.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Been drinking since the day began.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Been getting all kinds of drunk for reasons I can't share.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
Damn, I remember the time you used to share your personal secrets.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Now you can't anymore because you're rich and famous.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Cool.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Damn.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
I remember the time.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Do you?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Transparency.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
No, I actually don't remember the time.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I remember the time it just trails off.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I remember the time.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
No, I don't.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Damn.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Brandon Johnson, everybody.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Look, it's a little late in the podcast to, like, stir up beef,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
but honestly, my favorite Comptroller.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Oh, shit.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
No!

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
No!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, shit.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
No.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
You're booing the idea of pettiness.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
You're not booing him and you're not booing Jeff.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
You're booing the idea of me pitting them against each other.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
That's what I'm saying.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Exactly.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm, like, the Joker.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I'm, like, splitting the pool queue in half.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I'm, like...

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
I have never said this before, but would somebody please help me?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Please!

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
Help get me off this day.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Someone!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Someone!

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
My family, call my family.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I have been drinking all day.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Congratulations.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Why?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Why, Dan Harmon?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Veteran's Day.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Whoa.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
That's patriotism.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I truly...

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Did you guys see my Instagram post about Veteran's Day?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
I fucking knocked it out of the park.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
You're welcome.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
You're welcome, men and women and gender-fluid soldiers.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I just fucking nailed it.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I signaled so much virtue.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
You couldn't fucking, like...

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
It was beyond reproach.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I was, like, dude, no matter what you are, whatever, Veterans, what, booby-dee-boo-ba-dee.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I fucking...

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
I just, like, man, the world's gonna suck my dick when I click Submit.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I did it.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Boom, dude.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I got Ghost of Marines coming at me.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Like, Simper Fi, blah, blah, blah.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Like, I fucking did it.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I fucking signaled that virtue.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And then, undid it.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I was...

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm not a fucking warp.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
I, like, hate myself today.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
I honestly can't tell you guys why I'm so fucking upset.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
But my hope is that I can just be honest with you guys that I'm so fucking, like...

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I've been...

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
There are outside circumstances that have me in a real fucking tailspin.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
And the thing that I want to be honest about is, because I've been taking note of it,

04:03.000 --> 04:14.000
is how fucking rude and mean I am only, exclusively, only to the people that are closest to me.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
The people that I can trust.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
That stupid expression, you only hurt the ones you love.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Like, I have been so fucking mean to Cody the last couple of weeks because I am going through something

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
with people that deserve so much fucking abuse and who are getting nothing.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
If you want to be treated well by me, here's an insider tip.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Be a bag of dicks to me.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Proclaim yourself as my enemy.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
You will be a fucking red carpet ambassador.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
Like, you'll never hear a fucking peep from me because I'll be so busy strategizing and all this.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
But if you want to get a fucking verbally abused by me, love me.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Just love me.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Just be into me.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Be on my side.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Be in my corner.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
That's where you'll get fucking knocked out.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
It really is fucking weird.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Who lets you know is the thing that a good friend Jerry Minor said when I said I lost my mind one night.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
He said, who was crying or who was angry?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
And I said neither.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
And he goes, then you didn't lose your mind.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
So who told you that you had fucked up?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Did you discover it yourself?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Me.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Okay, good.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, I mean, but it's like...

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
At least you didn't get it secondhand.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
That would have sucked.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Well, a secondhand does Cody count a secondhand?

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Like, if I'm like being mean to her and then she's like, why are you being mean to me?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Is that, that's her the source?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Like, I'm like...

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I think that counts, yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Because I don't want to make it...

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
I don't want to sugarcoat and be like, oh yeah, and then I realized what a bag of fucking shit I am.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
No, it's like...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But you did eventually.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, but like...

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah, I'm just a terrible person.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
No, you know, terrible people don't question it.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
That's the difference.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Fuck you, Brandon.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Again, will somebody help me?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
I will tell you when I was a kid, my mother would say to me,

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't know why you talk shit to me, but you don't talk shit to that dude who stole your book back, you little bitch.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And it does shake you back.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
I love that your mom said that.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
She had a lot of gyms.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Your mom had the presence of mind to know you were taking aggression out on her

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
that was based on someone stealing your book back?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
She felt like it really didn't matter what the reason was.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
It was her fucking house.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't know why you're upset with me, but I can tell you this.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I saw your bitch ass run home today.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
So whatever's going on, you don't need to talk to me like that,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
because I'm sure you can't back it up.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
I used to wipe your ass, bitch.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Allow for that to happen in your relationship.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
Did your mom ever give you this one where you're like,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
did you ever come home like sniffling and crying because you got bullied?

07:06.000 --> 07:14.000
And did your mom go like, well, if they're that mean, then you don't want them as your friend?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
You fucking bitch.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
It's so true. It's so perfectly right.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
But it's not the message you're willing to receive at that time.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
No, she was hardcore.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
They were so mean to me.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Well, then they're not good people and you don't want to hang out with them.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean being in their treehouse wouldn't be rad.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Right.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
It's called fucking society, bitch.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah, your advice doesn't raise my self esteem, mom.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
It's the Schrab's next t-shirt.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Where's the fucking Schrab?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
You lost him on the way here.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
His biggest dream.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh, the episode where Schrab's gone, everyone misses Schrab.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I miss him too.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Who's going to find the good chair and move it into place?

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
I sat down, there's no guest per se.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
I think I heard a possible guest respond to that.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
But I sat down here because there's a camera situation where the worst, I don't know,

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
like me standing up there is not good for camera purposes.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
The camera's stuck.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Whereas this is amazing.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Me sitting here is amazing.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
But let's, let's, let's, let's bring on our friend, Nick Rutherford.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Nick.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes, Nick Rutherford, ladies and gentlemen, you know from such shows as the Nick Rutherford

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
show written and produced by Nick Rutherford.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Sorry, Nick Rutherford.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
What?

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yes.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Ladies and gentlemen, his entrance tonight is brought to you by lime, lime scooters.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
You're going to, you're going to bust your mouth open lime scooters.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh my God.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Wow.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Man.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Subtle.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
That was good.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I saw that.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
I saw the headlight on that thing coming down the thing and I was like, we're all going

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
to die.

09:19.000 --> 09:30.000
Oh, for the folks at home, Nick wrote a scooter up on stage.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
And then I had to turn it off so he didn't keep getting billed for the show.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah, he locked it.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Very expensive.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
So you knew you've, you're, you're facile enough with these things that you knew it would

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
make a punchline sound when you deactivated it.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I love limes, man.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
They're the best.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
People who rail against limes are awful.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, man.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
That's what I'm saying.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I think they're a little too curmudgeon-y.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Like, yeah.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
The people or the limes?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
The people.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I think limes are too curmudgeon-y.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Also, it's only people who live in Santa Monica and fuck that place, right?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
I just, anything like any critique people have of these scooters is the same about bikes,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
but no one said them about bikes because bikes are old and adults use them.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Okay, boomer.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Okay, boomer.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Oh shit.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh my god.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Okay, boomer.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
I can do it too, boomer.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh shit.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
I also know how to use the phrase of the day, boomer.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Okay.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
I saw this phrase is exploded like a fucking wad of shitty cum everywhere.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Oh, okay, boomer.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
Oh, you fucking got your ass nailed your ass to the fucking wall.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I saw, wait, what is that?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
What is that?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I'll celebrate.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
I'll celebrate when I say it, boomer.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
You know, demographically, Brandon, you're my age.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm sorry to out you, but like, we're generation X.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
You and I.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
That's right, yeah.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
We're the little one.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
Did you know demographically what that means is that we have no voice?

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
We don't, but all the shit's made for us right now.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
What?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
No, you're thinking it's 1995.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
No, no, it's true.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
It's all made for us.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
What do you mean?

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
We're in that sweet spot where it's like people market to music and shit.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
The morning show.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
No, I don't know.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Disney Plus is made for you guys.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
That's true.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
What is made for us?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
There's nothing made for us.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
There's like, what's like probiotics?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
All right.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh yeah.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Activity is huge.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
My point was going to be, I mean, I would love to think what you're saying is true, but

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
my point is that like demographically when you examine it, the baby boomers.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Okay, boomer.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Those are my parents, Brandon's parents.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Okay.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
That was a generation.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
They're called baby boomers.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Let me walk you through this because it's Veterans Day.

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
My grandpappies came back from Guadalcanal and did so much fucking that they created

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
the Beatles with their dicks.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
They're just like, holy fuck.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I'm so fucking horny.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I've just been like bayonetting the enemy forever.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I can't wait to fuck.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And so there was this baby boom.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
And that's our fucking obnoxious Trump generation is the fucking these boomers.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
They're like, I want a trivial pursuit.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Hey, Nick, how are you?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I'm great, man.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I've been Lyman.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
I'm sorry.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm a bad interviewer and bad host.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
You said you don't have a guest per se.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Well, I didn't want to.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Per se.

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
So like, did you forget or you don't consider me a guest?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm like, you're my friend.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Don't tell him that.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't have any friends.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I don't know what I'm doing.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Don't let me fucking do that to you.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm your friend, Dan.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
Anyways, the baby boomers had a couple of kids, like three of them total.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Me, Kurt Cobain, and Brandon.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Paul F. Tompkins, David Cross, Janeane Garofalo.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Okay.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That's us.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
We didn't have any kids because we're fucking awesome.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
We were like...

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Trying to save that planet.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Trying to save that planet.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Trying to impact that waste.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
And we were like, Disney, think so.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Coca-Cola?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Uh-uh.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Anything corporate?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Uh-uh.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
You think you're into the Bernie or whatever, like, fuck you.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
We were like socialists before we knew it was called socialism.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
We were like, fucking, fuck you, dude.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Hands in the pockets, Alanis Morissette.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Fuck it.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Give me a fucking peace sign, and I'm playing the piano over here.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
They don't know about Nader.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh, I thought you said something else.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh, no.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
I was like, hard R on the Nader, man.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Yeah, no.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
They don't know about Nader.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
No, Nader.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Did I vote?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
No.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
My first vote was 1992, I was 18 years old, voted for a guy named Ross Perot.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
My parents voted for Ross Perot.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
Felicia Day in her book talks about that was her first vote.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
It was like, anyways, but here's the thing.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Generation X.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Sandwich, real little sliver.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
If you were to represent, demographically, population-wise, we're just outnumbered.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
We have 1,000 parents and 1,000 cousins that are younger than us.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't know how that worked, but even though we didn't have kids, we now,

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
if you're Generation X, you're just a fucking piece of shit sandwiched between,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
fuck everybody, man.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
But we were nailing it.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
By doing what?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Nothing.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
What are you talking about?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
We gave him hip hop.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Hip hop.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
We had hip hop.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yeah, we did hip hop.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
You guys came up with hip hop?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Brandon and Dan, you came up with hip hop.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Cable.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Cable.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Cable.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Cable.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Cable.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Cable.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Your motherfuckers was getting free TV.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
Our generation came and said, pay for these reruns.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Cable.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
We were Generation X.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah, there were three channels when we were born.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
And then when we were 20, we were like, there should be 300.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
We did that.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
We did that.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
We added value to everything.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
We were like, you using one home phone?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Fuck that.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Get a cell phone.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
More billing.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Yup.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
And what'd y'all do?

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Y'all came in with the fucking YouTubes.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And you fucked it up.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Y'all like, like, subscribe.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Fuck y'all.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Let's give them one taste of the hip hop we invented.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
Can I have a beat?

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Yo.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Yo.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Puffy jackets.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
My name is Puffy Jacket.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
I can't hack it.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
When it's warm outside.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I like to let it ride.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
My name is Puffy Jacket.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Sleeves.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Infinite.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Feeling.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Down to the wrist.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Fuck you mama so hard I made her fucking list.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
Fingertips going inside her pussy.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
I woke up on Monday morning.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Went down to the car.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Okay.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Okay.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
No.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
You made a list.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
This weekend you made a mom's list.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Is that true?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh yeah?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
You fucked her so hard?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
You hit her with that dick and balls kung fu?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Yes.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
A little more hype than I'm worth.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yep.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It's all hype right now.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
It's the hype man.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
What baby?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I'm just, I don't deserve that much hype.

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
Well you're starting to talk me into it.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Come get some of this hype.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Enjoy all of this hype.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
I want to be a better rapper for you.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
You make me want to be a better rapper.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That's what a hype man do.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
That's what a hype man do.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I want to take you to the break of time.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I'm just a hype man, bro.

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
I know you've been drinking since 10, but let me get it in.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
You see, a hype man is the dude that has your back.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
Now the dude who you run up to and then make his booty crack.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Are you sure you can't expand on this?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
A little bit?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Pretty sure.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
That's not a relationship, boy.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
When you say pretty sure.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
How sure am I?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Wow.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
That relationship is worth unpacking.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
We got a real crack crew.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Like the lighting effects happen.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
The fucking beat was sweet.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
There's a lot of, you know, by the way, Nick, thanks for coming.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Tonight's guest is Nick Rutherford.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
He was in The Waitest Kids, you know.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
What was it?

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
A good neighbor, which yeah, wasn't as successful as the last kids.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Anything after Kids in the Hall, I don't even know it.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
All right.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
Well, you could just do a quick Google before you bring your not quite real guest on stage.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
No, that's something we do for guests.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Friends.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
You're a friend.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
We abuse you.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I know that's what the per se means.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Dan doesn't Google Dream Corp LLC.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
Yeah, Dream Corp LLC.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I saw some bus bench ads for that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Pretty good.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
Don't swim really tried to promote Dream Corp LLC by having really cool ads that didn't

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
say what Dream Corp LLC was right.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
It was like that's great.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I've been having sleeping problems lately.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Maybe I should go to these guys.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
It's like no.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
It's a TV show.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
It was like they did really subversive.

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
Like it was like a picture of John Grice who plays Dr. Roberts and it said like, oh, we

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
will analize your dreams and it's a fun anal pun.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
That's fun.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
But then everybody was like, look at that dumb billboard.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
They didn't, they spaced their text wrong and then nobody watched the show.

20:16.000 --> 20:24.000
When I was doing community, which I never bring up, there was, I wanted to, I was like

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
so excited about the website.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
I was like, I want to do the Greendale College, Greendale?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Greendale.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I'm like, I said, Glendale or Greendale?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
No, Greendale.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
I want to do like the Greendale College's like a website and I want it to be like, it's

20:41.000 --> 20:46.440
got to be legit, it's got to be like the Dunder Mifflin like a website, but like beyond that,

20:46.440 --> 20:49.000
like you get, it's got to be this fully immersive thing.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
We're going to have hundreds and hundreds of like student registries and your other

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
thing.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.160
And then it was like NBC digital was like, yeah, but we did research and we did that Dunder

20:59.160 --> 21:07.000
Mifflin page and like people were upset because they, what we found in our testing is that

21:07.000 --> 21:11.500
they're, they wanted to know whether it was a real website or not.

21:11.500 --> 21:18.000
And so what we found is if we put like a Toyota ad, people, it made people more comfortable.

21:18.000 --> 21:26.280
Anyways, just, I mean, it sounds like I'm complaining, but I'm not, I'm just laughing.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.480
We did the, I'm sorry, I've been drinking since 10 a.m.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.480
Wait, so you never got a community college?

21:33.480 --> 21:36.640
We never really, it was like, well, there was like a, there was a website, but it was

21:36.640 --> 21:46.080
like sony.com slash community slash NBC dot hashtag slash this is a TV show slash we promise

21:46.080 --> 21:55.080
this isn't really happening slash.org slash TV dot biz slash like oh, just for funsies

21:55.080 --> 22:01.200
let's pretend this is a community college dot just for fun dot just kidding.

22:01.200 --> 22:07.080
And it was like, it was nothing, it was like, let's go through the motions and hated it.

22:07.080 --> 22:11.000
And then we would do like Twitter, I was like, let's do a Twitter episode where we have

22:11.000 --> 22:14.120
the characters talking to each other and they're like, that's great.

22:14.120 --> 22:19.760
Just make sure that every character after everything they tweet, they hashtag NBC underscore

22:19.760 --> 22:27.080
community, watch it at eight, why would, why would any Edison be saying that anyways?

22:27.080 --> 22:29.440
Those guys all got mad at me one time on Twitter or something.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.680
They were all like adding me.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.280
The cast of community.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
Yeah.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
The characters from.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.280
Yeah.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.560
They're like obvets, obvets, tweets or whatever.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.920
That would probably be me.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.920
It was.

22:39.920 --> 22:40.920
It was someone.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
It was just someone.

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
Before we met.

22:42.920 --> 22:43.920
I was yelling at you.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.920
No, this was on Twitter.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.360
It was after it was way, it was way later than those accounts were like active.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.760
Like they went rogue or something.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.760
Like the people are like RPing them and they just like, you know, lost reality or something.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.760
For a while.

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
Those were all me.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.200
They had to be because you couldn't, you couldn't make writers do that.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
Who's doing it now?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.320
The guy who hates you.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.320
Yeah.

23:02.320 --> 23:08.400
I said, we did the vulture, vulture, uh, we did the community reunion panel.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.400
Was anyone at that?

23:09.400 --> 23:15.760
Uh, yeah, it was, it was basically everyone pretty much at the risk of offending anyone

23:15.760 --> 23:16.760
that I'm forgetting.

23:16.760 --> 23:24.400
No, it was basically everyone minus Donald and Chevy on the panel and, um, and then we

23:24.400 --> 23:30.720
went to this dinner in the basement of this steak place that Joel loves and in the middle

23:30.720 --> 23:33.320
of the dinner, fucking Donald Glover walks in.

23:33.320 --> 23:39.320
It was so fantastic to see him with his fucking crazy beard and is like, like, like, uh, god

23:39.320 --> 23:40.320
damn it.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.320
I'm jealous of that guy.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.520
Did he know about the dinner or does he work at that steak place?

23:44.520 --> 23:50.320
I think he was like, he's trying to make ends meet.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.040
He, I think he was literally come, got off.

23:53.040 --> 23:57.640
I think he was trying to make the panel and only made it like just to the dinner.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.480
Um, but it was just, it was just good to talk to him again.

24:01.480 --> 24:05.520
Did he, were you guys having a dinner and he just happened to be in the same place at

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
the same time?

24:06.520 --> 24:07.520
Or did he know you guys were going to be there?

24:07.520 --> 24:08.760
No, he, no, I mean, that's what I'm saying.

24:08.760 --> 24:13.600
Like, I think he was, I think he was literally coming from Atlanta, figuratively and literally

24:13.600 --> 24:21.040
like, like, like, or literally and literally, um, uh, and, and he just, the flight didn't

24:21.040 --> 24:25.520
work out, but he just made it to the dinner.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.000
Did Chevy show up at all?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
At the dinner?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yeah.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
No, he didn't make it.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.960
Well, you should give his phone number out.

24:33.960 --> 24:38.960
Yeah.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.920
I think they would like his phone number, right?

24:40.920 --> 24:44.560
I bet they'd love it.

24:44.560 --> 24:50.040
You should get hired like after people go through rehab, you should be like the tester.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.040
We should get one more drink, right?

24:52.040 --> 24:54.920
We should just get, do more, one more line, right?

24:54.920 --> 25:00.240
In informal poll, does anyone answer their phone anymore?

25:00.240 --> 25:01.240
Someone said yes.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.760
Who said yes?

25:03.760 --> 25:04.760
A liar.

25:04.760 --> 25:05.760
Me.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.760
Fred answer phone.

25:07.760 --> 25:08.760
Someone said yes, right?

25:08.760 --> 25:09.760
Yeah.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.760
Yeah.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.760
Boomer.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.760
No.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.760
Oh, no.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
Like, I like who?

25:14.760 --> 25:15.760
Why would you ever answer your phone anymore?

25:15.760 --> 25:18.920
I don't think we even need the actual phone call function anymore.

25:18.920 --> 25:25.800
Yeah, I mean, I don't, if someone's calling me, even if it says mom, I'm like, yeah, right.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
Nice try.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.560
Well, you don't think it's your mom, or?

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
Nice try.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.560
I just assume it's...

25:32.560 --> 25:33.560
My own contacts.

25:33.560 --> 25:34.560
Yeah, exactly.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.440
I'm like, good one, AT&T.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.640
Nick, what'd you do last night?

25:39.640 --> 25:43.840
Oh, we went to the Rick and Morty premiere last night.

25:43.840 --> 25:44.840
Yeah.

25:44.840 --> 25:45.840
Oh, shit.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
It's back.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.840
Wobble of a dub dub.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.800
Did you just like that episode?

25:50.800 --> 25:51.800
Who said no?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
Nobody.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.800
Okay, good.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.300
It was very fun, Brandon.

25:56.300 --> 25:57.300
Did you like it?

25:57.300 --> 25:58.300
Yeah.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.300
Did I like the episode?

25:59.300 --> 26:00.300
Did you like, how'd you feel?

26:00.300 --> 26:01.800
Was this your second one?

26:01.800 --> 26:02.800
First one?

26:02.800 --> 26:03.800
This is my first premiere.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.480
I don't care for the show itself, but I do like...

26:07.480 --> 26:08.480
Just hanging out with friends.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.480
Yeah.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.480
It's great.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.480
It's great.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.480
There was food.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.480
There was food.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.480
Yeah.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.480
Brandon was in the writer's room for a while.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.480
It's great.

26:16.480 --> 26:22.520
The time on that show moves so slowly that the episode that you inspired, which we will

26:22.520 --> 26:28.560
call the Vat of Acid episode, you got to see the fucking finished product on that.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.560
It's an amazing episode.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.560
I can't wait to see it.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.160
Yeah, it's going to be live action.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.160
It's a good room.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.160
Can you imagine?

26:36.160 --> 26:37.160
You guys know.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.160
It's fucking hilarious in there.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.160
It's a fun room.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.360
We have good times.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.360
Rob's in there.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.360
Rob is in there.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.200
Sometimes there's a dog in there.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.480
There's two dogs in there constantly.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.480
Let's talk about them.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.880
Well, one's a little angel.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
That's Tilda.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.880
That's Tilda.

26:53.880 --> 26:54.880
There's a dog named Tilda.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.280
Just think of a cute dog.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.800
That's kind of what it is.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.320
It's about the size of this microphone.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.000
I think that I'm having a lot of trouble.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
I think one thing...

27:04.000 --> 27:11.200
Because last night I was blackout drunk and I went wandering around.

27:11.200 --> 27:17.440
I have video of you and I holding hands prancing downtown.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.600
I guess you were just wrangling me or something.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.600
No, I don't know.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
We were just wandering.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.400
You were screaming at me in the photo booth and then there's a picture of it.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.400
I screamed at you?

27:29.400 --> 27:30.400
It was friendly.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.400
It was great.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.400
It was great.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.840
But it was right as the first picture got taken.

27:35.840 --> 27:43.360
So you're sort of like, and I'm like, I was really blackout drunk.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.160
And I think part of maybe like, I don't know, I don't want to be like a drama queen, but

27:47.160 --> 27:52.000
I also want to be honest and try to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.640
What am I going through?

27:53.640 --> 27:57.000
Why am I in this weird state?

27:57.000 --> 28:05.240
We had our producer friend, Mike, who passed away and his wife was there at the premiere.

28:05.240 --> 28:08.440
I think maybe that like set me off.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.440
I don't know.

28:09.440 --> 28:15.280
That just seems like something that a fucking horrible drunk uses an excuse like I but you

28:15.280 --> 28:21.360
know, Jewel, like as I've said here before, she was the casting director on the first

28:21.360 --> 28:26.240
thing that Rob Schrab and I ever did for TV three decades ago or something.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.200
And it was just pure coincidence that her husband was the line producer in Rick and

28:29.200 --> 28:31.080
Morty.

28:31.080 --> 28:35.120
And then I hadn't seen her since the funeral and she was there at the premiere and I just

28:35.120 --> 28:46.880
like I can't I just I feel I texted her today like, like, can you have a drink with me?

28:46.880 --> 28:49.440
And she's like, no, I'm at work.

28:49.440 --> 28:56.200
And I'm like, I don't I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I keep I keep doing it wrong with

28:56.200 --> 28:57.200
this.

28:57.200 --> 29:05.920
Like, I was like, like, she was robbed of her husband, and I just have this shame, like

29:05.920 --> 29:13.600
I'm just filled with shame about it, because I feel like we take people from their private

29:13.600 --> 29:17.680
lives and we use them in TV and then that's like, it was for nothing.

29:17.680 --> 29:25.600
And as Justin said to me recently, it was like, do you think that if Mike knew that

29:25.600 --> 29:29.480
it was going to end that way that he would have shown up for a day of this shit?

29:29.480 --> 29:32.960
The answer is obviously, no, not at all, of course not.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.960
Like what the fuck?

29:33.960 --> 29:34.960
But I don't even know.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.520
And then to see her there was like, what the fuck are we doing?

29:38.520 --> 29:39.520
I don't know.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.720
It's super hard, man, and it's really hard to make sense of it.

29:42.720 --> 29:45.240
But I don't know if it's like, is this me grieving?

29:45.240 --> 29:46.240
Mm hmm.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.240
Yep.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.240
You sound so sure of it.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.240
I don't.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.240
I don't.

29:50.240 --> 29:51.240
Well, I mean, you know, I've grieved.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.240
If that's what it is.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.240
Grieved.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.240
You've grieved.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.240
I've grieved.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.240
I've grieved.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.240
A piece of shit.

29:57.240 --> 30:02.360
I love you.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.760
And that's how that's that's the way it works.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
It sucks.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
Who have you lost them?

30:06.760 --> 30:07.760
I'm an orphan, you know.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.260
Oh, you lost both your parents.

30:09.260 --> 30:13.400
Yeah, you brought them up earlier in the show.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.640
You mean when I wrapped it that I fucked your mama?

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
That's cold.

30:17.640 --> 30:18.640
Did you fuck?

30:18.640 --> 30:34.680
Brandon, no, I'm a very special Brandon, your mama, god damn, I fucked it.

30:34.680 --> 30:41.520
All right, it doesn't, it doesn't, sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, but it's not funny, but

30:41.520 --> 30:42.760
it is super.

30:42.760 --> 30:48.040
It is super hard to see you have a survivor's guilt, the part of it, and then it's super

30:48.040 --> 30:51.520
hard to see the passage of time when you lose somebody.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.200
You see that other people that loved them out of function like that, and you naturally

30:55.200 --> 30:56.640
look for Mike in that room.

30:56.640 --> 31:00.520
There's survivor's guilt and then there's murderer's guilt.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.840
Well you shouldn't have murdered him.

31:01.840 --> 31:02.840
Yeah.

31:02.840 --> 31:03.840
Yeah.

31:03.840 --> 31:07.040
I feel like I took him away from his family.

31:07.040 --> 31:11.800
He remember that he went on a trip right before and he had spent time glad he got to

31:11.800 --> 31:12.800
spend time.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.800
Yeah, I know.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.120
No, he was a great family man, great husband, great father.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
Yeah.

31:17.120 --> 31:24.920
He took as much of that away as I could, and for nothing, for nothing.

31:24.920 --> 31:29.240
Some people may say that the fact that he was great at his job made him a better family

31:29.240 --> 31:30.240
man.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
Yeah.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.240
Yeah, no.

31:32.240 --> 31:37.920
You may have provided like a full universe for a person to express themselves fully.

31:37.920 --> 31:42.600
If you looked at that room last night, that's what you saw, is that there's a room full

31:42.600 --> 31:48.280
of people who are standing around all agreeing, and that's what you've created.

31:48.280 --> 31:54.120
So the fact that Mike was a part of that, a massive part of that, is amazing, and it

31:54.120 --> 31:55.920
super sucks that he's gone.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
Yeah.

31:56.920 --> 32:02.680
I'm sorry, but I don't mean to like fucking draw it out and all that stuff, but I want

32:02.680 --> 32:05.600
to get to the bottom of it.

32:05.600 --> 32:10.680
That's the profane thing to me is the idea of like, it's this old Hollywood thing of

32:10.680 --> 32:18.000
like, yeah, what we do is so important that it's worth human life, and it's not like,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
I mean, that's...

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Well, nothing's worth that.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.480
But if you have to be stuck on this motherfucker, you might as well make a show like that.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.480
Yeah.

32:26.480 --> 32:27.480
Yeah.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.560
I mean, he chose the job, right?

32:30.560 --> 32:32.680
He probably could have quit.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.680
No.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.680
No.

32:34.680 --> 32:38.680
That's why this is so complicated.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.680
No, but like...

32:39.680 --> 32:44.560
Yeah, actually, we didn't tell, you know, that's, there was this controversial program.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.560
We...

32:45.560 --> 32:46.560
Yeah.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.560
We actually selected him for birth.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.560
Nick, how are you?

32:48.560 --> 32:50.680
What's it like growing up in New Jersey?

32:50.680 --> 32:54.800
Don't say that, and then I...

32:54.800 --> 32:56.560
I love growing up in New Jersey.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.200
Yeah, what was that like?

32:58.200 --> 33:01.600
I like it better than the old one.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.200
I didn't grow up in New Jersey.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
Okay.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.400
I grew up on the Coney Island Pier, which is not New Jersey, I don't think.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.400
You ever go out?

33:09.400 --> 33:10.400
Yeah.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.840
You grew up in New Jersey, you went on the Coney Island Pier.

33:12.840 --> 33:16.560
I was a carnival barker on the Coney Island Pier.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.080
Where were you born, Nick Rutherford?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.120
I was born in Tarzana, California.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
Are you shitting?

33:21.120 --> 33:22.120
Oh, damn.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.120
Fuck yeah.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.120
You're born in California, you're so funny.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.120
Damn.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.120
You got a living man?

33:26.120 --> 33:27.120
Yeah, I'm born in Southern...

33:27.120 --> 33:28.120
What?

33:28.120 --> 33:29.120
I don't...

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
I'm so confused.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.120
What?

33:31.120 --> 33:32.120
I...

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
Yeah.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.040
I feel like everyone here is from somewhere else, and then there's a bunch of people

33:36.040 --> 33:39.920
that are just like, yeah, I was born here, like, I'm a con artist.

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
Yeah.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.920
Well, maybe I'm just a funny con artist.

33:44.920 --> 33:49.240
I do feel like a con artist a lot of the time, you know.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.520
You're a lovely man.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.320
Thanks, Dan.

33:52.320 --> 33:57.440
I don't know you that well, but you've been very kind to me, you're very nice.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.640
Well, we've been hanging out, it's very fun to hang out with you.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.840
I trust you.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.960
We're into wings now.

34:03.960 --> 34:04.960
The show.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.960
Yeah.

34:05.960 --> 34:10.960
Well, we just felt like it was a bold choice to set a sitcom at an airport.

34:10.960 --> 34:19.960
Yeah, we got Drizzle Wings at BJs.

34:19.960 --> 34:23.840
I can't believe there's a restaurant called BJs.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.840
I worked at BJs.

34:25.840 --> 34:26.840
Yeah.

34:26.840 --> 34:27.840
Yeah.

34:27.840 --> 34:32.800
He's thinking about his mom again.

34:32.800 --> 34:33.800
Does anybody...

34:33.800 --> 34:34.800
Hood it.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.800
BJ.

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
Fuck no.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.800
Yeah.

34:37.800 --> 34:47.480
I worked at Brandon's restaurant, but yeah, we had Drizzle Wings, and is this good content?

34:47.480 --> 34:48.480
Yeah.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.480
Yeah.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.480
I mean, what kind of wings?

34:50.480 --> 34:53.200
Let's talk about are they those the root beer wings that they got over there at BJs?

34:53.200 --> 34:54.200
What?

34:54.200 --> 34:56.000
I think they have root beer wings at BJs now.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
No, we didn't have those.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.400
Oh, well, what were they drizzled with?

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
Root beer.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.400
Oh, yeah, they do have those.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.400
Well, you see.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.320
Well, that's just because you got me self-conscious now.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.320
Let's make sure...

35:05.320 --> 35:10.720
Let's bring out a celebrity guest here, Rufy McFamous.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.920
Hey, everybody.

35:14.920 --> 35:15.920
It's me.

35:15.920 --> 35:16.920
Rufy.

35:16.920 --> 35:17.920
What's up?

35:17.920 --> 35:18.920
Hey.

35:18.920 --> 35:27.960
Rufy, I understand you have a book or a movie coming out, yeah?

35:27.960 --> 35:28.960
What's that about?

35:28.960 --> 35:34.040
Just living life on the East Coast, hanging out.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.400
Is that kind of self-autobiographical?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.400
Yeah.

35:37.400 --> 35:38.400
Yeah.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.400
Okay.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.400
Do you want me to go?

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
No.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.400
Wait, what?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.400
Wait, are you...

35:43.400 --> 35:48.520
I know I'm not a guest, so you just made up a guest with a guitar pedal.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
Don't...

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
Rufy McCelebrity.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
You're ruining the...

35:51.520 --> 35:56.320
Don't tell people it's a guitar pedal.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.320
It doesn't even...

35:57.320 --> 35:58.320
It's not even a modulated voice.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.400
It's like two voices on top of each other.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.480
I can't even hear it.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.480
I don't even know.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
It's just...

36:04.480 --> 36:07.920
You just see Rufy that clearly.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.080
You guys, come on.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.080
I'm famous.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.480
I don't think that pedal is doing anything, honestly.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.480
Well, here's the thing.

36:17.480 --> 36:18.480
Here we are.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.480
Okay.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.480
It's me now more famous than ever.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.480
Oh, hey.

36:22.480 --> 36:26.480
I remember working with Meryl Streep on a car.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.480
Oh, what?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.480
On a car?

36:28.480 --> 36:30.480
Oh, you guys rebuilt the car.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.480
I built a car with Meryl Streep.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.480
I had four wheels.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.480
Oh, good.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.480
Fuck.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.480
This isn't easy.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.480
Being a guest on this show.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.480
No, you don't say.

36:44.480 --> 36:45.480
Anyways.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.480
Yeah.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.480
Famous.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.480
And I built a car.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.480
And I wrote a book about it.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.480
You got into a lot of trouble recently.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.480
Yeah.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.480
I got kind of rumbled on Twitter.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.480
Black Twitter.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Right.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.480
The funny one.

37:01.480 --> 37:05.480
People don't tell you that's a whole different Twitter.

37:05.480 --> 37:10.480
I love that that's what you think we call it.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.480
I knew you'd say that.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.480
That's what I got in trouble for.

37:16.480 --> 37:22.480
I said, I bet it's not called Black Twitter by black people on Twitter.

37:22.480 --> 37:26.480
And then Black Twitter got all upset.

37:26.480 --> 37:31.480
And I was like, whatever, snowflakes.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.480
Cocks.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.480
Cocks?

37:35.480 --> 37:37.480
Did I trigger you?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.480
Snowflake.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.480
Rufi, you're very right wing.

37:42.480 --> 37:45.480
Well, no, that's not true.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.480
And I don't mean to be a contrarian.

37:48.480 --> 37:53.480
But I'm more of a centrist.

37:53.480 --> 38:01.480
I like things the way they were when America was great.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.480
It just seems like a lot of, like,

38:03.480 --> 38:04.480
What?

38:04.480 --> 38:05.480
A lot of what?

38:05.480 --> 38:09.480
With that terminal, like, yeah.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.480
Are you Jewish?

38:11.480 --> 38:13.480
I don't even, I don't have to answer that.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.480
Because a lot of Jewish people think I'm right wing.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.480
But I'm not.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.480
That's just something Jews said.

38:19.480 --> 38:20.480
I find.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.480
Well, I'm not.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.480
I'm not Jewish.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.480
Well, you talk like a Jew.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.480
Well, no, I don't.

38:24.480 --> 38:25.480
Okay.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.480
Well, I'm not.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.480
What does a Jew talk like?

38:27.480 --> 38:30.480
I'm, well, I don't know because I'm centrist.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.480
Okay.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
I'm politically neutral.

38:32.480 --> 38:33.480
All right.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.480
You got me.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.480
I'm Jewish.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.480
Fine.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.480
You fucking Jew.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.480
I love it.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.480
I love you.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.480
You're going to get fucked on Jewish Twitter soon, man.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.480
Dude.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.480
Don't get me started.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.480
Player.

38:46.480 --> 38:47.480
Player.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.480
All right.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.480
Rufi, everybody.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.480
Okay.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.480
This is Rufi's publicist.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.480
Oh, fuck.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.480
It's too late and administrator.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.480
I am the administrator of black Twitter.

39:03.480 --> 39:07.480
And we're taking Rufi away now.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.480
What would you say?

39:09.480 --> 39:14.480
He just said it to a classic character for the past.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.480
Yeah at two and nine.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.480
This is a two and nine.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.480
You got excited.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.480
You were like, I get it.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.480
I don't believe at two and nine is Rufi McSlover.

39:23.480 --> 39:26.480
It's me at two and nine.

39:26.480 --> 39:30.480
If anybody wants to yell out a character name at any point, please.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.480
You know what's exciting was at new Meyer.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.480
Like did we did we talk about it when he was on the show?

39:35.480 --> 39:42.480
Like his his one of his kids is like a non binary activist like trans and

39:42.480 --> 39:48.480
autistic like act like you you name it they're an activist for it.

39:48.480 --> 39:55.480
And he wrote Robocop and since he was on the show like their kid who's

39:55.480 --> 39:57.480
like this crazy like not crazy.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.480
That's a bad word.

39:58.480 --> 39:59.480
Crazy.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.480
I meant extreme like like like like like super activist like into

40:03.480 --> 40:08.480
trans rights and stuff like they've heard my ed 209 bit that I did years

40:08.480 --> 40:12.480
ago where I was ed 209 and I was like but it was like ed 209 was gender

40:12.480 --> 40:17.480
fluid and they heard it and they liked it.

40:17.480 --> 40:23.480
And they would have a lot of reason not to like it.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.480
I think I'm pretty fucking woke.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.480
This is an amazing part of the show.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
I do fucking edgy shit.

40:28.480 --> 40:33.480
That's like funny to everybody and I never offend anyone.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.480
Okay, boomer.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.480
Oh, we did it.

40:38.480 --> 40:44.480
I did it was at 209 wasn't there the robot that was addicted to nuke.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.480
Right.

40:45.480 --> 40:51.480
That was that was the Frank Miller written sequel Robocop to you don't

40:51.480 --> 40:52.480
like it as much.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.480
Well, I mean you can't like it if you're a Robocop fan.

40:55.480 --> 41:00.480
I mean it's in a vacuum is pretty good movie.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.480
Actually, I would think maybe the little drug dealer kid.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.480
Yeah, the kid had never talked about that.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.480
He cursed.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.480
I can't believe we had a new mayor on the show.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.480
Well, now you have Nick Rutherford on the show.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.480
So what is it?

41:12.480 --> 41:20.480
What's it? What was it like being in a human giant?

41:20.480 --> 41:21.480
That's great.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.480
Is a Z's as funny as even funnier in person.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.480
Okay.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.480
Yeah, yeah.

41:28.480 --> 41:34.480
When you come up with your comedy.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.480
What are you smoking?

41:37.480 --> 41:39.480
Yeah, because some of these ideas man they're out there.

41:39.480 --> 41:42.480
What do you smoke it when you come up with some of this stuff?

41:42.480 --> 41:48.480
Yeah, just high on life and not Jesus, but the Jewish one.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.480
I guess not Jesus.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.480
Excuse me, Nick.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.480
It's me.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.480
Black Twitter.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.480
Oh, what's up?

42:00.480 --> 42:02.480
What's on my Twitter?

42:02.480 --> 42:05.480
You need to.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.480
Don't even.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.480
Don't come.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.480
You need to come with me.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.480
Oh, no.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.480
Where are we going?

42:14.480 --> 42:15.480
Come with me.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.480
Okay.

42:16.480 --> 42:22.480
At the same time.

42:22.480 --> 42:31.480
It's like an X-rated Harvey Corman.

42:31.480 --> 42:37.480
Are we walking or are you sucking me?

42:37.480 --> 42:41.480
Who says sucking me?

42:41.480 --> 42:43.480
What in the bot?

42:43.480 --> 42:46.480
What in the computer generated porn talk?

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
Yes.

42:47.480 --> 42:50.480
Keep sucking me.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.480
It flow.

42:51.480 --> 42:52.480
I like it.

42:52.480 --> 42:55.480
I feel like if you, everybody out there gets sucked tonight,

42:55.480 --> 42:57.480
maybe try saying that.

42:57.480 --> 43:02.480
Man, maybe try being specific.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.480
I was sucking you.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.480
I believe now.

43:07.480 --> 43:16.480
Oh, hey, throwing down a smoke pellet.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.480
Shit.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.480
Where's the door?

43:21.480 --> 43:24.480
God damn smoke pellets.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.480
I can't fucking shit.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.480
Fucking door won't open.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.480
Black Twitter here.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.480
I got it.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.480
Oh, thank you.

43:33.480 --> 43:35.480
Anyways.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.480
Black Twitter.

43:36.480 --> 43:37.480
Nice to meet you.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.480
Yeah.

43:38.480 --> 43:39.480
Pleasure.

43:39.480 --> 43:40.480
Bye.

43:40.480 --> 43:43.480
Uber.

43:43.480 --> 43:46.480
You've never called an Uber before.

43:46.480 --> 43:49.480
I've heard about it in popular culture.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.480
I assume that's how it works.

43:51.480 --> 43:54.480
Uber.

43:54.480 --> 43:59.480
Coming right up.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.480
Hello.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.480
Get in.

44:01.480 --> 44:04.480
Yes.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.480
Are you a random person?

44:07.480 --> 44:08.480
Yes.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.480
So it works like a cab?

44:10.480 --> 44:11.480
Yes.

44:11.480 --> 44:12.480
Wait.

44:12.480 --> 44:13.480
Why am I asking you?

44:13.480 --> 44:15.480
I don't know.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.480
It works like a cab?

44:16.480 --> 44:17.480
Yes.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.480
All right.

44:19.480 --> 44:24.480
Get in.

44:24.480 --> 44:32.480
Let me say on your settings that you prefer quiet and cool.

44:32.480 --> 44:42.480
But I have a band and I'd like to play some of their music if that's cool.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.480
Cool.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.480
Says you prefer cool.

44:46.480 --> 44:53.480
If you like cool, then let me introduce you to six feet under.

44:53.480 --> 44:58.480
My band.

44:58.480 --> 45:01.480
Me, me, me, me, me.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.480
Me, me, me, me, me.

45:03.480 --> 45:06.480
I don't know.

45:06.480 --> 45:09.480
Me, me, me, me, me.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.480
Me, me, me, me.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.480
What the fuck?

45:13.480 --> 45:14.480
I can't.

45:14.480 --> 45:22.480
I'm Black Twitter and I've, you would think I would be used to disappointment.

45:22.480 --> 45:38.480
in confusion. I do what the fuck. Just listen. Six feet under. So your band immediately

45:38.480 --> 45:48.480
released a song. Yeah, it's like Bad Company. Okay. Yeah, everyone's gonna get that reference.

45:48.480 --> 45:55.480
Oh, I'm sorry. It's like Phil Collins. Does he never had a son named Phil Collins? No,

45:55.480 --> 46:01.480
I don't. I don't think he ever said his name in any of his. Well, I don't think you choose

46:01.480 --> 46:13.480
whatever reference you want. Okay, Tori Amos. I am after all a black Twitter Tori Amos.

46:13.480 --> 46:30.480
What? Just listen to the thing. I'm sorry. They love it. Keep going. Six feet under.

46:30.480 --> 46:37.480
We want to know how this is going. Going long and strong. Six feet under. You're

46:37.480 --> 46:49.480
in a grave, but you won't be buried long. I am six feet under. That's cool. Black Twitter came

46:49.480 --> 46:59.480
around. Everyone expects black Twitter to not be into white people. Shit. I like this band.

46:59.480 --> 47:08.480
I love it. I love six feet under. Good. You want to go see them in concert? Yes. Okay.

47:08.480 --> 47:19.480
Here we go. Three hours later. That'll be seven hundred dollars. God damn it.

47:19.480 --> 47:30.480
They were performing in like Arizona. Yep. That's cool.

47:30.480 --> 47:40.480
Six feet under. They're Irish. I think they're Australian.

47:40.480 --> 47:52.480
Everything's Irish. Jamaican. Alright. That's not going anywhere.

47:52.480 --> 48:01.480
Okay. Well, anyway, so it's kind of a show, but not a show. Six feet under. No, this.

48:01.480 --> 48:08.480
This is kind of, I mean, this feels like a show. I think we did good so far. Yeah, I think we did good.

48:08.480 --> 48:16.480
How's Harmon Quest going? Oh, it's done. We put it out already, and it's in the hands of the people.

48:16.480 --> 48:24.480
You got any numbers on that? Did you retain the office's ratings? No. That was always the metric when I

48:24.480 --> 48:30.480
was your age. Yeah. That makes sense. How much of the office did you retain? I don't think any of it.

48:30.480 --> 48:36.480
Okay. Well, you failed then. Yeah. We're moving you to 8 p.m. Good luck. I mean, that sounds great.

48:36.480 --> 48:44.480
Well, okay. CBS thinks so, too. Fuck off. Oh shit. Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.

48:44.480 --> 48:52.480
Steve Levy looking wonderful tonight. Doing a big hug. Jesus. That's how drunk I am.

48:52.480 --> 48:57.480
That's Levy brought out the booze like an hour into the show instead of 20 minutes.

48:57.480 --> 49:03.480
He was like, maybe this, maybe this will help. I don't know. Just more alcohol.

49:03.480 --> 49:11.480
We get to start booking real guess per se. All right. No, he's back.

49:11.480 --> 49:20.480
Go up. Hey Nick, when it comes to cities, Tarzana, not being from California, Tarzana, you have a rivalry with

49:20.480 --> 49:28.480
what city? Well, I Jane, Jane, Janesville. Yeah, civilization.

49:28.480 --> 49:36.480
Well, I didn't grow up in Tarzana. I grew up in Thousand Oaks. Okay. So I was born in the valley raised in Ventura County.

49:36.480 --> 49:40.480
Thousand Oaks is great. I grew up in Moore Park and when you wanted to have fun, you would go to Thousand Oaks,

49:40.480 --> 49:47.480
or if you wanted to not have very much fun, you go to CV Valley. Yeah, CV Valley is like more kind of funkier.

49:47.480 --> 49:55.480
The thing I know about CV Valley is they had an outlier in terms of per capita incest rates

49:55.480 --> 50:02.480
and an outlier and the shows back on track. Ladies and gentlemen, thank Christ. What did you get here by bus?

50:02.480 --> 50:07.480
Holy shit entertainment finally arrived. Yeah, no, but all the cool people went to Thousand Oaks.

50:07.480 --> 50:13.480
That's where the mall was more. Oh God. Oh God. Yeah. Hey guys, how did you find out about the incest thing

50:13.480 --> 50:18.480
and then what are the what are the numbers? I looked at the census. No, I don't know.

50:18.480 --> 50:26.480
I ran the numbers. It's on there. Like welcome to see me son. It was it. Yeah, it says population, but really population.

50:26.480 --> 50:30.480
Twenty thousand five thousand incest.

50:30.480 --> 50:36.480
What are we going to confront the fact pornographically that literally everyone is getting online and

50:36.480 --> 50:42.480
like good, like it's like stupid fucking there. Step four. And hub is this beautiful thing where they like they can report

50:42.480 --> 50:48.480
these numbers. They go happy St. Patrick's Day. Here's how many people search for leprechaun rape. Yeah.

50:48.480 --> 50:53.480
And it's like, it's like, it's like, what's his name? Kinsey. Like, like that's what we had back in the day was that

50:53.480 --> 51:01.480
Kinsey guy, like, like who basically just represented to everyone is like, Hey, whatever you're thinking, like, no one's normal.

51:01.480 --> 51:09.480
That was that was his contribution to mankind. And that's kind of what porn hub represents. Yeah, it's like they're like,

51:09.480 --> 51:19.480
Hey, everybody, you're all searching for incest porn. All of you. Well, that's all there is. I heard someone say that that the

51:19.480 --> 51:27.480
increase, like the attention towards incest porn signaled a deep lack of connection felt by the user base. Everyone is feeling

51:27.480 --> 51:35.480
super isolated and they don't have any sort of connections to draw upon. So, you know, when you kind of eroticize that,

51:35.480 --> 51:43.480
you know, like the truest form of a bond is someone who's already here. But I find that this is going to sound silly, but I

51:43.480 --> 51:51.480
find that incredibly unscientific. Oh, no, that's philosophical. Very easily say philosophically that no, it's the opposite,

51:51.480 --> 51:59.480
like that people are too connected with their families. Well, I connected. Here's a sample size of one, but I hate everyone

51:59.480 --> 52:08.480
in my family and I love incest porn. So, you know, I guess that's also not scientific. It's just taboo, right? It's like,

52:08.480 --> 52:17.480
well, that's part of it. It's like you got to I think it's like, but my biggest question is, does sex have to be taboo?

52:17.480 --> 52:22.480
That's my huge question. Like, could you have a good money?

52:22.480 --> 52:30.480
Could humankind, if they were given an infinite sandbox, if they were given total permission and there was no such thing as taboo,

52:30.480 --> 52:45.480
would sexuality, my speculation, my gut tells me that sex is not automatically tied to naughtiness.

52:45.480 --> 52:54.480
And it's just it's not even American. It's just like human, like homo sapien, like we kind of we just have this thing like,

52:54.480 --> 53:01.480
oh, it's naughty because we're so into it. And part of what we're into is the naughtiness. It's like putting your thumb over a garden hose

53:01.480 --> 53:04.480
and like makes it spray more.

53:04.480 --> 53:07.480
This is how you jerk off. That's how I do it.

53:07.480 --> 53:18.480
The inhibition is what drives things. But I don't think that that thumb needs to be there. I think there's a version of humanity that just flows out of the hose.

53:18.480 --> 53:25.480
Well, I think taboo taboo is attractive the same way it's attractive to touch a hot stove. It's like, I know I can't do that.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.480
So I want to. But it's like, so that's part of what's important.

53:28.480 --> 53:34.480
But I don't think I think that's a human inclination that then goes and ties in with our shame towards sex and stuff.

53:34.480 --> 53:39.480
But yeah, I think that we would still seek out various forms of taboo if sex weren't taboo, but it wouldn't be.

53:39.480 --> 53:46.480
There's another function of taboo that I think when I explore it myself, I go like, why is that I'm thinking about this fucked up shit?

53:46.480 --> 53:49.480
You know, when I have so much permission to do whatever I want.

53:49.480 --> 53:56.480
I like, why am I continually going to like bad places where I'm not supposed to be going to grab that officer's gun?

53:56.480 --> 54:00.480
That's all I think about.

54:00.480 --> 54:04.480
Hot stoves and I don't know what I got to do with it.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.480
But once I have it, then I'll know.

54:07.480 --> 54:14.480
And I think the answer is because as human beings, as animals, we want to just engage in sex.

54:14.480 --> 54:19.480
We want to have fun with sex, but we work with each other.

54:19.480 --> 54:23.480
We wear neckties. We go like, oh, can I take your order, please?

54:23.480 --> 54:30.480
We have alphabets. We don't just fuck to make up words. We don't just shit in the street.

54:30.480 --> 54:31.480
We go in toilets.

54:31.480 --> 54:42.480
And so we, as human beings, as sentient mammals, we don't even trust ourselves to be fully sexual unless we build a wall around it.

54:42.480 --> 54:48.480
We need it to be private or we don't really actually trust that it's erotic.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.480
Or intimate.

54:49.480 --> 54:52.480
I mean, that's the other component of it is that because it's intimacy, it's got to be hidden.

54:52.480 --> 54:55.480
So there is this automatic built-in naughty, right?

54:55.480 --> 54:57.480
It's because you're eating chocolate.

54:57.480 --> 55:02.480
Well, it's kind of like how many friendships are based off of this moment where you take each other aside and you're like,

55:02.480 --> 55:04.480
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

55:04.480 --> 55:09.480
It's like naughty. There's something. It's like shit talking to a third friend or some situation you're both in.

55:09.480 --> 55:19.480
It's like, it's that it is the fact that you're not supposed to be saying what you're saying that actually makes what you're going through sincere.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.480
Yes.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.480
And there's something really funny about that.

55:23.480 --> 55:37.480
It equates to me with that feral pig thing where the reason feral pigs are a problem is because there are people who are incentivized to hunt feral pigs.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.480
And so they're breeding the pigs.

55:39.480 --> 55:46.480
Like if you really wanted feral pigs to go away, you should make it not legal to hunt them.

55:46.480 --> 55:56.480
Whereas if you really wanted taboo sexuality to go away, you should accept that sexuality is what it is.

55:56.480 --> 55:59.480
Because people then be like, okay, I'm allowed to be sexual.

55:59.480 --> 56:04.480
But it's like, for my money, I find myself with Cody.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.480
My mind will wander.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.480
I'm like, why is my mind wandering when I'm with Cody?

56:08.480 --> 56:10.480
We're already filthy enough.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.480
We get up to enough bad shit.

56:13.480 --> 56:24.480
And I'm like, oh, it's because you want to trick your brain into only focusing on the primal sexuality.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.480
Like you trust it then.

56:25.480 --> 56:33.480
You're like, well, there's no way this has anything to do with anything other than my dick then if this is what's going on.

56:33.480 --> 56:35.480
I nailed it.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.480
It's drywall.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.480
Taboo is drywall.

56:39.480 --> 56:44.480
It's just like it's a taboo's drywall.

56:44.480 --> 56:46.480
We proved it.

56:46.480 --> 56:50.480
I think you kind of hit on it that you have a little secret.

56:50.480 --> 56:51.480
People bond over secrets.

56:51.480 --> 56:54.480
They bond over something that they can withhold from other people.

56:54.480 --> 56:57.480
And that is, in a way, connection.

56:57.480 --> 57:00.480
Also, can we get back to touching the hot stove?

57:00.480 --> 57:01.480
I'll get there.

57:01.480 --> 57:03.480
What do you want to talk about it?

57:03.480 --> 57:06.480
I am so afraid of getting burnt.

57:06.480 --> 57:10.480
I got burnt making popcorn.

57:10.480 --> 57:11.480
Yeah.

57:11.480 --> 57:12.480
And that's the story.

57:12.480 --> 57:17.480
Well, do you have the thing where when you're up high, you picture yourself jumping off?

57:17.480 --> 57:18.480
Yes, I do have that.

57:18.480 --> 57:25.480
I think the human mind has this mechanism, and it's a survival mechanism, where it's kind of like flashcards.

57:25.480 --> 57:28.480
It runs through scenarios and then has visceral reaction to that.

57:28.480 --> 57:31.480
And those cement the connections on our brain.

57:31.480 --> 57:34.480
And so you think of jumping off a cliff, and then you're like, bad.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.480
That's scary.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.480
And you're like, okay.

57:36.480 --> 57:40.480
If I'm in a situation where that actually comes up, or remember that feels terrible, and I won't do it.

57:40.480 --> 57:47.480
The same with grabbing a cop's gun or, you know, like you keep wedging that in there, man.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.480
That's the kind of thing.

57:48.480 --> 57:53.480
Whenever I see a cop, I'm like, man, I could just sucker punch it right in the neck.

57:53.480 --> 57:56.480
What do you do with it?

57:56.480 --> 57:58.480
You're only going to seal your own death.

57:58.480 --> 58:02.480
Like that's the only thing that could come of that, but it's something I think about all the time.

58:02.480 --> 58:03.480
I can't stop.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.480
We know, we know.

58:05.480 --> 58:10.480
But yeah, like so I think there's a lot of shameful thoughts we have, and then we have guilt associated with it,

58:10.480 --> 58:19.480
but it's like you having that thought and then that reaction is you affirming like your ethical nature or something, you know,

58:19.480 --> 58:24.480
and I think that's I think people think those thoughts and they're like, oh, this is so violent or something.

58:24.480 --> 58:32.480
This is I'm so fucked up, but it's like no, you're revolts by that, and that's because like that's your brain reminding you to not be a sociopath.

58:32.480 --> 58:37.480
Because if you're like, oh man, that actually seems like a fine thing to do with no consequences.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.480
That means your brain doesn't work right.

58:39.480 --> 58:43.480
I feel like the worst elements among us are constantly using like naturalism.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.480
We've talked about this before.

58:45.480 --> 58:52.480
They act like if they can conceive of the idea that it would be natural or people have a natural inclination.

58:52.480 --> 58:58.480
It's like, aha, that's proof like women do this and you know it ladies don't fucking deny it.

58:58.480 --> 59:04.480
Ah, we proved it. It's like, yeah, but you people take shits, but you do it in a toilet because if you did it in the street,

59:04.480 --> 59:05.480
we don't get sick.

59:05.480 --> 59:08.480
Yeah, natural natural. It's called like the naturalism fallacy.

59:08.480 --> 59:14.480
It's a classic logical fallacy that people use to try and excuse behavior, but it just doesn't hold up most of the time because

59:14.480 --> 59:18.480
well, like you said, like we built a toilet because shitting is natural.

59:18.480 --> 59:22.480
Like it's like and we are fucking 80 instead of 50 because of it.

59:22.480 --> 59:24.480
Yeah, exactly. So natural isn't good.

59:24.480 --> 59:27.480
Yeah, but their whole premises natural is better than unnatural.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.480
It doesn't make any set like alphabets aren't natural.

59:30.480 --> 59:32.480
No, we fucking made that shit up.

59:32.480 --> 59:36.480
Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy to think that all the words are made up.

59:36.480 --> 59:38.480
See it's crazy. Yeah.

59:38.480 --> 59:43.480
Yeah, come on. Come on with E. Yeah.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.480
Yeah, come on. Yeah.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.480
I do that than F. I like F.

59:47.480 --> 59:49.480
I mean, okay.

59:49.480 --> 59:53.480
Well, it's pretty cool, but G H.

59:53.480 --> 59:55.480
This is like your egg.

59:55.480 --> 59:57.480
Big H fan over there.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480
Okay, I loves H.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.480
I like, you know, bonobo monkeys.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.480
Yeah, you know what they love incest.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480
Yeah.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.480
And if I can gang or G's.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.480
Yeah, they they it's like conflict resolution.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480
They love winky fencing.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.480
They are genetically our look it up the closest animal to us.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.480
That's also another species.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480
We are bonobo.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.480
I'm very fascinated by it, but we they don't have religion or like, you know,

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.480
Protestantism telling you like, don't this is the limit.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480
That was the biggest word I know.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.480
Don't, you know, don't you gross.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.480
Oh, you grabbed a booby that's gross.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.480
Don't touch up.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480
Yeah.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.480
You know what bonobos do and they get in the fucking tussle over a banana.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480
They suck each other off.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.480
Yeah, they have orgies.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.480
There's they that's their breakdown.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.480
One of the bonobos is like, oh, you're sucking me right now.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.480
Yeah, they're like, they're like, like two bonobo tribes are like,

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.480
there's only so much fresh water here.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.480
I got an idea.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.480
And then someone's like, all right, it's go time.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.480
And then they just all fucking suck.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.480
And then they wake up and they're like, we can share the water.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.480
Yeah.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.480
What the fuck, man?

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.480
Like, let's all agree.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.480
The only reason we wanted water is so we could hydrate so we could do this.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.480
More fucking and goddamn, you're a great sucker.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480
That's my sister.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480
There's my cousin.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480
There's my uncle Glenn.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.480
We're doing it fucking upside down.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:30.480
Scientists were studying bonobos like there's a there's a huge like lag behind the scientific

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:36.480
study of them because in the fifties, people were just like they kept like noting their

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480
behavior and not writing it down.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.480
Literally, they were just like, well, that's fucked up.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480
I can't write that down.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.480
That's crazy.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.480
I can't tell my wife what I watched today.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.480
And that is the generation primatologist, not a pornographer.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.480
Yeah.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480
Right.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480
And they would just go, well, that's an outlier.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.480
It turns out we are the outliers.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480
That is what we are.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.480
We want to fuck and suck, baby.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480
That's it.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.480
That's all we have to do to live is eat and fuck.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.480
That's it.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.480
But Desmond Morris says, well, then we had to compete with wolves.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.480
So like the other part of us is like, we have this pack mentality, this alpha mentality.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.480
Like we're ashamed of our fucking sucky part.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.480
Like we hate, we hate how communist we are.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.480
We hate that we just want to groom each other and lick each other's tits.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:32.480
We don't like it because it suggests to us that we're going to die, which is not an unfounded

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.480
belief, genetically, because our primate cousins are like dying.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.480
And we are-

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.480
But they're dying because they didn't invent drywall.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.480
Well, I mean, they're dying not really because of us.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.480
They're dying because it's hard to have a planet that's so lush that its equator can support

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.480
this fucking giant, tailless ape that doesn't climb trees anymore because it's too heavy

01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:01.480
and just hangs out and wipes its ass with its hand and fucking howls at the moon.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.480
It's like a flash on the pan.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.480
But the version of those primates that experimented with this weird forebrain, that's us, and

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.480
here we are going strong.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.480
We're ashamed of our animal nature.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.480
We hate the part of us that would save our lives right now.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.480
We hate that we just want to chill.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.480
And if we just held ourselves to the standard that we had when we were chimpanzees, we could fucking save the world.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.480
But we have this compulsion.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480
We're just like, yeah, but what about my iPhone?

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480
What about the fucking smokestacks?

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480
What about the rocket ships?

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.480
What about fighting this other person?

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:48.480
You told me, Brandon, at one point, we're still genetically acting like we're competing over resources.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.480
Yeah, scarcity.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:57.480
At the end of the day, we go through all this technology and we get to these great heights,

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:04.480
but there's always two floors of breast augmentation and one floor for sick kids with cancer because we're monkeys.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.480
And we're just like, Titty, oh, Titty, make Titty room.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480
Gotta make Titty floor.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.480
Titty floor, like, well, your kid's sick.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.480
I know my kid's sick, Titty, Titty, Titty.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.480
Got a Titty shiny monkey banana, more banana.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.480
And you can tell monkeys this is going to be awful for you.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.480
This piece of technology is going to be awful for you, whether it's breast augmentation or a cell phone screen.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.480
And they're like, yeah, but Titty.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.480
Yeah, but can you imagine a monkey with tits?

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.480
That would be fucking hell.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.480
If you could just talk to a chimpanzee.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.480
If chimpanzees could talk, that would be, if you could teach one to talk, not sign language, none of that bullshit.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.480
Oh, okay, not sign language bullshit.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.480
All right, sorry, deaf people that listen to the podcast.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480
We're going to lift that.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.480
They're going to hear you laugh and it's going to be fucked up.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.480
Yeah, you guys fucked you.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.480
Yeah, that's on you guys. That was a test.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.480
Yeah, whoever's signing you guys to them, it's on you guys.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.480
If a chimpanzee could actually have a sentient conversation with us, that would be, that's what we need.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.480
The atonement with the fire.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.480
We have that. It's called the president.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.480
Yeah.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.480
No, no, that's a fucking wolf. That guy's a fucking jagoff.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:28.480
A chimpanzee would go, okay, what's all this ruckus? What are you guys doing? What's happening?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.480
And we'd be like, we're trying to save the earth.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.480
We got ass.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.480
From what? Spotted leopards, giraffes, ants?

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.480
Like, what is it? A chimpanzee would be like, what the fuck is your problem? Calm down.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.480
And we'd be like, no, no, no, it's these people in Saudi Arabia and they're doing like,

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.480
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.480
Like, what are you so fucking panicked about?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.480
But they're tribal.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.480
Yeah, they literally war.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.480
Yeah, chimpanzees are gnarly.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.480
But they're just as worried as we are just about, you know.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.480
All right, well, you guys are taking it a little more literally.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.480
All the monkey mad because we told them to be a monkey.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.480
Yeah, I know if we could talk to an actual monkey that they'd be inferior to us culturally.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.480
You know what you should do is rip that guy's head open and ease his brain.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.480
That'll solve the problem.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:19.480
I just mean, I'm saying like, like us minus the thing that separates us from chimps,

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.480
which is like this fucking compulsion to reach for the stars.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.480
We are no, our stars are shit.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:32.480
If we could just, if we were just to take a one breath and go, what if we just as a litmus test,

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.480
what if we just for one second held ourselves to the standard of the chimpanzee.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.480
And fuck frogs.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480
Yeah.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:48.480
And like, which would define a frog as a great Saturday afternoon and which would define indoors as a fucking miracle

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.480
because we control the weather.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.480
Like a chimpanzee that could make a house would be a chimpanzee that wouldn't make war.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.480
A chimpanzee, they would be like, fuck, why are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.480
But they do, they make, they make like leave houses and leave beds.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480
And they, they,

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.480
I think what you're saying is, I don't know, I keep coming back to more and more in my life

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.480
than like humans are driven to strive.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480
We like being in conflicts.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.480
We like, we have a goal and we go for this goal.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.480
But then you hit that goal and you're like, well, this fucking sucks.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480
I hate this.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.480
I hate myself.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.480
Nothing has changed.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.480
I still want to die.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.480
We're afflicted as a species.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.480
Yeah.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.480
But I think that, so like if you could like go to therapy and work that out, but it's like,

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480
every human has that.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.480
And I think that's evolutionary because it's like, oh man, I just got to jump over this cliff.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.480
So I get away from the wolf and like a couple of people survived and passed down that trait.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.480
And it's like, I'm really good under serious pressure.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.480
And I only feel like alive under pressure.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.480
And once I accomplish the thing that I evolutionarily am allowed to accomplish, I don't feel better

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.480
because evolution wants me to keep going, keep doing those same things and keep propagating

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480
the species.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480
But that just makes us all miserable.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:00.480
Like if you put a spider in an aquarium full of flies, like, and it was like, I got to

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.480
build a web.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480
I got to build a web.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.480
And you'd be like, dude, you don't have to build a web.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.480
And the spider would be like, what are you talking about?

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480
How am I going to catch all these flies?

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480
No, the flies are right there.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:14.480
Like if the spider could just understand and cheat the system and go, oh, the flies are

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:21.480
there, I'll save all of this biological energy that God gave me, like, that my metabolism

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:27.480
is so high because it expects my ass to like crank out silk.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.480
What if the spider was aware enough to go, yeah, but I don't have to do that.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.480
There's a bucket of flies here.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.480
That's the situation that we could be in.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.480
You assume that the web is built to catch the flies, not that he is a compulsion to build

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.480
the web without knowing its relation to the flies.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480
What?

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.480
Yeah, that is it.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480
Wow.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.480
Because that is the human experience.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480
Yeah, we just got to do it.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.480
Well, that's what, yeah, I agree with you there.

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.480
That's the thing.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:09:04.480
Skyscrapers, space programs, alphabets, eyeglasses, insulin, podcasts, Oprah, Tom Hanks, toothpicks.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480
Oh, see the toothpick?

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.480
Oh, we didn't start the fire.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.480
I like this.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.480
All of it is like a web we're spinning, like humans.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480
Crazy.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.480
And we have ourselves convinced that we're like making these decisions.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480
We're not at all.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.480
Obviously it's compulsive behavior or we wouldn't fucking do the shit that we do.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.480
It's obviously compulsive, obviously.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.480
And we, but we measure intelligence by this thing where we go like, well, if you know

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.480
what you're doing and then you choose to do it, that means it's your choice.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.480
That's horse shit.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.480
We're not, we're not choosing shit, Jack.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.480
Nick, it's a little bit like your books coming out, right?

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.480
You're gonna write a chapter.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.480
Yeah, I've lived with the bonobos for a year and we would just suck and fuck each other

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480
all the time.

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480
I don't know.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.480
Yeah, I drank since 10 a.m. and how much do you think you drank?

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:02.480
And we know how long you drank, but how much 75,000 units of alcohol.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.480
That might be right.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.480
How are you still able to do all this?

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.480
It's called functional alcoholism and it's like the most dangerous kind.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.480
Did you see Denzel Washington in flight?

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.480
Yeah, he saved all those people.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.480
Yeah, those people are so pissed.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480
He's a goddamn hero.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.480
That's why that movie is so important because Denzel has nobody.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.480
He's the only one holding himself accountable at the end.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.480
He could fly a plane upside down and he could get away with drinking while flying.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.480
And then finally at the end, he alone has to be like, nah, dude, fuck you.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480
I'm drunk.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.480
I really was bummed by that ending.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.480
I don't know what that says about me.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.480
I'll never watch that movie again, but I will forever say that was such a...

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:51.480
In the world of cinematic portrayals of alcoholism, that is like the fucking end all be all.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.480
That and McNulty and the wire.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.480
Like when he would get drunk, McNulty.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480
McNulty?

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
Fuck you guys.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
On the wire?

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480
The wire.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480
Come on.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480
Jesus Christ.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480
The wire.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480
David Simon?

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.480
Oh my God, they just turned on me so hard.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.480
The whole audience is over it.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.480
I'm sorry, there wasn't a dragon in it.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.480
Fucking nerd.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.480
I've never, I didn't watch Game of Thrones either.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.480
I watch Wings.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480
Yeah.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480
Laris.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480
God damn it.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480
Laris.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480
Where are my wing heads at?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.480
Nolan, our director really wants Wings.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.480
Let's see him flap them.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:35.480
Let's meet one friend who really genuinely feels like they deserve attention.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.480
I'm proud of you guys.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480
That was an amazing response.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480
This dude has a sign.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:48.480
It says, give me 90 seconds to speak.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480
Oh no.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.480
Well, if they made a sign, let's find out what it's about.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480
Come on.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.480
Come on, sign guy.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.480
Yeah, he got to come up because he got to come up.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480
I'm sorry.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480
It's a style audience.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480
He made a sign.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480
Who came from the farthest?

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Because there's a lot of people in town for the last couple.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480
Florida, who's farther than Florida?

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.480
We have anybody from Italy, Germany.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.480
Man, Germany, y'all always fuck up when y'all get up here,

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480
but we might fuck with you later.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480
What's your name, friend?

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.480
This guy's like the perfect version of me.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480
Yeah.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480
Laris.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.480
This is so fucked up.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.480
He's like airbrushed you.

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.480
I like the tired and sick next to him.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.480
It's fucking shirts open.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.480
He took a Photoshop tool and just went for 25.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480
Yes.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
Yeah.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
Damn it.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480
He probably sings.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480
There's that's another good guess.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.480
Yeah.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.480
What's your name, friend?

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480
My name is Pele.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.480
Pele is named after the soccer player.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480
Yeah.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.480
Oh, Pele.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480
Yeah, my dad was a big soccer fan.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480
To the audience.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.480
I waited for like a moment where he asked.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.480
I didn't just raise it.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480
No.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480
You gotta forgive us.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480
Wait.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480
This is a sign guy?

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480
This is a sign guy.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480
I feel pretty good then.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.480
Everybody relax.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.480
I very much respect our audiences like skepticism about people that come up.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.480
Like, yeah, you're right.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480
That's good.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.480
You're going like, hey, look, I'm not like some crazy person that just really thinks

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480
they're entitled to it.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.480
That's what the audience worries about.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480
Like, oh, don't.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480
Don't.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.480
I could have been up there and I didn't go up there.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.480
Well, you just can't go up there because you want to be up there.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480
You're humble and you've done it.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480
You nailed it.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480
Now you can do whatever you want.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480
Be racist.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480
I'm mixed race.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.480
That would be a strange choice for me.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480
So it would be OK.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.480
So racist to say that.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.480
I don't see mixed race.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.480
What did your sign say?

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.480
The idea that mixed race people can't be racist.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.480
I find really offensive as a white person.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.480
What did your sign say?

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.480
It was kind of over promising because I thought that I could like weave together

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.480
some like disparate ideas.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.480
The sign said, give me 90 seconds and I can offer a fulfilling conclusion.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.480
You had 60 seconds right now.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480
Sorry, 90.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.480
90 seconds.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480
You had 60 seconds right now.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.480
I got people from Germany wanting to get up here, bro.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480
You better hurry up.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480
I'm from Canada.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480
That makes a difference.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480
I got lost for years.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480
You're so handsome.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480
You're like handsome Nick Rutherford.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.480
Don't let him thwart you.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.480
You got 30 more seconds.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.480
Firstly, I want to thank you for doing what you do, not just for this and for Harmonie.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.480
It's not always easy, but I do it for the people.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.480
I appreciate that.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.480
Also for opening up your platform over the years, I've been listening to you for a while

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.480
to people who wouldn't otherwise be heard, regular people like myself and socialists

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.480
and minorities and you're using your soft power, your platform to allow people to talk.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.480
You're welcome.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.480
But shouldn't he use his hard power?

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.480
Doesn't it feel like...

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.480
Did you say soft power?

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480
Is that a phrase?

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.480
Yeah, I'm a political theorist.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480
That's why I wanted to talk.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.480
Oh, really?

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480
What does soft power mean?

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.480
So soft power is everything that's not hard power.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.480
Get the fluff off the stage!

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.480
I got academia.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480
I got it.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480
You just survived for six years.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:15.480
So hard power is like guns and money, it's military might and the straight up actual

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.480
capital P power, whereas soft power is diplomacy and yeah, hegemonic forces, cultural forces.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.480
Like if your country has all the movies.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.480
Right, or if you are a person who runs shows that are in the zeitgeist and you have some

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480
soft power.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480
What did you want to say?

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480
Or if you happen to be...

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480
I sidetracked him.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480
I sidetracked him.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
You've got to be better than that.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480
You get up here.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480
What did you want to say?

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480
Right, sure.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.480
So I am a little flustered, you might imagine, right now.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.480
Unacceptable.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.480
Sitting next to me.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.480
It's got to be hard.

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.480
I run a tight ship.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.480
Don't take photos of this guy.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480
Take photos of Nick.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480
That would be next to him.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480
It's like a before and after.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.480
These are like faces of meth right here.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480
Hey, get in there man.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480
Get in there.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.480
Okay, we know.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:08.480
So you've, over the years I've watched as you've gone from being a centrist...

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.480
Hey man, give me security.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.480
Sorry.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480
Give me security.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:20.680
Anarchist leaning a political person into sort of recognizing your role as you quoted

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.480
the world shifted under your fees.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.480
And I just think that you've gone on a lot of rants.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.480
I've seen you existentially worry about the state of politics and power, but you've never

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.680
like delves into actually political theory.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.960
So I just wanted to get one idea out to your brain.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.960
That's what I wanted to do.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
Oh go for it.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960
Nazism.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.480
Give it a shot.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.320
Mixed race Nazism.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.320
Hear me out.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.480
Actually is practical.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.820
This is the race that will dominate eventually.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.980
It makes sense.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.400
It's what God wants.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.860
Mixed race Nazism.

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.860
It works.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:04.860
Sorry.

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.360
Let's get back in there Pelley.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360
Let's get back.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360
Yeah, okay.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360
I'm back.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360
All right.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360
You see Rutherford had you on the ropes.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360
Murdered you out there.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360
It's a penalty time Pelley.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360
Come on.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.480
Essentially it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like you are recognizing the

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.480
issues of late stage capitalism.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.480
You know they booed Drake off stage last night.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.360
I'm going to let you know what LA will do to you unless you get into that second song

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.560
we all want to hear.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560
Now let's go.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560
Okay.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560
And it seems like-

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560
But I do have a flush drum.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560
That's not fair.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560
I feel bad for it.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.560
No.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560
Like say whatever you want.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560
This is a really long 90 seconds.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560
I'm sorry.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560
Do it.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.360
And it seems like that to some degree you circle around the idea of anarchism as the alternative.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:57.360
And what that is doing is taking a corrupt and outdated mode of power or power structure

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.160
and then replacing it with a lack of power instead of fixing the power structure or evolving

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160
it.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160
Yeah.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160
I agree with you totally.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160
No.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
I'm saying that that doesn't work because of the nature-

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160
Oh, wait.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160
I disagree with you.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160
No.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.160
Wait.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160
Yeah.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160
Okay.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160
Sorry.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.160
Continue.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160
Yeah.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.960
So what I'm trying to say is that anarchy is impossible because of the maximum of power.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.600
The essential nature of what power is is that it looks to concretize itself, to cement

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.560
itself, to understand itself, and it doesn't go away like that.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.200
So you need to fix the power structure, not dissolve the power structure.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.000
It sounds nice in theory because it's like, oh, hey, everybody is on equal footing and

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.080
everybody has equal power, but it's just what you're doing by the dissolution of political

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.600
power is not empowering people.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.160
You empower people by having a political power that is powerful enough to give power to the

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160
people.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.160
Yeah.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.160
That is anarchist.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.400
We don't tend to roll non-hierarchically.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:59.840
We tend to, no matter what, you give us an infinite sandbox, you give us a bunch of mushrooms.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.480
Hierarchies tend to happen because we're primates.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.080
We tend to fucking start leveraging each other and exchanging things, and people tend to

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.920
rise up and you go, hey, is it me or is that guy more awesome than that guy?

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.320
You kind of start to compare things.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320
Why would you say that?

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.920
Why was that the example you gave?

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.040
I mean, I think I thought, yeah, I used to, I was way left of Noam Chomsky when we started

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.120
this podcast because I was like, I had that privilege.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.120
I never cared.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.880
I thought all politics was horseshit because it was dangling chads and are you going to

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.440
convince me Al Gore is any different from fucking George Bush and all my fucking bullshit?

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:46.120
And then we went through, we sure showed me.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.880
We really showed me a thing or two.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880
Politics is not bullshit.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.040
It actually is a thing.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:56.960
Because both parties, admirably or not, they both got hacked at the same time.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:04.040
The Democrats got hacked by, quote unquote, socialists just to oversimplify and the Republicans

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.240
got hacked to oversimplify Nazis because they were both smart enough to go, we're not going

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.800
to suffer the third party fate.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800
What happened?

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800
It was just this creed.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.880
The politics became real politics and then once it did, I was like, oh shit, I guess

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.480
I can't be an anarchist anymore.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.320
I really can't because you actually have a bipartisan system that actually means something

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.560
now because right actually means Nazi and left actually means socialist and I don't

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:34.120
want either of them because I want my Obama back.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.680
The other things that I was saying was total straight theory.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.320
This is just opinion to some degree.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.720
I mean, it's based on, you can look at the empirical studies and you can look at the

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.160
theory of it and essentially you can call it reform liberalism or democratic socialism

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.360
or social democracy.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.280
They're all just different steps of the same thing, which is a synthesis of market society

01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:00.160
and a powerful enough Leviathan to provide for people, but that's the thing that is required.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.160
You're so handsome.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.160
Thank you so much.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.320
Focus on anything you're saying, I just want you to read my paper.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:13.320
Take my life.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.320
Here he goes.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:26.640
Hey Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, leave the scooter.

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.320
Yeah, honestly, I'm too drunk to have followed what you just said and that's on me, not you.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.920
I mean, I don't know, man.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.840
We've been doing this podcast for eight years.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:44.400
I've tried to be upfront about my politics, which is like, man, I was sucking my thumb

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.320
and going like, voting is bullshit and democracies now.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.320
You have been.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320
You're amazing.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320
I so appreciate how a friend you've been about it.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.360
And then I told people when I changed my mind, I told people I was really wrong and I got

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:03.000
real invested to the extent that I'm like, no, man, it's not even politics to me when

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.960
it's like fascism versus anything other than that.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.640
And most recently, because it's primary season and stuff, I'm like, I'm not even going to

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.720
talk about it because I don't want to be like, I'm an Elizabeth Warren guy and have everybody

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.560
because I totally respect everybody.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.120
Like I don't want them fighting.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:25.920
Like it is a fucking heartbreak that the good guys and yeah, they're the good guys that

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.960
they're all fighting.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.280
They have to fight now and so I can't even, it's like, I just watched the whole thing

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.280
play out.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280
And I'm like, God damn it.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.440
I wish there was some way that we could be as unified as the shit faces.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.800
You can't as far as I can tell.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.320
I mean, as somebody who's involved in politics, progressive politics, that's where the thinkers

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.160
are and that means that you get really neurotic people who are all worried about very specific

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.760
and small issues or wording.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:58.160
When you think about like, like, like, like I talked on this podcast about because I heard

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.680
some radio lab episode or whatever about the Irish system, like the way they do, right?

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680
Yeah.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.960
It's like everyone gets five votes and then they do some system where it's like, oh, yeah,

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960
yeah, yeah.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.480
First pass, the post is terrible and antiquated.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.480
It doesn't.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.480
Yeah.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.480
Yeah.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.480
It's true.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.480
Look it up.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.160
When you actually think about that, is that what that is, the five votes is the first

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.160
pass.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.920
No, no, that's our system here and in Canada, which is where I'm from is first pass the

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.520
post and he's Canadian.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520
Oh, my God.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.000
You're you're tri racial.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.760
That's the other half of the by.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.760
I bet it.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.760
Thank you so much.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760
You were wonderful.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760
Thanks, man.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760
Thank you.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760
You know, good buddy.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.760
Thanks to pay.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:41.760
We have a real guest.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.760
A real guest.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:43.760
That was a real guest.

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.760

year, but that's it.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.920
Unless of course you were to get a husband, you know.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.920

God damn it.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.920
That's not what the show is for.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.880

Do you respect Frank Lloyd Wright or is that like, Freud?

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560
No, no, of course.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.560
Everybody respects him.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560
Okay.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.560

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.560
Turns out he was right.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.240
I mean, he was like, it's like, yeah, he's wrong about a bunch of shit, but it's like,

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:23.280
how much disrespect for, anyways, I just, I wouldn't have shocked me if you had said

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.720
to like, as a millennial, you're not even millennial, are you?

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.720

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.400
You're, you're, you're in control.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.400
That's what you are.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.960
But, um, I just, I want to say something to you.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960
Uh-oh.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.960
No, it's nothing.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960
Okay.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960
Okay.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.040
Um, so I was at the community reunion yesterday.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.560
It was so fucking emotional.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.960
I like, I cried when you guys got on stage.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.960
Like, did you?

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:52.960
Yes.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:27:00.560
But I fucking like, I, when I went up, I thought, I was like, this is a problem.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.960
I had to shut it down.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.480
I was going to weep that something about going up there.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.560
And everybody like in a line, like you guys got up on stage and I was just like, fuck.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.400
I was like, I had to make a decision in my head.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.720
I was like, you were either going to weep in front of a bunch of people about your own

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:26.480
sitcom, which is, as your generation calls it, a bad look, uh, or you're going to fucking

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.480
robot and like, I made the right decision.

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480
You did really well.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480
Yeah.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480
Thank you.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480
Yeah.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480
No, you did well.

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480
Anyway, so what, yeah, uh, it was emotional.

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.480
It was emotional.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.840
And, um, so since I've been here, so, okay, so I got here on the 9th of August and on

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.600
the 12th of August, there was my first Harmontown show and I've been coming every week

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.560
and it's been like the best transitional thing for me because I mean, I don't know.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.400
Like this is the first time I've ever been here and I, I'm really bad at making friends,

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.000
but like Harmontown is the only like escape I have every week.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.120
And it's just, it's amazing because I've been listening to the podcasts, like I remember

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.360
being at home back in Pakistan and just like listening to the podcast and like laughing

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.360
to myself.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.840
And just the fact that I can be here live is just, it's insane and it's kind of a mind

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840
blower to me.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.120
Like I have no image in my head of Pakistan.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:24.560
Like we, we, obviously that's where, that's where Kumail is from and like, I don't talk

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.960
about bad at making friends.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.040
Like I never asked him, what's it like there?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.120
Uh, I have no image in my head, you know, like I don't know, like where, how, how, what

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120
was it?

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120
What was it?

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120
You, you're, you're just a little baby.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.520
If you started listening to the show back when we were doing it.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.440
I started listening in 2013.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.720
I was just starting my undergrad.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.960
So yeah, I wasn't a baby.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960
I was pretty old.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.960
What is it?

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960
Yeah.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960
You're living with your parents in Pakistan.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960
It's like a house, an apartment.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.120
It's a, so, um, we have a really large farmhouse.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.360
Um, so it's just, it's pretty cool, but it's very like rural.

01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.160
Like there's lots of donkeys.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160
Did you have like dogs?

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.160
Yeah.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.160
I have one dog.

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.160
And was it long or short hair?

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.160
What?

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.160
Brandon.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.160
What the heck?

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.960
No, I just wonder, was it long or short hair?

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.960
He's doing his cold reading technique.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.680
He's a, he's about to tell you the ghost of your father watched you to, he buried your

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.040
money in Arkansas.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.560
My dog is a German shepherd.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.960
Oh, so you had to, you had to cut his hair?

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:22.960
No.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:23.960
Oh.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960
What is going on?

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.960
What is happening?

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.960
What is, what is that?

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:33.360
Do you just try to figure out, I'm just trying to figure out if she had a dog and they had

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360
to cut the hair.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.360
That's all.

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.360
Why?

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.360
What?

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.360
You say that, like that's an innocent thing to want.

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.360
What?

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.920
You know, I can't tell you the secrets of Comptrolling, but I get people to talk.

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.560
Do you want to know about Victor's dog's hair length?

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560
Sure.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.360
Did you have a dog when you were a kid, Victor?

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.360
Vincent.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.360
Vincent.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.360
Vincent.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.360
I'm just listening.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360
Okay.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360
I would have.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360
Did you have a dog?

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360
Yeah.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360
How long was his hair?

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360
Yeah.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360
Who was involved in its upkeep?

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360
Did you cut it?

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360
I had.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.360
Did you dog of a barber?

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360
I had a cat.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.360
A cat?

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.360
Hell yeah.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360
How long were his ears?

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.360
So many cats.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:14.360
Did you cut your cat's hair?

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.360
Yeah.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.360
Was it a short hair?

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.360
Or a long hair?

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.360
Hairless.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.360
Medium.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.360
Medium.

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.360
So did you?

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.360
Okay.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.360
Did you brush it?

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.360
That response, by the way, people are going to listen to this podcast 10 years from now.

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.360
They're going to think cats were going extinct.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.360
Oh my God.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.360
It's like Bojack Horseman.

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.360
Cats.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.360
All right.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.360
Anyways.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.360
That is like Bojack Horseman.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360
I know who we are now.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360
I know whatever.

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360
I know what's going on now.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360
All right.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.360
I don't know what's going on anymore.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.360
What brings you here from Germany, Vincent?

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360
This show.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360
Oh, this is the only thing.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360
How long are you here for?

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360
Oh wow.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.360
Two days.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360
Okay.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360
So you're about to go back.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.360
Yeah.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360
Tomorrow morning.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.360
Did you really just come in a pilgrimage here for this show?

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360
Yeah.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360
I mean, I made some stops.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.360
I was in Berlin previously.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.360
And no, I mean, Berlin's in Germany, obviously.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.360
It's not where I live.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.360
Have you been listening to this show for how long?

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.360
Have you caught up?

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360
Yeah.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360
I think I started at about episode 100, 100.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360
And then I made my way down and up.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360
And now I'm here.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360
Hell yeah.

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360
What's the...

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360
Here's the thing about ending this show.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.360
All right.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.360
What?

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.360
What?

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360
Oh, you didn't know.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.360
He's not on the emails.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.960
I went to the vet once.

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.360
I had a cat.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.360
It was like...

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.360
All alone?

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.360
Yeah.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.360
Well, now you guys are over cats.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360
I remember the vet, like...

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360
Now they don't even care about cats.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360
Saying to me, the vet was like, as if...

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
I think the vet was like...

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.360
He must have had this conversation with so many people, because I really didn't cue him

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.640
to do this speech.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.640
But he...

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.760
It seemed like he's just like so...

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:01.360
He so wanted people to understand this, that I almost thought he was like a cat murderer.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:08.360
But he was like, you know, if your cat's sick, it's not human.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.360
So it's not going to let you know.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.360
It's not going to be like, oh, I'm sick.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360
You know?

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.360
And then you take the cat home.

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.360
And it's curled up in its favorite sun ray.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360
What?

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360
And it's like...

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360
It's like wagging its tail.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.360
No, this guy didn't know anything about cats.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:33.360
No, but he was like, your cat acts like your cat, and then it's like, you don't want to put it down.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360
But he was like...

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:37.360
This was a guy who was pro-putting my cat down.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.360
He was letting me know.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.360
It's like, yeah, here's the thing.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.360
Once you decide to put your cat down, your cat's going to start acting like a normal cat.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.360
You still got to put it down.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.360
Why did I bring that story of...

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.360
You were talking about the show ending.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.360
I know.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.360
That's horrible, but that's going to make it even happy.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.360
Yeah, the show feels healthy.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.360
But you got to put it down.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.360
Cody's dog, Barbara, is riddled with cancer, and it has been for a while.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.360
And it's like, we're saying goodbye to Barbara, and she's going to die.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.360
And it's like...

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.360
She's wagging her tail, and she's running all over the place.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.360
And it's like, fuck, man.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.360
It's like knowing that she's going to die is making her seem even healthier

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.360
than if we didn't know that.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360
What is my fucking point?

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360
Yeah, that's such a weird thing, though.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.360
That's the podcast.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.360
Because there's always...

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.360
Like you were saying, the doctors are always like, oh, man, it's okay.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.360
It's torture to leave them alive.

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.360
And it's like, well, it would be great to actually ask the pet, like,

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360
oh, would you like to be ceased right now,

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.360
or do you want to keep feeling pain for another terrible couple of weeks?

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.360
Because it's all just trying to assuage the guilt.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.360
But it's like, no, you are ending their life, and that's crazy if you think about it.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.360
But we had talked about this, and you had said something that really stuck with me,

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:03.360
which is that we, as eugenicists who have been mastering the dog race forever,

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.360
there's not a dog alive that we haven't tampered with genetically.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360
I'm a big scholar of eugenicists.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:16.360
The dogs that we have created, there's no biological profit in them registering pain

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360
or expressing it.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:23.360
Like, dogs that said, ow, gone.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360
Like, they're not in the gene pool.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:31.360
Dogs that, when their leg is broken, are like, can I have a cookie?

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.360
Those are all of the progenitors of our species.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360
Anyways, what's a leg in Pakistan?

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.360
I don't know.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360
Does it bug you when guys like, I go Pakistan?

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.360
I don't want to take the leap and start going Pakistan.

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.360
No, no, no, it sounds weirder when you say Pakistan.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360
Okay, thank you.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360
God damn it.

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:54.360
Can I, can you give me a card that says, like, because I just feel like a bag of dicks.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.360
I'm like, yeah, I know it's Pakistan at this point, but I'm like, Pakistan.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360
No, it's not your fault.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360
All right, thank you.

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360
Oh, it's like when you talk to someone from Nicaragua.

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360
Nicaragua.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.360
Nicaragua.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.360
So many hard Rs in there.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360
Yeah.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360
Nicaragua.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:20.360
So, let's squash this beef between Germany and Pakistan.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360
Play some soccer, you guys.

01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360
What do you do in Germany?

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360
Are you starting as well?

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.360
Yeah, I studied journalism.

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.360
Oh, yeah.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.360
That's why I was going to bring up when she was talking about architecture.

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:36.360
I majored in journalism and I, like, very quickly, like my first year of journalism,

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.360
I was like, oh, journalism sucks.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360
Yeah, it does.

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.360
I didn't have a fallback, so I dropped out of college.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360
You're not going to, though.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360
You're going to be a great German journalist.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360
I'm going to finish it.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.360
But I mean, yeah, it sucks right now.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.360
Everybody just keeps telling me, yeah, you're not going to get any money.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.360
You're not going to get a job.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.360
No, you could be like, you could work for Buzzfeed.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.360
Yeah, right.

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.360
We have that in Germany.

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360
Is your media like ours?

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360
Do you guys have a sensationalized?

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.360
It's not as extreme.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.360
I mean, it is obviously emotionalized, but it's not.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.360
You guys, everyone makes fun of Fox News, but even if I look at MSNBC,

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.360
I think, oh, CNN, it's like, it's still extreme.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360
That's what's so crazy.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360
People are like, Fox News is bad.

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.360
And then the Fox News Watchers are like, no, you don't understand CNN.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.360
It's the fake news.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.360
It's like, no, it's all a fucking nightmare hellscape.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.360
Anywhere else in the world, it's like, oh, there's news, actually.

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.360
There's real news.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360
It's bad.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.360
Is there real news?

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.360
Yeah, BBC's better.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.360
Yeah, but it's so boring.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.360
That's the secret.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.360
It's sort of like a super villain.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.360
They're so busy pronouncing Nicaragua, right?

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.360
I mean, where's the fucking hits?

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360
What's going on over there, Nazi-wise?

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.360
Come on, be real.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360
Yeah, I mean, it's coming back, right?

01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.360
You have like cities, Dresden is fucking overrun.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360
It's fucked up, man.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.360
They declared a national emergency or a city emergency.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360
They're like, we got skinheads, folks.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:10.360
Yeah, I think that was another city, but we just had an election and they were second-largest for us.

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.360
I mean, we're toast then, right?

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:21.360
If we can't count on you guys to be Nazi-phobic, we're fucked, right?

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360
I mean, it's all of Europe and America.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360
It's the whole west side.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:30.360
Why do you think as a journalist, why do you think as a planet, I have my theory,

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.360
why do you think as a planet, it's just like almost unrelatedly,

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.360
it just seems like all of these nations are just sliding right.

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:41.360
Do you have a theory about that?

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.360
I probably have one.

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.360
You would be a journalist if you were like, it's because of Christmas.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360
But I can't think of one right now.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.360
I think it's because of the fucking internet.

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.360
I mean, that's it.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360
I think the internet is simulating what...

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360
That's certainly part of it.

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.360
I think people who are just in a little bubble or maybe just one guy in a village,

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.360
now he is connected to another guy in another village.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360
Historically, people when they...

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.360
Nations, when they go multicultural, when their economy is destabilized,

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.360
there's certain cues that people start sliding right

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.360
because they have an authoritarianistic instinct when they start to get threatened.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.360
They start to have that xenophobic fear.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360
You weren't finished?

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:29.360
No, no, I have comma, semicolon, whatever, and the rest of my thought would be,

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.360
the internet has made everyone feel like that's happening, but it's not happening.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.360
Because people are like, oh my God, I didn't know how many Muslims there are.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360
It's like there aren't any Muslims where you are.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360
You just got on Facebook for the first time.

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360
Calm down.

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:50.360
Yeah, yeah, it's like every time the parts of the countries where these parties are active,

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:55.360
those numbers are the most extreme, there's none of the problems that they're running on.

01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.360
Yeah, all the cities where people are stacked up on top of each other,

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.360
you can't stay racist of living in New York.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.360
It's not really that possible.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360
I mean, okay, it is.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.360
Some people rise to that challenge, but I just think you can't really,

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.360
you can't hold onto these fucking crazy theories and be stacked on top of each other

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.360
in these giant cities where people are functioning and generating all of the shit

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360
that keeps the lights on for the rest of the country.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:31.360
And it's like this age-old irony that then you go out to the sticks, sorry, no offense,

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.360
what the fuck ever, but it's like where there's three people per square mile

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:41.360
and those people are absolutely the most convinced that the world is ending

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.360
and that race mixing is going to make everything.

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:49.360
Dude, your grandpa's birthday is the last time you saw anyone.

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.360
Well, you're fine.

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.360
I think in New York and stuff, it's the same kind of thing,

01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:01.360
but it's just like the internet kind of lets you hold onto these crazy theories

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.360
without being challenged in the same way that your face isn't rubbed into it.

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.360
And that's what we didn't anticipate is that we don't want to evolve

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.360
and we should all cop to that, I will.

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.360
We don't want to be wrong.

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.360
I got a world of knowledge at my fingertips,

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.360
but as I've said in this practice before, I'll sit in a bar and go like,

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Hudson Hawk, that was 1993.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.360
Oh, but you $50, no one gets their phone out

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:29.360
because no one wants to actually know anything.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.360
We do not actually want to use the internet to become like cyber Christ.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.360
We don't want to learn and evolve.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:40.360
We could easily just know everything.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.360
I did say stuff.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.360
That's a reference to this podcast.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.360
There is an episode called Cyber Christ and Stubnortz,

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:53.360
and I want to say Matt Gorely was involved.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.360
All right, kids, what are you plugging?

01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.360
You got a book coming out about architecture.

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.360
I want to make it worth your while.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.360
I'm babbling and like, oh, God, we're almost there.

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.360
It's already worth my while.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.360
I'm good.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.360
I'm so flattered.

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.360
Thank you for expressing that.

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.360
You too.

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:23.360
That's why I brought up the dying dog thing.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.360
It wasn't to discourage everyone.

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360
The show can't tell us it's hurting.

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.360
It was like...

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.360
It's like, yeah, okay, the show, of course,

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.360
God damn, could the show just be ending forever?

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.360
We'll launch another podcast called the Harmontowns Ending,

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.360
and then we'll just do that forever,

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.360
and then everyone will be on their best behavior.

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.360
I don't know.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.360
I just want to say my accent sounds really German,

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360
not that I hear it.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.360
It's cool, though.

01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:55.360
You didn't know that?

01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.360
No, I didn't.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.360
You never heard you.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360
I'm so glad you said that,

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.360
because I was thinking that the whole time.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.360
Does he know?

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.360
You're like, oh, my God, I sound like Dieter.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.360
Will you please say there are no more fucking Krugerons,

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.360
Mr. Johnson?

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.360
Kruger what?

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.360
Krugerons.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360
Krugerons.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360
It's a golden coin.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.360
There's no more fucking Krugerons, Mr. Johnson?

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360
What are you talking about?

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.360
It'll work.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.360
Brandon is rock hard right now.

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:33.360
You guys can't see, he's rock hard, he's throbbing,

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360
fully torqued.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.360
As long as you're doing requests.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.360
Can you give me an evil laugh

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:47.360
and then say diplomatic immunity?

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.360
Okay, I can...

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.360
There's the evil laugh.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.360
Diplomatic immunity.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.360
You son of a bitch,

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.360
you think you can hide behind that shield,

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.360
but I'm Mel Gibson, I'm going to get you.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.360
Those bad guys were South African.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.360
How do you feel about South Africa as a German?

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.360
Are you proud of it?

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.360
No, it's good, yeah.

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:08.360
It's Dutch.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.360
It's Dutch.

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.360
Those are the Dutch.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360
No, the Germans were the best ones.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:13.360
Were they there first?

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.360
Look at you bragging on oppression and shit.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.360
No, no, we got there first.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.360
It's good, Brandon, it's good.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.360
Does Pakistan have any imperial territories?

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.360
Is Pakistan like, oh yeah,

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.360
we ran Portugal for a while.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:32.360
No, we were run by the British imperial colonialism, sorry.

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.360
So did Pakistan have to fight for its independence?

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.360
It was part of India,

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.360
and then when the British left,

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.360
they were like, fuck you guys, what do you want?

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.360
And then Pakistan was like, oh, we want to be separate,

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.360
and then it was just fine, whatever.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.360
That's kind of what happened here, except there were muskets.

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.360
Except for the nuke issue.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.360
You guys kind of will nuke each other, right?

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.360
India and Pakistan?

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.360
That's crazy.

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.360
Oh yeah, Pakistan, well yeah, forever.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.360
Yeah, you guys are a nuclear power.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.360
I see you guys like, you, you, you.

01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.360
But Pakistan's been a nuclear power forever, right?

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.360
Yep, yep.

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:09.360
Yeah, they got that hard power.

01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.360
Yeah, Paley.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.360
Nice.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.360
Yes.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:14.360
Yeah.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360
But it's never been a crisis.

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.360
When did Pakistan become a nuclear power?

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.360
When was it, 70s, 80s?

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.360
I think 70s.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360
And like, why wasn't that a crisis?

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:29.360
Because we were on good terms with them.

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.360
So was that America, did America go like, yeah,

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.360
you guys should have nuclear bombs?

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.360
Like, that's not like us at all.

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.360
Typically when you colonize a place,

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.360
you invite people to come back.

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:42.360
They learn the same things that they're taught.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360
So you have a bunch of new engineers.

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:47.360
Then why doesn't Alaska have the nukes, man?

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.360
God damn it.

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.360
Check Anthony.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:53.360
It just doesn't, it seems like such a weird outlier.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.360
Because I remember like during the Iraq war,

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.360
the first one, it was like,

01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.360
Pakistan was like this like wild card.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.360
It was like, oh, are they going to get involved?

01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.360
Like they're like U.S. allies and like,

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.360
we don't, yeah, I don't know, whatever, man.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.360
So fucking drunk.

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:13.360
I've been drinking for like, since Thursday.

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.360
Thank you two so much for stepping up on stage.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:16.360
Thank you guys.

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:17.360
Thank you for having me.

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.360
So flattering that you came here in a pilgrimage.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.360
Awesome.

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.360
All the way from Germany.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:25.360
It was my, sorry, Maria, Myra.

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:26.360
Sorry.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.360
Sorry, sorry.

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:28.360
And Vincent.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.360
Myra and Vincent.

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:30.360
God bless you.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:31.360
So wonderful.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:32.360
Unless you don't believe in God,

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:35.360
in which case, chaos, magic, bless you.

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.360
It's all the same thing.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:40.360
Do you, tomorrow, will you feel any of that today?

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:43.360
No, I mean, the reason I am so drunk right now

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.360
is because of how drunk we got at the premiere.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.360
Yeah.

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.360
So I woke up this morning.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.360
Are you crying?

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.360
Yeah.

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.360
Does it look like I'm crying?

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.360
It looks like you're in Pakistan.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.360
I miss, I miss them.

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.360
You want their nuclear weapons to work, don't you?

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.360
You're such a softy.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360
Soft power.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:09.360
I just, I don't like, not, I liked not being threatened by the guests up here.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.360
You like both of them.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.360
They're good kids.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:12.360
I like them.

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.360
I thought they were very sweet.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.360
And I went to USC.

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.360
So like, you know, fight on.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:20.360
It's sweet to think that there's a generation of kids who listen to me ramble on and on.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.360
It's just been ruined.

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.360
I love it.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.360
I, but I also don't you think it's kind of a cheat?

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.360
She goes to school 20 minutes from here.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360
Wow.

01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:31.360
Wow.

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.360
Wow.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:38.360
I don't want to say anything because, you know, but that's, yeah, that's true.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.360
That's bullshit.

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.360
You could walk here.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.360
You're saying, you're saying she Germany, Germany will come here from Pakistan.

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:48.360
No, she kind of played the nationality card.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.360
My friend is here from Australia right now.

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.360
Fuck your friend.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:53.360
Yeah.

Yeah.

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.360
Yeah.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:56.360
But we don't care.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.360
Let's do a wrap.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:58.360
All right.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:46:59.360
Australia.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.360
I was going to answer your question.

01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.360
The answer to your question is no, I was the, it was the hair of the dog thing.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.360
I was a bag of dicks this morning and I was like, there's only one way through this.

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.360
Excellent.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:09.360
I got to get drunk.

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.360
So there you go.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.360
So for the kids.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.360
So will I, will I feel like tomorrow?

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:15.360
No, I won't.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.360
I don't know.

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.360
If you do, do you have a cure?

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.360
Do you have like a hangover remedy?

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:24.360
No, this guy says sometimes I would use to put a packet of salt in a glass of water

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.360
and give it to him or give him a gatorator or whatever is bacon, bacon sandwiches.

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.360
Oh yeah.

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.360
Anything fatty, salty.

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.360
Yeah.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360
You want all that stuff?

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.360
All right.

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.360
Sourdough breakfast jack.

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.360
All right.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.360
Start this.

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.360
This show has been brought to you by too drunk to rap.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:45.360
Give me a beat blue apron kettle or kettlebell kettlebell.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.360
Kettlebell kitchen.

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.360
Kettlebell kitchen.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.360
Yo.

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.360
Yeah.

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.360
Yo.

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.360
I remember the time.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360
Kettlebell.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:55.360
The kettlebell kitchen showed up in my house.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.360
Yeah.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.360
Put it in a bag, deliver it without lag.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.360
Bring me some drumsticks and flour.

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.360
Give me that home cooking power.

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:14.360
I don't want to go to the grocery store, but I also don't want to go outdoors to a restaurant.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:17.360
I want you to deliver me ingredients.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.360
That's what I want.

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:24.360
Split the difference between autonomy and dependency.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.360
Bring me a box of pieces of food.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.360
I'll put them together when I'm in the mood.

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.360
I'll impress my date.

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.360
Hey, what do you want?

01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.360
Broccolini?

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:38.360
Okay.

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:39.360
Don't hate.

01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.360
Here we go.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:41.360
I put it in a bag.

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.360
Shake it up and put it on the plate.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.360
You fucking hag.

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.360
Little bit of energy.

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:46.360
Little energy.

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.360
Little energy.

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:48.360
Yeah.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360
Why am I making me to my date too?

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:52.360
Bring it up.

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.360
Okay.

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360
Yeah.

Go.

01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.360
Go.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.360
Go.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:48:59.360
My name is Kettlebell.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.360
I like to be here and say I like to deliver food all a little long day.

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.360
I like to salt and season and put it in a cup.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.360
I like to put your mama put you daddy up in a hotel.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:19.360
And a chair as the French would call it on the stairs.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:20.360
Take it.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.360
Rub it for.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.360
This is...

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.360
Uber's back?

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:29.360
Kettlebell is a thing that tries to sell everything.

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.360
You can always sing through it.

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.360
Nobody knows what the product is.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.360
Deliver to your house two times a week.

01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:40.360
They got things for your tire.

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.360
They'll deliver it.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.360
Keto or vegetarian.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.360
Protein style paleo.

01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.360
You'll be swearing.

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.360
They have good stuff for you.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.360
Get to this food.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360
I know I do.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.360
I have the salmon cakes.

01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:00.360
They had colored greens.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.360
Oh boy.

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.360
It was fine.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:03.360
That's fine.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360
That's Harvey Town ladies and gentlemen.

Give it to me!

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.360
