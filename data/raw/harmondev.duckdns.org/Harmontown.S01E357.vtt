02:17.000\nYou're booing the idea of me pitting them against each other.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:19.000\nYeah.\n\n02:19.000 -->

03:04.000\nI just fucking nailed it.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nI signaled so much virtue.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nYou couldn't fucking, like...\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:10.000\nIt was beyond reproach.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:15.000\nI was, like, dude, no matter what you are, whatever, Veterans, what, booby-dee-boo-ba-dee.\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nI fucking...\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:21.000\nI just, like, man, the world's gonna suck my dick when I click Submit.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.000\nI did it.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:23.000\nBoom, dude.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:26.000\nI got Ghost of Marines coming at me.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nLike, Simper Fi, blah, blah, blah.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nLike, I fucking did it.\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nI fucking signaled that virtue.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nAnd then, undid it.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\nI was...\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nI'm not a fucking warp.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:42.000\nI, like, hate myself today.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nI honestly can't tell you guys why I'm so fucking upset.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:50.000\nBut my hope is that I can just be honest with you guys that I'm so fucking, like...\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nI've been...\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:58.000\nThere are outside circumstances that have me in a real fucking tailspin.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:03.000\nAnd the thing that I want to be honest about is, because I've been taking note of it,\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:14.000\nis how fucking rude and mean I am only, exclusively, only to the people that are closest to me.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nThe people that I can trust.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\nThat stupid expression, you only hurt the ones you love.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:25.000\nLike, I have been so fucking mean to Cody the last couple of weeks because I am going through something\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:32.000\nwith people that deserve so much fucking abuse and who are getting nothing.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:37.000\nIf you want to be treated well by me, here's an insider tip.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nBe a bag of dicks to me.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nProclaim yourself as my enemy.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:45.000\nYou will be a fucking red carpet ambassador.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:50.000\nLike, you'll never hear a fucking peep from me because I'll be so busy strategizing and all this.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:56.000\nBut if you want to get a fucking verbally abused by me, love me.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nJust love me.\n\n04:58.000 --> 04:59.000\nJust be into me.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nBe on my side.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:01.000\nBe in my corner.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:05.000\nThat's where you'll get fucking knocked out.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nIt really is fucking weird.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:12.000\nWho lets you know is the thing that a good friend Jerry Minor said when I said I lost my mind one night.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nHe said, who was crying or who was angry?\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nAnd I said neither.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:17.000\nAnd he goes, then you didn't lose your mind.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nSo who told you that you had fucked up?\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nDid you discover it yourself?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:22.000\nMe.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:23.000\nOkay, good.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nWell, I mean, but it's like...\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nAt least you didn't get it secondhand.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nThat would have sucked.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:30.000\nWell, a secondhand does Cody count a secondhand?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:34.000\nLike, if I'm like being mean to her and then she's like, why are you being mean to me?\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.000\nIs that, that's her the source?\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:38.000\nLike, I'm like...\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI think that counts, yeah.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nBecause I don't want to make it...\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nI don't want to sugarcoat and be like, oh yeah, and then I realized what a bag of fucking shit I am.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nNo, it's like...\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nBut you did eventually.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nYeah, but like...\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:53.000\nYeah, I'm just a terrible person.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nNo, you know, terrible people don't question it.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:58.000\nThat's the difference.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:01.000\nFuck you, Brandon.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:05.000\nAgain, will somebody help me?\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:09.000\nI will tell you when I was a kid, my mother would say to me,\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:16.000\nI don't know why you talk shit to me, but you don't talk shit to that dude who stole your book back, you little bitch.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nAnd it does shake you back.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:22.000\nI love that your mom said that.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nShe had a lot of gyms.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:29.000\nYour mom had the presence of mind to know you were taking aggression out on her\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nthat was based on someone stealing your book back?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nShe felt like it really didn't matter what the reason was.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:39.000\nIt was her fucking house.\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:42.000\nI don't know why you're upset with me, but I can tell you this.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:45.000\nI saw your bitch ass run home today.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.000\nSo whatever's going on, you don't need to talk to me like that,\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nbecause I'm sure you can't back it up.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:55.000\nI used to wipe your ass, bitch.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nAllow for that to happen in your relationship.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nDid your mom ever give you this one where you're like,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:06.000\ndid you ever come home like sniffling and crying because you got bullied?\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:14.000\nAnd did your mom go like, well, if they're that mean, then you don't want them as your friend?\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nYou fucking bitch.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nIt's so true. It's so perfectly right.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nBut it's not the message you're willing to receive at that time.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:28.000\nNo, she was hardcore.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nThey were so mean to me.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:33.000\nWell, then they're not good people and you don't want to hang out with them.\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:38.000\nYeah, well, that doesn't mean being in their treehouse wouldn't be rad.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nRight.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nIt's called fucking society, bitch.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nYeah, your advice doesn't raise my self esteem, mom.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:52.000\nIt's the Schrab's next t-shirt.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:54.000\nWhere's the fucking Schrab?\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.000\nYou lost him on the way here.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nHis biggest dream.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nOh, the episode where Schrab's gone, everyone misses Schrab.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nI miss him too.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:10.000\nWho's going to find the good chair and move it into place?\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:15.000\nI sat down, there's no guest per se.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:20.000\nI think I heard a possible guest respond to that.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:26.000\nBut I sat down here because there's a camera situation where the worst, I don't know,\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:32.000\nlike me standing up there is not good for camera purposes.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nThe camera's stuck.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.000\nWhereas this is amazing.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nMe sitting here is amazing.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nBut let's, let's, let's, let's bring on our friend, Nick Rutherford.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nNick.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:48.000\nYes, Nick Rutherford, ladies and gentlemen, you know from such shows as the Nick Rutherford\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:53.000\nshow written and produced by Nick Rutherford.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nSorry, Nick Rutherford.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:56.000\nWhat?\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.000\nYes.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:01.000\nLadies and gentlemen, his entrance tonight is brought to you by lime, lime scooters.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:05.000\nYou're going to, you're going to bust your mouth open lime scooters.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nOh my God.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nWow.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nMan.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nSubtle.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nThat was good.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nI saw that.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:18.000\nI saw the headlight on that thing coming down the thing and I was like, we're all going\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.000\nto die.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:30.000\nOh, for the folks at home, Nick wrote a scooter up on stage.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nAnd then I had to turn it off so he didn't keep getting billed for the show.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:34.000\nYeah, he locked it.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nVery expensive.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nSo you knew you've, you're, you're facile enough with these things that you knew it would\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nmake a punchline sound when you deactivated it.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:45.000\nI love limes, man.\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:46.000\nThey're the best.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nPeople who rail against limes are awful.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:49.000\nYeah, man.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:50.000\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nI think they're a little too curmudgeon-y.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nLike, yeah.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nThe people or the limes?\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:56.000\nThe people.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:58.000\nI think limes are too curmudgeon-y.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nAlso, it's only people who live in Santa Monica and fuck that place, right?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:02.000\nYeah.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:08.000\nI just, anything like any critique people have of these scooters is the same about bikes,\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nbut no one said them about bikes because bikes are old and adults use them.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:13.000\nOkay, boomer.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:14.000\nOkay, boomer.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:15.000\nOh shit.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:16.000\nOh my god.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:17.000\nOkay, boomer.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:18.000\nI can do it too, boomer.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.000\nOh shit.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:24.000\nI also know how to use the phrase of the day, boomer.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nOkay.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:31.000\nI saw this phrase is exploded like a fucking wad of shitty cum everywhere.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nOh, okay, boomer.\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:39.000\nOh,

billboard.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:16.000\nThey didn't, they spaced their text wrong and then nobody watched the show.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:24.000\nWhen I was doing community, which I never bring up, there was, I wanted to, I was like\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nso excited about the website.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:29.000\nI was like, I want to do the Greendale College, Greendale?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nYeah.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nGreendale.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nI'm like, I said, Glendale or Greendale?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nNo, Greendale.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:41.000\nI want to do like the Greendale College's like a website and I want it to be like, it's\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:46.440\ngot to be legit, it's got to be like the Dunder Mifflin like a website, but like beyond that,\n\n20:46.440 --> 20:49.000\nlike you get, it's got to be this fully immersive thing.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:53.000\nWe're going to have hundreds and hundreds of like student registries and your other\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nthing.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.160\nAnd then it was like NBC digital was like, yeah, but we did research and we did that Dunder\n\n20:59.160 --> 21:07.000\nMifflin page and like people were upset because they, what we found in our testing is that\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:11.500\nthey're, they wanted to know whether it was a real website or not.\n\n21:11.500 --> 21:18.000\nAnd so what we found is if we put like a Toyota ad, people, it made people more comfortable.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:26.280\nAnyways, just, I mean, it sounds like I'm complaining, but I'm not, I'm just laughing.\n\n21:26.280 --> 21:30.480\nWe did the, I'm sorry, I've been drinking since 10 a.m.\n\n21:30.480 --> 21:33.480\nWait, so you never got a community college?\n\n21:33.480 --> 21:36.640\nWe never really, it was like, well, there was like a, there was a website, but it was\n\n21:36.640 --> 21:46.080\nlike sony.com slash community slash NBC dot hashtag slash this is a TV show slash we promise\n\n21:46.080 --> 21:55.080\nthis isn't really happening slash.org slash TV dot biz slash like oh, just for funsies\n\n21:55.080 --> 22:01.200\nlet's pretend this is a community college dot just for fun dot just kidding.\n\n22:01.200 --> 22:07.080\nAnd it was like, it was nothing, it was like, let's go through the motions and hated it.\n\n22:07.080 --> 22:11.000\nAnd then we would do like Twitter, I was like, let's do a Twitter episode where we have\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.120\nthe characters talking to each other and they're like, that's great.\n\n22:14.120 --> 22:19.760\nJust make sure that every character after everything they tweet, they hashtag NBC underscore\n\n22:19.760 --> 22:27.080\ncommunity, watch it at eight, why would, why would any Edison be saying that anyways?\n\n22:27.080 --> 22:29.440\nThose guys all got mad at me one time on Twitter or something.\n\n22:29.440 --> 22:30.680\nThey were all like adding me.\n\n22:30.680 --> 22:32.280\nThe cast of community.\n\n22:32.280 --> 22:33.280\nYeah.\n\n22:33.280 --> 22:34.280\nThe characters from.\n\n22:34.280 --> 22:35.280\nYeah.\n\n22:35.280 --> 22:37.560\nThey're like obvets, obvets, tweets or whatever.\n\n22:37.560 --> 22:38.920\nThat would probably be me.\n\n22:38.920 --> 22:39.920\nIt was.\n\n22:39.920 --> 22:40.920\nIt was someone.\n\n22:40.920 --> 22:41.920\nIt was just someone.\n\n22:41.920 --> 22:42.920\nBefore we met.\n\n22:42.920 --> 22:43.920\nI was yelling at you.\n\n22:43.920 --> 22:44.920\nNo, this was on Twitter.\n\n22:44.920 --> 22:48.360\nIt was after it was way, it was way later than those accounts were like active.\n\n22:48.360 --> 22:49.760\nLike they went rogue or something.\n\n22:49.760 --> 22:53.760\nLike the people are like RPing them and they just like, you know, lost reality or something.\n\n22:53.760 --> 22:54.760\nFor a while.\n\n22:54.760 --> 22:55.760\nThose were all me.\n\n22:55.760 --> 22:58.200\nThey had to be because you couldn't, you couldn't make writers do that.\n\n22:58.200 --> 22:59.200\nWho's doing it now?\n\n22:59.200 --> 23:01.320\nThe guy who hates you.\n\n23:01.320 --> 23:02.320\nYeah.\n\n23:02.320 --> 23:08.400\nI said, we did the vulture, vulture, uh, we did the community reunion panel.\n\n23:08.400 --> 23:09.400\nWas anyone at that?\n\n23:09.400 --> 23:15.760\nUh, yeah, it was, it was basically everyone pretty much at the risk of offending anyone\n\n23:15.760 --> 23:16.760\nthat I'm forgetting.\n\n23:16.760 --> 23:24.400\nNo, it was basically everyone minus Donald and Chevy on the panel and, um, and then we\n\n23:24.400 --> 23:30.720\nwent to this dinner in the basement of this steak place that Joel loves and in the middle\n\n23:30.720 --> 23:33.320\nof the dinner, fucking Donald Glover walks in.\n\n23:33.320 --> 23:39.320\nIt was so fantastic to see him with his fucking crazy beard and is like, like, like, uh, god\n\n23:39.320 --> 23:40.320\ndamn it.\n\n23:40.320 --> 23:42.320\nI'm jealous of that guy.\n\n23:42.320 --> 23:44.520\nDid he know about the dinner or does he work at that steak place?\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:50.320\nI think he was like, he's trying to make ends meet.\n\n23:50.320 --> 23:53.040\nHe, I think he was literally come, got off.\n\n23:53.040 --> 23:57.640\nI think he was trying to make the panel and only made it like just to the dinner.\n\n23:57.640 --> 24:01.480\nUm, but it was just, it was just good to talk to him again.\n\n24:01.480 --> 24:05.520\nDid he, were you guys having a dinner and he just happened to be in the same place at\n\n24:05.520 --> 24:06.520\nthe same time?\n\n24:06.520 --> 24:07.520\nOr did he know you guys were going to be there?\n\n24:07.520 --> 24:08.760\nNo, he, no, I mean, that's what I'm saying.\n\n24:08.760 --> 24:13.600\nLike, I think he was, I think he was literally coming from Atlanta, figuratively and literally\n\n24:13.600 --> 24:21.040\nlike, like, like, or literally and literally, um, uh, and, and he just, the flight didn't\n\n24:21.040 --> 24:25.520\nwork out, but he just made it to the dinner.\n\n24:25.520 --> 24:27.000\nDid Chevy show up at all?\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nAt the dinner?\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nYeah.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nYeah.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nNo, he didn't make it.\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.960\nWell, you should give his phone number out.\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:38.960\nYeah.\n\n24:38.960 --> 24:40.920\nI think they would like his phone number, right?\n\n24:40.920 --> 24:44.560\nI bet they'd love it.\n\n24:44.560 --> 24:50.040\nYou should get hired like after people go through rehab, you should be like the tester.\n\n24:50.040 --> 24:52.040\nWe should get one more drink, right?\n\n24:52.040 --> 24:54.920\nWe should just get, do more, one more line, right?\n\n24:54.920 --> 25:00.240\nIn informal poll, does anyone answer their phone anymore?\n\n25:00.240 --> 25:01.240\nSomeone said yes.\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:03.760\nWho said yes?\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:04.760\nA liar.\n\n25:04.760 --> 25:05.760\nMe.\n\n25:05.760 --> 25:07.760\nFred answer phone.\n\n25:07.760 --> 25:08.760\nSomeone said yes, right?\n\n25:08.760 --> 25:09.760\nYeah.\n\n25:09.760 --> 25:10.760\nYeah.\n\n25:10.760 --> 25:11.760\nBoomer.\n\n25:11.760 --> 25:12.760\nNo.\n\n25:12.760 --> 25:13.760\nOh, no.\n\n25:13.760 --> 25:14.760\nLike, I like who?\n\n25:14.760 --> 25:15.760\nWhy would you ever answer your phone anymore?\n\n25:15.760 --> 25:18.920\nI don't think we even need the actual phone call function anymore.\n\n25:18.920 --> 25:25.800\nYeah, I mean, I don't, if someone's calling me, even if it says mom, I'm like, yeah, right.\n\n25:25.800 --> 25:26.800\nNice try.\n\n25:26.800 --> 25:30.560\nWell, you don't think it's your mom, or?\n\n25:30.560 --> 25:31.560\nNice try.\n\n25:31.560 --> 25:32.560\nI just assume it's...\n\n25:32.560 --> 25:33.560\nMy own contacts.\n\n25:33.560 --> 25:34.560\nYeah, exactly.\n\n25:34.560 --> 25:36.440\nI'm like, good one, AT&T.\n\n25:36.440 --> 25:39.640\nNick, what'd you do last night?\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:43.840\nOh, we went to the Rick and Morty premiere last night.\n\n25:43.840 --> 25:44.840\nYeah.\n\n25:44.840 --> 25:45.840\nOh, shit.\n\n25:45.840 --> 25:46.840\nIt's back.\n\n25:46.840 --> 25:47.840\nWobble of a dub dub.\n\n25:47.840 --> 25:50.800\nDid you just like that episode?\n\n25:50.800 --> 25:51.800\nWho said no?\n\n25:51.800 --> 25:52.800\nNobody.\n\n25:52.800 --> 25:53.800\nOkay, good.\n\n25:53.800 --> 25:56.300\nIt was very fun, Brandon.\n\n25:56.300 --> 25:57.300\nDid you like it?\n\n25:57.300 --> 25:58.300\nYeah.\n\n25:58.300 --> 25:59.300\nDid I like the episode?\n\n25:59.300 --> 26:00.300\nDid you like, how'd you feel?\n\n26:00.300 --> 26:01.800\nWas this your second one?\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:02.800\nFirst one?\n\n26:02.800 --> 26:03.800\nThis is my first premiere.\n\n26:03.800 --> 26:07.480\nI don't care for the show itself, but I do like...\n\n26:07.480 --> 26:08.480\nJust hanging out with friends.\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:09.480\nYeah.\n\n26:09.480 --> 26:10.480\nIt's great.\n\n26:10.480 --> 26:11.480\nIt's great.\n\n26:11.480 --> 26:12.480\nThere was food.\n\n26:12.480 --> 26:13.480\nThere was food.\n\n26:13.480 --> 26:14.480\nYeah.\n\n26:14.480 --> 26:15.480\nBrandon was in the writer's room for a while.\n\n26:15.480 --> 26:16.480\nIt's great.\n\n26:16.480 --> 26:22.520\nThe time on that show moves so slowly that the episode that you inspired, which we will\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:28.560\ncall the Vat of Acid episode, you got to see the fucking finished product on that.\n\n26:28.560 --> 26:30.560\nIt's an amazing episode.\n\n26:30.560 --> 26:31.560\nI can't wait to see it.\n\n26:31.560 --> 26:33.160\nYeah, it's going to be live action.\n\n26:33.160 --> 26:35.160\nIt's a good room.\n\n26:35.160 --> 26:36.160\nCan you imagine?\n\n26:36.160 --> 26:37.160\nYou guys know.\n\n26:37.160 --> 26:39.160\nIt's fucking hilarious in there.\n\n26:39.160 --> 26:40.160\nIt's a fun room.\n\n26:40.160 --> 26:41.360\nWe have good times.\n\n26:41.360 --> 26:42.360\nRob's in there.\n\n26:42.360 --> 26:43.360\nRob is in there.\n\n26:43.360 --> 26:45.200\nSometimes there's a dog in there.\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:48.480\nThere's two dogs in there constantly.\n\n26:48.480 --> 26:49.480\nLet's talk about them.\n\n26:49.480 --> 26:51.880\nWell, one's a little angel.\n\n26:51.880 --> 26:52.880\nThat's Tilda.\n\n26:52.880 --> 26:53.880\nThat's Tilda.\n\n26:53.880 --> 26:54.880\nThere's a dog named Tilda.\n\n26:54.880 --> 26:57.280\nJust think of a cute dog.\n\n26:57.280 --> 26:58.800\nThat's kind of what it is.\n\n26:58.800 --> 27:01.320\nIt's about the size of this microphone.\n\n27:01.320 --> 27:03.000\nI think that I'm having a lot of trouble.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nI think one thing...\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:11.200\nBecause last night I was blackout drunk and I went wandering around.\n\n27:11.200 --> 27:17.440\nI have video of you and I holding hands prancing downtown.\n\n27:17.440 --> 27:19.600\nI guess you were just wrangling me or something.\n\n27:19.600 --> 27:21.600\nNo, I don't know.\n\n27:21.600 --> 27:22.600\nWe were just wandering.\n\n27:22.600 --> 27:26.400\nYou were screaming at me in the photo booth and then there's a picture of it.\n\n27:26.400 --> 27:29.400\nI screamed at you?\n\n27:29.400 --> 27:30.400\nIt was friendly.\n\n27:30.400 --> 27:31.400\nIt was great.\n\n27:31.400 --> 27:32.400\nIt was great.\n\n27:32.400 --> 27:35.840\nBut it was right as the first picture got taken.\n\n27:35.840 --> 27:43.360\nSo you're sort of like, and I'm like, I was really blackout drunk.\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:47.160\nAnd I think part of maybe like, I don't know, I don't want to be like a drama queen, but\n\n27:47.160 --> 27:52.000\nI also want to be honest and try to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:53.640\nWhat am I going through?\n\n27:53.640 --> 27:57.000\nWhy am I in this weird state?\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:05.240\nWe had our producer friend, Mike, who passed away and his wife was there at the premiere.\n\n28:05.240 --> 28:08.440\nI think maybe that like set me off.\n\n28:08.440 --> 28:09.440\nI don't know.\n\n28:09.440 --> 28:15.280\nThat just seems like something that a fucking horrible drunk uses an excuse like I but you\n\n28:15.280 --> 28:21.360\nknow, Jewel, like as I've said here before, she was the casting director on the first\n\n28:21.360 --> 28:26.240\nthing that Rob Schrab and I ever did for TV three decades ago or something.\n\n28:26.240 --> 28:29.200\nAnd it was just pure coincidence that her husband was the line producer in Rick and\n\n28:29.200 --> 28:31.080\nMorty.\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:35.120\nAnd then I hadn't seen her since the funeral and she was there at the premiere and I just\n\n28:35.120 --> 28:46.880\nlike I can't I just I feel I texted her today like, like, can you have a drink with me?\n\n28:46.880 --> 28:49.440\nAnd she's like, no, I'm at work.\n\n28:49.440 --> 28:56.200\nAnd I'm like, I don't I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I keep I keep doing it wrong with\n\n28:56.200 --> 28:57.200\nthis.\n\n28:57.200 --> 29:05.920\nLike, I was like, like, she was robbed of her husband, and I just have this shame, like\n\n29:05.920 --> 29:13.600\nI'm just filled with shame about it, because I feel like we take people from their private\n\n29:13.600 --> 29:17.680\nlives and we use them in TV and then that's like, it was for nothing.\n\n29:17.680 --> 29:25.600\nAnd as Justin said to me recently, it was like, do you think that if Mike knew that\n\n29:25.600 --> 29:29.480\nit was going to end that way that he would have shown up for a day of this shit?\n\n29:29.480 --> 29:32.960\nThe answer is obviously, no, not at all, of course not.\n\n29:32.960 --> 29:33.960\nLike what the fuck?\n\n29:33.960 --> 29:34.960\nBut I don't even know.\n\n29:34.960 --> 29:38.520\nAnd then to see her there was like, what the fuck are we doing?\n\n29:38.520 --> 29:39.520\nI don't know.\n\n29:39.520 --> 29:42.720\nIt's super hard, man, and it's really hard to make sense of it.\n\n29:42.720 --> 29:45.240\nBut I don't know if it's like, is this me grieving?\n\n29:45.240 --> 29:46.240\nMm hmm.\n\n29:46.240 --> 29:47.240\nYep.\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:48.240\nYou sound so sure of it.\n\n29:48.240 --> 29:49.240\nI don't.\n\n29:49.240 --> 29:50.240\nI don't.\n\n29:50.240 --> 29:51.240\nWell, I mean, you know, I've grieved.\n\n29:51.240 --> 29:52.240\nIf that's what it is.\n\n29:52.240 --> 29:53.240\nGrieved.\n\n29:53.240 --> 29:54.240\nYou've grieved.\n\n29:54.240 --> 29:55.240\nI've grieved.\n\n29:55.240 --> 29:56.240\nI've grieved.\n\n29:56.240 --> 29:57.240\nA piece of shit.\n\n29:57.240 --> 30:02.360\nI love you.\n\n30:02.360 --> 30:04.760\nAnd that's how that's that's the way it works.\n\n30:04.760 --> 30:05.760\nIt sucks.\n\n30:05.760 --> 30:06.760\nWho have you lost them?\n\n30:06.760 --> 30:07.760\nI'm an orphan, you know.\n\n30:07.760 --> 30:09.260\nOh, you lost both your parents.\n\n30:09.260 --> 30:13.400\nYeah, you brought them up earlier in the show.\n\n30:13.400 --> 30:16.640\nYou mean when I wrapped it that I fucked your mama?\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:17.640\nThat's cold.\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:18.640\nDid you fuck?\n\n30:18.640 --> 30:34.680\nBrandon, no, I'm a very special Brandon, your mama, god damn, I fucked it.\n\n30:34.680 --> 30:41.520\nAll right, it doesn't, it doesn't, sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, but it's not funny, but\n\n30:41.520 --> 30:42.760\nit is super.\n\n30:42.760 --> 30:48.040\nIt is super hard to see you have a survivor's guilt, the part of it, and then it's super\n\n30:48.040 --> 30:51.520\nhard to see the passage of time when you lose somebody.\n\n30:51.520 --> 30:55.200\nYou see that other people that loved them out of function like that, and you naturally\n\n30:55.200 --> 30:56.640\nlook for Mike in that room.\n\n30:56.640 --> 31:00.520\nThere's survivor's guilt and then there's murderer's guilt.\n\n31:00.520 --> 31:01.840\nWell you shouldn't have murdered him.\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:02.840\nYeah.\n\n31:02.840 --> 31:03.840\nYeah.\n\n31:03.840 --> 31:07.040\nI feel like I took him away from his family.\n\n31:07.040 --> 31:11.800\nHe remember that he went on a trip right before and he had spent time glad he got to\n\n31:11.800 --> 31:12.800\nspend time.\n\n31:12.800 --> 31:13.800\nYeah, I know.\n\n31:13.800 --> 31:16.120\nNo, he was a great family man, great husband, great father.\n\n31:16.120 --> 31:17.120\nYeah.\n\n31:17.120 --> 31:24.920\nHe took as much of that away as I could, and for nothing, for nothing.\n\n31:24.920 --> 31:29.240\nSome people may say that the fact that he was great at his job made him a better family\n\n31:29.240 --> 31:30.240\nman.\n\n31:30.240 --> 31:31.240\nYeah.\n\n31:31.240 --> 31:32.240\nYeah, no.\n\n31:32.240 --> 31:37.920\nYou may have provided like a full universe for a person to express themselves fully.\n\n31:37.920 --> 31:42.600\nIf you looked at that room last night, that's what you saw, is that there's a room full\n\n31:42.600 --> 31:48.280\nof people who are standing around all agreeing, and that's what you've created.\n\n31:48.280 --> 31:54.120\nSo the fact that Mike was a part of that, a massive part of that, is amazing, and it\n\n31:54.120 --> 31:55.920\nsuper sucks that he's gone.\n\n31:55.920 --> 31:56.920\nYeah.\n\n31:56.920 --> 32:02.680\nI'm sorry, but I don't mean to like fucking draw it out and all that stuff, but I want\n\n32:02.680 --> 32:05.600\nto get to the bottom of it.\n\n32:05.600 --> 32:10.680\nThat's the profane thing to me is the idea of like, it's this old Hollywood thing of\n\n32:10.680 --> 32:18.000\nlike, yeah, what we do is so important that it's worth human life, and it's not like,\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:19.000\nI mean, that's...\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nWell, nothing's worth that.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:25.480\nBut if you have to be stuck on this motherfucker, you might as well make a show like that.\n\n32:25.480 --> 32:26.480\nYeah.\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:27.480\nYeah.\n\n32:27.480 --> 32:30.560\nI mean, he chose the job, right?\n\n32:30.560 --> 32:32.680\nHe probably could have quit.\n\n32:32.680 --> 32:33.680\nNo.\n\n32:33.680 --> 32:34.680\nNo.\n\n32:34.680 --> 32:38.680\nThat's why this is so complicated.\n\n32:38.680 --> 32:39.680\nNo, but like...\n\n32:39.680 --> 32:44.560\nYeah, actually, we didn't tell, you know, that's, there was this controversial program.\n\n32:44.560 --> 32:45.560\nWe...\n\n32:45.560 --> 32:46.560\nYeah.\n\n32:46.560 --> 32:47.560\nWe actually selected him for birth.\n\n32:47.560 --> 32:48.560\nNick, how are you?\n\n32:48.560 --> 32:50.680\nWhat's it like growing up in New Jersey?\n\n32:50.680 --> 32:54.800\nDon't say that, and then I...\n\n32:54.800 --> 32:56.560\nI love growing up in New Jersey.\n\n32:56.560 --> 32:58.200\nYeah, what was that like?\n\n32:58.200 --> 33:01.600\nI like it better than the old one.\n\n33:01.600 --> 33:03.200\nI didn't grow up in New Jersey.\n\n33:03.200 --> 33:04.200\nOkay.\n\n33:04.200 --> 33:08.400\nI grew up on the Coney Island Pier, which is not New Jersey, I don't think.\n\n33:08.400 --> 33:09.400\nYou ever go out?\n\n33:09.400 --> 33:10.400\nYeah.\n\n33:10.400 --> 33:12.840\nYou grew up in New Jersey, you went on the Coney Island Pier.\n\n33:12.840 --> 33:16.560\nI was a carnival barker on the Coney Island Pier.\n\n33:16.560 --> 33:18.080\nWhere were you born, Nick Rutherford?\n\n33:18.080 --> 33:20.120\nI was born in Tarzana, California.\n\n33:20.120 --> 33:21.120\nAre you shitting?\n\n33:21.120 -->

I do what the fuck. Just listen. Six feet under. So your band immediately\n\n45:38.480 --> 45:48.480\nreleased a song. Yeah, it's like Bad Company. Okay. Yeah, everyone's gonna get that reference.\n\n45:48.480 --> 45:55.480\nOh, I'm sorry. It's like Phil Collins. Does he never had a son named Phil Collins? No,\n\n45:55.480 --> 46:01.480\nI don't. I don't think he ever said his name in any of his. Well, I don't think you choose\n\n46:01.480 --> 46:13.480\nwhatever reference you want. Okay, Tori Amos. I am after all a black Twitter Tori Amos.\n\n46:13.480 --> 46:30.480\nWhat? Just listen to the thing. I'm sorry. They love it. Keep going. Six feet under.\n\n46:30.480 --> 46:37.480\nWe want to know how this is going. Going long and strong. Six feet under. You're\n\n46:37.480 --> 46:49.480\nin a grave, but you won't be buried long. I am six feet under. That's cool. Black Twitter came\n\n46:49.480 --> 46:59.480\naround. Everyone expects black Twitter to not be into white people. Shit. I like this band.\n\n46:59.480 --> 47:08.480\nI love it. I love six feet under. Good. You want to go see them in concert? Yes. Okay.\n\n47:08.480 --> 47:19.480\nHere we go. Three hours later. That'll be seven hundred dollars. God damn it.\n\n47:19.480 --> 47:30.480\nThey were performing in like Arizona. Yep. That's cool.\n\n47:30.480 --> 47:40.480\nSix feet under. They're Irish. I think they're Australian.\n\n47:40.480 --> 47:52.480\nEverything's Irish. Jamaican. Alright. That's not going anywhere.\n\n47:52.480 --> 48:01.480\nOkay. Well, anyway, so it's kind of a show, but not a show. Six feet under. No, this.\n\n48:01.480 --> 48:08.480\nThis is kind of, I mean, this feels like a show. I think we did good so far. Yeah, I think we did good.\n\n48:08.480 --> 48:16.480\nHow's Harmon Quest going? Oh, it's done. We put it out already, and it's in the hands of the people.\n\n48:16.480 --> 48:24.480\nYou got any numbers on that? Did you retain the office's ratings? No. That was always the metric when I\n\n48:24.480 --> 48:30.480\nwas your age. Yeah. That makes sense. How much of the office did you retain? I don't think any of it.\n\n48:30.480 --> 48:36.480\nOkay. Well, you failed then. Yeah. We're moving you to 8 p.m. Good luck. I mean, that sounds great.\n\n48:36.480 --> 48:44.480\nWell, okay. CBS thinks so, too. Fuck off. Oh shit. Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.\n\n48:44.480 --> 48:52.480\nSteve Levy looking wonderful tonight. Doing a big hug. Jesus. That's how drunk I am.\n\n48:52.480 --> 48:57.480\nThat's Levy brought out the booze like an hour into the show instead of 20 minutes.\n\n48:57.480 --> 49:03.480\nHe was like, maybe this, maybe this will help. I don't know. Just more alcohol.\n\n49:03.480 --> 49:11.480\nWe get to start booking real guess per se. All right. No, he's back.\n\n49:11.480 --> 49:20.480\nGo up. Hey Nick, when it comes to cities, Tarzana, not being from California, Tarzana, you have a rivalry with\n\n49:20.480 --> 49:28.480\nwhat city? Well, I Jane, Jane, Janesville. Yeah, civilization.\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:36.480\nWell, I didn't grow up in Tarzana. I grew up in Thousand Oaks. Okay. So I was born in the valley raised in Ventura County.\n\n49:36.480 --> 49:40.480\nThousand Oaks is great. I grew up in Moore Park and when you wanted to have fun, you would go to Thousand Oaks,\n\n49:40.480 --> 49:47.480\nor if you wanted to not have very much fun, you go to CV Valley. Yeah, CV Valley is like more kind of funkier.\n\n49:47.480 --> 49:55.480\nThe thing I know about CV Valley is they had an outlier in terms of per capita incest rates\n\n49:55.480 --> 50:02.480\nand an outlier and the shows back on track. Ladies and gentlemen, thank Christ. What did you get here by bus?\n\n50:02.480 --> 50:07.480\nHoly shit entertainment finally arrived. Yeah, no, but all the cool people went to Thousand Oaks.\n\n50:07.480 --> 50:13.480\nThat's where the mall was more. Oh God. Oh God. Yeah. Hey guys, how did you find out about the incest thing\n\n50:13.480 --> 50:18.480\nand then what are the what are the numbers? I looked at the census. No, I don't know.\n\n50:18.480 --> 50:26.480\nI ran the numbers. It's on there. Like welcome to see me son. It was it. Yeah, it says population, but really population.\n\n50:26.480 --> 50:30.480\nTwenty thousand five thousand incest.\n\n50:30.480 --> 50:36.480\nWhat are we going to confront the fact pornographically that literally everyone is getting online and\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:42.480\nlike good, like it's like stupid fucking there. Step four. And hub is this beautiful thing where they like they can report\n\n50:42.480 --> 50:48.480\nthese numbers. They go happy St. Patrick's Day. Here's how many people search for leprechaun rape. Yeah.\n\n50:48.480 --> 50:53.480\nAnd it's like, it's like, it's like, what's his name? Kinsey. Like, like that's what we had back in the day was that\n\n50:53.480 --> 51:01.480\nKinsey guy, like, like who basically just represented to everyone is like, Hey, whatever you're thinking, like, no one's normal.\n\n51:01.480 --> 51:09.480\nThat was that was his contribution to mankind. And that's kind of what porn hub represents. Yeah, it's like they're like,\n\n51:09.480 --> 51:19.480\nHey, everybody, you're all searching for incest porn. All of you. Well, that's all there is. I heard someone say that that the\n\n51:19.480 --> 51:27.480\nincrease, like the attention towards incest porn signaled a deep lack of connection felt by the user base. Everyone is feeling\n\n51:27.480 --> 51:35.480\nsuper isolated and they don't have any sort of connections to draw upon. So, you know, when you kind of eroticize that,\n\n51:35.480 --> 51:43.480\nyou know, like the truest form of a bond is someone who's already here. But I find that this is going to sound silly, but I\n\n51:43.480 --> 51:51.480\nfind that incredibly unscientific. Oh, no, that's philosophical. Very easily say philosophically that no, it's the opposite,\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:59.480\nlike that people are too connected with their families. Well, I connected. Here's a sample size of one, but I hate everyone\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:08.480\nin my family and I love incest porn. So, you know, I guess that's also not scientific. It's just taboo, right? It's like,\n\n52:08.480 --> 52:17.480\nwell, that's part of it. It's like you got to I think it's like, but my biggest question is, does sex have to be taboo?\n\n52:17.480 --> 52:22.480\nThat's my huge question. Like, could you have a good money?\n\n52:22.480 --> 52:30.480\nCould humankind, if they were given an infinite sandbox, if they were given total permission and there was no such thing as taboo,\n\n52:30.480 --> 52:45.480\nwould sexuality, my speculation, my gut tells me that sex is not automatically tied to naughtiness.\n\n52:45.480 --> 52:54.480\nAnd it's just it's not even American. It's just like human, like homo sapien, like we kind of we just have this thing like,\n\n52:54.480 --> 53:01.480\noh, it's naughty because we're so into it. And part of what we're into is the naughtiness. It's like putting your thumb over a garden hose\n\n53:01.480 --> 53:04.480\nand like makes it spray more.\n\n53:04.480 --> 53:07.480\nThis is how you jerk off. That's how I do it.\n\n53:07.480 --> 53:18.480\nThe inhibition is what drives things. But I don't think that that thumb needs to be there. I think there's a version of humanity that just flows out of the hose.\n\n53:18.480 --> 53:25.480\nWell, I think taboo taboo is attractive the same way it's attractive to touch a hot stove. It's like, I know I can't do that.\n\n53:25.480 --> 53:28.480\nSo I want to. But it's like, so that's part of what's important.\n\n53:28.480 --> 53:34.480\nBut I don't think I think that's a human inclination that then goes and ties in with our shame towards sex and stuff.\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:39.480\nBut yeah, I think that we would still seek out various forms of taboo if sex weren't taboo, but it wouldn't be.\n\n53:39.480 --> 53:46.480\nThere's another function of taboo that I think when I explore it myself, I go like, why is that I'm thinking about this fucked up shit?\n\n53:46.480 --> 53:49.480\nYou know, when I have so much permission to do whatever I want.\n\n53:49.480 --> 53:56.480\nI like, why am I continually going to like bad places where I'm not supposed to be going to grab that officer's gun?\n\n53:56.480 --> 54:00.480\nThat's all I think about.\n\n54:00.480 --> 54:04.480\nHot stoves and I don't know what I got to do with it.\n\n54:04.480 --> 54:07.480\nBut once I have it, then I'll know.\n\n54:07.480 --> 54:14.480\nAnd I think the answer is because as human beings, as animals, we want to just engage in sex.\n\n54:14.480 --> 54:19.480\nWe want to have fun with sex, but we work with each other.\n\n54:19.480 --> 54:23.480\nWe wear neckties. We go like, oh, can I take your order, please?\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:30.480\nWe have alphabets. We don't just fuck to make up words. We don't just shit in the street.\n\n54:30.480 --> 54:31.480\nWe go in toilets.\n\n54:31.480 --> 54:42.480\nAnd so we, as human beings, as sentient mammals, we don't even trust ourselves to be fully sexual unless we build a wall around it.\n\n54:42.480 --> 54:48.480\nWe need it to be private or we don't really actually trust that it's erotic.\n\n54:48.480 --> 54:49.480\nOr intimate.\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:52.480\nI mean, that's the other component of it is that because it's intimacy, it's got to be hidden.\n\n54:52.480 --> 54:55.480\nSo there is this automatic built-in naughty, right?\n\n54:55.480 --> 54:57.480\nIt's because you're eating chocolate.\n\n54:57.480 --> 55:02.480\nWell, it's kind of like how many friendships are based off of this moment where you take each other aside and you're like,\n\n55:02.480 --> 55:04.480\nare you thinking what I'm thinking?\n\n55:04.480 --> 55:09.480\nIt's like naughty. There's something. It's like shit talking to a third friend or some situation you're both in.\n\n55:09.480 --> 55:19.480\nIt's like, it's that it is the fact that you're not supposed to be saying what you're saying that actually makes what you're going through sincere.\n\n55:19.480 --> 55:20.480\nYes.\n\n55:20.480 --> 55:23.480\nAnd there's something really funny about that.\n\n55:23.480 --> 55:37.480\nIt equates to me with that feral pig thing where the reason feral pigs are a problem is because there are people who are incentivized to hunt feral pigs.\n\n55:37.480 --> 55:39.480\nAnd so they're breeding the pigs.\n\n55:39.480 --> 55:46.480\nLike if you really wanted feral pigs to go away, you should make it not legal to hunt them.\n\n55:46.480 --> 55:56.480\nWhereas if you really wanted taboo sexuality to go away, you should accept that sexuality is what it is.\n\n55:56.480 --> 55:59.480\nBecause people then be like, okay, I'm allowed to be sexual.\n\n55:59.480 --> 56:04.480\nBut it's like, for my money, I find myself with Cody.\n\n56:04.480 --> 56:05.480\nMy mind will wander.\n\n56:05.480 --> 56:08.480\nI'm like, why is my mind wandering when I'm with Cody?\n\n56:08.480 --> 56:10.480\nWe're already filthy enough.\n\n56:10.480 --> 56:13.480\nWe get up to enough bad shit.\n\n56:13.480 --> 56:24.480\nAnd I'm like, oh, it's because you want to trick your brain into only focusing on the primal sexuality.\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:25.480\nLike you trust it then.\n\n56:25.480 --> 56:33.480\nYou're like, well, there's no way this has anything to do with anything other than my dick then if this is what's going on.\n\n56:33.480 --> 56:35.480\nI nailed it.\n\n56:37.480 --> 56:38.480\nIt's drywall.\n\n56:38.480 --> 56:39.480\nTaboo is drywall.\n\n56:39.480 --> 56:44.480\nIt's just like it's a taboo's drywall.\n\n56:44.480 --> 56:46.480\nWe proved it.\n\n56:46.480 --> 56:50.480\nI think you kind of hit on it that you have a little secret.\n\n56:50.480 --> 56:51.480\nPeople bond over secrets.\n\n56:51.480 --> 56:54.480\nThey bond over something that they can withhold from other people.\n\n56:54.480 --> 56:57.480\nAnd that is, in a way, connection.\n\n56:57.480 --> 57:00.480\nAlso, can we get back to touching the hot stove?\n\n57:00.480 --> 57:01.480\nI'll get there.\n\n57:01.480 --> 57:03.480\nWhat do you want to talk about it?\n\n57:03.480 --> 57:06.480\nI am so afraid of getting burnt.\n\n57:06.480 --> 57:10.480\nI got burnt making popcorn.\n\n57:10.480 --> 57:11.480\nYeah.\n\n57:11.480 --> 57:12.480\nAnd that's the story.\n\n57:12.480 --> 57:17.480\nWell, do you have the thing where when you're up high, you picture yourself jumping off?\n\n57:17.480 --> 57:18.480\nYes, I do have that.\n\n57:18.480 --> 57:25.480\nI think the human mind has this mechanism, and it's a survival mechanism, where it's kind of like flashcards.\n\n57:25.480 --> 57:28.480\nIt runs through scenarios and then has visceral reaction to that.\n\n57:28.480 --> 57:31.480\nAnd those cement the connections on our brain.\n\n57:31.480 --> 57:34.480\nAnd so you think of jumping off a cliff, and then you're like, bad.\n\n57:34.480 --> 57:35.480\nThat's scary.\n\n57:35.480 --> 57:36.480\nAnd you're like, okay.\n\n57:36.480 --> 57:40.480\nIf I'm in a situation where that actually comes up, or remember that feels terrible, and I won't do it.\n\n57:40.480 --> 57:47.480\nThe same with grabbing a cop's gun or, you know, like you keep wedging that in there, man.\n\n57:47.480 --> 57:48.480\nThat's the kind of thing.\n\n57:48.480 --> 57:53.480\nWhenever I see a cop, I'm like, man, I could just sucker punch it right in the neck.\n\n57:53.480 --> 57:56.480\nWhat do you do with it?\n\n57:56.480 --> 57:58.480\nYou're only going to seal your own death.\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:02.480\nLike that's the only thing that could come of that, but it's something I think about all the time.\n\n58:02.480 --> 58:03.480\nI can't stop.\n\n58:03.480 --> 58:05.480\nWe know, we know.\n\n58:05.480 --> 58:10.480\nBut yeah, like so I think there's a lot of shameful thoughts we have, and then we have guilt associated with it,\n\n58:10.480 --> 58:19.480\nbut it's like you having that thought and then that reaction is you affirming like your ethical nature or something, you know,\n\n58:19.480 --> 58:24.480\nand I think that's I think people think those thoughts and they're like, oh, this is so violent or something.\n\n58:24.480 --> 58:32.480\nThis is I'm so fucked up, but it's like no, you're revolts by that, and that's because like that's your brain reminding you to not be a sociopath.\n\n58:32.480 --> 58:37.480\nBecause if you're like, oh man, that actually seems like a fine thing to do with no consequences.\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:39.480\nThat means your brain doesn't work right.\n\n58:39.480 --> 58:43.480\nI feel like the worst elements among us are constantly using like naturalism.\n\n58:43.480 --> 58:45.480\nWe've talked about this before.\n\n58:45.480 --> 58:52.480\nThey act like if they can conceive of the idea that it would be natural or people have a natural inclination.\n\n58:52.480 --> 58:58.480\nIt's like, aha, that's proof like women do this and you know it ladies don't fucking deny it.\n\n58:58.480 --> 59:04.480\nAh, we proved it. It's like, yeah, but you people take shits, but you do it in a toilet because if you did it in the street,\n\n59:04.480 --> 59:05.480\nwe don't get sick.\n\n59:05.480 --> 59:08.480\nYeah, natural natural. It's called like the naturalism fallacy.\n\n59:08.480 --> 59:14.480\nIt's a classic logical fallacy that people use to try and excuse behavior, but it just doesn't hold up most of the time because\n\n59:14.480 --> 59:18.480\nwell, like you said, like we built a toilet because shitting is natural.\n\n59:18.480 --> 59:22.480\nLike it's like and we are fucking 80 instead of 50 because of it.\n\n59:22.480 --> 59:24.480\nYeah, exactly. So natural isn't good.\n\n59:24.480 --> 59:27.480\nYeah, but their whole premises natural is better than unnatural.\n\n59:27.480 --> 59:30.480\nIt doesn't make any set like alphabets aren't natural.\n\n59:30.480 --> 59:32.480\nNo, we fucking made that shit up.\n\n59:32.480 --> 59:36.480\nYeah, it's crazy. It's crazy to think that all the words are made up.\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:38.480\nSee it's crazy. Yeah.\n\n59:38.480 --> 59:43.480\nYeah, come on. Come on with E. Yeah.\n\n59:43.480 --> 59:45.480\nYeah, come on. Yeah.\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:47.480\nI do that than F. I like F.\n\n59:47.480 --> 59:49.480\nI mean, okay.\n\n59:49.480 --> 59:53.480\nWell, it's pretty cool, but G H.\n\n59:53.480 --> 59:55.480\nThis is like your egg.\n\n59:55.480 --> 59:57.480\nBig H fan over there.\n\n59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480\nOkay, I loves H.\n\n01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.480\nI like, you know, bonobo monkeys.\n\n01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.480\nYeah, you know what they love incest.\n\n01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.480\nAnd if I can gang or G's.\n\n01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.480\nYeah, they they it's like conflict resolution.\n\n01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.480\nThey love winky fencing.\n\n01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.480\nThey are genetically our look it up the closest animal to us.\n\n01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.480\nThat's also another species.\n\n01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.480\nWe are bonobo.\n\n01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.480\nI'm very fascinated by it, but we they don't have religion or like, you know,\n\n01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:29.480\nProtestantism telling you like, don't this is the limit.\n\n01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.480\nThat was the biggest word I know.\n\n01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.480\nDon't, you know, don't you gross.\n\n01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.480\nOh, you grabbed a booby that's gross.\n\n01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.480\nDon't touch up.\n\n01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480\nYeah.\n\n01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.480\nYou know what bonobos do and they get in the fucking tussle over a banana.\n\n01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480\nThey suck each other off.\n\n01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480\nYeah. Yeah.\n\n01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.480\nYeah, they have orgies.\n\n01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.480\nThere's they that's their breakdown.\n\n01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.480\nOne of the bonobos is like, oh, you're sucking me right now.\n\n01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.480\nYeah, they're like, they're like, like two bonobo tribes are like,\n\n01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.480\nthere's only so much fresh water here.\n\n01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.480\nI got an idea.\n\n01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.480\nAnd then someone's like, all right, it's go time.\n\n01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.480\nAnd then they just all fucking suck.\n\n01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.480\nAnd then they wake up and they're like, we can share the water.\n\n01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.480\nYeah.\n\n01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.480\nWhat the fuck, man?\n\n01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.480\nLike, let's all agree.\n\n01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.480\nThe only reason we wanted water is so we could hydrate so we could do this.\n\n01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.480\nMore fucking and goddamn, you're a great sucker.\n\n01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480\nThat's my sister.\n\n01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480\nThere's my cousin.\n\n01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.480\nThere's my uncle Glenn.\n\n01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.480\nWe're doing it fucking upside down.\n\n01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:30.480\nScientists were studying bonobos like there's a there's a huge like lag behind the scientific\n\n01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:36.480\nstudy of them because in the fifties, people were just like they kept like noting their\n\n01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.480\nbehavior and not writing it down.\n\n01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.480\nLiterally, they were just like, well, that's fucked up.\n\n01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480\nI can't write that down.\n\n01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.480\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.480\nI can't tell my wife what I watched today.\n\n01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.480\nAnd that is the generation primatologist, not a pornographer.\n\n01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.480\nYeah.\n\n01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480\nRight.\n\n01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480\nAnd they would just go, well, that's an outlier.\n\n01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.480\nIt turns out we are the outliers.\n\n01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480\nThat is what we are.\n\n01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.480\nWe want to fuck and suck, baby.\n\n01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480\nThat's it.\n\n01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.480\nThat's all we have to do to live is eat and fuck.\n\n01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.480\nThat's it.\n\n01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.480\nBut Desmond Morris says, well, then we had to compete with wolves.\n\n01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.480\nSo like the other part of us is like, we have this pack mentality, this alpha mentality.\n\n01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.480\nLike we're ashamed of our fucking sucky part.\n\n01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.480\nLike we hate, we hate how communist we are.\n\n01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.480\nWe hate that we just want to groom each other and lick each other's tits.\n\n01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:32.480\nWe don't like it because it suggests to us that we're going to die, which is not an unfounded\n\n01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.480\nbelief, genetically, because our primate cousins are like dying.\n\n01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.480\nAnd we are-\n\n01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.480\nBut they're dying because they didn't invent drywall.\n\n01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.480\nWell, I mean, they're dying not really because of us.\n\n01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.480\nThey're dying because it's hard to have a planet that's so lush that its equator can support\n\n01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.480\nthis fucking giant, tailless ape that doesn't climb trees anymore because it's too heavy\n\n01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:01.480\nand just hangs out and wipes its ass with its hand and fucking howls at the moon.\n\n01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.480\nIt's like a flash on the pan.\n\n01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.480\nBut the version of those primates that experimented with this weird forebrain, that's us, and\n\n01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.480\nhere we are going strong.\n\n01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.480\nWe're ashamed of our animal nature.\n\n01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:20.480\nWe hate the part of us that would save our lives right now.\n\n01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.480\nWe hate that we just want to chill.\n\n01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.480\nAnd if we just held ourselves to the standard that we had when we were chimpanzees, we could fucking save the world.\n\n01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.480\nBut we have this compulsion.\n\n01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480\nWe're just like, yeah, but what about my iPhone?\n\n01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480\nWhat about the fucking smokestacks?\n\n01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480\nWhat about the rocket ships?\n\n01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.480\nWhat about fighting this other person?\n\n01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:48.480\nYou told me, Brandon, at one point, we're still genetically acting like we're competing over resources.\n\n01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.480\nYeah, scarcity.\n\n01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:57.480\nAt the end of the day, we go through all this technology and we get to these great heights,\n\n01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:04.480\nbut there's always two floors of breast augmentation and one floor for sick kids with cancer because we're monkeys.\n\n01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.480\nAnd we're just like, Titty, oh, Titty, make Titty room.\n\n01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480\nGotta make Titty floor.\n\n01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.480\nTitty floor, like, well, your kid's sick.\n\n01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.480\nI know my kid's sick, Titty, Titty, Titty.\n\n01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.480\nGot a Titty shiny monkey banana, more banana.\n\n01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.480\nAnd you can tell monkeys this is going to be awful for you.\n\n01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.480\nThis piece of technology is going to be awful for you, whether it's breast augmentation or a cell phone screen.\n\n01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.480\nAnd they're like, yeah, but Titty.\n\n01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.480\nYeah, but can you imagine a monkey with tits?\n\n01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.480\nThat would be fucking hell.\n\n01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.480\nIf you could just talk to a chimpanzee.\n\n01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.480\nIf chimpanzees could talk, that would be, if you could teach one to talk, not sign language, none of that bullshit.\n\n01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.480\nOh, okay, not sign language bullshit.\n\n01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:48.480\nAll right, sorry, deaf people that listen to the podcast.\n\n01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480\nWe're going to lift that.\n\n01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.480\nThey're going to hear you laugh and it's going to be fucked up.\n\n01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.480\nYeah, you guys fucked you.\n\n01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.480\nYeah, that's on you guys. That was a test.\n\n01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.480\nYeah, whoever's signing you guys to them, it's on you guys.\n\n01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.480\nIf a chimpanzee could actually have a sentient conversation with us, that would be, that's what we need.\n\n01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.480\nThe atonement with the fire.\n\n01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.480\nWe have that. It's called the president.\n\n01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.480\nYeah.\n\n01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:20.480\nNo, no, that's a fucking wolf. That guy's a fucking jagoff.\n\n01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:28.480\nA chimpanzee would go, okay, what's all this ruckus? What are you guys doing? What's happening?\n\n01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.480\nAnd we'd be like, we're trying to save the earth.\n\n01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.480\nWe got ass.\n\n01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.480\nFrom what? Spotted leopards, giraffes, ants?\n\n01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.480\nLike, what is it? A chimpanzee would be like, what the fuck is your problem? Calm down.\n\n01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.480\nAnd we'd be like, no, no, no, it's these people in Saudi Arabia and they're doing like,\n\n01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.480\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.480\nLike, what are you so fucking panicked about?\n\n01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.480\nBut they're tribal.\n\n01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.480\nYeah, they literally war.\n\n01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.480\nYeah, chimpanzees are gnarly.\n\n01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.480\nBut they're just as worried as we are just about, you know.\n\n01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.480\nAll right, well, you guys are taking it a little more literally.\n\n01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.480\nAll the monkey mad because we told them to be a monkey.\n\n01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.480\nYeah, I know if we could talk to an actual monkey that they'd be inferior to us culturally.\n\n01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.480\nYou know what you should do is rip that guy's head open and ease his brain.\n\n01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.480\nThat'll solve the problem.\n\n01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:19.480\nI just mean, I'm saying like, like us minus the thing that separates us from chimps,\n\n01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.480\nwhich is like this fucking compulsion to reach for the stars.\n\n01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.480\nWe are no, our stars are shit.\n\n01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:32.480\nIf we could just, if we were just to take a one breath and go, what if we just as a litmus test,\n\n01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.480\nwhat if we just for one second held ourselves to the standard of the chimpanzee.\n\n01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.480\nAnd fuck frogs.\n\n01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480\nYeah.\n\n01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:48.480\nAnd like, which would define a frog as a great Saturday afternoon and which would define indoors as a fucking miracle\n\n01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.480\nbecause we control the weather.\n\n01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.480\nLike a chimpanzee that could make a house would be a chimpanzee that wouldn't make war.\n\n01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.480\nA chimpanzee, they would be like, fuck, why are you fucking kidding me?\n\n01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.480\nBut they do, they make, they make like leave houses and leave beds.\n\n01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480\nAnd they, they,\n\n01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.480\nI think what you're saying is, I don't know, I keep coming back to more and more in my life\n\n01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.480\nthan like humans are driven to strive.\n\n01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480\nWe like being in conflicts.\n\n01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.480\nWe like, we have a goal and we go for this goal.\n\n01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.480\nBut then you hit that goal and you're like, well, this fucking sucks.\n\n01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480\nI hate this.\n\n01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.480\nI hate myself.\n\n01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.480\nNothing has changed.\n\n01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.480\nI still want to die.\n\n01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.480\nWe're afflicted as a species.\n\n01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.480\nYeah.\n\n01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.480\nBut I think that, so like if you could like go to therapy and work that out, but it's like,\n\n01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480\nevery human has that.\n\n01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:33.480\nAnd I think that's evolutionary because it's like, oh man, I just got to jump over this cliff.\n\n01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.480\nSo I get away from the wolf and like a couple of people survived and passed down that trait.\n\n01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.480\nAnd it's like, I'm really good under serious pressure.\n\n01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.480\nAnd I only feel like alive under pressure.\n\n01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.480\nAnd once I accomplish the thing that I evolutionarily am allowed to accomplish, I don't feel better\n\n01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.480\nbecause evolution wants me to keep going, keep doing those same things and keep propagating\n\n01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.480\nthe species.\n\n01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.480\nBut that just makes us all miserable.\n\n01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:00.480\nLike if you put a spider in an aquarium full of flies, like, and it was like, I got to\n\n01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.480\nbuild a web.\n\n01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480\nI got to build a web.\n\n01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.480\nAnd you'd be like, dude, you don't have to build a web.\n\n01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.480\nAnd the spider would be like, what are you talking about?\n\n01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480\nHow am I going to catch all these flies?\n\n01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.480\nNo, the flies are right there.\n\n01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:14.480\nLike if the spider could just understand and cheat the system and go, oh, the flies are\n\n01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:21.480\nthere, I'll save all of this biological energy that God gave me, like, that my metabolism\n\n01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:27.480\nis so high because it expects my ass to like crank out silk.\n\n01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.480\nWhat if the spider was aware enough to go, yeah, but I don't have to do that.\n\n01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.480\nThere's a bucket of flies here.\n\n01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.480\nThat's the situation that we could be in.\n\n01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:40.480\nYou assume that the web is built to catch the flies, not that he is a compulsion to build\n\n01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.480\nthe web without knowing its relation to the flies.\n\n01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480\nWhat?\n\n01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.480\nYeah, that is it.\n\n01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480\nWow.\n\n01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.480\nBecause that is the human experience.\n\n01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480\nYeah, we just got to do it.\n\n01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.480\nWell, that's what, yeah, I agree with you there.\n\n01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.480\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:08:52.480 --> 01:09:04.480\nSkyscrapers, space programs, alphabets, eyeglasses, insulin, podcasts, Oprah, Tom Hanks, toothpicks.\n\n01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480\nOh, see the toothpick?\n\n01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.480\nOh, we didn't start the fire.\n\n01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.480\nI like this.\n\n01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.480\nAll of it is like a web we're spinning, like humans.\n\n01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480\nCrazy.\n\n01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.480\nAnd we have ourselves convinced that we're like making these decisions.\n\n01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480\nWe're not at all.\n\n01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.480\nObviously it's compulsive behavior or we wouldn't fucking do the shit that we do.\n\n01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:27.480\nIt's obviously compulsive, obviously.\n\n01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.480\nAnd we, but we measure intelligence by this thing where we go like, well, if you know\n\n01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.480\nwhat you're doing and then you choose to do it, that means it's your choice.\n\n01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.480\nThat's horse shit.\n\n01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.480\nWe're not, we're not choosing shit, Jack.\n\n01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.480\nNick, it's a little bit like your books coming out, right?\n\n01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.480\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.480\nYou're gonna write a chapter.\n\n01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.480\nYeah, I've lived with the bonobos for a year and we would just suck and fuck each other\n\n01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480\nall the time.\n\n01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.480\nYeah, I drank since 10 a.m. and how much do you think you drank?\n\n01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:02.480\nAnd we know how long you drank, but how much 75,000 units of alcohol.\n\n01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.480\nThat might be right.\n\n01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.480\nHow are you still able to do all this?\n\n01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.480\nIt's called functional alcoholism and it's like the most dangerous kind.\n\n01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.480\nDid you see Denzel Washington in flight?\n\n01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.480\nYeah, he saved all those people.\n\n01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.480\nYeah, those people are so pissed.\n\n01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480\nHe's a goddamn hero.\n\n01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.480\nThat's why that movie is so important because Denzel has nobody.\n\n01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.480\nHe's the only one holding himself accountable at the end.\n\n01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.480\nHe could fly a plane upside down and he could get away with drinking while flying.\n\n01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:33.480\nAnd then finally at the end, he alone has to be like, nah, dude, fuck you.\n\n01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480\nI'm drunk.\n\n01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.480\nI really was bummed by that ending.\n\n01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.480\nI don't know what that says about me.\n\n01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.480\nI'll never watch that movie again, but I will forever say that was such a...\n\n01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:51.480\nIn the world of cinematic portrayals of alcoholism, that is like the fucking end all be all.\n\n01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.480\nThat and McNulty and the wire.\n\n01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:57.480\nLike when he would get drunk, McNulty.\n\n01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480\nMcNulty?\n\n01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480\nFuck you guys.\n\n01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480\nOn the wire?\n\n01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.480\nThe wire.\n\n01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480\nCome on.\n\n01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.480\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480\nThe wire.\n\n01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480\nOh, for fuck's sake.\n\n01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480\nDavid Simon?\n\n01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.480\nOh my God, they just turned on me so hard.\n\n01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.480\nThe whole audience is over it.\n\n01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.480\nI'm sorry, there wasn't a dragon in it.\n\n01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.480\nFucking nerd.\n\n01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.480\nI've never, I didn't watch Game of Thrones either.\n\n01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.480\nI watch Wings.\n\n01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.480\nYeah.\n\n01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.480\nLaris.\n\n01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.480\nGod damn it.\n\n01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.480\nLaris.\n\n01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.480\nWhere are my wing heads at?\n\n01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.480\nNolan, our director really wants Wings.\n\n01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.480\nLet's see him flap them.\n\n01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:35.480\nLet's meet one friend who really genuinely feels like they deserve attention.\n\n01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.480\nI'm proud of you guys.\n\n01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.480\nThat was an amazing response.\n\n01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480\nThis dude has a sign.\n\n01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:48.480\nIt says, give me 90 seconds to speak.\n\n01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480\nOh no.\n\n01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.480\nWell, if they made a sign, let's find out what it's about.\n\n01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480\nCome on.\n\n01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.480\nCome on, sign guy.\n\n01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.480\nYeah, he got to come up because he got to come up.\n\n01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480\nIt's a style audience.\n\n01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480\nHe made a sign.\n\n01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480\nWho came from the farthest?\n\n01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.480\nBecause there's a lot of people in town for the last couple.\n\n01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480\nFlorida, who's farther than Florida?\n\n01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.480\nWe have anybody from Italy, Germany.\n\n01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.480\nMan, Germany, y'all always fuck up when y'all get up here,\n\n01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480\nbut we might fuck with you later.\n\n01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.480\nWhat's your name, friend?\n\n01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.480\nThis guy's like the perfect version of me.\n\n01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:20.480\nLaris.\n\n01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.480\nThis is so fucked up.\n\n01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.480\nHe's like airbrushed you.\n\n01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.480\nI like the tired and sick next to him.\n\n01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.480\nIt's fucking shirts open.\n\n01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.480\nHe took a Photoshop tool and just went for 25.\n\n01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480\nYes.\n\n01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480\nDamn it.\n\n01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480\nHe probably sings.\n\n01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480\nThere's that's another good guess.\n\n01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.480\nWhat's your name, friend?\n\n01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480\nMy name is Pele.\n\n01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.480\nPele is named after the soccer player.\n\n01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.480\nYeah.\n\n01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.480\nOh, Pele.\n\n01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480\nYeah, my dad was a big soccer fan.\n\n01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.480\nTo the audience.\n\n01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.480\nI waited for like a moment where he asked.\n\n01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.480\nI didn't just raise it.\n\n01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480\nNo.\n\n01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.480\nYou gotta forgive us.\n\n01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480\nWait.\n\n01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480\nThis is a sign guy?\n\n01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480\nThis is a sign guy.\n\n01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.480\nI feel pretty good then.\n\n01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.480\nEverybody relax.\n\n01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.480\nI very much respect our audiences like skepticism about people that come up.\n\n01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.480\nLike, yeah, you're right.\n\n01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480\nThat's good.\n\n01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:13.480\nYou're going like, hey, look, I'm not like some crazy person that just really thinks\n\n01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480\nthey're entitled to it.\n\n01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.480\nThat's what the audience worries about.\n\n01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480\nLike, oh, don't.\n\n01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480\nDon't.\n\n01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.480\nI could have been up there and I didn't go up there.\n\n01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.480\nWell, you just can't go up there because you want to be up there.\n\n01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.480\nYou're humble and you've done it.\n\n01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480\nYou nailed it.\n\n01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480\nNow you can do whatever you want.\n\n01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480\nBe racist.\n\n01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480\nI'm mixed race.\n\n01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.480\nThat would be a strange choice for me.\n\n01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480\nSo it would be OK.\n\n01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.480\nSo racist to say that.\n\n01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.480\nI don't see mixed race.\n\n01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.480\nWhat did your sign say?\n\n01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.480\nThe idea that mixed race people can't be racist.\n\n01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.480\nI find really offensive as a white person.\n\n01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.480\nWhat did your sign say?\n\n01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.480\nIt was kind of over promising because I thought that I could like weave together\n\n01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.480\nsome like disparate ideas.\n\n01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.480\nThe sign said, give me 90 seconds and I can offer a fulfilling conclusion.\n\n01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.480\nYou had 60 seconds right now.\n\n01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480\nSorry, 90.\n\n01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.480\n90 seconds.\n\n01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480\nYou had 60 seconds right now.\n\n01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.480\nI got people from Germany wanting to get up here, bro.\n\n01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.480\nYou better hurry up.\n\n01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.480\nI'm from Canada.\n\n01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:06.480\nThat makes a difference.\n\n01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480\nI got lost for years.\n\n01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.480\nYou're so handsome.\n\n01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.480\nYou're like handsome Nick Rutherford.\n\n01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:11.480\nDon't let him thwart you.\n\n01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.480\nYou got 30 more seconds.\n\n01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.480\nFirstly, I want to thank you for doing what you do, not just for this and for Harmonie.\n\n01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.480\nIt's not always easy, but I do it for the people.\n\n01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.480\nI appreciate that.\n\n01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:32.480\nAlso for opening up your platform over the years, I've been listening to you for a while\n\n01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.480\nto people who wouldn't otherwise be heard, regular people like myself and socialists\n\n01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.480\nand minorities and you're using your soft power, your platform to allow people to talk.\n\n01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.480\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.480\nBut shouldn't he use his hard power?\n\n01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.480\nDoesn't it feel like...\n\n01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:50.480\nDid you say soft power?\n\n01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.480\nIs that a phrase?\n\n01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.480\nYeah, I'm a political theorist.\n\n01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.480\nThat's why I wanted to talk.\n\n01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.480\nOh, really?\n\n01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480\nWhat does soft power mean?\n\n01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.480\nSo soft power is everything that's not hard power.\n\n01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.480\nGet the fluff off the stage!\n\n01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.480\nI got academia.\n\n01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480\nI got it.\n\n01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.480\nYou just survived for six years.\n\n01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:15.480\nSo hard power is like guns and money, it's military might and the straight up actual\n\n01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.480\ncapital P power, whereas soft power is diplomacy and yeah, hegemonic forces, cultural forces.\n\n01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.480\nLike if your country has all the movies.\n\n01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.480\nRight, or if you are a person who runs shows that are in the zeitgeist and you have some\n\n01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.480\nsoft power.\n\n01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480\nWhat did you want to say?\n\n01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:29.480\nOr if you happen to be...\n\n01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:30.480\nI sidetracked him.\n\n01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480\nI sidetracked him.\n\n01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480\nYou've got to be better than that.\n\n01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480\nYou get up here.\n\n01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480\nWhat did you want to say?\n\n01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480\nRight, sure.\n\n01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.480\nSo I am a little flustered, you might imagine, right now.\n\n01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.480\nUnacceptable.\n\n01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.480\nSitting next to me.\n\n01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.480\nIt's got to be hard.\n\n01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.480\nI run a tight ship.\n\n01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.480\nDon't take photos of this guy.\n\n01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.480\nTake photos of Nick.\n\n01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480\nThat would be next to him.\n\n01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480\nIt's like a before and after.\n\n01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.480\nThese are like faces of meth right here.\n\n01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480\nHey, get in there man.\n\n01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480\nGet in there.\n\n01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.480\nOkay, we know.\n\n01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:08.480\nSo you've, over the years I've watched as you've gone from being a centrist...\n\n01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.480\nHey man, give me security.\n\n01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.480\nSorry.\n\n01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.480\nGive me security.\n\n01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:20.680\nAnarchist leaning a political person into sort of recognizing your role as you quoted\n\n01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.480\nthe world shifted under your fees.\n\n01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.480\nAnd I just think that you've gone on a lot of rants.\n\n01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.480\nI've seen you existentially worry about the state of politics and power, but you've never\n\n01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.680\nlike delves into actually political theory.\n\n01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.960\nSo I just wanted to get one idea out to your brain.\n\n01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.960\nThat's what I wanted to do.\n\n01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960\nOh go for it.\n\n01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960\nNazism.\n\n01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.480\nGive it a shot.\n\n01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.320\nMixed race Nazism.\n\n01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.320\nHear me out.\n\n01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.480\nActually is practical.\n\n01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.820\nThis is the race that will dominate eventually.\n\n01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:57.980\nIt makes sense.\n\n01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.400\nIt's what God wants.\n\n01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.860\nMixed race Nazism.\n\n01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.860\nIt works.\n\n01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:04.860\nSorry.\n\n01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.360\nLet's get back in there Pelley.\n\n01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.360\nLet's get back.\n\n01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360\nI'm back.\n\n01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360\nAll right.\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360\nYou see Rutherford had you on the ropes.\n\n01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360\nMurdered you out there.\n\n01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360\nIt's a penalty time Pelley.\n\n01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360\nCome on.\n\n01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.480\nEssentially it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like you are recognizing the\n\n01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.480\nissues of late stage capitalism.\n\n01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.480\nYou know they booed Drake off stage last night.\n\n01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.360\nI'm going to let you know what LA will do to you unless you get into that second song\n\n01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.560\nwe all want to hear.\n\n01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560\nNow let's go.\n\n01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560\nOkay.\n\n01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560\nAnd it seems like-\n\n01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560\nBut I do have a flush drum.\n\n01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560\nI feel bad for it.\n\n01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.560\nNo.\n\n01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560\nLike say whatever you want.\n\n01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560\nThis is a really long 90 seconds.\n\n01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560\nDo it.\n\n01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.360\nAnd it seems like that to some degree you circle around the idea of anarchism as the alternative.\n\n01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:57.360\nAnd what that is doing is taking a corrupt and outdated mode of power or power structure\n\n01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.160\nand then replacing it with a lack of power instead of fixing the power structure or evolving\n\n01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160\nit.\n\n01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160\nI agree with you totally.\n\n01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160\nNo.\n\n01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160\nI'm saying that that doesn't work because of the nature-\n\n01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160\nOh, wait.\n\n01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160\nI disagree with you.\n\n01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.160\nNo.\n\n01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.160\nWait.\n\n01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160\nOkay.\n\n01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:13.160\nSorry.\n\n01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.160\nContinue.\n\n01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.960\nSo what I'm trying to say is that anarchy is impossible because of the maximum of power.\n\n01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:22.600\nThe essential nature of what power is is that it looks to concretize itself, to cement\n\n01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.560\nitself, to understand itself, and it doesn't go away like that.\n\n01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.200\nSo you need to fix the power structure, not dissolve the power structure.\n\n01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.000\nIt sounds nice in theory because it's like, oh, hey, everybody is on equal footing and\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.080\neverybody has equal power, but it's just what you're doing by the dissolution of political\n\n01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.600\npower is not empowering people.\n\n01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.160\nYou empower people by having a political power that is powerful enough to give power to the\n\n01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160\npeople.\n\n01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.160\nYeah.\n\n01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.160\nThat is anarchist.\n\n01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.400\nWe don't tend to roll non-hierarchically.\n\n01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:59.840\nWe tend to, no matter what, you give us an infinite sandbox, you give us a bunch of mushrooms.\n\n01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.480\nHierarchies tend to happen because we're primates.\n\n01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.080\nWe tend to fucking start leveraging each other and exchanging things, and people tend to\n\n01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.920\nrise up and you go, hey, is it me or is that guy more awesome than that guy?\n\n01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.320\nYou kind of start to compare things.\n\n01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320\nWhy would you say that?\n\n01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.920\nWhy was that the example you gave?\n\n01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:28.040\nI mean, I think I thought, yeah, I used to, I was way left of Noam Chomsky when we started\n\n01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.120\nthis podcast because I was like, I had that privilege.\n\n01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.120\nI never cared.\n\n01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.880\nI thought all politics was horseshit because it was dangling chads and are you going to\n\n01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.440\nconvince me Al Gore is any different from fucking George Bush and all my fucking bullshit?\n\n01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:46.120\nAnd then we went through, we sure showed me.\n\n01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.880\nWe really showed me a thing or two.\n\n01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880\nPolitics is not bullshit.\n\n01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.040\nIt actually is a thing.\n\n01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:56.960\nBecause both parties, admirably or not, they both got hacked at the same time.\n\n01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:04.040\nThe Democrats got hacked by, quote unquote, socialists just to oversimplify and the Republicans\n\n01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.240\ngot hacked to oversimplify Nazis because they were both smart enough to go, we're not going\n\n01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.800\nto suffer the third party fate.\n\n01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800\nWhat happened?\n\n01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800\nIt was just this creed.\n\n01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:17.880\nThe politics became real politics and then once it did, I was like, oh shit, I guess\n\n01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.480\nI can't be an anarchist anymore.\n\n01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.320\nI really can't because you actually have a bipartisan system that actually means something\n\n01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.560\nnow because right actually means Nazi and left actually means socialist and I don't\n\n01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:34.120\nwant either of them because I want my Obama back.\n\n01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.680\nThe other things that I was saying was total straight theory.\n\n01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.320\nThis is just opinion to some degree.\n\n01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.720\nI mean, it's based on, you can look at the empirical studies and you can look at the\n\n01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.160\ntheory of it and essentially you can call it reform liberalism or democratic socialism\n\n01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.360\nor social democracy.\n\n01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.280\nThey're all just different steps of the same thing, which is a synthesis of market society\n\n01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:00.160\nand a powerful enough Leviathan to provide for people, but that's the thing that is required.\n\n01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.160\nYou're so handsome.\n\n01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:02.160\nThank you so much.\n\n01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.320\nFocus on anything you're saying, I just want you to read my paper.\n\n01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:13.320\nTake my life.\n\n01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.320\nHere he goes.\n\n01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:26.640\nHey Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, leave the scooter.\n\n01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.320\nYeah, honestly, I'm too drunk to have followed what you just said and that's on me, not you.\n\n01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.920\nI mean, I don't know, man.\n\n01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.840\nWe've been doing this podcast for eight years.\n\n01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:44.400\nI've tried to be upfront about my politics, which is like, man, I was sucking my thumb\n\n01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.320\nand going like, voting is bullshit and democracies now.\n\n01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.320\nYou have been.\n\n01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320\nYou're amazing.\n\n01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320\nI so appreciate how a friend you've been about it.\n\n01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:57.360\nAnd then I told people when I changed my mind, I told people I was really wrong and I got\n\n01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:03.000\nreal invested to the extent that I'm like, no, man, it's not even politics to me when\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.960\nit's like fascism versus anything other than that.\n\n01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.640\nAnd most recently, because it's primary season and stuff, I'm like, I'm not even going to\n\n01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.720\ntalk about it because I don't want to be like, I'm an Elizabeth Warren guy and have everybody\n\n01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.560\nbecause I totally respect everybody.\n\n01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.120\nLike I don't want them fighting.\n\n01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:25.920\nLike it is a fucking heartbreak that the good guys and yeah, they're the good guys that\n\n01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.960\nthey're all fighting.\n\n01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.280\nThey have to fight now and so I can't even, it's like, I just watched the whole thing\n\n01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.280\nplay out.\n\n01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280\nAnd I'm like, God damn it.\n\n01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.440\nI wish there was some way that we could be as unified as the shit faces.\n\n01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.800\nYou can't as far as I can tell.\n\n01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:44.320\nI mean, as somebody who's involved in politics, progressive politics, that's where the thinkers\n\n01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.160\nare and that means that you get really neurotic people who are all worried about very specific\n\n01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.760\nand small issues or wording.\n\n01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:58.160\nWhen you think about like, like, like, like I talked on this podcast about because I heard\n\n01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.680\nsome radio lab episode or whatever about the Irish system, like the way they do, right?\n\n01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680\nYeah.\n\n01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.960\nIt's like everyone gets five votes and then they do some system where it's like, oh, yeah,\n\n01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960\nyeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:13.480\nFirst pass, the post is terrible and antiquated.\n\n01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.480\nIt doesn't.\n\n01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.480\nYeah.\n\n01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.480\nYeah.\n\n01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.480\nIt's true.\n\n01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.480\nLook it up.\n\n01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.160\nWhen you actually think about that, is that what that is, the five votes is the first\n\n01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.160\npass.\n\n01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.920\nNo, no, that's our system here and in Canada, which is where I'm from is first pass the\n\n01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.520\npost and he's Canadian.\n\n01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520\nOh, my God.\n\n01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.000\nYou're you're tri racial.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.760\nThat's the other half of the by.\n\n01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.760\nI bet it.\n\n01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.760\nThank you so much.\n\n01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760\nYou were wonderful.\n\n01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760\nThanks, man.\n\n01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760\nThank you.\n\n01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760\nYou know, good buddy.\n\n01:23:39.760

was like, I had to make a decision in my head.\n\n01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.720\nI was like, you were either going to weep in front of a bunch of people about your own\n\n01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:26.480\nsitcom, which is, as your generation calls it, a bad look, uh, or you're going to fucking\n\n01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.480\nrobot and like, I made the right decision.\n\n01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.480\nYou did really well.\n\n01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.480\nYeah.\n\n01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.480\nThank you.\n\n01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:34.480\nYeah.\n\n01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480\nNo, you did well.\n\n01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:36.480\nAnyway, so what, yeah, uh, it was emotional.\n\n01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.480\nIt was emotional.\n\n01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.840\nAnd, um, so since I've been here, so, okay, so I got here on the 9th of August and on\n\n01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.600\nthe 12th of August, there was my first Harmontown show and I've been coming every week\n\n01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.560\nand it's been like the best transitional thing for me because I mean, I don't know.\n\n01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.400\nLike this is the first time I've ever been here and I, I'm really bad at making friends,\n\n01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:00.000\nbut like Harmontown is the only like escape I have every week.\n\n01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.120\nAnd it's just, it's amazing because I've been listening to the podcasts, like I remember\n\n01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:08.360\nbeing at home back in Pakistan and just like listening to the podcast and like laughing\n\n01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.360\nto myself.\n\n01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.840\nAnd just the fact that I can be here live is just, it's insane and it's kind of a mind\n\n01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840\nblower to me.\n\n01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.120\nLike I have no image in my head of Pakistan.\n\n01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:24.560\nLike we, we, obviously that's where, that's where Kumail is from and like, I don't talk\n\n01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.960\nabout bad at making friends.\n\n01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.040\nLike I never asked him, what's it like there?\n\n01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.120\nUh, I have no image in my head, you know, like I don't know, like where, how, how, what\n\n01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120\nwas it?\n\n01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120\nWhat was it?\n\n01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120\nYou, you're, you're just a little baby.\n\n01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.520\nIf you started listening to the show back when we were doing it.\n\n01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.440\nI started listening in 2013.\n\n01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.720\nI was just starting my undergrad.\n\n01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.960\nSo yeah, I wasn't a baby.\n\n01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.960\nI was pretty old.\n\n01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:45.960\nWhat is it?\n\n01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960\nYeah.\n\n01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960\nYou're living with your parents in Pakistan.\n\n01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.960\nIt's like a house, an apartment.\n\n01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.120\nIt's a, so, um, we have a really large farmhouse.\n\n01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.360\nUm, so it's just, it's pretty cool, but it's very like rural.\n\n01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.160\nLike there's lots of donkeys.\n\n01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160\nDid you have like dogs?\n\n01:29:00.160 -->

01:29:06.160\nBrandon.\n\n01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.160\nWhat the heck?\n\n01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.960\nNo, I just wonder, was it long or short hair?\n\n01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.960\nHe's doing his cold reading technique.\n\n01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.680\nHe's a, he's about to tell you the ghost of your father watched you to, he buried your\n\n01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.040\nmoney in Arkansas.\n\n01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.560\nMy dog is a German shepherd.\n\n01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.960\nOh, so you had to, you had to cut his hair?\n\n01:29:21.960 -->

is, what is that?\n\n01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:33.360\nDo you just try to figure out, I'm just trying to figure out if she had a dog and they had\n\n01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360\nto cut the hair.\n\n01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.360\nThat's all.\n\n01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.360\nWhy?\n\n01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.360\nWhat?\n\n01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.360\nYou say that, like that's an innocent thing to want.\n\n01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.360\nWhat?\n\n01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:44.920\nYou know, I can't tell you the secrets of Comptrolling, but I get people to talk.\n\n01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.560\nDo you want to know about Victor's dog's hair length?\n\n01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.560\nSure.\n\n01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.360\nDid you have a dog when you were a kid, Victor?\n\n01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.360\nVincent.\n\n01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.360\nVincent.\n\n01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.360\nVincent.\n\n01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.360\nI'm just listening.\n\n01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360\nOkay.\n\n01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360\nI would have.\n\n01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360\nDid you have a dog?\n\n01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360\nYeah.\n\n01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.360\nHow long was his hair?\n\n01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360\nWho was involved in its upkeep?\n\n01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360\nDid you cut it?\n\n01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360\nI had.\n\n01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.360\nDid you dog of a barber?\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360\nI had a cat.\n\n01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:07.360\nA cat?\n\n01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.360\nHell yeah.\n\n01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.360\nHow long were his ears?\n\n01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.360\nSo many cats.\n\n01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:14.360\nDid you cut your cat's hair?\n\n01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.360\nYeah.\n\n01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.360\nWas it a short hair?\n\n01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.360\nOr a long hair?\n\n01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.360\nHairless.\n\n01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.360\nMedium.\n\n01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.360\nMedium.\n\n01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.360\nSo did you?\n\n01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.360\nOkay.\n\n01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.360\nDid you brush it?\n\n01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.360\nThat response, by the way, people are going to listen to this podcast 10 years from now.\n\n01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.360\nThey're going to think cats were going extinct.\n\n01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.360\nOh my God.\n\n01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.360\nIt's like Bojack Horseman.\n\n01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.360\nCats.\n\n01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.360\nAll right.\n\n01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.360\nAnyways.\n\n01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.360\nThat is like Bojack Horseman.\n\n01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360\nI know who we are now.\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360\nI know whatever.\n\n01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360\nI know what's going on now.\n\n01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360\nAll right.\n\n01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.360\nI don't know what's going on anymore.\n\n01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.360\nWhat brings you here from Germany, Vincent?\n\n01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360\nThis show.\n\n01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.360\nOh, this is the only thing.\n\n01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360\nHow long are you here for?\n\n01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360\nOh wow.\n\n01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:55.360\nTwo days.\n\n01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360\nOkay.\n\n01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360\nSo you're about to go back.\n\n01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.360\nYeah.\n\n01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360\nTomorrow morning.\n\n01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.360\nDid you really just come in a pilgrimage here for this show?\n\n01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.360\nI mean, I made some stops.\n\n01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.360\nI was in Berlin previously.\n\n01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.360\nAnd no, I mean, Berlin's in Germany, obviously.\n\n01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.360\nIt's not where I live.\n\n01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.360\nHave you been listening to this show for how long?\n\n01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.360\nHave you caught up?\n\n01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.360\nYeah.\n\n01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360\nI think I started at about episode 100, 100.\n\n01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360\nAnd then I made my way down and up.\n\n01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360\nAnd now I'm here.\n\n01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360\nHell yeah.\n\n01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360\nWhat's the...\n\n01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.360\nHere's the thing about ending this show.\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.360\nAll right.\n\n01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.360\nWhat?\n\n01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.360\nWhat?\n\n01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360\nOh, you didn't know.\n\n01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.360\nHe's not on the emails.\n\n01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.960\nI went to the vet once.\n\n01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.360\nI had a cat.\n\n01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.360\nIt was like...\n\n01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.360\nAll alone?\n\n01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.360\nYeah.\n\n01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.360\nWell, now you guys are over cats.\n\n01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360\nI remember the vet, like...\n\n01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360\nNow they don't even care about cats.\n\n01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360\nSaying to me, the vet was like, as if...\n\n01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360\nI think the vet was like...\n\n01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.360\nHe must have had this conversation with so many people, because I really didn't cue him\n\n01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.640\nto do this speech.\n\n01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.640\nBut he...\n\n01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.760\nIt seemed like he's just like so...\n\n01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:01.360\nHe so wanted people to understand this, that I almost thought he was like a cat murderer.\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:08.360\nBut he was like, you know, if your cat's sick, it's not human.\n\n01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.360\nSo it's not going to let you know.\n\n01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.360\nIt's not going to be like, oh, I'm sick.\n\n01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360\nYou know?\n\n01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.360\nAnd then you take the cat home.\n\n01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.360\nAnd it's curled up in its favorite sun ray.\n\n01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360\nWhat?\n\n01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:23.360\nAnd it's like...\n\n01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360\nIt's like wagging its tail.\n\n01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.360\nNo, this guy didn't know anything about cats.\n\n01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:33.360\nNo, but he was like, your cat acts like your cat, and then it's like, you don't want to put it down.\n\n01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:34.360\nBut he was like...\n\n01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:37.360\nThis was a guy who was pro-putting my cat down.\n\n01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.360\nHe was letting me know.\n\n01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.360\nIt's like, yeah, here's the thing.\n\n01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.360\nOnce you decide to put your cat down, your cat's going to start acting like a normal cat.\n\n01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.360\nYou still got to put it down.\n\n01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.360\nWhy did I bring that story of...\n\n01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.360\nYou were talking about the show ending.\n\n01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.360\nI know.\n\n01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.360\nThat's horrible, but that's going to make it even happy.\n\n01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.360\nYeah, the show feels healthy.\n\n01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.360\nBut you got to put it down.\n\n01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.360\nCody's dog, Barbara, is riddled with cancer, and it has been for a while.\n\n01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.360\nAnd it's like, we're saying goodbye to Barbara, and she's going to die.\n\n01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.360\nAnd it's like...\n\n01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.360\nShe's wagging her tail, and she's running all over the place.\n\n01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.360\nAnd it's like, fuck, man.\n\n01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:24.360\nIt's like knowing that she's going to die is making her seem even healthier\n\n01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.360\nthan if we didn't know that.\n\n01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360\nWhat is my fucking point?\n\n01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360\nYeah, that's such a weird thing, though.\n\n01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.360\nThat's the podcast.\n\n01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.360\nBecause there's always...\n\n01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.360\nLike you were saying, the doctors are always like, oh, man, it's okay.\n\n01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.360\nIt's torture to leave them alive.\n\n01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.360\nAnd it's like, well, it would be great to actually ask the pet, like,\n\n01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.360\noh, would you like to be ceased right now,\n\n01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.360\nor do you want to keep feeling pain for another terrible couple of weeks?\n\n01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.360\nBecause it's all just trying to assuage the guilt.\n\n01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.360\nBut it's like, no, you are ending their life, and that's crazy if you think about it.\n\n01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:56.360\nBut we had talked about this, and you had said something that really stuck with me,\n\n01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:03.360\nwhich is that we, as eugenicists who have been mastering the dog race forever,\n\n01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.360\nthere's not a dog alive that we haven't tampered with genetically.\n\n01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360\nI'm a big scholar of eugenicists.\n\n01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:16.360\nThe dogs that we have created, there's no biological profit in them registering pain\n\n01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.360\nor expressing it.\n\n01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:23.360\nLike, dogs that said, ow, gone.\n\n01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nLike, they're not in the gene pool.\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:31.360\nDogs that, when their leg is broken, are like, can I have a cookie?\n\n01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.360\nThose are all of the progenitors of our species.\n\n01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.360\nAnyways, what's a leg in Pakistan?\n\n01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.360\nDoes it bug you when guys like, I go Pakistan?\n\n01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:44.360\nI don't want to take the leap and start going Pakistan.\n\n01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.360\nNo, no, no, it sounds weirder when you say Pakistan.\n\n01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360\nOkay, thank you.\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.360\nGod damn it.\n\n01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:54.360\nCan I, can you give me a card that says, like, because I just feel like a bag of dicks.\n\n01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:59.360\nI'm like, yeah, I know it's Pakistan at this point, but I'm like, Pakistan.\n\n01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360\nNo, it's not your fault.\n\n01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360\nAll right, thank you.\n\n01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.360\nOh, it's like when you talk to someone from Nicaragua.\n\n01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.360\nNicaragua.\n\n01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.360\nNicaragua.\n\n01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.360\nSo many hard Rs in there.\n\n01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360\nYeah.\n\n01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360\nNicaragua.\n\n01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:20.360\nSo, let's squash this beef between Germany and Pakistan.\n\n01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.360\nPlay some soccer, you guys.\n\n01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.360\nWhat do you do in Germany?\n\n01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.360\nAre you starting as well?\n\n01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.360\nYeah, I studied journalism.\n\n01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.360\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.360\nThat's why I was going to bring up when she was talking about architecture.\n\n01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:36.360\nI majored in journalism and I, like, very quickly, like my first year of journalism,\n\n01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.360\nI was like, oh, journalism sucks.\n\n01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.360\nYeah, it does.\n\n01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.360\nI didn't have a fallback, so I dropped out of college.\n\n01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360\nYou're not going to, though.\n\n01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.360\nYou're going to be a great German journalist.\n\n01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360\nI'm going to finish it.\n\n01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.360\nBut I mean, yeah, it sucks right now.\n\n01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.360\nEverybody just keeps telling me, yeah, you're not going to get any money.\n\n01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.360\nYou're not going to get a job.\n\n01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:56.360\nNo, you could be like, you could work for Buzzfeed.\n\n01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.360\nYeah, right.\n\n01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.360\nWe have that in Germany.\n\n01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:01.360\nIs your media like ours?\n\n01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.360\nDo you guys have a sensationalized?\n\n01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:04.360\nIt's not as extreme.\n\n01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.360\nI mean, it is obviously emotionalized, but it's not.\n\n01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.360\nYou guys, everyone makes fun of Fox News, but even if I look at MSNBC,\n\n01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:16.360\nI think, oh, CNN, it's like, it's still extreme.\n\n01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360\nThat's what's so crazy.\n\n01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360\nPeople are like, Fox News is bad.\n\n01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.360\nAnd then the Fox News Watchers are like, no, you don't understand CNN.\n\n01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.360\nIt's the fake news.\n\n01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.360\nIt's like, no, it's all a fucking nightmare hellscape.\n\n01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.360\nAnywhere else in the world, it's like, oh, there's news, actually.\n\n01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.360\nThere's real news.\n\n01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360\nIt's bad.\n\n01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.360\nIs there real news?\n\n01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.360\nYeah, BBC's better.\n\n01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.360\nYeah, but it's so boring.\n\n01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.360\nThat's the secret.\n\n01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.360\nIt's sort of like a super villain.\n\n01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.360\nThey're so busy pronouncing Nicaragua, right?\n\n01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.360\nI mean, where's the fucking hits?\n\n01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360\nWhat's going on over there, Nazi-wise?\n\n01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.360\nCome on, be real.\n\n01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.360\nYeah, I mean, it's coming back, right?\n\n01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.360\nYou have like cities, Dresden is fucking overrun.\n\n01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360\nIt's fucked up, man.\n\n01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.360\nThey declared a national emergency or a city emergency.\n\n01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360\nThey're like, we got skinheads, folks.\n\n01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:10.360\nYeah, I think that was another city, but we just had an election and they were second-largest for us.\n\n01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.360\nI mean, we're toast then, right?\n\n01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:21.360\nIf we can't count on you guys to be Nazi-phobic, we're fucked, right?\n\n01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:23.360\nI mean, it's all of Europe and America.\n\n01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360\nIt's the whole west side.\n\n01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:30.360\nWhy do you think as a journalist, why do you think as a planet, I have my theory,\n\n01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.360\nwhy do you think as a planet, it's just like almost unrelatedly,\n\n01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.360\nit just seems like all of these nations are just sliding right.\n\n01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:41.360\nDo you have a theory about that?\n\n01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.360\nI probably have one.\n\n01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.360\nYou would be a journalist if you were like, it's because of Christmas.\n\n01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.360\nBut I can't think of one right now.\n\n01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.360\nI think it's because of the fucking internet.\n\n01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:49.360\nI mean, that's it.\n\n01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360\nI think the internet is simulating what...\n\n01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360\nThat's certainly part of it.\n\n01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:58.360\nI think people who are just in a little bubble or maybe just one guy in a village,\n\n01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.360\nnow he is connected to another guy in another village.\n\n01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.360\nHistorically, people when they...\n\n01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.360\nNations, when they go multicultural, when their economy is destabilized,\n\n01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.360\nthere's certain cues that people start sliding right\n\n01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:17.360\nbecause they have an authoritarianistic instinct when they start to get threatened.\n\n01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.360\nThey start to have that xenophobic fear.\n\n01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360\nYou weren't finished?\n\n01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:29.360\nNo, no, I have comma, semicolon, whatever, and the rest of my thought would be,\n\n01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.360\nthe internet has made everyone feel like that's happening, but it's not happening.\n\n01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.360\nBecause people are like, oh my God, I didn't know how many Muslims there are.\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:40.360\nIt's like there aren't any Muslims where you are.\n\n01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.360\nYou just got on Facebook for the first time.\n\n01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.360\nCalm down.\n\n01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:50.360\nYeah, yeah, it's like every time the parts of the countries where these parties are active,\n\n01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:55.360\nthose numbers are the most extreme, there's none of the problems that they're running on.\n\n01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.360\nYeah, all the cities where people are stacked up on top of each other,\n\n01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.360\nyou can't stay racist of living in New York.\n\n01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.360\nIt's not really that possible.\n\n01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360\nI mean, okay, it is.\n\n01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.360\nSome people rise to that challenge, but I just think you can't really,\n\n01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.360\nyou can't hold onto these fucking crazy theories and be stacked on top of each other\n\n01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.360\nin these giant cities where people are functioning and generating all of the shit\n\n01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360\nthat keeps the lights on for the rest of the country.\n\n01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:31.360\nAnd it's like this age-old irony that then you go out to the sticks, sorry, no offense,\n\n01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.360\nwhat the fuck ever, but it's like where there's three people per square mile\n\n01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:41.360\nand those people are absolutely the most convinced that the world is ending\n\n01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:44.360\nand that race mixing is going to make everything.\n\n01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:49.360\nDude, your grandpa's birthday is the last time you saw anyone.\n\n01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:52.360\nWell, you're fine.\n\n01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.360\nI think in New York and stuff, it's the same kind of thing,\n\n01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:01.360\nbut it's just like the internet kind of lets you hold onto these crazy theories\n\n01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.360\nwithout being challenged in the same way that your face isn't rubbed into it.\n\n01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.360\nAnd that's what we didn't anticipate is that we don't want to evolve\n\n01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.360\nand we should all cop to that, I will.\n\n01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.360\nWe don't want to be wrong.\n\n01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.360\nI got a world of knowledge at my fingertips,\n\n01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.360\nbut as I've said in this practice before, I'll sit in a bar and go like,\n\n01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.360\nHudson Hawk, that was 1993.\n\n01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.360\nOh, but you $50, no one gets their phone out\n\n01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:29.360\nbecause no one wants to actually know anything.\n\n01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.360\nWe do not actually want to use the internet to become like cyber Christ.\n\n01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.360\nWe don't want to learn and evolve.\n\n01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:40.360\nWe could easily just know everything.\n\n01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.360\nI did say stuff.\n\n01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.360\nThat's a reference to this podcast.\n\n01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.360\nThere is an episode called Cyber Christ and Stubnortz,\n\n01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:53.360\nand I want to say Matt Gorely was involved.\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.360\nAll right, kids, what are you plugging?\n\n01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:04.360\nYou got a book coming out about architecture.\n\n01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.360\nI want to make it worth your while.\n\n01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.360\nI'm babbling and like, oh, God, we're almost there.\n\n01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.360\nIt's already worth my while.\n\n01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.360\nI'm good.\n\n01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.360\nI'm so flattered.\n\n01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.360\nThank you for expressing that.\n\n01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.360\nYou too.\n\n01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:23.360\nThat's why I brought up the dying dog thing.\n\n01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.360\nIt wasn't to discourage everyone.\n\n01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360\nThe show can't tell us it's hurting.\n\n01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:31.360\nIt was like...\n\n01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.360\nIt's like, yeah, okay, the show, of course,\n\n01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.360\nGod damn, could the show just be ending forever?\n\n01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.360\nWe'll launch another podcast called the Harmontowns Ending,\n\n01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.360\nand then we'll just do that forever,\n\n01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.360\nand then everyone will be on their best behavior.\n\n01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.360\nI just want to say my accent sounds really German,\n\n01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.360\nnot that I hear it.\n\n01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.360\nIt's cool, though.\n\n01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:55.360\nYou didn't know that?\n\n01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.360\nNo, I didn't.\n\n01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.360\nYou never heard you.\n\n01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.360\nI'm so glad you said that,\n\n01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.360\nbecause I was thinking that the whole time.\n\n01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.360\nDoes he know?\n\n01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.360\nYou're like, oh, my God, I sound like Dieter.\n\n01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:13.360\nWill you please say there are no more fucking Krugerons,\n\n01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.360\nMr. Johnson?\n\n01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.360\nKruger what?\n\n01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.360\nKrugerons.\n\n01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360\nKrugerons.\n\n01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360\nIt's a golden coin.\n\n01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.360\nThere's no more fucking Krugerons, Mr. Johnson?\n\n01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.360\nIt'll work.\n\n01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:30.360\nBrandon is rock hard right

India,\n\n01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.360\nand then when the British left,\n\n01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.360\nthey were like, fuck you guys, what do you want?\n\n01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:45.360\nAnd then

power?\n\n01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.360\nWhen was it, 70s, 80s?\n\n01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.360\nI think 70s.\n\n01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:27.360\nAnd like, why wasn't that a crisis?\n\n01:44:27.360 -->
