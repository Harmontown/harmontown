00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
To note that product in Hollywood, California, Carmen Town is now in session.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
Happy Easter!

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Carmen Town, Mr. Dan Frontier's apartment.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Thank you! Happy Easter!

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
What's the thing for Thanksgiving? It's about what you're thankful for.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
You tell everybody you're thankful for on Easter, is it like what you're relieved about?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
In keeping with the Christian tradition of like, whew!

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
He's up.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
It's a spring ceremony about that things are back in bloom, that Jesus is back in bloom.

01:13.000 --> 01:25.000
He's blossoming like a little flower. He's ready to pollinate with his Christ pollen.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
It's a pretty uplifting thing, isn't it?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
You're reminding me right now of a movie I don't like, and I know that people here love it, Donnie Darko.

01:35.000 --> 01:44.000
I don't like Donnie Darko, and you're reminding me of the terrible nightmare rabbit from Donnie Darko.

01:44.000 --> 01:58.000
I have ears on like that costume, so you're saying the rest of my face and body are like a blood-soaked, dirt-coated, creepy rabbit costume.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Precisely.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
So when I'm not wearing the ears, you just think I'm like a creepy, gross, furry, bloody...

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
I think you're a lazy Donnie Darko.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't think the rabbit's name is Donnie Darko.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
I don't think your hatred of the movie is valid if you don't know that.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
But check this out, look.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
What?

02:24.000 --> 02:33.000
You showing me a slightly off-center cottontail on your ass is not going to stop me from having more nightmares.

02:33.000 --> 02:44.000
But of course, you know, our audience is filled with jaded hipsters, so they already know that Easter is, of course...

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
What is a hipster, by the way? What is your definition of hipster?

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
A hipster is any person that you are projecting a bunch of your insecurities onto.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
But couldn't there also be jocks and also hippies?

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
Yeah, I don't think that there's people who present as jocks anymore in the millennium, so everyone just calls everybody a hipster that they don't like.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
Even Los Angeles, anyway. I'm sure there's archetypes in the Midwest that you could go, like, that guy's a fucking tractor.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
Look out in our audience, look out and physically make eye contact. Find what you would think of as a hipster.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, they're all hipsters.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
If there was a jaded, stand-out comic that came up here, he would call them all hipsters.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
I've been through this situation. Channel 101 kids were called hipsters at this open mic because they came to see me do stand-up instead of this other guy.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I called them all hipsters. And it was like, we're nerds, fucking hipster.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, I think we have 100% nerds, no hipsters.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
What I don't see is hipsters wearing, like, ironic, weird scarves for no reason.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Well, I mean, for instance, there's a razor-raiser fine line between nerd girl and hipster.

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
I mean, if you're a nerd girl, how do you distinguish, you know, like, if you're a guy and you see a nerdy girl?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Well, I would say there's a very definable line between nerd girl and nerd hipster.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
It depends if her glasses are actually prescription or if that's what it is.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
I mean, if she takes off the glasses, then walks into a wall, then she would, okay, gotcha, she's a nerd.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
Just take our front row, find a hipster in our front row, or admit they're all nerds.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
We got Lena Dunham here, and she's definitely a hipster. Will you stand up and wave to everybody?

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
You're the ultimate hipster. Lena Dunham, everybody.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
She's a nerd! She's a nerd?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
No, right, she's a nerd. Yes, that was very nerdy behavior. Thank you.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Where's this going? What's your idea?

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
I don't think there's hipsters here. I think we've all, we, Harmontown, we never really went to the moon,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
because we gave up on that premise a fucking good long time ago.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
But what we did do is we went to the moon of no hipsters, just nerds. Right?

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah. I mean, you're pretty drunk.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
He said nervously adjusting his bunny ears.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
I mean, it's Easter. Jeff said, are we doing a show on Easter? I said, yeah, sorry about that, and my assistant's Jewish.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
And Jeff said, well, I'll come, but I'm going to be pretty drunk.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Actually, I'm not as drunk as I would like to be. I drink a lot of rosÃ© Greek wine at Dino's, but I'm not as drunk as I wish I were.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
No. I think that's in the eye of the beholder.

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
Anyways, I think Easter is, of course, based on the absorption of the solstice.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
What does Easter mean for you? I've internalized Easter.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
It's spring. It's coming out of winter and into the time when the winter thaw and stuff.

06:00.000 --> 06:11.000
For my family, growing up as a Lutheran kid in Wisconsin, we would dye the eggs and then we would hide the actual hard-boiled eggs.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
I found out that's not as common a thing. A lot of people hide the plastic eggs filled with candy.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Makes more sense. What kid wants to find a hard-boiled egg?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I did. I was like, I can't wait to find all the eggs.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
You and I are about the same age. It was always hard-boiled eggs. There were no fake eggs filled with candy.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
You found a hard-boiled egg.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
But why? Why did you want to find them?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Because it was Easter.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
I also associate Easter with my clearest memory about Easter is, unfortunately, for my mom.

06:43.000 --> 06:51.000
I remember waking up with my brother and walking into the living room and there was this piece of typewriter paper with a sharpie-pen note written on it that said,

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
Easter has been postponed. Because somebody misbehaved the previous day, there was a big family fight or something.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
So we woke up and we were like, what the fuck does postponed mean?

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
And my brother was like, I think it means canceled. I think it means delayed. I think we're going to have an Easter later.

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
Then we had to force ourselves to go like, well, do we like Easter? Do we care if it ever arrives?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Isn't the whole point of Easter that Jesus delayed it for three days before he...

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah, a good Easter has always postponed.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Yes.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
How ironic.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Jesus can't be on time.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
That's like somebody ruining Christmas by giving birth.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
To Jesus.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
That's the only way to ruin it.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Or like if you're like, oh, Christmas is ruined because there's no room in this hotel.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
There's so much room, fuck it.

07:57.000 --> 08:06.000
Why would you stay in a barn? There's room at the hotel.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
All right, so I... let's see what we got here. I don't think a lot.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Let me know in the booth if our special guest shows up.

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
We have a guest? Also, don't tell me who it is. I don't know that.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
Dan, special secret. I'm a little drunk.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
So to go back to my thing, it's Easter, so what are you relieved about?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Why is it about relief?

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Because when the people saw Jesus come out of the cave, I'm sure they were like, whew.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
No, I don't think it's relief. I think it's a crisis.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, maybe for a few...

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
For the Romans and the Jews and everyone else. What does this mean? It's a moment of crisis.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
I don't think we celebrate Easter through the eyes of the Romans.

08:57.000 --> 09:06.000
No, we celebrate against the backdrop of the Romans. The idea that we help the guy get killed,

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
and that he's now... where the fuck is he?

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
We have to take on the word of a few people that he's risen.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
He actually rose from the dead. Relief is not what's happening then.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
It's like, what the fuck is happening right now?

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
For the followers of Jesus, I don't think they felt relief.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
They were like, whew, shit!

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, what is that?

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
They killed our friend, now he's gone, now he's alive.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So surprised? Pleasant surprise?

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
I don't think they said, oh, what a pleasure.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
So on Easter, you should ask yourself, what are you pleasantly surprised by?

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm pleasantly surprised by you wearing bunny ears.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
Also, I'm pleasantly surprised by the fact that this is a holiday that absolutely means nothing,

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
including people that believe in the New Testament, the Old Testament, and any Testament.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
It's really... it's simply a spring ritual. That's all it is.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Well, isn't that kind of uplifting that even the Holy Roman Empire, with all of its power, had to...

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
They're like, you know what, we can rule by force with a lot of ways,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
but we can't keep these people on these equinoxes, these solstices.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
We can't keep them from knowing that the eggs are important.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
And so we've got to move Jesus's various thresholds.

10:43.000 --> 10:52.000
The Empire, I think about like 300 or 400 years before Caesar ruined the Republic.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
The Gauls, which is basically France, a bunch of barbarians they called him,

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
came in and took over and kicked a bunch of ass in Italy and went right to the gates of Rome.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
The geese flew off in the sky.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
And Romans worshipped the geese for hundreds of years after that,

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
because the geese went honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, and warned Rome that the fucking Gauls were at the gates.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
And they hated dogs because the dogs didn't bark.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
So for a couple hundred years, for a couple hundred years, then there was a ritual.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
There was a ritual in Rome while Caesar was in Gaul and fucking Pompey and Caesar

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
and a lot of fucking mate, like Cato and Cicero and people we know were there.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
Because Cato?

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
C-A-T-O, not Cato Kalem.

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
There was a ritual held where dogs were murdered in the streets of Rome

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
and geese got to sit on golden pillows and watch it happen.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
So that's the backdrop of where Easter fucking happens,

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
because it was only about fucking 50 years later that Jesus was killed or was around and was dead.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Isn't it crazy that it wasn't too long ago when animals were like competitors to us?

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
We were still kind of like on the same pop chart with them.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
We were living in cities, but there was still, like in the back of our heads,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
there was like a threat that maybe we'd be living in Beartown one day.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
They never make the wall a little higher.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
These fucking bears are looking their eye.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Rome was Wolftown, so it's two wolves the fucking fan of the goddamn thing, right?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, and Athens was just like a rocky crevice.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
People crawled up into some holes to get away from all the animals.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Then they built the Acropolis on that.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
The whole foundation of Western civilization is just based on us being scared of animals

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
and wondering why they're so much smarter than us.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Why do they always know what to do?

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
God damn it, every time we try to hunt something, the dogs get there first.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
It's a really uplifting story that we ended up having them as pets and stuff.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
It's sad that we at one point were so ticked off at them

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
and kind of still insecure that we had to slaughter them and stuff.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It's a little sad.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Alright, so anyways, can we do a new segment called,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
My Wife Bullies Me?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Yes, we can.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
When you get married, it's time to get picked on by your wife

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
for the rest of your life.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
She can make fun of you,

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
because it would be hard for you to just get up and leave.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
So all your shit is there,

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
and you promised in front of God and her dad that you'd stay.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So that was Easter.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
Erin was coordinating things with Hoppy Town, our Easter mascot, Hoppy Town.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
You guys met up front.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
She came down to visit me,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
and I was having a nice Easter with the Easter basket she made for me

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
with all kinds of Reese's products in it.

14:31.000 --> 14:40.000
I had put on a selection of music in a really roundabout way.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
We call them chain zingers.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
A chain zinger is like,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
if somebody is taking your french fries off of your plate while you're eating,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
instead of just saying, hey, you're taking all my fries,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
you go, so where are you going to deposit it?

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
And then the other person goes, deposit what?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You go, oh, your money.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Don't you have a bunch of extra money now?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
And they go, what do you mean?

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
And they go, well, because you're getting so rich now, aren't you?

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Because you're saving so much money on blood pressure medication?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
No, what are you talking about?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Well, don't you have really low blood pressure?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
No, I don't think so.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
Well, then how come your sodium intake just seems to be so high?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
What are you talking about?

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
You're eating my fucking fries!

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
That's a chain zinger.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
So she came down and did a chain zinger.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm not going to try to recreate it.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I want to hear more chain zingers.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
They're not easy, and they've become a thing unto themselves.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Just try it with your loved ones home.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
So the person zinging you is doing a chain zinger?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
They start eight steps back, and they make you go,

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
what do you mean, like eight times, and then they insult you.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
So she did one of those, and I'm not going to bother to recreate her chain zinger,

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
I wish you would.

16:09.000 --> 16:15.000
Because of the music I was listening to, she called me a gay drug dealer.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Wait, is that how she opened up the chain zinger?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Or is that the payoff of the chain zinger?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
No, that's not how she opened up the chain zinger.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I'm still confused about what a chain zinger is.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Well, I shouldn't have distracted you with that,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
but I didn't want to undersell her bullying of me.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
It's very sophisticated.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I also don't remember what her chains are.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Her chains are a little sloppy.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I don't want to try to recreate their lame half the time.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Do you chain zing her?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, I do.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
So what would be you chain zinging, Aaron?

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
You know, I don't know. They're hard. They're hard to do.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
All right, well, you're asking us to buy a premise that I don't quite understand, right?

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm asking you to buy a cup of coffee.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
So my wife...

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
This episode can't be called chain zinger

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
until you tell me what a fucking chain zinger really is.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
What's the meat and potatoes of a chain zinger?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
All right, all right, Jeff.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Jeff, are they...

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Try and chain zing me on what I'm doing right now.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Okay. Jeff, are they removable?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
What?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
The tattoos.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Which tattoos are you talking about?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
The ones that you get in prison.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The ones I got in prison?

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah, didn't you go to prison?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I've never been to prison.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
But what happened after you hit that tree?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Which tree?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
The one that you hit in your car.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I didn't hit a tree.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Aren't you an alcoholic?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
No.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Wait, this tree...

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
I tried to back into...

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I don't want to do a chain zinger on command.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
They're hard. They're hard.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
That's if I wanted to know what a fucking chain zinger is.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I just tried one. It was bad, but I did one.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Give me a fucking historical chain zinger.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
No, I don't keep track of them.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
But you're grinding an axe about chain zinging.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
All right, all right, all right.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
We're not leaving this room until I fucking know what a chain zinger is.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
All right.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
Is it hard for you to...

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Do your eyes hurt? Do your eyes hurt?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Currently?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
No.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Okay, but doesn't all the flash photography hurt your eyes?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
When does lots of flash photography?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
When you do a red carpet.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh, yeah, I mean, you asked me could it...

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
It's a possible word. There's lots of flash photography.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
You were in that movie recently.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Right. That movie called...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Well, Lawnmower Man 3.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, right.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Because aren't you Job?

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Don't you have control over time and space?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
No, I was just an actor.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Well, you're putting me on the spot.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
I kind of cheated with that one.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Am I cheating? I mean, not accomplishing your goal.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
A broken chain zinger.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I want a chain zinger.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
I mean, these are examples of chain zingers.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
They're not good ones.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
You mean that somebody's trying to mush it to you over the long term.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
They're trying to get you...

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
They set you up.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
They force you through a series of hoops.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah, you just make someone walk with you to the place where you slap them.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Why was I in Lawnmower Man 3?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Because you were putting me on the spot.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
If we call this fucking episode a chain zinger, I'll fucking kill everybody in this room.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
We only get to call this episode a chain zinger if Dan does a chain zinger

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
and the audience knows what the hell he's talking about.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Yes!

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Okay, somebody came up on the stage and chained zinged Dan

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
and proved to me what he's talking about.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Precisely. Nobody fucking knows.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
They're hard. They're hard.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I understand the premise.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
I just want to hear a story about being properly chain zinged.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Let's do it. Do you have a chain zinger?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Is that what you said? Let's do it?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, let him do it first.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Come up and chain zing.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
What's your name?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Ben.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Hello, Ben.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Sorry.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
We met two days ago.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Good to meet you.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Alright.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Are you going to improv a chain zing?

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Do you have a current existing beef that you're going to zing Dan on and chain in fashion?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
No, it's half and half.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Okay.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
Hey, Ben, can I ask you, do you...

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
There comes a bad chain zinger.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Do you find it difficult to move?

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Aren't you part robot?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
No.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Don't you have a speaker for a mouth?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Because you're not talking on the microphone.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Okay.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Sorry.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
I see that as a chain zinger, but I don't see that as a zinger.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Alright.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I see the chain...

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Okay.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Here's the chain zinger.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Hey, Dan.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
Yes, Ben?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Did all those doves die?

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
What doves? What are you talking about, Ben?

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Did all those doves die when you and Aaron threw all that rice?

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
What rice did we throw? I don't get it. What do you mean?

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
At your guy's most recent wedding.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, we got married.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
I mean, when you and Aaron got married to doing chain zingers.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
No, no, don't fucking...

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
That's not... That doesn't fucking scan. It doesn't scan at all.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
They're not easy to do.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
I know. Give me one version where it works.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
No, because they're hard.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Then why bring it up?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Why bring up skateboarding? Skateboarding's hard.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
If Tony Hawk came on stage, you could skateboard.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Wait, but...

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
What's a chain zinger?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
We just made it up. Someone had to put wheels on a board

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
before Tony Hawk could ever be good at something.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
We're sending these people out into the world.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
That person didn't think he was zinging somebody. He thought he was an engineer.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Jeff, Jeff, can I ask you a question?

23:11.000 --> 23:18.000
Only on one condition, Dan. This is a fucking chain zinger.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
You can ask me multiple questions. You can ask me as many questions as you want.

23:22.000 --> 23:34.000
Does it get lonely being so old?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
How old?

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Aren't you as old as the universe, almost?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
You're younger than you are.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
But you're not hydrogen?

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
No, I'm not hydrogen.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm a mixture of different atoms.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
Mostly water, right?

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
I believe a certain high percentage of what makes up a human body is water.

24:06.000 --> 24:15.000
That would explain your slight negative charge.

24:15.000 --> 24:30.000
It doesn't work. It doesn't fucking work.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Wait, water is negatively charged?

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
It has a slight negative charge. It's responsible for all life on the earth.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
It's responsible for the capillary motion of water.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Chain zinging. I didn't know I'd get it.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
I'm going to sit down.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Okay, thank you, Ben.

24:46.000 --> 24:53.000
Ben, get the fuck out of here.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
Anyways, my wife told me I had the musical taste of a gay drug dealer was the point.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
See, that's just a zing. Why bring the chain into it?

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
I made a huge mistake when I did that. Believe me.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Why walk me down a primrose path?

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
I felt like Erin would yell at me later if I characterized her as just coming down

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
and saying, you sound like a gay drug dealer listening to this music

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
because the truth is she was more creative about it.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
So I wanted to acknowledge that out of fairness,

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
but you got very distracted, like a Jack Russell terrier staring at a socket

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
that you think a bug went into.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Like an English bulldog got distracted.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Okay.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
Why does a witticism have to make me go through a bunch of fucking weird hoops?

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
Nothing has to do anything. You're reverse hitlering.

25:48.000 --> 25:57.000
No, I'm hitlering. Reverse hitlering is a chain zinger.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
What were you listening to?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
What?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
She called you that.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
LCD sound system.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
Alright, now I'm on her side.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Which she probably introduced me to.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
I was listening to a Pandora station based on LCD sound system.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
So there was, at the time, I guess,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
wait, you know what? That's a compliment gay drug dealer for music.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I mean, like, what are those guys?

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
It's not like you get into your gay drug dealers car and Willie Nelson's on the radio.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Oh, Willie Nelson's great.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
If I have to hear a stranger's music, I hope it's a gay drug dealer.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
That'll be good music.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
That's that in clothes too, right?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Like, you'd want to dress like a gay drug dealer too, I assume.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
If you want to be like, oh, caron.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Alright.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I mean, they're gay and they deal drugs.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
They're on the bleeding edge of society.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
The bleeding edge?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah, the bloody, bloody edge.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
You, you, okay.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
Dan, you get to ask me as many questions in a row as you want.

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
Were you like, were you really hurt?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Were your feelings hurt?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Just, just recently?

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah, well, specifically when Bruce Wayne hurt them.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
What are you talking about?

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
Well, when he came to your, your research facility at Wayne Industries

27:25.000 --> 27:31.000
and he rejected your inventions.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Dan, can I, can I be honest with you?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
Maybe in the history of my whole life.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
I don't think it's ever been a time when I have been more hurt

27:45.000 --> 27:54.000
when, while I was making Wayne Industries inventions

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
when Bruce Wayne himself came in and he wasn't fucking digging it.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
So, so you...

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I was fucking mortified.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
I was almost suicidally hurt when he came in and said, boo,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I don't dig it, I don't like it.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
And that's when you became the Riddler, right?

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Oh shit, you're right.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I never put those two together.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
I, I knew that, I knew that one day I started becoming a super villain

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
and asked questions instead of giving answers.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
You, that's why you're always questioning me.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Right?

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
You ruined my chainzinger.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Dan, here's a riddle for you.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Riddle me this, is it hard to ruin a chainzinger?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Well, no, it's not.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You could, you could, it's not hard.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
All you have to do is to...

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It's not a magic trick.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
If you do jumping jacks during it, you can ruin it.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
If you interrupt it, you can ruin it.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
So, I'm not allowed to really love chainzingers as a premise or a concept.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
What do you mean, love them?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
You're not allowed to, you're not allowed to ruin them.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Do you love chainzingers?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I mean, you're allowed to do whatever you want.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Do you love chainzingers?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I love chainzingers.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
You, my friend, have been chainzing'd.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
No, you haven't, it doesn't exist, it's not a thing.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
All right, well, let's bring out...

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
No, no one comes out, we're going to fucking finish this.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Come on, you're going to want this guy to come out.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
Who?

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
He's an old friend, we haven't seen him for a couple weeks.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Curtis Armstrong's back.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Oh, no, shit!

29:32.000 --> 29:49.000
Curtis Armstrong!

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Howdy!

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Hello, Curtis.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Howdy!

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
My god, it's so festive here.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah, happy Easter.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Thank you so much.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I wasn't even going to celebrate.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
And now, I feel like I have to.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah, so...

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Were you raised religiously?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I was raised religious...

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I was raised Catholic, yeah.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Oh, okay, so Easter's a pretty heavy duty to get up for the Sunrise Mass.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
It was a big deal.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
The whole deal.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
The whole deal.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
So would you...

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
My wife couldn't remember, because she was the daughter of a pastor it was.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
She still is, but...

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
She mentioned the Sunrise Mass thing.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
But then also all the Easter hiding and stuff like that.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
She couldn't remember what order they did them in.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Oh, well, I mean, you know, I mean, if you're...

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I mean, we did everything, because we were just, you know...

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
I mean, we were Catholic and we did the whole services and all that.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
But the Easter eggs were just as big a part of it.

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
But there are a lot of people that I know who were raised where that's like devil's work is doing the Easter egg hunt.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Because it has nothing to do with...

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Oh, well, that's kind of admirable.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I mean, from the Christian perspective.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I mean, you know what?

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
If you go for the religious part of it, you might as well go the whole way and say that Easter eggs are...

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I get aggravated by those things.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
Technically, of course, it all comes from the Pagans anyway.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Right.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
Like the right-wing people who talk about the war on Christmas because we want to make it politically correct.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Exactly.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
But they won't give up their Santa Claus.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
They really need their Christmas tradition, but their Christmas tradition is based on a bunch of different shit.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Exactly.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
They think they're living in their little 20-year period.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Nothing's allowed to change during that time.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Exactly.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It's like a big chain-zinger.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
I missed the chain-zinger part.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
I came in at the very end of the chain-zinger part.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Is there anything I need to know?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Nothing at all.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Okay.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
All right.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Yeah.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
I mean, you know, it's weird.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
You're so mad about chain-zingers.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
He said Mr. Kettle to Admiral Pott.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
You're mad about chain-zingers.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm overjoyed with them.

32:02.000 --> 32:09.000
Jeff's in his cups, as Chevy Chase used to say about himself on his voicemails.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I think I'm delightfully Easter drunk.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
I think, yes, there's no negative things.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'm just warning Curtis that you're like a loaded gun.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's a little different.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
He looks a little different this week.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
He does.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
He has a glow or a sheen.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
It's a sheen.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
It's a sheen.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
It's a sheen.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
It's definitely a sheen.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
It's an airy sort of sheen.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
That sort of disabye, as our friends the French would say.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I don't know that word.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
You know, a little ruffled, a little bit, you know, just got out of bed.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Look.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I put this together, Curtis.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
This represents a lot of work.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm sorry.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I thought it was an accident.

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
No, I'm fucking high as a Georgia pine right now.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Those are high.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Georgia pines are high.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Oh, yeah.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Dan, can I ask you a question?

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Yeah.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I would try to fucking chain-thing you.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
I don't know how to do it still.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Well, yeah, they're hard.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
They're not easy.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
We wouldn't do a podcast about breathing, like everyone knows how to do that.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
You do a podcast about macrame.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
That's hard.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
I'm not leaving this building until you've done a successful chain-thinger.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I would have to sit here in silence, like thinking.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
Like it's not, you know, it's not, it's not, it wouldn't be a cool thing to do.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
And the payoff wouldn't be that great.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
Like just to chain-thingers are, you got to let, just forget about them.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I want you to forget about them.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
There's no, there's no joy to come from, from you knowing about them.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I want you to turn away.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Deal.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
All right.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
Well, it could also be sort of a long-running thing, couldn't it?

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
I mean, you know, technically he could think about it in like in two weeks.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
It could come up and then it's like a callback to the chain-thingers.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
He could, he could do like a, like a macro chain.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
Let me see what's on my little, my little notepad.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
What do you have scheduled?

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Okay.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Let's see.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Gay drug dealer.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Last Nights with Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
You guys see that?

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
It's like Game of Thrones fan fiction kind of movie.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
It's Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen running around.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
No.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Swords.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
No.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
That's fine.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
It's called Last Nights, which sounds like, it's like, you know, date movie or something,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
but it's a-

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Curtis.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Sir.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
You were away for a while.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Where did you go?

34:36.000 --> 34:45.000
I went to, I went to Las Vegas and I went to Seattle, Washington.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
Were you there?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
You followed me back, didn't you?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Yeah.

34:53.000 --> 35:00.000
We went to, I went to a Comic Con in Seattle and I went to a supernatural thing in Las Vegas.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Awesome.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
What was the supernatural thing?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
They do these supernatural things.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I know supernatural is a show I do.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It's one of the other shows I do.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Wait, I don't know.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
It's one I do when I'm not here.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I do another show called Supernatural.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I've heard of that show.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
I didn't know you were on it.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
You're on it as an actor?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
I've been on it as an actor for about three years.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Are you a-

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
On and off.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Are you a werewolf or a vampire?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
I'm not.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
I am the evilest creature ever.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
I'm an evil, evil, evil creature.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Go Mettitron!

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Yes!

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
He knows-

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
What's the-

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
It's Mettitron.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
He's a biblical character, actually.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
I'm playing a biblical-

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
It's actually appropriate.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
It's Easter.

35:40.000 --> 35:49.000
And I play a biblical character named Mettitron, who is or was the scribe of God.

35:49.000 --> 35:56.000
Mettitron, for those of you who don't know, Mettitron was the one who wrote out the Ten Commandments.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Whoa.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Uh-huh.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Uh-huh.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Wait, so there was another guy?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
There was another guy.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
I mean, basically on the movies, I always thought there was a fire that came from the bush into the tablet.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
No.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
His voice was the voice from the burning bush.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That was Mettitron, not God.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Oh, this is like a-

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Mettitron was the guy who did everything for God.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
He did everything that God-

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
This is according to what mythology?

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
According to, well, questionable mythology.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
But he does exist, historically.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Is that in the Bible?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Is Mettitron's name mentioned?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Yeah, it's kind of the Bible.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Is Mettitron's name mentioned in the Bible?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
The Bible?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
No, not in the- I don't think it is.

36:38.000 --> 36:46.000
I think it's actually mentioned in, like, ancient Hebrew texts that are sort of questionable.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
But that's who he is.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
But everybody assumes-

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
So God didn't give us straight to Moses.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
It went through Mettitron?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
It went through Mettitron.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
And you play Mettitron?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Thank you.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Yes, I do.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
It's the role you were born to play?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
It is the role I was born to play.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
It's one of the most important roles of my career.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Huh.

37:05.000 --> 37:10.000
I mean, you know, if you think about it in terms of, you know, there's, you know, like,

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
there's Booger and there's Charles DeMar and then there's the scribe of God.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Right, right, right.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
You know?

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
In terms of function, yeah, yeah.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
You're assisting John Kuzak and then you're going to assist him.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
And then you're going to God.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Yeah.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
I mean, that's a big deal.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
So that's who he is.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
And God would, he would transcribe what God wanted said to the Israelites and he would

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
write it down or speak it.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Well, that's what I do.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Why is that?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
That's not who he is.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Why is that not canonical in the Bible?

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
I mean, all the cool stuff is sort of questionable.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
It's the, what do you call it?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
It's the apocrypha.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
That's what it's called, the apocrypha, which is it's supposedly part of it, but it was

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
sort of taken out by people because it was considered a little funny.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Apocryphal.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Yeah.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
The apocrypha.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Is that right?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Yeah.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Thank you.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
See, they all know.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yeah.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
But that was not who Metatron was.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
My Metatron, the Metatron I play is the scribe of God.

38:07.000 --> 38:16.000
Because Metatron hated Optimus Prime, right?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
That was in my bio.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
The bio I wrote for Metatron.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
That's a callback.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
I forgot to bring this up last week, and I don't know what to do about it yet, but I

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
did want to remind myself to bring it up.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Books for prisoners.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
All right.

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
So I saw these guys tweeting about it.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
It was out of Seattle, actually.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
The organization is out of Seattle.

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
So did you say hi to them?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Now I can't remember their Twitter handle or whatever, but I got to figure out how to

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
coordinate something with them because they tweeted at me because what they do is they

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
try to get books to prisoners, which is already a very worthwhile goal.

38:58.000 --> 39:04.000
I mean, as fucked up as our prison system is, as you know, we have the largest prison

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
population in the world, and we definitely do not rehabilitate them very much.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
We could definitely do to do that.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
And the idea that there's a shortage of books that these people are inside prison, that

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
they're asking for books while they're in there, they should be flooded with them.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Because books cost nothing because of the internet.

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
And also, I think these guys, if they're sitting there going, hey, sorry, I murdered that person.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
I would like to start reading while I'm in here.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
They shouldn't be empty-handed.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I don't know how much we can do about that.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
It does seem like a really focused, worthwhile cause in general.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
I'll put some elbow grease into it and try to help.

39:46.000 --> 39:53.000
But I wanted to mention it to our viewers and listeners because they specifically tweeted

39:53.000 --> 40:02.000
at me about D&D books because a certain percentage of their prisoners that seek them out are asking

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
for D&D books.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And they can't get ahold of those either.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
I mean, and it's like, my God, not only are they asking for books, they're asking for

40:11.000 --> 40:17.000
books that would open them up to creativity, to the assembly of their own mythology, to

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
making shit right in a way that doesn't involve stabbing real people and stuff.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
You're talking about state and federal prisons?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
People are looking for books?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Yeah, I don't know all the details about it.

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
I just know this charity is in Seattle and I know that they just have this mass shortage

40:36.000 --> 40:43.000
of old D&D books, which it seems like this audience would have a surplus of.

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
It seems like if we found out there's a charity out there, people that don't have enough McDonald's

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
wrappers.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
I'm not saying we're fat, I just mean, for us it's kind of like, we got a lot of old D&D

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
books, I think.

40:59.000 --> 41:05.000
So I don't know if we can have a drive or something like that at some point and like

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
ship them like crates.

41:06.000 --> 41:14.000
Can we ship one prison, not trying to be silly, can we pick one prison where we send all of

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
those books to and the whole prison just starts playing D&D?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
It's like adopt a prison.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
It would be like the signs on the freeway.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
We have to go out and find who the dungeon master of that prison would be and that prison

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
starts getting really into fucking Pathfinder or D&D.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
It would be amazing to adopt a prison of one podcast, adopt one prison, it just starts

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
fucking around.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
Kind of like, okay, now we're going to change wardens this week.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
And we just have our favorite prisoners come on the thing, like their whole prison system

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
becomes corrupted because it's based on podcast listenership and stuff.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
Dan, Curtis, you don't know this, but very early on a long time ago, Dan and I, I think

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
it was before we started recording this, we said, Dan said, let's get together, let's

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
use Harmontown to find a dungeon master.

42:12.000 --> 42:21.000
Every week we'll use it like, like, what was, like, the fucking, so drunk.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
The show is like the voice or whatever.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
We'll use our show to find the best dungeon master.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
The first week we found our friend Spencer.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Right.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Who I know.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
And then we never looked any further beyond that.

42:36.000 --> 42:43.000
Why don't we find a prison and give them all of our D&D books and then turn one prison

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
into a giant D&D campaign?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Is it possible?

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Yes, I don't know.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I think we'll start with...

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
Could we get, like, could we get one prison to be really into storytelling and into fantasy

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
and maybe save the world and bring them on the show?

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
Or we do a Harmontown, we do a Harmontown from that prison, like Johnny Cash?

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Yeah.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
I want to do, each week we have, like, a guest, an inmate from the prison who's, like, a year

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
from parole and they're, like, they're eligible for early parole.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
And we kind of, like, we give them a thumbs up, thumbs down.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
A trustee.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Yeah.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
We get a trustee.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Yeah.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
That's fantastic.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
I love this idea.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Like, we picked their brain about what they did to go in.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And then we're like, what do you think, guys?

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
You sound sorry to me.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And then we just let them go.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
I was like, guess what?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
You're not going home.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Here's a tie instead of a handcuffs.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
I would love to go to an actual prison and actually do a D&D campaign there and play

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
with them there, like, come what may.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
And maybe that positively would affect their parole hearing.

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
Like, the guy was so good at committing to his elf character.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Yeah.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I mean, I imagine if you, yeah.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
I'm sure if your average parole board overheard a game of Dungeons & Dragons, they'd be very

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
impressed and want you out in the public immediately.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
Speaking of, let's bring Spencer out.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Spencer?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Yay!

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
Spencer Crittenden and everybody.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Sorry, everybody.

44:22.000 --> 44:34.000
That took me a while.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
Did I miss a high five opportunity there?

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
It's easy because you're going that way and I'm over here.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Yeah.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Spencer, your high fives are built in.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Oh, okay.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Yeah, good to know.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
Well, it's just because you had a pen in your hand.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
Are those flowers blocking anyone from seeing your beautiful face?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Doug's fine.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
I think we should strike those as they say in the theater.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Perfect.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
No, I can't see Spencer.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
All right.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Yeah, just put them down there.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Put them in front of Dan.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
What's up, you guys?

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
Spencer, could you picture yourself going to like San Quentin or Falsum Prison, like

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
Johnny Cash, and doing a giant game mastering session?

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Back there, I was just imagining, you know, walking into like just the big prison and

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
then there's like a prison, Spencer, who's like, you know, he has his lair or whatever,

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
he has it all figured out and he's like, he'd be the dungeon master of the prison and,

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
you know, we'd meet up and we'd have a whole day of it and we'd learn we were really alike

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
and, you know, maybe we'd even like trade places and he'd go to my house and my job

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
and stuff and kill animals and, you know.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Because that's what you do.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
No, because he's a prisoner.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Oh.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
And all prisoners and murder animals.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
What would you do in his place in a federal prison?

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
I'd frolic.

46:01.000 --> 46:06.000
No, I don't know, it'd probably be much less entertaining for me, I'd imagine.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
Oh, it's books to prisoners at B number two P Seattle.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
B two P Seattle is their Twitter handle.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
B two P.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
Oh, I'm going to continue to, they were sending me information.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
They have these letters that they tend to get.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
They sent me a picture of one of them.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
I don't think I can read that because of all the swastikas.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Just kidding.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Prison humor.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
Whatever they had to do in there to survive, that's what you had to do.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Now I'm going to turn my back on you.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah, no.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
I don't know if that would really be, that would probably be really offensive to people whose charity is like,

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
they put all this work into like furnishing these people and then you just like kind of do this swastika joke.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
It's just like every prisoner movie you see, if you're a white guy in prison, you have to be a Nazi.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
Do you think Dan, like in the Harmon tour, the thing that we did a couple years ago,

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
we went around the country and proved that Harmontown audiences are,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
they resemble each other.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
They're a lot like you guys here.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
Do you think that we could go do a show in a prison and people would dig it?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
I don't know.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
I kind of like, I kind of wake up called because I'm trying to use Lyft instead of Uber now,

47:13.000 --> 47:20.000
just because I feel like the, I just, I haven't met a woman in Los Angeles that doesn't have a story that starts with,

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
I call it an Uber.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
If they're writing by themselves, it's just, it's not a hand and I feel like, like Uber is not that bad for me,

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
but it just feels like, now I feel dirty, like taking, taking Uber.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
So I took, took a lift and it made me feel better because like, I don't know, the guy was like,

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
definitely probably would have treated my wife with respect if he picked her up.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
But then again, he had his own podcast and was just talking about that.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
And I was like, take me back to the, take me back to the Uber.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
I told Lyft, I told him,

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
I talked to Mr. Lyft, I told him, you need to put a switch or if you flip the switch,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
the driver doesn't fucking talk to you.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
It'd be so easy.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I think that's called getting in the backseat maybe.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
No, well, that's what they, they, they, that's a new thing.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
They didn't use to have that.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
They just always, you'd sit in the front and then you'd talk.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
And then so many people were like, I don't want to do this, that they, they invented this backseat.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
You could program a switch.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
It'd be so easy.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Everyone, it'd be done.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
That's a, that's a good idea.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
Like a little switch, like I'm not, I'm not feeling in the mood for conversation.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
What kind of pressure would that put them in the, if, if, if you were like, then you're

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
deliberately not hitting that switch.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
And then they're like, now I gotta talk to this fucker.

48:27.000 --> 48:33.000
Um, then it's like those, those, those barber conversations where like 10 minutes into the

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
haircut, they're like, so how's your day?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
They, they, they hate you.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
This is astonishing.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
I just took a Lyft just last week and it was the same guy.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
He, I swear to God.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
With the podcast?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
No way to the airport.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
He interviewed me.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And I mean, it was, it was one of those.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
It wasn't this guy.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
It wasn't, I got a business card.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
No, no, no.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
He told me to give this to you and I'm not kidding.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
No, it's all right.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I probably know it's a good podcast, but.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
Yeah.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Yeah.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
No, this was exactly the same thing.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
I think it's, it's, you know, and this, you know, the questions went, you know, from,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
you know, subject to subject.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
And the fewer ants words I responded, the more he would ask questions.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
So it was not like he was getting the fact that I didn't want to talk.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
It was like a cue to ask more questions.

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
Well, they tell, like they hire the drivers based on conversational skills and they do

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
expect them to talk to you consistently the whole right.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
It's, it's part of what like they're, you know, their business.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
That's not true really.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Is it?

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
No, it is.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
One of their selling points is they have these conversationalist drivers.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
Yeah.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
That's, that's part of their marketing.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
I thought I was just, I was just lucky that I got one just like yours.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
They're quite pleasant.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
How do you think they vet for that?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Do you think they take them on test drives?

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
Well, they do a lot more work than Uber does to vet their employees.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
I'll tell you that.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Sure seems that way.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Yeah.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Cause they do.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
They make sure that they're people that are like social and can sit and talk and not

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
make people feel weird, I think.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
So the reason I brought that up is because Jeff asked, do we think we could do a show

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
for a prison?

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
And I was like, I think, I think yesterday I would have been like, yeah, man.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
Cause I'm like egalitarian, like, like awesomeness.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
But my lift ride over here, I was like, eh, you know what?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I don't like most people.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Even the ones that like me, even the ones that have podcasts, even the ones I just,

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
I don't like you.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
I don't like you.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
You're laughing too much at the hustler billboard.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
I judge you.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
I don't, I hate you.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I don't, the guy was like, he saw the hustler billboard.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And it had, I think like a joke on it.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
It's like a cucumber.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
And it said stop, stop violence against vegetables, shop at hustler.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
And the guy, this is, I'm not exaggerating.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
This is, this is, this is, this was the guy's response.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
He's like driving.

50:55.000 --> 51:01.000
And he was like, oh, oh, oh, shit.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
Oh, fuck that billboard.

51:05.000 --> 51:12.000
Oh, stop violence against, he read it to me.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
And I was like, let's shop at a, oh, shit.

51:15.000 --> 51:25.000
Oh, oh, like, I was like, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
I tried trying to like scrape my laugh gland.

51:29.000 --> 51:35.000
I get it.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Stick something else in your pussy.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
I get it.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Don't, don't put a cucumber in your pussy.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
I got it.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Cucumber wants you to use something else.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Maybe a dildo from hustler.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Got it.

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
I just got that.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Me too.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Me too.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
You have been changing.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
I hadn't gotten that.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
We should bring up my wife.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
Erin McGathy.

52:12.000 --> 52:21.000
Oh, it's Hoppy Town.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Oh, Hoppy Town.

52:23.000 --> 52:35.000
It was me the whole time.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
So we, oh, sorry, go ahead.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Jeff, do you get nervous?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Do you get nervous when you walk across grass?

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
Am I about to be changing?

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Just do you get nervous walking across grass?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Generally no.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
I like walking across grass.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
You're not worried you're going to disappear?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Just walking across fields?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Yeah, because the color, I would think that you'd be afraid

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
that you would just disappear in the grass.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
Because of walking on green grass.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
Let me ask you something else.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
Do you have any new news from your cardiologist?

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
I've never seen a cardiologist.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
I mean, you should because I heard it's really small.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
No, your heart.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Aren't you a grinch who hates all joyful things,

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
including chain-singers?

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
It's 9-Eleven.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's 9-Eleven.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
9-Eleven!

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
That's the response we want to cultivate.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
It's 9-Eleven.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Is that the chain-sing?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Because I hear the thing.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Now it's 9-12.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
It's not a zing.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Why is that a zing?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I see the chain part of that.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It's a jovial thing.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
Earlier, Dan was listening to the band Sleigh Bells remixed.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Sleigh Bells is a band I like.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
And the song I even liked.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
And I do not hate gay drug dealers at all.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
But it's a jovial thing.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
It's a fun thing.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
So walking across grass means I hate all jovial things?

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
No, because the grinch is green!

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
That doesn't fucking scan.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
It's not a fucking thing.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Maybe it's not for you.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
It's not a chain-singer at the end.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
You go, kaboom!

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
Also, I feel like a zinger should actually just zing on the first fucking try.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
It doesn't need to be a chain.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
But well, it's our thing.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
It's so fun.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
I want to hear actual proof of it.

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
Okay, you guys keep chain-singing each other and leave me the fuck out of it.

54:38.000 --> 54:43.000
I feel like gay drug dealers would be most dangerous.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
I know, of course they are.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
They have the efficiency of that whole gay aesthetic way of life.

54:49.000 --> 54:56.000
And they're applying that to a very dangerous profession where image is very important.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
And thinking or saying the wrong thing could mean death.

54:59.000 --> 55:06.000
Yeah, I think you're doubling down on your environmental risk groups, too, for sociopathology.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
There's a kid from the Midwest who came out and his parents didn't accept him.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
If that's why he started drug dealing or whatever makes you a drug dealer or whatever.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
It could be the nicest kid in the world, but also, if you got stabbed by a gay drug dealer,

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
on the eighth stab you'd be like, well, I guess.

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
I don't know if he was more likely to stab me than a straight drug dealer or a regular gay man.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
But I know I shouldn't have gotten in this car.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
With Campbell.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
I was driven by an Uber driver once who told me that he was narcoleptic.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
And that he can't walk up stairs without falling down the stairs.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
And I still don't understand what he meant, but he's like, oh, you know stairs, I can't have.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
He said, your house, your house, so many stairs.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
I can't have that.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
Yeah, and you kept telling him to go to a doctor and he was like, no, no, no, no, no.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
No, no, no, this is my quirk, this is my quirk.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
It's not as bad.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Curtis, do you like music?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Do I like music?

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Music, I love music.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Don't fuck.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
You're about to be changing, motherfucker.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Watch out.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
I'm open to it, actually.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Here's my problem with changing.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
It's because just seeing somebody, just say it in fucking one go.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Why walk me down the road?

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Curtis, do people ever get frustrated by the noise?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Of my music?

56:33.000 --> 56:39.000
No, just the noise of your body when you enter a room.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Is it going to pay off so big?

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Is it going to be a fucking pay off?

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Sometimes.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Great showmanship, Jeff.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Your rapper.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Your rapper.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
You fucking show me how this is showmanship, what you're about to do, the fucking...

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Jeff?

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Yes.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
I'm talking to her.

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
Tina, Curtis, what you just did is a singer and that actually works done one fucking pass.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
That's what makes this a chain singer.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
But I mean by your rapper.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
By my rapper.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
I mean, because you're so sweet, you must be made out of candy.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
A chain snuggle.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
Not a singer and just took long to say something nice.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
That was great.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
Just say you're sweet.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
Wait, what's Jeff's problem with chain singers?

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
It's fucking stupid.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
It's fucking worthless and stupid.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
It's really dumb.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Why though?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Are you about to chain sing me?

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
No.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.000
Because dragging out a bad singer over fucking 17 sentences is not as good as just saying

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
something funny.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
See, that's a singer.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And that's why that's funny.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It's funny to go.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
That's right, sister.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
That's funny.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
It's a loving, it's a loving thing.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Can I ask you why?

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
That's stupid.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I still want to hear why Jeff doesn't like them.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
I feel like...

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Because I have yet to be entertained by one.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Okay.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Well, they're not...

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Chasing me.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
Chasing me, Spencer.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Or changing anybody in the building.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Okay.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
And make it worth my fucking money.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
It's not going to happen.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
It's not going to happen.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.000
The problem with chain singers is you've got to start by working backwards and then you've got to...

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Going down the fucking payoff, which is just say something witty.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Just say something witty.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Well, yeah, that's the whole thing is that you're delaying the payoff.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
Right.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
And then the payoff is really not worth all the fucking stretch.

58:32.000 --> 58:38.000
It's another way of saying I love you because it's never a mean thing that's said.

58:38.000 --> 58:44.000
I feel like it was pretty mean when you said he had the music taste of a gay drug dealer

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
that seems mean, that doesn't seem loving.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
But that's a bit that Dan and I have with us is that...

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
That's not a changing.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
No, it was still a changing.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
But I'm saying that it's not a mean thing.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
You know what a zing means, right?

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
You know what a zinger is.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
I feel like it is an insult.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Do you know what a changing is?

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
No one knows what a fucking changing is.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
It's...

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
You don't fucking know.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
I feel like...

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
This is the equivalent of you were mad at slip and slides for not being like subways.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Just put a token in it.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Then you'd show up.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Take me to work.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Take me to work.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Why is my lawn wet?

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
If I want to go somewhere...

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
It's a fucking like...

59:23.000 --> 59:28.000
The only thing funny about that, Dan, was you fixing your rabbit ears while you did that bit.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
That's not the only thing.

59:30.000 --> 59:36.000
But we're not here to figure out what's wrong or what's right about anything that any of us are doing.

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
Jeff, do you remember a couple of Easter's ago when we all flew kites?

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
It was the best.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
It was very fun.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
It was great.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Thank you, Aaron.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
That's a nice thing to say.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
The end.

59:45.000 --> 59:51.000
What if Jeff just said the end after every sentence I ever uttered?

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
What if I said the end and it actually was the end?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
That'd be fucking paradise.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
What do you mean?

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
You want to leave?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
No, he's saying he doesn't want me to say anything.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Chainsingers don't fucking work for me.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
That's noted.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Because what doesn't happen in the Chainsinger is that there's no zinging at the end of the chain.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
What happens in your criticism of Chainsingers?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
What's the payoff?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Only the end of Chainsinging.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Well, that hasn't happened yet.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Sadly, no.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
In terms of the amount of verbiage that goes into something versus the amount of entertainment that comes out of it,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
how does Chainsinging compare to your criticism of it?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I think they completely cancel each other out.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000
No, no, no, I'm miserable because of your totally needless hatred of something stupid.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And wait a minute, can I say something?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yes.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
You know what?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
She gave me a Chainsinger, which was really nice.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Right.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
It was a compliment.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And it was a compliment, and she said it with a smile, and then she gave me a hug.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And she could have gone on for half an hour, and I would have been fine with that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
See, I agree with that.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I'm an angel.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I'm an angel, buddy.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Dan, you also know that my fake hatred of Chainsinging is only fake hatred.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I just don't quite understand.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I don't know about that.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
It's very convincing.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
The King of the Nerds is over, right?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It's over for another season.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
What's his name one?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
What's his name one?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
God bless him.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Jonathan won.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Did we talk about our first male?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But isn't that interesting, though, that this was the first male winner?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I can't remember if we talked about this, but is this the first season?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I'm sure this has happened on other reality shows, but this one began with the girls immediately making a macro alliance,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
almost exclusively across gender lines, excluding only two girls.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And it was really effective, and they just squeezed the guys out of the toothpaste.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And to a man, all of the guys were eliminated with absolutely no idea

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
that this was going on.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
That's right.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
It was like this biological phenomenon that just went,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
and they just squeezed the testosterone, like popping a zit.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Pretty much.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
But the one guy that they led into that fucking alliance.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
They led in two.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Oh, was the other guy?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And the other guy, they wound up competing against each other at the end.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Which was so biological.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It was like those rhino beetles, you know?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Trying to throw each other off of a twig while these women watched.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But I just think that's very interesting.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It was the first season that I'd seen that happen where the girls did this really effective thing

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
that almost threatened to kind of destroy the show.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It was so simple.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I know.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
That was the thing that I loved about it, was that these women got together,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and they wound up letting a couple of guys in.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But before they let the guys in, the idea was cross-team alliance to keep men out.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Based on the very practical, simple solution,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
which is that women built in, like they're in the women's bathroom together.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And they're like, they have that time together.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And no one is going to suspect anything is off kilter if all of them are gone for a half hour.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And all come out at the same time.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Because we don't know what goes on in there.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
It's a super smart objective alliance technique because you can just say,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
well, it's just women because we're women, not because we don't like you or anything.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
If you did that with any other quality and your other attribute, genetically,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
you would be in big trouble.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And it's just the fairest skin.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Yeah, it's just the tall people.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
The short people got to go.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That's all it is.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But mind you, as effective as it was as a strategy, two men wound up competing,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
and one of them actually won.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So there you are.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And it was the first male winner.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And the one woman who was left out of the alliance was one of the final four.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So it really, it was a strange series of things.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But I loved it.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I had a great time.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It was a great season.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We really loved Colby.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Colby had a great.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Such a fascinating archetype.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
He was like, if a hack white writer wrote like a magical black reality show contestant.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because he was there.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000
The reason he was a nerd is because he grew up in the streets and wanted to make his mom happy.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Now he's a math teacher.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And I knew all the students were watching.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Every single thing he said, it was like, wait, did William Goldman write you?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I don't mean William Goldman's a hack.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I didn't mean that.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
But I mean, he wrote Goodwill Hunting and didn't even take credit.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Colby was like, he had that mood shift.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I don't know how much of this is editing, but he felt betrayed at one point.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
He wrote him up, sacrificed him, and he never really recovered from that.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Emotionally, it looked like.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
He had an odd feeling with the rest of them.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
He wanted to be there, obviously, and he'd done what do you call it, Jeopardy.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
He'd won Jeopardy like three times or something.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So the guy has obviously had experience.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000
But it's unusual when they get into that into Nerdvana.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It does weird things to people.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
One of the most outrageous things that had me clutching my fist and yelling at the TV

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
was the moment when he came back.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
They had tried to kill him and failed.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So now he comes back and there's always that weird thing in all reality shows.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Like, oh, you tried to slip my throat and your knives didn't work.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
So let's play part cheesy.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
But I found it really culturally fascinating that here he is sitting there,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
a little dour, not totally willing to play Improv Star Wars with them.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
My read was that he was over it because there was kind of like a clicky group sex vibe a little bit.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yeah, there was that too.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And that's when they all started in with this thing that drove me a little crazy where they were like...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Also, they were drinking and he wasn't.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
They started playing the Nerd card in order to try to...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
They're like, come on, we're all nerds, but betrayal is betrayal.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
We all know what it feels like to be picked on and kicked on.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Yeah, but you less so right now at this particular age of March.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And then they became the bullies on the bus when you were a kid that were like,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
ah, you've showered. Come on, man.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And then it's like the worst bullying.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I thought it was a really interesting family.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
The show continues to fascinate me because again, they're like, it's real nerds.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Actually, the reality show shit is all the same,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000
but it reveals more honest stuff than just like, oh, this Barbie doll broke in this way and this one broke in this way.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It's like, I like watching those dynamics.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:56.000
That heavy fellow that had the nervous breakdown was comparing himself to Razzal Ghoul.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Using Razzal Ghoul as a mentor, he's like, look, here's the reason I'm acting this way,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
because Razzal Ghoul would do this and that.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I'm like, well, that's okay. Batman hates him.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Anyways, you should watch it.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
They can watch it on Demand or something.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
You can watch it on TBS on Demand or you can watch it on iTunes, I think.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
And can we just check in about...

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
We'll just bump it and glance off, but the topic of how Bobby's doing?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Bobby Carradine was in a big car accident in Colorado the week of the last episode.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So it was kind of distressing. He seems to be on the mend, however.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Which is absolutely a miracle.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
You're given what that car looked like.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Thank you.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Well, that's good. And his wife was in the car as well.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah, she was fine. Believe it or not. I mean, she walked away.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Man, there was nothing left of this car.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
If you see the picture of the car, there's nothing left of the car.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000
We're on the verge, in our lifetime, I think, unless actuarial tables are correct.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
In my lifetime, we will see self-driving cars.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
We will see a kind of Google grid of cars that take you...

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I don't know that they won't have a steering wheel, but we're going to see this happening.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
The big question that Spencer and I have, we've been talking about it, is

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000
once that starts happening and it has this incredible impact on the amount of car accidents that happen,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
are they going to start making cars out of paper?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Are they going to be interested to watch human society decide,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
well, what about these 2017 safety standards that we keep jacking that up

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and playing this game of insurance claims versus fatalities versus statistics versus traffic?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:05.000
If we were able to switch over to a system by which cars have gotten relatively few car accidents,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
would we immediately drop all that shit and then make cars really unsafe

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
so that the handful of times when a computer crashed a car,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
it was this horrible human sacrifice on the altar of Skynet,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
but everyone just looked the other way.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
They're just like, well, we all got to go to work,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000
so our two paper cars crumbled into each other and it was just skull against skull.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I don't know, I wonder if they're going to do that

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000
or if they'll keep making cars out of these cages with these air balloons and stuff in a sophisticated way,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
because it's very impressive what we've come to so far.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Yes, it is.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
You know what? Poor taste for me to talk about it right now.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
But it was on my mind.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Thank you for asking. No, he's doing well.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
That's fantastic.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
All right, so look, I mean, I think we didn't accomplish that much last week.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I think we might have only crossed the street last time.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
We got to get DeMorge up here.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
DeMorge Brown!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Come on!

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So for the first time in a while, we have a full complement of our Shadowrun cast up here.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I love it.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Fabulous, fantastic.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I was very excited last time, because remember Jen was here?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
The woman you called up for, is she here?

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
She's not here tonight, but she was here last time.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And I finally got what I'm supposed to do.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Oh, really?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Just from watching her.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You're supposed to ask questions.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Oh, really?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Yeah, you can ask anything you want.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I know, I never thought about asking questions, until she said,

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
can I do such and such?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And I went, oh my god, I should have been asking that.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Spencer loves that.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I know, I'm going to do it this time.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Yeah, I love questions.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I watched last week's show, as it was happening.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I would kind of like to do my character, as Julia doing.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
She was interesting.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Yeah, I saw her in line earlier, when I had my big mask on.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Is she here tonight?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
She is.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm not sure who, can you guys just check top and pass the rest down?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It's always been that way.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Julia, how are you feeling?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Yeah.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Julia, what are you on right now?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Nope.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Nope.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
All right.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
All right, Spencer, do we have a guest author of the recap?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Yeah, but I can't remember who it is.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
There was someone on Reddit.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
I'll get you back, Reddit guy.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Should we just give it a try?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
All right, Spencer, take it away from an anonymous recap author.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Sorry, Reddit guy.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I'll say it was Frack.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Last time on Harmon Time Shadow Run.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Mercy O'Donnell went into the burger tyrants.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
All right.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
That's it.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
That's how much ground we got there.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Let the punishment fit the crime because we didn't do shit.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
She had like a Carol Burnett laugh.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
She had a very delightful laugh.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Can you laugh?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Can you laugh?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Like that.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Oh shit.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I enjoyed her.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
She was a delight.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
She was like a pine tree air freshener hanging from the roof

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
mirror of the stage.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
She was like a beautiful hot air balloon.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Spencer, she was going to meet, was it Anthony Spazuli?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Arturo Spazuli.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Arturo Spazuli.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Spaguli.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Spaguli, sorry.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
My writing is, wow.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So we're meeting Arturo Spaguli.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Yeah.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Mercy is in there.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Mercy is in there.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Okay.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
You guys are outside actually.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Just kind of waiting, waiting for her.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Okay.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I have a snack.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I don't know what I'm going to be doing.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I have made a mistake.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Someone else do this.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Someone else do this right now.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Okay.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Okay.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Come on.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Come on.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Come on.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Come on.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Come on.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Come on.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Come on.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Come on.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Come on.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Come on.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Okay.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I would like a hot dog wink.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Can I veto this?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Yes.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Yes.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Okay.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
That was my ode to Julia.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Let's get drunk after a girl.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
All right.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Hi.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I'm sorry.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
What am I doing?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You're standing in a burger tyrant.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Right.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And I'm looking for this guy's, I'm sorry.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
The plan was for you to go in and just lure this guy out using the oldest weapon in the

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
business.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
All right.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Old Smith and Sexton.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Hi.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Hi.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Hi, young man.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I know you hear this every day, but me and my girlfriend, it's my girlfriend's bachelorette.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Our stripper didn't show up and we would never ask you to strip.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
But a couple of the girls have a crush on you.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Could you just, could you just come out and take a picture with us quickly for a second?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Arturo is, he's wearing a fine Italian suit and stuffing burgers in his face.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
He's holding a burger in each hand.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
His hands are full of burgers.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
He barely seems, you know, bothered by the words coming out of your mouth.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
He's like, no can do, honey.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Sorry.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
He's like, um, um, um.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Okay.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Um, I'm going to use a con.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I think you already were.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
All right.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Um, how about negotiation?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Okay.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
All right.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Hey, look, you come outside.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I'll give you a kiss on your balls.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
One single.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
You see, now, now we're playing shadow run.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
See, Julian, that's all you had to do.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That was your crime was not doing that.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Just walk in, walk in and offer a ball kiss.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I'm a classy lady.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I just have this thing with kissing anonymous balls.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Um, just come outside and I'll just, I'll just give you a little kiss on the balls.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I'm kind of busy.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Give me, give me 20 minutes.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I'll be right out.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Yeah, this guy's just like me.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You said the process.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
What?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:28.000
He's like, wait, when someone says, kiss your balls, you say, give me 20 minutes.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Can I, can I use perception to see like why, why the delay?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Uh, what can I use perception to understand like why he doesn't want his balls kissed

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
immediately?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Um, you see, you don't see a reason why he doesn't want his balls kicked.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm, um, kissed.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Is it possible that, uh, from a distance I might cast a spell?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Uh, yeah.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
If you can, yeah, anyone you can see you could probably cast a spell at.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Might I enter the room?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I enter the room.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Okay.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
You enter the room and the, the guy, he drops his burgers and draws two pistols.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
The fry cooks each drop pistol and appointment.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You guys are like, get the fuck out of here, boy.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Sorry, that's rude.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Well, I'm sorry.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Hard to get it.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Hard to go to Swedish, right?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
There's black people in Sweden.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Well, that raises the question.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Is it hard to go black?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It's a, I don't know.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
It's hard to go black.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Absolutely not.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Then it's fine.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It's all fine.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
It's all fine.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
The problem of being a boy is that I am tiny and short.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And I have certain possibilities that I might.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And I'll wait for the awkward conversation between Special and the Borge Lady.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
However, I feel like it's happening right now.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Given, given, uh, given, uh, the landscape that you have, uh, left out.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I believe shouting at me that I can see you.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And given that I can see you, perhaps I can cast a spell.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
All right.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
What do you want to cast?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
A spell of stupidity in which you are open to suggestion.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Can I, can I?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Is that a real thing?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Yes.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Can I pull horticard aside for a second?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Uh, I'm standing.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
We're in the middle of a move.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Like, well, you're, you're a good 10, 15 feet off and there's like four guns on the guys.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So, okay.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I don't know.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
You're, I mean, you could do something, but it might.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Might as cast a spell of susceptibility then.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Uh, is that a spell that you have?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
That just makes you more hurt by things?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
No.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It makes the subject more susceptible.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Could I, may I ask a question?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Yeah.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Could I cast a spell and put him into a complete troll skin?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Wait, what?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
A troll skin.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It's armor.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And I'm the doctor.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I think you have troll skin.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
No, no, no.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:15.000
No, according to, excuse me, but, but according to this, uh, I've got, I've got, I can, I

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
can, uh, well, maybe it is me.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Yeah.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I think it's you.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Is it under armor?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Troll skin.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Never mind.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
You can put it on and run in front of it.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Seriously.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Is there a susceptibility spell?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I don't mean to, if there is, you could do it.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I've heard of it, but however, let's try this.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
You're making up spells?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
No.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
This is one that I've read up.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Is it on your spell list?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
No, it's not.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
It has to be one of the spells that you know.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I don't think it is.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Are you trying to cheat Shadowrun?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Might I use, no.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I would like to cast turn everyone into pillows.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I don't, I don't think that's a spell you have.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Might I use a mind pro to find what his resistance is to the face that no one can resist?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Uh, who?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
The, the guy with the burgers?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Mr. Burgers.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Yeah.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Uh, yeah.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Okay.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So fun fact, casting a spell, it takes some time and if you cast a spell, people will

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.080
know you're casting a spell and casting spells also causes like apocalypses and people's

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.000
heads to explode, so it might be really, really a threatening thing to do.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Right, put the mind probe.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But he's saying like it's the, they got their guns on you and they told you to get the fuck

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
out.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
If you cast a spell, it's the equivalent of pulling a gun out.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Like they, they might shoot you.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Yeah.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Right, so maybe, maybe do more good for me.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
So do less, do less.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
All we want is to get our tourist bagouli out of there.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Mercy or Donald asked, I'll suck your dick or lick your balls.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I will kiss your balls.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I'll kiss your balls.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
A single time.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
He said he'll be out in 20 minutes.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Should we just wait him out or should we?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
All right.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
20, yeah, let's wait him out.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Well, I'm.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Can we just cool our heels for 20 minutes or should we?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Well, I mean, yeah, like a horde of guards, get out of there.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Is it possible that I might order a burger?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Not.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
That's possible.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Which given might take 35 minutes or so.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You go outside and you leave your weapons outside and then you come back and you get

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
all the burgers you need, my friend.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I require one.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
OK.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Is it even that amount?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I got in the comic and say, everybody, let's just buy it our time.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
20 minutes.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Mercy's going to kiss a couple of balls.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
We're going to get our tourist bagouli out here.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
We'll take him.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
We'll get the money.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
That's going to be good, right?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Yeah.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I apply a lot of chapstick.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Is Curtis's character in the car with me?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Yeah.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I'm school there.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
All right.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Dialogue break.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:02.000
So, I haven't been on a lot of shadow runs with you.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Well, you know, these always make me very nervous.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
The shadow runs.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
How does a man in medicine become such a destructive force?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
That's the problem.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Is I figure sometimes I try to resist, but sometimes I have powers and it's more than

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I can do to control them.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
You go on shadow runs to exercise your powers?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I go on shadow runs in case anyone else is hurt.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
That's my job as a doctor.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000
But sometimes, sometimes, when we get into these kinds of situations, I do have powers

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and I lose control over them.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Like that agony spell?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I was just thinking about that one.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I remember that.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Because I was thinking that if there's a problem in there, I may have to use the agony spell,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
which goes against all of my rules as a doctor.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Yeah.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I'm kind of conflicted because, you know, I want this one to go clean, but I really loved

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
you casting that agony spell.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I wanted to do the troll skin, but I wasn't allowed to.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So now I'm going to have to do the agony spell.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Ready?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
No.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
You're going to do it now?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Yeah.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
No, don't.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
No.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I jump on the comic and go, boys, if you're thinking about casting agony spells, can

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
we just wait 15 minutes to get this fucking done?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
We're just sitting in a car waiting.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I mean, I can do it just through the window.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
We know.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Guys, on the comic, I'll kiss everyone's balls, just wait.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Wait a second.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I go on the comic and say, Mercy, would you go kiss a doctor's balls and fucking have

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
him lay low for a second?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Kiss everybody's balls so we can just get Anthony Spraguli out of here.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Arturo Spraguli.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
The thing is, it's an empty offer, but it usually works.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Why is it an empty offer?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Because I've never actually kissed any balls.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Why haven't you kissed any balls before?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Why would anyone just kiss balls?

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I mean, if anything, it's just a show that I'm subservient and I'm not.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I mean, it's something that turns guys on.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I feel like kissing balls is its own reward.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Will you show me how to kiss balls?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Will you kiss the doctor's balls?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Okay, I will.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
All right.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Thank you.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Okay, I walk up to the doctor and I say, doctor, I'm going to kiss your balls.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I'm going to do it for one reason, because we're going to find out the importance of

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:50.000
kissing balls, the ratio of ball kissing to pay off, where you don't have to jump in

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
and cast agony spells and make any kind of cause.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Eve, Eve, Eve.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Woman to woman, you're going to blow my cover.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Getting your balls kissed, I don't think is actually that great.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
It's just something I say, but please don't.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000
But don't just, if you start kissing balls, then the deflation of ball kissing.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But you said you've never kissed balls before.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
How do you know what they're about?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
No, I know, because I never had to.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
We're not doing this, we have to.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
We're doing this.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I mean, you kiss all the balls you want, but you don't have to do a study about how

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
worthless it is to have your balls kissed.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Spencer, is there a way for me and Mercy to talk privately on the Comlink?

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Or is it always over the hole?

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
What the fuck?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Mercy, this is Eve on a direct message.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Hello?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Hey, hi.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Mercy?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
You got me?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
This is just Eve.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I think they went off channel.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Can you keep a secret?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Yeah, yeah, girl, if you want.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
You got to promise me, Mercy, you can keep a secret.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Who can hear me?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Check, check.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I'm here, I can hear you.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Oh, you can hear me?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
All right.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Believe me, before they went dark.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Mercy, I'm not doing this for you.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I'm not doing this for the mission.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm doing this because I want to kiss the doctor's balls.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I think that's beautiful and powerful, and I think that's great.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And if you don't have to talk to me about it, but if you want to tell me about it, you can.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I think I deserve to be heard in this conversation.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
What if I don't want my balls kissed?

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
What do you get out of it if you do kiss my balls?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
You can hear them?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I just know you get the shame of not taking the balls kissed.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I go offline.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Where am I, and where is the doctor?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000
You guys are all in the truck.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I'm in the car.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Okay, I just start kissing the doctor's balls.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
We're all just in a car, right?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Aren't we just in a car?

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
It's just like prom night in Milwaukee.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Can you explain, did you unzip his pants and then cradle his balls out of his pants?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yes, precisely.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
What did you do with his dick?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Did you touch his dick?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The dick has nothing to do with what I'm doing.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
This is simply about me?

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
You just fished his balls out like a goldfish bag at a carnival?

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Hey guys, we're all in the same car.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Watch me work.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It's one elf, one doctor, two.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It's just as rewarding.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Two balls.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Let me fucking do my thing, and I start gently kissing the doctor's balls.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I placed my author about 15 minutes ago.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I just wanted to get any progress on the background.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I would like to take this moment to say that I really appreciate all the work that Spencer does

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
and all the work that he puts into these.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Thank you.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Thanks.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It was a great job.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
You don't think that when he writes the maps and the descriptions of different rooms

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
and then we spend a half hour kissing balls that he's not like, phew, I gotta wake up.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I'm certain that he's like, yeah.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
It's all good.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So I'm kissing the doctor's balls.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I mean, yeah, what does the doctor have to say about that, right?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Well, I gave up.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I thought I had an opinion, but I guess I don't, so I'm just going with it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Doctor, I'm kissing your balls.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
And it's up to you.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Doctor, friend, whether you, I'm just trying to prove a point,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
whether we could have gone and kissed this guy's balls and got him out of here.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Wait, you're still insisting that there was a point?

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
You said this was about your wife and your niece.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Okay, guys, truth be told, I just want to kiss his balls.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
You don't say.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Okay.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I said, now I'm just sucking him.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Now I'm just fucking.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Now I got both, I got both balls in my mouth at the same time.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And now I'm just fucking, I'm really fucking going at it.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I know I'm not on this link, but how, how is it that you're talking?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Can you say what you just said again, but as if you had the doctor's balls in your mouth?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
With both balls in your mouth.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And by both balls, I mean one scrotum.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Using it, no stuff.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Like a link.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:48.900
I'm going to make a perimeter, I get out of the car, and there's like a

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:52.780
dolly shot of me walking down the street with the car in the background

01:29:52.780 --> 01:30:04.220
and I'm just like shadow runs it sounds like there are cicadas in the

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:13.180
trees it's too much shadow on this one

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:26.580
while I'm sucking the doctor's balls I cast a butterfly spell and I cast

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:31.060
two butterflies to tickle both of his balls from the side while I'm sucking

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:38.940
his balls I start licking his butt but I cast two butterflies I cast two magic

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:46.380
butterflies I cast force for butterflies to tickle his balls while I'm

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:52.580
looking at you but I find a playground I'm just like I got my fingers to the

chain link and I'm just watching children play and I'm just like and the

01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:05.140

darkness was I conjure to force for a butterfly like also don't don't exhaust

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:23.580

01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:02.220
won't come out for two children in a car accident no he's a he's a mobster and

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:07.820
it's the future if you think the present is selfish right but if I've

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:23.580
learned anything from Grandfather the godfather but the godfather he was so

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:31.820
grand wasn't he mafia in the 70s like yeah I mean it's only gotten worse the

01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:40.460
burgers he's eating are probably made of children too soon organized crime is

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:45.460
all about code right and you protect children they have dances and you have

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:50.860
to buy their organized crime movies that we've seen play out a particular story

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.740
which is that organized crime much like capitalism itself like it's slowly

01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:01.300
eroded by its own code which is profit above all else so what starts as the

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:07.140
black hand in Sicily and it becomes La Cosa Nostra turns into just a bunch of

01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:11.920
business people okay okay I walk out and I come back in again and I say two

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:18.740
Ponzi schemes got in a car accident I'm gonna crazy can I can I use my grapple

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:24.740
gun to Batman up to the roof of the burger tyrant yeah I mean you laugh but

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:29.740
this is my style I get it this is what I do that's why I laugh I'm like a cat I

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:34.580
fight higher ground I come down from from from up above so let me know when

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.100
I'm up there let me know what my options are you're up there it's there's some

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:45.140
small fist size pipes for ventilation yeah not people size all right nothing

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:51.260
nothing cinematically sized no I'm afraid not all right fine go going back

01:36:51.260 --> 01:37:02.060
down okay reality check it's a trope called well it's it's the you know it's

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:06.540
not much ventilation in a burger tyrant of course not why would there be I don't

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:15.220
know what it will prohibit it for me to go use my other an alternate identity as

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.980
a security guard yeah but you still look the same exactly so secondly is it

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:26.380
possible that the doctor could give me another skin I don't I think the troll

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:30.780
skin is just something he has if he if he could disguise I go in the comic and

01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:34.700
I asked our whole team why is it so hard to get one guy out of a fucking burger

01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:42.020
place it's not a helpful question we have to be able to get one guy out of a

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:46.340
burger place let's let's just muscle up and go get this I'm gonna have organized

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:51.140
how do I use my organized scrap my organized crime skill to get him out can

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.020
I use that also under qualities it says moderate egg allergy that's not a

01:37:55.020 --> 01:38:01.300
quality that is an absolutely a quality it's it's what made me want to work for

01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:07.860
you I I want to when I get a turn what was the other question organized crime

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:14.180
how do I use your knowledge of organized crime to learn stuff I mean I want to

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:20.980
learn how to lure this guy outside using my organized crime knowledge nothing

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:28.300
that's like looking at the walkthrough for a video game for me what a moderate

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:34.620
egg allergy would it be would it be possible for me to inflict the agony

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:42.620
spell on you not the guys with the guns but on you the dungeon master not you

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:47.980
not not you but the guy we're trying to get out sure I put the agony spell on

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:54.460
him when he goes down screaming in agony I come rushing in saying I'm a doctor

01:38:54.460 --> 01:39:05.780
yeah now we're fucking talking that's what I'm talking about so I I put the

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:11.020
spell on him how does that go I mean let's not because he's yours let's not

01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:17.620
short change the audience on the agony spell so I roll down the window of the

01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:22.660
of the truck actually do you mind if I can I hold on I mean I just want to get

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:41.860
this on video I we're recording oh yeah I know but not from this angle okay you

01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:46.220
fire off the agony spell and it lances through the window and hits him right in

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:52.860
his dumb suit he goes down a righty thing around in what looks like agony is

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.820
there a verbal component to the spell though I feel like there's a verbal

01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:14.500
component oh oh oh all right I I guess I I guess I should just let things that

01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:22.180
make me happy go I just remember that first week you just going I don't

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:31.980
remember that but anyway okay that's much better and so okay so it's done

01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:40.420
yeah down on the floor in agony yes yeah out of the way let him breathe are

01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:46.780
you carrying your weapons no I'm not I'm carrying my bag all right so I kneel

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:56.980
down I give him an injection he passes out I need help somebody you men with

01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:04.860
guns help me get him out to our truck I'll get him to the hospital oh yeah
