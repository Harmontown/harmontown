{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.000\nTo note that product in Hollywood, California, Carmen Town is now in session.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:28.000\nHappy Easter!\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:39.000\nLet's welcome to the stage the mayor of Carmen Town, Mr. Dan Frontier's apartment.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:44.000\nThank you! Happy Easter!\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:51.000\nWhat's the thing for Thanksgiving? It's about what you're thankful for.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:56.000\nYou tell everybody you're thankful for on Easter, is it like what you're relieved about?\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:02.000\nIn keeping with the Christian tradition of like, whew!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:05.000\nHe's up.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:13.000\nIt's a spring ceremony about that things are back in bloom, that Jesus is back in bloom.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:25.000\nHe's blossoming like a little flower. He's ready to pollinate with his Christ pollen.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:29.000\nIt's a pretty uplifting thing, isn't it?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nYou're reminding me right now of a movie I don't like, and I know that people here love it, Donnie Darko.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:44.000\nI don't like Donnie Darko, and you're reminding me of the terrible nightmare rabbit from Donnie Darko.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:58.000\nI have ears on like that costume, so you're saying the rest of my face and body are like a blood-soaked, dirt-coated, creepy rabbit costume.\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:00.000\nPrecisely.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:06.000\nSo when I'm not wearing the ears, you just think I'm like a creepy, gross, furry, bloody...\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:10.000\nI think you're a lazy Donnie Darko.\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:13.000\nI don't think the rabbit's name is Donnie Darko.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:19.000\nI don't think your hatred of the movie is valid if you don't know that.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.000\nBut check this out, look.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nWhat?\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:33.000\nYou showing me a slightly off-center cottontail on your ass is not going to stop me from having more nightmares.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:44.000\nBut of course, you know, our audience is filled with jaded hipsters, so they already know that Easter is, of course...\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nWhat is a hipster, by the way? What is your definition of hipster?\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:58.000\nA hipster is any person that you are projecting a bunch of your insecurities onto.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nBut couldn't there also be jocks and also hippies?\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:11.000\nYeah, I don't think that there's people who present as jocks anymore in the millennium, so everyone just calls everybody a hipster that they don't like.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:18.000\nEven Los Angeles, anyway. I'm sure there's archetypes in the Midwest that you could go, like, that guy's a fucking tractor.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:25.000\nLook out in our audience, look out and physically make eye contact. Find what you would think of as a hipster.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:27.000\nYeah, they're all hipsters.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:33.000\nIf there was a jaded, stand-out comic that came up here, he would call them all hipsters.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:40.000\nI've been through this situation. Channel 101 kids were called hipsters at this open mic because they came to see me do stand-up instead of this other guy.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:44.000\nI called them all hipsters. And it was like, we're nerds, fucking hipster.\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:49.000\nYeah, I think we have 100% nerds, no hipsters.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:56.000\nWhat I don't see is hipsters wearing, like, ironic, weird scarves for no reason.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:02.000\nWell, I mean, for instance, there's a razor-raiser fine line between nerd girl and hipster.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:10.000\nI mean, if you're a nerd girl, how do you distinguish, you know, like, if you're a guy and you see a nerdy girl?\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:15.000\nWell, I would say there's a very definable line between nerd girl and nerd hipster.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nIt depends if her glasses are actually prescription or if that's what it is.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:26.000\nI mean, if she takes off the glasses, then walks into a wall, then she would, okay, gotcha, she's a nerd.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:33.000\nJust take our front row, find a hipster in our front row, or admit they're all nerds.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:39.000\nWe got Lena Dunham here, and she's definitely a hipster. Will you stand up and wave to everybody?\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:44.000\nYou're the ultimate hipster. Lena Dunham, everybody.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:48.000\nShe's a nerd! She's a nerd?\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nNo, right, she's a nerd. Yes, that was very nerdy behavior. Thank you.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.000\nWhere's this going? What's your idea?\n\n04:54.000 --> 05:00.000\nI don't think there's hipsters here. I think we've all, we, Harmontown, we never really went to the moon,\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:04.000\nbecause we gave up on that premise a fucking good long time ago.\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:09.000\nBut what we did do is we went to the moon of no hipsters, just nerds. Right?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:14.000\nYeah. I mean, you're pretty drunk.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.000\nHe said nervously adjusting his bunny ears.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:25.000\nI mean, it's Easter. Jeff said, are we doing a show on Easter? I said, yeah, sorry about that, and my assistant's Jewish.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd Jeff said, well, I'll come, but I'm going to be pretty drunk.\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:36.000\nActually, I'm not as drunk as I would like to be. I drink a lot of rosÃ© Greek wine at Dino's, but I'm not as drunk as I wish I were.\n\n05:36.000 --> 05:41.000\nNo. I think that's in the eye of the beholder.\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:50.000\nAnyways, I think Easter is, of course, based on the absorption of the solstice.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:54.000\nWhat does Easter mean for you? I've internalized Easter.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:00.000\nIt's spring. It's coming out of winter and into the time when the winter thaw and stuff.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:11.000\nFor my family, growing up as a Lutheran kid in Wisconsin, we would dye the eggs and then we would hide the actual hard-boiled eggs.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:15.000\nI found out that's not as common a thing. A lot of people hide the plastic eggs filled with candy.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:20.000\nMakes more sense. What kid wants to find a hard-boiled egg?\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.000\nI did. I was like, I can't wait to find all the eggs.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:29.000\nYou and I are about the same age. It was always hard-boiled eggs. There were no fake eggs filled with candy.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nYou found a hard-boiled egg.\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nBut why? Why did you want to find them?\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:37.000\nBecause it was Easter.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:43.000\nI also associate Easter with my clearest memory about Easter is, unfortunately, for my mom.\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:51.000\nI remember waking up with my brother and walking into the living room and there was this piece of typewriter paper with a sharpie-pen note written on it that said,\n\n06:51.000 --> 07:00.000\nEaster has been postponed. Because somebody misbehaved the previous day, there was a big family fight or something.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:04.000\nSo we woke up and we were like, what the fuck does postponed mean?\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:10.000\nAnd my brother was like, I think it means canceled. I think it means delayed. I think we're going to have an Easter later.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:17.000\nThen we had to force ourselves to go like, well, do we like Easter? Do we care if it ever arrives?\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nIsn't the whole point of Easter that Jesus delayed it for three days before he...\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nYeah, a good Easter has always postponed.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nYes.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.000\nHow ironic.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nJesus can't be on time.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:39.000\nThat's like somebody ruining Christmas by giving birth.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nTo Jesus.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nThat's the only way to ruin it.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:48.000\nOr like if you're like, oh, Christmas is ruined because there's no room in this hotel.\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:57.000\nThere's so much room, fuck it.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:06.000\nWhy would you stay in a barn? There's room at the hotel.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:13.000\nAll right, so I... let's see what we got here. I don't think a lot.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:17.000\nLet me know in the booth if our special guest shows up.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:24.000\nWe have a guest? Also, don't tell me who it is. I don't know that.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:31.000\nDan, special secret. I'm a little drunk.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:35.000\nSo to go back to my thing, it's Easter, so what are you relieved about?\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nWhy is it about relief?\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nBecause when the people saw Jesus come out of the cave, I'm sure they were like, whew.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:46.000\nNo, I don't think it's relief. I think it's a crisis.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nWell, maybe for a few...\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:53.000\nFor the Romans and the Jews and everyone else. What does this mean? It's a moment of crisis.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:57.000\nI don't think we celebrate Easter through the eyes of the Romans.\n\n08:57.000 --> 09:06.000\nNo, we celebrate against the backdrop of the Romans. The idea that we help the guy get killed,\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:11.000\nand that he's now... where the fuck is he?\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:18.000\nWe have to take on the word of a few people that he's risen.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:24.000\nHe actually rose from the dead. Relief is not what's happening then.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:28.000\nIt's like, what the fuck is happening right now?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:33.000\nFor the followers of Jesus, I don't think they felt relief.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nThey were like, whew, shit!\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nWell, what is that?\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:40.000\nThey killed our friend, now he's gone, now he's alive.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nSo surprised? Pleasant surprise?\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:46.000\nI don't think they said, oh, what a pleasure.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:53.000\nSo on Easter, you should ask yourself, what are you pleasantly surprised by?\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:58.000\nI'm pleasantly surprised by you wearing bunny ears.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:04.000\nAlso, I'm pleasantly surprised by the fact that this is a holiday that absolutely means nothing,\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:11.000\nincluding people that believe in the New Testament, the Old Testament, and any Testament.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:19.000\nIt's really... it's simply a spring ritual. That's all it is.\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:24.000\nWell, isn't that kind of uplifting that even the Holy Roman Empire, with all of its power, had to...\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:30.000\nThey're like, you know what, we can rule by force with a lot of ways,\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:34.000\nbut we can't keep these people on these equinoxes, these solstices.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:38.000\nWe can't keep them from knowing that the eggs are important.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:43.000\nAnd so we've got to move Jesus's various thresholds.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:52.000\nThe Empire, I think about like 300 or 400 years before Caesar ruined the Republic.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:57.000\nThe Gauls, which is basically France, a bunch of barbarians they called him,\n\n10:57.000 --> 11:05.000\ncame in and took over and kicked a bunch of ass in Italy and went right to the gates of Rome.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:09.000\nThe geese flew off in the sky.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:13.000\nAnd Romans worshipped the geese for hundreds of years after that,\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:18.000\nbecause the geese went honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, and warned Rome that the fucking Gauls were at the gates.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:24.000\nAnd they hated dogs because the dogs didn't bark.\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:30.000\nSo for a couple hundred years, for a couple hundred years, then there was a ritual.\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:36.000\nThere was a ritual in Rome while Caesar was in Gaul and fucking Pompey and Caesar\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:42.000\nand a lot of fucking mate, like Cato and Cicero and people we know were there.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:48.000\nBecause Cato?\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:52.000\nC-A-T-O, not Cato Kalem.\n\n11:52.000 --> 12:00.000\nThere was a ritual held where dogs were murdered in the streets of Rome\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:04.000\nand geese got to sit on golden pillows and watch it happen.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:08.000\nSo that's the backdrop of where Easter fucking happens,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:15.000\nbecause it was only about fucking 50 years later that Jesus was killed or was around and was dead.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:20.000\nIsn't it crazy that it wasn't too long ago when animals were like competitors to us?\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:25.000\nWe were still kind of like on the same pop chart with them.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nWe were living in cities, but there was still, like in the back of our heads,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:33.000\nthere was like a threat that maybe we'd be living in Beartown one day.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nThey never make the wall a little higher.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nThese fucking bears are looking their eye.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:42.000\nRome was Wolftown, so it's two wolves the fucking fan of the goddamn thing, right?\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:46.000\nYeah, and Athens was just like a rocky crevice.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:50.000\nPeople crawled up into some holes to get away from all the animals.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nThen they built the Acropolis on that.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:57.000\nThe whole foundation of Western civilization is just based on us being scared of animals\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nand wondering why they're so much smarter than us.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nWhy do they always know what to do?\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:09.000\nGod damn it, every time we try to hunt something, the dogs get there first.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:15.000\nIt's a really uplifting story that we ended up having them as pets and stuff.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:20.000\nIt's sad that we at one point were so ticked off at them\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:24.000\nand kind of still insecure that we had to slaughter them and stuff.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nIt's a little sad.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:31.000\nAlright, so anyways, can we do a new segment called,\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:35.000\nMy Wife Bullies Me?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nYes, we can.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:46.000\nWhen you get married, it's time to get picked on by your wife\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nfor the rest of your life.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:51.000\nShe can make fun of you,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:56.000\nbecause it would be hard for you to just get up and leave.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:59.000\nSo all your shit is there,\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:04.000\nand you promised in front of God and her dad that you'd stay.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nSo that was Easter.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:18.000\nErin was coordinating things with Hoppy Town, our Easter mascot, Hoppy Town.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou guys met up front.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nShe came down to visit me,\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nand I was having a nice Easter with the Easter basket she made for me\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.000\nwith all kinds of Reese's products in it.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:40.000\nI had put on a selection of music in a really roundabout way.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nWe call them chain zingers.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:48.000\nA chain zinger is like,\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:52.000\nif somebody is taking your french fries off of your plate while you're eating,\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:55.000\ninstead of just saying, hey, you're taking all my fries,\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:58.000\nyou go, so where are you going to deposit it?\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nAnd then the other person goes, deposit what?\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nYou go, oh, your money.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nDon't you have a bunch of extra money now?\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nAnd they go, what do you mean?\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nAnd they go, well, because you're getting so rich now, aren't you?\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:15.000\nBecause you're saving so much money on blood pressure medication?\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nNo, what are you talking about?\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:19.000\nWell, don't you have really low blood pressure?\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:26.000\nWell, then how come your sodium intake just seems to be so high?\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:31.000\nYou're eating my fucking fries!\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:35.000\nThat's a chain zinger.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nSo she came down and did a chain zinger.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nI'm not going to try to recreate it.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\nI want to hear more chain zingers.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nThey're not easy, and they've become a thing unto themselves.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nJust try it with your loved ones home.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:51.000\nSo the person zinging you is doing a chain zinger?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nThey start eight steps back, and they make you go,\n\n15:53.000 --> 16:00.000\nwhat do you mean, like eight times, and then they insult you.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:04.000\nSo she did one of those, and I'm not going to bother to recreate her chain zinger,\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:09.000\nI wish you would.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:15.000\nBecause of the music I was listening to, she called me a gay drug dealer.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nWait, is that how she opened up the chain zinger?\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nOr is that the payoff of the chain zinger?\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nNo, that's not how she opened up the chain zinger.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nI'm still confused about what a chain zinger is.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nWell, I shouldn't have distracted you with that,\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:28.000\nbut I didn't want to undersell her bullying of me.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:30.000\nIt's very sophisticated.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nI also don't remember what her chains are.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nHer chains are a little sloppy.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nI don't want to try to recreate their lame half the time.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nDo you chain zing her?\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nYeah, I do.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nSo what would be you chain zinging, Aaron?\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:46.000\nYou know, I don't know. They're hard. They're hard to do.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nAll right, well, you're asking us to buy a premise that I don't quite understand, right?\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:56.000\nI'm asking you to buy a cup of coffee.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:00.000\nSo my wife...\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nThis episode can't be called chain zinger\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nuntil you tell me what a fucking chain zinger really is.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.000\nWhat's the meat and potatoes of a chain zinger?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nAll right, all right, Jeff.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nJeff, are they...\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nTry and chain zing me on what I'm doing right now.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:19.000\nOkay. Jeff, are they removable?\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:20.000\nWhat?\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nThe tattoos.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nWhich tattoos are you talking about?\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nThe ones that you get in prison.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nThe ones I got in prison?\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nYeah, didn't you go to prison?\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nI've never been to prison.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nBut what happened after you hit that tree?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nWhich tree?\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nThe one that you hit in your car.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nI didn't hit a tree.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nAren't you an alcoholic?\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nNo.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:49.000\nWait, this tree...\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nI tried to back into...\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nI don't want to do a chain zinger on command.\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:56.000\nThey're hard. They're hard.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nThat's if I wanted to know what a fucking chain zinger is.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:01.000\nI just tried one. It was bad, but I did one.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:04.000\nGive me a fucking historical chain zinger.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nNo, I don't keep track of them.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nBut you're grinding an axe about chain zinging.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nWe're not leaving this room until I fucking know what a chain zinger is.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nAll right.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:26.000\nIs it hard for you to...\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:29.000\nDo your eyes hurt? Do your eyes hurt?\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:30.000\nCurrently?\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:31.000\nYeah.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:32.000\nNo.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nOkay, but doesn't all the flash photography hurt your eyes?\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nWhen does lots of flash photography?\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nWhen you do a red carpet.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nOh, yeah, I mean, you asked me could it...\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:46.000\nIt's a possible word. There's lots of flash photography.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nYou were in that movie recently.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nRight. That movie called...\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nWell, Lawnmower Man 3.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nYeah, right.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nBecause aren't you Job?\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.000\nDon't you have control over time and space?\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nNo, I was just an actor.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nWell, you're putting me on the spot.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nI kind of cheated with that one.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nAm I cheating? I mean, not accomplishing your goal.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.000\nA broken chain zinger.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nI want a chain zinger.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:28.000\nI mean, these are examples of chain zingers.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nThey're not good ones.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:33.000\nYou mean that somebody's trying to mush it to you over the long term.\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nThey're trying to get you...\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.000\nThey set you up.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:39.000\nThey force you through a series of hoops.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:44.000\nYeah, you just make someone walk with you to the place where you slap them.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nWhy was I in Lawnmower Man 3?\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:50.000\nBecause you were putting me on the spot.\n\n19:56.000 --> 20:00.000\nIf we call this fucking episode a chain zinger, I'll fucking kill everybody in this room.\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:06.000\nWe only get to call this episode a chain zinger if Dan does a chain zinger\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:09.000\nand the audience knows what the hell he's talking about.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nDo you guys know what I'm talking about?\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nYes!\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nOkay, somebody came up on the stage and chained zinged Dan\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nand proved to me what he's talking about.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nPrecisely. Nobody fucking knows.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nThey're hard. They're hard.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nI understand the premise.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nI just want to hear a story about being properly chain zinged.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nLet's do it. Do you have a chain zinger?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.000\nIs that what you said? Let's do it?\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nYeah.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:36.000\nWell, let him do it first.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nCome up and chain zing.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nBen.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:50.000\nHello, Ben.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nSorry.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nWe met two days ago.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nGood to meet you.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nAlright.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.000\nAre you going to improv a chain zing?\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:05.000\nDo you have a current existing beef that you're going to zing Dan on and chain in fashion?\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nNo, it's half and half.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nOkay.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nHey, Ben, can I ask you, do you...\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nThere comes a bad chain zinger.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:23.000\nDo you find it difficult to move?\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:27.000\nAren't you part robot?\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nNo.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nDon't you have a speaker for a mouth?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nBecause you're not talking on the microphone.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nOkay.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nSorry.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:42.000\nI see that as a chain zinger, but I don't see that as a zinger.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:43.000\nAlright.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nI see the chain...\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nOkay.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:50.000\nHere's the chain zinger.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:51.000\nHey, Dan.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:55.000\nYes, Ben?\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:57.000\nDid all those doves die?\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:01.000\nWhat doves? What are you talking about, Ben?\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:05.000\nDid all those doves die when you and Aaron threw all that rice?\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:08.000\nWhat rice did we throw? I don't get it. What do you mean?\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:12.000\nAt your guy's most recent wedding.\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:17.000\nYeah, we got married.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:23.000\nI mean, when you and Aaron got married to doing chain zingers.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nNo, no, don't fucking...\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:31.000\nThat's not... That doesn't fucking scan. It doesn't scan at all.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nThey're not easy to do.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:37.000\nI know. Give me one version where it works.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nNo, because they're hard.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nThen why bring it up?\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:44.000\nWhy bring up skateboarding? Skateboarding's hard.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:48.000\nIf Tony Hawk came on stage, you could skateboard.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nWait, but...\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nWhat's a chain zinger?\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:57.000\nWe just made it up. Someone had to put wheels on a board\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nbefore Tony Hawk could ever be good at something.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:03.000\nWe're sending these people out into the world.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:07.000\nThat person didn't think he was zinging somebody. He thought he was an engineer.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:11.000\nJeff, Jeff, can I ask you a question?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:18.000\nOnly on one condition, Dan. This is a fucking chain zinger.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:22.000\nYou can ask me multiple questions. You can ask me as many questions as you want.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:34.000\nDoes it get lonely being so old?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nHow old?\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nAren't you as old as the universe, almost?\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:42.000\nYou're younger than you are.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:47.000\nBut you're not hydrogen?\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:51.000\nNo, I'm not hydrogen.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nI'm a mixture of different atoms.\n\n23:54.000 --> 24:00.000\nMostly water, right?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:06.000\nI believe a certain high percentage of what makes up a human body is water.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:15.000\nThat would explain your slight negative charge.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:30.000\nIt doesn't work. It doesn't fucking work.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nWait, water is negatively charged?\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:36.000\nIt has a slight negative charge. It's responsible for all life on the earth.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.000\nIt's responsible for the capillary motion of water.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:44.000\nOh, I'm sorry. Chain zinging. I didn't know I'd get it.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nI'm going to sit down.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nOkay, thank you, Ben.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:53.000\nBen, get the fuck out of here.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:59.000\nAnyways, my wife told me I had the musical taste of a gay drug dealer was the point.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nSee, that's just a zing. Why bring the chain into it?\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:08.000\nI made a huge mistake when I did that. Believe me.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nWhy walk me down a primrose path?\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:15.000\nI felt like Erin would yell at me later if I characterized her as just coming down\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:18.000\nand saying, you sound like a gay drug dealer listening to this music\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:23.000\nbecause the truth is she was more creative about it.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:26.000\nSo I wanted to acknowledge that out of fairness,\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:31.000\nbut you got very distracted, like a Jack Russell terrier staring at a socket\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nthat you think a bug went into.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nLike an English bulldog got distracted.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nOkay.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:43.000\nWhy does a witticism have to make me go through a bunch of fucking weird hoops?\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:48.000\nNothing has to do anything. You're reverse hitlering.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:57.000\nNo, I'm hitlering. Reverse hitlering is a chain zinger.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nWhat were you listening to?\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nWhat?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nShe called you that.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nLCD sound system.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:07.000\nAlright, now I'm on her side.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nWhich she probably introduced me to.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:14.000\nI was listening to a Pandora station based on LCD sound system.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nSo there was, at the time, I guess,\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:19.000\nwait, you know what? That's a compliment gay drug dealer for music.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:22.000\nI mean, like, what are those guys?\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:26.000\nIt's not like you get into your gay drug dealers car and Willie Nelson's on the radio.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:28.000\nOh, Willie Nelson's great.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:33.000\nIf I have to hear a stranger's music, I hope it's a gay drug dealer.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:34.000\nThat'll be good music.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nThat's that in clothes too, right?\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:39.000\nLike, you'd want to dress like a gay drug dealer too, I assume.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:42.000\nIf you want to be like, oh, caron.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nAlright.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nI mean, they're gay and they deal drugs.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nThey're on the bleeding edge of society.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.000\nThe bleeding edge?\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nYeah.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:53.000\nYeah, the bloody, bloody edge.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nYou, you, okay.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:57.000\nHey, listen, can I ask you a question?\n\n26:57.000 --> 27:01.000\nDan, you get to ask me as many questions in a row as you want.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:07.000\nWere you like, were you really hurt?\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nWere your feelings hurt?\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nJust, just recently?\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:17.000\nYeah, well, specifically when Bruce Wayne hurt them.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:25.000\nWell, when he came to your, your research facility at Wayne Industries\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:31.000\nand he rejected your inventions.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nDan, can I, can I be honest with you?\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.000\nYeah.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:41.000\nMaybe in the history of my whole life.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:45.000\nI don't think it's ever been a time when I have been more hurt\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:54.000\nwhen, while I was making Wayne Industries inventions\n\n27:54.000 --> 28:00.000\nwhen Bruce Wayne himself came in and he wasn't fucking digging it.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nSo, so you...\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nI was fucking mortified.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:08.000\nI was almost suicidally hurt when he came in and said, boo,\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nI don't dig it, I don't like it.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:15.000\nAnd that's when you became the Riddler, right?\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:19.000\nOh shit, you're right.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nI never put those two together.\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:27.000\nI, I knew that, I knew that one day I started becoming a super villain\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:30.000\nand asked questions instead of giving answers.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nYou, that's why you're always questioning me.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nRight?\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:36.000\nYou ruined my chainzinger.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.000\nDan, here's a riddle for you.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:42.000\nRiddle me this, is it hard to ruin a chainzinger?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nWell, no, it's not.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nYou could, you could, it's not hard.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:47.000\nYeah.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nAll you have to do is to...\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nIt's not a magic trick.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:52.000\nIf you do jumping jacks during it, you can ruin it.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nIf you interrupt it, you can ruin it.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:58.000\nSo, I'm not allowed to really love chainzingers as a premise or a concept.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nWhat do you mean, love them?\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nYou're not allowed to, you're not allowed to ruin them.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nDo you love chainzingers?\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nI mean, you're allowed to do whatever you want.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nDo you love chainzingers?\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nI love chainzingers.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:14.000\nYou, my friend, have been chainzing'd.\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:17.000\nNo, you haven't, it doesn't exist, it's not a thing.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nAll right, well, let's bring out...\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:24.000\nNo, no one comes out, we're going to fucking finish this.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nCome on, you're going to want this guy to come out.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:27.000\nWho?\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nHe's an old friend, we haven't seen him for a couple weeks.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:30.000\nCurtis Armstrong's back.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nOh, no, shit!\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:49.000\nCurtis Armstrong!\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:50.000\nHowdy!\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nHello, Curtis.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:52.000\nHowdy!\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:56.000\nMy god, it's so festive here.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nYeah, happy Easter.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nThank you so much.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nI wasn't even going to celebrate.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:03.000\nAnd now, I feel like I have to.\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:04.000\nYeah, so...\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nWere you raised religiously?\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nI was raised religious...\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nI was raised Catholic, yeah.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:13.000\nOh, okay, so Easter's a pretty heavy duty to get up for the Sunrise Mass.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:14.000\nIt was a big deal.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:15.000\nThe whole deal.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nThe whole deal.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nSo would you...\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:20.000\nMy wife couldn't remember, because she was the daughter of a pastor it was.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nShe still is, but...\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:25.000\nShe mentioned the Sunrise Mass thing.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:28.000\nBut then also all the Easter hiding and stuff like that.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nShe couldn't remember what order they did them in.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nOh, well, I mean, you know, I mean, if you're...\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:36.000\nI mean, we did everything, because we were just, you know...\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:41.000\nI mean, we were Catholic and we did the whole services and all that.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:44.000\nBut the Easter eggs were just as big a part of it.\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:50.000\nBut there are a lot of people that I know who were raised where that's like devil's work is doing the Easter egg hunt.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nBecause it has nothing to do with...\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nOh, well, that's kind of admirable.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nI mean, from the Christian perspective.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nI mean, you know what?\n\n30:56.000 --> 31:02.000\nIf you go for the religious part of it, you might as well go the whole way and say that Easter eggs are...\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:03.000\nYeah.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nI get aggravated by those things.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:09.000\nTechnically, of course, it all comes from the Pagans anyway.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nRight.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:14.000\nLike the right-wing people who talk about the war on Christmas because we want to make it politically correct.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nExactly.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nBut they won't give up their Santa Claus.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:22.000\nThey really need their Christmas tradition, but their Christmas tradition is based on a bunch of different shit.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.000\nExactly.\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:26.000\nThey think they're living in their little 20-year period.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nNothing's allowed to change during that time.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nExactly.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nIt's like a big chain-zinger.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:36.000\nI missed the chain-zinger part.\n\n31:36.000 --> 31:39.000\nI came in at the very end of the chain-zinger part.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nIs there anything I need to know?\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nNothing at all.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nOkay.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:44.000\nAll right.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:45.000\nYeah.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\nI mean, you know, it's weird.\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:49.000\nYou're so mad about chain-zingers.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:55.000\nHe said Mr. Kettle to Admiral Pott.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nYou're mad about chain-zingers.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:02.000\nI'm overjoyed with them.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:09.000\nJeff's in his cups, as Chevy Chase used to say about himself on his voicemails.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nI think I'm delightfully Easter drunk.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:14.000\nI think, yes, there's no negative things.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nI'm just warning Curtis that you're like a loaded gun.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:18.000\nIt's a little different.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:20.000\nHe looks a little different this week.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nHe does.\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:25.000\nHe has a glow or a sheen.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\nIt's a sheen.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nIt's a sheen.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nIt's a sheen.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:29.000\nIt's definitely a sheen.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:32.000\nIt's an airy sort of sheen.\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:36.000\nThat sort of disabye, as our friends the French would say.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nI don't know that word.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:43.000\nYou know, a little ruffled, a little bit, you know, just got out of bed.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:44.000\nLook.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:47.000\nI put this together, Curtis.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nThis represents a lot of work.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nI thought it was an accident.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:58.000\nNo, I'm fucking high as a Georgia pine right now.\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.000\nThose are high.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:00.000\nGeorgia pines are high.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:04.000\nDan, can I ask you a question?\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:07.000\nYeah.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:10.000\nI would try to fucking chain-thing you.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nI don't know how to do it still.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nWell, yeah, they're hard.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nThey're not easy.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:17.000\nWe wouldn't do a podcast about breathing, like everyone knows how to do that.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nYou do a podcast about macrame.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nThat's hard.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:27.000\nI'm not leaving this building until you've done a successful chain-thinger.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.000\nI would have to sit here in silence, like thinking.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:35.000\nLike it's not, you know, it's not, it's not, it wouldn't be a cool thing to do.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nAnd the payoff wouldn't be that great.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:40.000\nLike just to chain-thingers are, you got to let, just forget about them.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nI want you to forget about them.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:47.000\nThere's no, there's no joy to come from, from you knowing about them.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nI want you to turn away.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nDeal.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nAll right.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.000\nWell, it could also be sort of a long-running thing, couldn't it?\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:58.000\nI mean, you know, technically he could think about it in like in two weeks.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:02.000\nIt could come up and then it's like a callback to the chain-thingers.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:03.000\nYeah.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nHe could, he could do like a, like a macro chain.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nYeah.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nLet me see what's on my little, my little notepad.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nWhat do you have scheduled?\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nOkay.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nLet's see.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nGay drug dealer.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nLast Nights with Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nYou guys see that?\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:21.000\nIt's like Game of Thrones fan fiction kind of movie.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nIt's Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen running around.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:24.000\nNo.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:25.000\nSwords.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:26.000\nNo.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:27.000\nThat's fine.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:31.000\nIt's called Last Nights, which sounds like, it's like, you know, date movie or something,\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nbut it's a-\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:33.000\nCurtis.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:34.000\nSir.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou were away for a while.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.000\nWhere did you go?\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:45.000\nI went to, I went to Las Vegas and I went to Seattle, Washington.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.000\nWere you there?\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nYou followed me back, didn't you?\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:53.000\nYeah.\n\n34:53.000 --> 35:00.000\nWe went to, I went to a Comic Con in Seattle and I went to a supernatural thing in Las Vegas.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.000\nAwesome.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nWhat was the supernatural thing?\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nThey do these supernatural things.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.000\nI know supernatural is a show I do.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:08.000\nIt's one of the other shows I do.\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:09.000\nWait, I don't know.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nIt's one I do when I'm not here.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI do another show called Supernatural.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:14.000\nI've heard of that show.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nI didn't know you were on it.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nYou're on it as an actor?\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:19.000\nI've been on it as an actor for about three years.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:20.000\nAre you a-\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nOn and off.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:22.000\nAre you a werewolf or a vampire?\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.000\nI'm not.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:27.000\nI am the evilest creature ever.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:30.000\nI'm an evil, evil, evil creature.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nGo Mettitron!\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:33.000\nYes!\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nHe knows-\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nWhat's the-\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:36.000\nIt's Mettitron.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:37.000\nHe's a biblical character, actually.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:38.000\nI'm playing a biblical-\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nIt's actually appropriate.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nIt's Easter.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:49.000\nAnd I play a biblical character named Mettitron, who is or was the scribe of God.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:56.000\nMettitron, for those of you who don't know, Mettitron was the one who wrote out the Ten Commandments.\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nWhoa.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nUh-huh.\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nUh-huh.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:00.000\nWait, so there was another guy?\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:01.000\nThere was another guy.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:06.000\nI mean, basically on the movies, I always thought there was a fire that came from the bush into the tablet.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.000\nNo.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nHis voice was the voice from the burning bush.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nThat was Mettitron, not God.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nOh, this is like a-\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:18.000\nMettitron was the guy who did everything for God.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nHe did everything that God-\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nThis is according to what mythology?\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:25.000\nAccording to, well, questionable mythology.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.000\nBut he does exist, historically.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nIs that in the Bible?\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nIs Mettitron's name mentioned?\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nYeah, it's kind of the Bible.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nIs Mettitron's name mentioned in the Bible?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:36.000\nThe Bible?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nNo, not in the- I don't think it is.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:46.000\nI think it's actually mentioned in, like, ancient Hebrew texts that are sort of questionable.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nBut that's who he is.\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nBut everybody assumes-\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nSo God didn't give us straight to Moses.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nIt went through Mettitron?\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:53.000\nIt went through Mettitron.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:54.000\nAnd you play Mettitron?\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nThank you.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nYes, I do.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nIt's the role you were born to play?\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nIt is the role I was born to play.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nIt's one of the most important roles of my career.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:05.000\nHuh.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:10.000\nI mean, you know, if you think about it in terms of, you know, there's, you know, like,\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:14.000\nthere's Booger and there's Charles DeMar and then there's the scribe of God.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nRight, right, right.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nYou know?\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:17.000\nIn terms of function, yeah, yeah.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:20.000\nYou're assisting John Kuzak and then you're going to assist him.\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:21.000\nAnd then you're going to God.\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nYeah.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nI mean, that's a big deal.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:24.000\nSo that's who he is.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:31.000\nAnd God would, he would transcribe what God wanted said to the Israelites and he would\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nwrite it down or speak it.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nWell, that's what I do.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.000\nWhy is that?\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:36.000\nThat's not who he is.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nWhy is that not canonical in the Bible?\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:42.000\nI mean, all the cool stuff is sort of questionable.\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:45.000\nIt's the, what do you call it?\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nIt's the apocrypha.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:51.000\nThat's what it's called, the apocrypha, which is it's supposedly part of it, but it was\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:55.000\nsort of taken out by people because it was considered a little funny.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nApocryphal.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nYeah.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nYeah.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nThe apocrypha.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nIs that right?\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nYeah.\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:02.000\nThank you.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nSee, they all know.\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nYeah.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nBut that was not who Metatron was.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nMy Metatron, the Metatron I play is the scribe of God.\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:16.000\nBecause Metatron hated Optimus Prime, right?\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nThat was in my bio.\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nThe bio I wrote for Metatron.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nThat's a callback.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:26.000\nI forgot to bring this up last week, and I don't know what to do about it yet, but I\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\ndid want to remind myself to bring it up.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nBooks for prisoners.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nAll right.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:36.000\nSo I saw these guys tweeting about it.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nIt was out of Seattle, actually.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:39.000\nThe organization is out of Seattle.\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:45.000\nSo did you say hi to them?\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:48.000\nNow I can't remember their Twitter handle or whatever, but I got to figure out how to\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:53.000\ncoordinate something with them because they tweeted at me because what they do is they\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:58.000\ntry to get books to prisoners, which is already a very worthwhile goal.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:04.000\nI mean, as fucked up as our prison system is, as you know, we have the largest prison\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:10.000\npopulation in the world, and we definitely do not rehabilitate them very much.\n\n39:10.000 --> 39:11.000\nWe could definitely do to do that.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:16.000\nAnd the idea that there's a shortage of books that these people are inside prison, that\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:21.000\nthey're asking for books while they're in there, they should be flooded with them.\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:24.000\nBecause books cost nothing because of the internet.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:30.000\nAnd also, I think these guys, if they're sitting there going, hey, sorry, I murdered that person.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:33.000\nI would like to start reading while I'm in here.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:37.000\nThey shouldn't be empty-handed.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nI don't know how much we can do about that.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:43.000\nIt does seem like a really focused, worthwhile cause in general.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:46.000\nI'll put some elbow grease into it and try to help.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:53.000\nBut I wanted to mention it to our viewers and listeners because they specifically tweeted\n\n39:53.000 --> 40:02.000\nat me about D&D books because a certain percentage of their prisoners that seek them out are asking\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nfor D&D books.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nAnd they can't get ahold of those either.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:11.000\nI mean, and it's like, my God, not only are they asking for books, they're asking for\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:17.000\nbooks that would open them up to creativity, to the assembly of their own mythology, to\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:22.000\nmaking shit right in a way that doesn't involve stabbing real people and stuff.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:26.000\nYou're talking about state and federal prisons?\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:28.000\nPeople are looking for books?\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nYeah, I don't know all the details about it.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:36.000\nI just know this charity is in Seattle and I know that they just have this mass shortage\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:43.000\nof old D&D books, which it seems like this audience would have a surplus of.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:50.000\nIt seems like if we found out there's a charity out there, people that don't have enough McDonald's\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nwrappers.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:58.000\nI'm not saying we're fat, I just mean, for us it's kind of like, we got a lot of old D&D\n\n40:58.000 --> 40:59.000\nbooks, I think.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:05.000\nSo I don't know if we can have a drive or something like that at some point and like\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:06.000\nship them like crates.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:14.000\nCan we ship one prison, not trying to be silly, can we pick one prison where we send all of\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:19.000\nthose books to and the whole prison just starts playing D&D?\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:21.000\nIt's like adopt a prison.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nIt would be like the signs on the freeway.\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:30.000\nWe have to go out and find who the dungeon master of that prison would be and that prison\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:35.000\nstarts getting really into fucking Pathfinder or D&D.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:40.000\nIt would be amazing to adopt a prison of one podcast, adopt one prison, it just starts\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:41.000\nfucking around.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:45.000\nKind of like, okay, now we're going to change wardens this week.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:50.000\nAnd we just have our favorite prisoners come on the thing, like their whole prison system\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:56.000\nbecomes corrupted because it's based on podcast listenership and stuff.\n\n41:56.000 --> 42:04.000\nDan, Curtis, you don't know this, but very early on a long time ago, Dan and I, I think\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:09.000\nit was before we started recording this, we said, Dan said, let's get together, let's\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:12.000\nuse Harmontown to find a dungeon master.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:21.000\nEvery week we'll use it like, like, what was, like, the fucking, so drunk.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:26.000\nThe show is like the voice or whatever.\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:29.000\nWe'll use our show to find the best dungeon master.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nThe first week we found our friend Spencer.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:32.000\nRight.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.000\nWho I know.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nAnd then we never looked any further beyond that.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:43.000\nWhy don't we find a prison and give them all of our D&D books and then turn one prison\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:46.000\ninto a giant D&D campaign?\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:48.000\nIs it possible?\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nYes, I don't know.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nI think we'll start with...\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:59.000\nCould we get, like, could we get one prison to be really into storytelling and into fantasy\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:04.000\nand maybe save the world and bring them on the show?\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:08.000\nOr we do a Harmontown, we do a Harmontown from that prison, like Johnny Cash?\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:09.000\nYeah.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:14.000\nI want to do, each week we have, like, a guest, an inmate from the prison who's, like, a year\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:18.000\nfrom parole and they're, like, they're eligible for early parole.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nAnd we kind of, like, we give them a thumbs up, thumbs down.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:21.000\nA trustee.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:22.000\nYeah.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.000\nWe get a trustee.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:24.000\nYeah.\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:25.000\nThat's fantastic.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:26.000\nI love this idea.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nLike, we picked their brain about what they did to go in.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nAnd then we're like, what do you think, guys?\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:34.000\nYou sound sorry to me.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nAnd then we just let them go.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nI was like, guess what?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nYou're not going home.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:41.000\nHere's a tie instead of a handcuffs.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:46.000\nI would love to go to an actual prison and actually do a D&D campaign there and play\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:49.000\nwith them there, like, come what may.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:54.000\nAnd maybe that positively would affect their parole hearing.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:59.000\nLike, the guy was so good at committing to his elf character.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:00.000\nYeah.\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:02.000\nI mean, I imagine if you, yeah.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:06.000\nI'm sure if your average parole board overheard a game of Dungeons & Dragons, they'd be very\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:10.000\nimpressed and want you out in the public immediately.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:15.000\nSpeaking of, let's bring Spencer out.\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nSpencer?\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nYay!\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:21.000\nSpencer Crittenden and everybody.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:22.000\nSorry, everybody.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:34.000\nThat took me a while.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:37.000\nDid I miss a high five opportunity there?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:41.000\nIt's easy because you're going that way and I'm over here.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nYeah.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nSpencer, your high fives are built in.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:46.000\nOh, okay.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nYeah, good to know.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:51.000\nWell, it's just because you had a pen in your hand.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:55.000\nAre those flowers blocking anyone from seeing your beautiful face?\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nDoug's fine.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:59.000\nI think we should strike those as they say in the theater.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nPerfect.\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nNo, I can't see Spencer.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nAll right.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nYeah, just put them down there.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nPut them in front of Dan.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nWhat's up, you guys?\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:13.000\nSpencer, could you picture yourself going to like San Quentin or Falsum Prison, like\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:18.000\nJohnny Cash, and doing a giant game mastering session?\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:22.000\nBack there, I was just imagining, you know, walking into like just the big prison and\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:28.000\nthen there's like a prison, Spencer, who's like, you know, he has his lair or whatever,\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:33.000\nhe has it all figured out and he's like, he'd be the dungeon master of the prison and,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:37.000\nyou know, we'd meet up and we'd have a whole day of it and we'd learn we were really alike\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:42.000\nand, you know, maybe we'd even like trade places and he'd go to my house and my job\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:46.000\nand stuff and kill animals and, you know.\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.000\nBecause that's what you do.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nNo, because he's a prisoner.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nOh.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:55.000\nAnd all prisoners and murder animals.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:58.000\nWhat would you do in his place in a federal prison?\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:01.000\nI'd frolic.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:06.000\nNo, I don't know, it'd probably be much less entertaining for me, I'd imagine.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:10.000\nOh, it's books to prisoners at B number two P Seattle.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:13.000\nB two P Seattle is their Twitter handle.\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:14.000\nB two P.\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:17.000\nOh, I'm going to continue to, they were sending me information.\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nThey have these letters that they tend to get.\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nThey sent me a picture of one of them.\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:25.000\nI don't think I can read that because of all the swastikas.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nJust kidding.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:29.000\nPrison humor.\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:32.000\nWhatever they had to do in there to survive, that's what you had to do.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:35.000\nNow I'm going to turn my back on you.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nYeah, no.\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:41.000\nI don't know if that would really be, that would probably be really offensive to people whose charity is like,\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:46.000\nthey put all this work into like furnishing these people and then you just like kind of do this swastika joke.\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:51.000\nIt's just like every prisoner movie you see, if you're a white guy in prison, you have to be a Nazi.\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:55.000\nDo you think Dan, like in the Harmon tour, the thing that we did a couple years ago,\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:59.000\nwe went around the country and proved that Harmontown audiences are,\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nthey resemble each other.\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nThey're a lot like you guys here.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:07.000\nDo you think that we could go do a show in a prison and people would dig it?\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:08.000\nI don't know.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:13.000\nI kind of like, I kind of wake up called because I'm trying to use Lyft instead of Uber now,\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:20.000\njust because I feel like the, I just, I haven't met a woman in Los Angeles that doesn't have a story that starts with,\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nI call it an Uber.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:26.000\nIf they're writing by themselves, it's just, it's not a hand and I feel like, like Uber is not that bad for me,\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:30.000\nbut it just feels like, now I feel dirty, like taking, taking Uber.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:35.000\nSo I took, took a lift and it made me feel better because like, I don't know, the guy was like,\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:39.000\ndefinitely probably would have treated my wife with respect if he picked her up.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:42.000\nBut then again, he had his own podcast and was just talking about that.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:46.000\nAnd I was like, take me back to the, take me back to the Uber.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:50.000\nI told Lyft, I told him,\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:55.000\nI talked to Mr. Lyft, I told him, you need to put a switch or if you flip the switch,\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nthe driver doesn't fucking talk to you.\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:58.000\nIt'd be so easy.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nI think that's called getting in the backseat maybe.\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nNo, well, that's what they, they, they, that's a new thing.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nThey didn't use to have that.\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nThey just always, you'd sit in the front and then you'd talk.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:11.000\nAnd then so many people were like, I don't want to do this, that they, they invented this backseat.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nYou could program a switch.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:13.000\nIt'd be so easy.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:14.000\nEveryone, it'd be done.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:15.000\nThat's a, that's a good idea.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:19.000\nLike a little switch, like I'm not, I'm not feeling in the mood for conversation.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:23.000\nWhat kind of pressure would that put them in the, if, if, if you were like, then you're\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\ndeliberately not hitting that switch.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nAnd then they're like, now I gotta talk to this fucker.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:33.000\nUm, then it's like those, those, those barber conversations where like 10 minutes into the\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:37.000\nhaircut, they're like, so how's your day?\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nThey, they, they hate you.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\nThis is astonishing.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:45.000\nI just took a Lyft just last week and it was the same guy.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nHe, I swear to God.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:48.000\nWith the podcast?\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nNo way to the airport.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:52.000\nHe interviewed me.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.000\nAnd I mean, it was, it was one of those.\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:55.000\nIt wasn't this guy.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:58.000\nIt wasn't, I got a business card.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:04.000\nHe told me to give this to you and I'm not kidding.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nNo, it's all right.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nI probably know it's a good podcast, but.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:09.000\nYeah.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:10.000\nYeah.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:13.000\nNo, this was exactly the same thing.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:17.000\nI think it's, it's, you know, and this, you know, the questions went, you know, from,\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nyou know, subject to subject.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:25.000\nAnd the fewer ants words I responded, the more he would ask questions.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:29.000\nSo it was not like he was getting the fact that I didn't want to talk.\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nIt was like a cue to ask more questions.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:36.000\nWell, they tell, like they hire the drivers based on conversational skills and they do\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:39.000\nexpect them to talk to you consistently the whole right.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:42.000\nIt's, it's part of what like they're, you know, their business.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:43.000\nThat's not true really.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:44.000\nIs it?\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:45.000\nNo, it is.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:48.000\nOne of their selling points is they have these conversationalist drivers.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:49.000\nYeah.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nThat's, that's part of their marketing.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:55.000\nI thought I was just, I was just lucky that I got one just like yours.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nThey're quite pleasant.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nHow do you think they vet for that?\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nDo you think they take them on test drives?\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:03.000\nWell, they do a lot more work than Uber does to vet their employees.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nI'll tell you that.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nSure seems that way.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nYeah.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:07.000\nCause they do.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:10.000\nThey make sure that they're people that are like social and can sit and talk and not\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nmake people feel weird, I think.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:15.000\nSo the reason I brought that up is because Jeff asked, do we think we could do a show\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:16.000\nfor a prison?\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:20.000\nAnd I was like, I think, I think yesterday I would have been like, yeah, man.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:23.000\nCause I'm like egalitarian, like, like awesomeness.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:27.000\nBut my lift ride over here, I was like, eh, you know what?\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nI don't like most people.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:33.000\nEven the ones that like me, even the ones that have podcasts, even the ones I just,\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:34.000\nI don't like you.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:35.000\nI don't like you.\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nYou're laughing too much at the hustler billboard.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:38.000\nI judge you.\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:39.000\nI don't, I hate you.\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nI don't, the guy was like, he saw the hustler billboard.\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nAnd it had, I think like a joke on it.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:44.000\nIt's like a cucumber.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:49.000\nAnd it said stop, stop violence against vegetables, shop at hustler.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nAnd the guy, this is, I'm not exaggerating.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:54.000\nThis is, this is, this is, this was the guy's response.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:55.000\nHe's like driving.\n\n50:55.000 --> 51:01.000\nAnd he was like, oh, oh, oh, shit.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:05.000\nOh, fuck that billboard.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:12.000\nOh, stop violence against, he read it to me.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:15.000\nAnd I was like, let's shop at a, oh, shit.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:25.000\nOh, oh, like, I was like, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:29.000\nI tried trying to like scrape my laugh gland.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:35.000\nI get it.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nStick something else in your pussy.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nI get it.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nDon't, don't put a cucumber in your pussy.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.000\nI got it.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nCucumber wants you to use something else.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:44.000\nMaybe a dildo from hustler.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:45.000\nGot it.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:51.000\nI just got that.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nMe too.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nMe too.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:58.000\nYou have been changing.\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:03.000\nI hadn't gotten that.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:06.000\nWe should bring up my wife.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:12.000\nErin McGathy.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:21.000\nOh, it's Hoppy Town.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nOh, Hoppy Town.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:35.000\nIt was me the whole time.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nSo we, oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:40.000\nJeff, do you get nervous?\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nDo you get nervous when you walk across grass?\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:45.000\nAm I about to be changing?\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:48.000\nJust do you get nervous walking across grass?\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nGenerally no.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:50.000\nI like walking across grass.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:54.000\nYou're not worried you're going to disappear?\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nJust walking across fields?\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nYeah, because the color, I would think that you'd be afraid\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nthat you would just disappear in the grass.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.000\nBecause of walking on green grass.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:06.000\nLet me ask you something else.\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:10.000\nDo you have any new news from your cardiologist?\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:15.000\nI've never seen a cardiologist.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:19.000\nI mean, you should because I heard it's really small.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nNo, your heart.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:24.000\nAren't you a grinch who hates all joyful things,\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:27.000\nincluding chain-singers?\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:32.000\n9-Eleven!\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:38.000\nThat's the response we want to cultivate.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:39.000\nIt's 9-Eleven.\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nIs that the chain-sing?\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nBecause I hear the thing.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:44.000\nNow it's 9-12.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:45.000\nIt's not a zing.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nWhy is that a zing?\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nI see the chain part of that.\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nIt's a jovial thing.\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:56.000\nEarlier, Dan was listening to the band Sleigh Bells remixed.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nSleigh Bells is a band I like.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nAnd the song I even liked.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:04.000\nAnd I do not hate gay drug dealers at all.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:05.000\nBut it's a jovial thing.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nIt's a fun thing.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nSo walking across grass means I hate all jovial things?\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:12.000\nNo, because the grinch is green!\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nThat doesn't fucking scan.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:15.000\nIt's not a fucking thing.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nMaybe it's not for you.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nIt's not a chain-singer at the end.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:20.000\nYou go, kaboom!\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:24.000\nAlso, I feel like a zinger should actually just zing on the first fucking try.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:25.000\nIt doesn't need to be a chain.\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:28.000\nBut well, it's our thing.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nIt's so fun.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:32.000\nI want to hear actual proof of it.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:38.000\nOkay, you guys keep chain-singing each other and leave me the fuck out of it.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:43.000\nI feel like gay drug dealers would be most dangerous.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nI know, of course they are.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:49.000\nThey have the efficiency of that whole gay aesthetic way of life.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:56.000\nAnd they're applying that to a very dangerous profession where image is very important.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:59.000\nAnd thinking or saying the wrong thing could mean death.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:06.000\nYeah, I think you're doubling down on your environmental risk groups, too, for sociopathology.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:10.000\nThere's a kid from the Midwest who came out and his parents didn't accept him.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:16.000\nIf that's why he started drug dealing or whatever makes you a drug dealer or whatever.\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:21.000\nIt could be the nicest kid in the world, but also, if you got stabbed by a gay drug dealer,\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:28.000\non the eighth stab you'd be like, well, I guess.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:34.000\nI don't know if he was more likely to stab me than a straight drug dealer or a regular gay man.\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:39.000\nBut I know I shouldn't have gotten in this car.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nWith Campbell.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:46.000\nI was driven by an Uber driver once who told me that he was narcoleptic.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:52.000\nAnd that he can't walk up stairs without falling down the stairs.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:56.000\nAnd I still don't understand what he meant, but he's like, oh, you know stairs, I can't have.\n\n55:56.000 --> 56:00.000\nHe said, your house, your house, so many stairs.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:01.000\nI can't have that.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:05.000\nYeah, and you kept telling him to go to a doctor and he was like, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:08.000\nNo, no, no, this is my quirk, this is my quirk.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:09.000\nIt's not as bad.\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nCurtis, do you like music?\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nDo I like music?\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:14.000\nMusic, I love music.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:15.000\nDon't fuck.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:18.000\nYou're about to be changing, motherfucker.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:19.000\nWatch out.\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:22.000\nI'm open to it, actually.\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:24.000\nHere's my problem with changing.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:27.000\nIt's because just seeing somebody, just say it in fucking one go.\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nWhy walk me down the road?\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:32.000\nCurtis, do people ever get frustrated by the noise?\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:33.000\nOf my music?\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:39.000\nNo, just the noise of your body when you enter a room.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nIs it going to pay off so big?\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nIs it going to be a fucking pay off?\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:44.000\nSometimes.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:45.000\nGreat showmanship, Jeff.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.000\nYour rapper.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:47.000\nYour rapper.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:51.000\nYou fucking show me how this is showmanship, what you're about to do, the fucking...\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.000\nJeff?\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:53.000\nYes.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:57.000\nI'm talking to her.\n\n56:57.000 --> 57:04.000\nTina, Curtis, what you just did is a singer and that actually works done one fucking pass.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:08.000\nThat's what makes this a chain singer.\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:11.000\nBut I mean by your rapper.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:12.000\nBy my rapper.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:16.000\nI mean, because you're so sweet, you must be made out of candy.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.000\nA chain snuggle.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:22.000\nNot a singer and just took long to say something nice.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:23.000\nThat was great.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:26.000\nJust say you're sweet.\n\n57:26.000 --> 57:29.000\nWait, what's Jeff's problem with chain singers?\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:30.000\nIt's fucking stupid.\n\n57:30.000 --> 57:32.000\nIt's fucking worthless and stupid.\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:33.000\nIt's really dumb.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:34.000\nWhy though?\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nAre you about to chain sing me?\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:41.000\nNo.\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:47.000\nBecause dragging out a bad singer over fucking 17 sentences is not as good as just saying\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:50.000\nsomething funny.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\nSee, that's a singer.\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:54.000\nAnd that's why that's funny.\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:56.000\nIt's funny to go.\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:57.000\nThat's right, sister.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:58.000\nThat's funny.\n\n57:58.000 --> 57:59.000\nIt's a loving, it's a loving thing.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:00.000\nCan I ask you why?\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:01.000\nThat's stupid.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nI still want to hear why Jeff doesn't like them.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:04.000\nI feel like...\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:06.000\nBecause I have yet to be entertained by one.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:07.000\nOkay.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:08.000\nWell, they're not...\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:09.000\nChasing me.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:10.000\nChasing me, Spencer.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:12.000\nOr changing anybody in the building.\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:13.000\nOkay.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nAnd make it worth my fucking money.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nIt's not going to happen.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:18.000\nIt's not going to happen.\n\n58:18.000 --> 58:22.000\nThe problem with chain singers is you've got to start by working backwards and then you've got to...\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:25.000\nGoing down the fucking payoff, which is just say something witty.\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nJust say something witty.\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nWell, yeah, that's the whole thing is that you're delaying the payoff.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:30.000\nRight.\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:32.000\nAnd then the payoff is really not worth all the fucking stretch.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:38.000\nIt's another way of saying I love you because it's never a mean thing that's said.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:44.000\nI feel like it was pretty mean when you said he had the music taste of a gay drug dealer\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nthat seems mean, that doesn't seem loving.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:50.000\nBut that's a bit that Dan and I have with us is that...\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:51.000\nThat's not a changing.\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nNo, it was still a changing.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nBut I'm saying that it's not a mean thing.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:56.000\nYou know what a zing means, right?\n\n58:56.000 --> 58:57.000\nYou know what a zinger is.\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:58.000\nI feel like it is an insult.\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:00.000\nDo you know what a changing is?\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:02.000\nNo one knows what a fucking changing is.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:03.000\nIt's...\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:06.000\nYou don't fucking know.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:08.000\nI feel like...\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:14.000\nThis is the equivalent of you were mad at slip and slides for not being like subways.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:16.000\nJust put a token in it.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.000\nThen you'd show up.\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.000\nTake me to work.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:19.000\nTake me to work.\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:20.000\nWhy is my lawn wet?\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:22.000\nIf I want to go somewhere...\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:23.000\nIt's a fucking like...\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:28.000\nThe only thing funny about that, Dan, was you fixing your rabbit ears while you did that bit.\n\n59:28.000 --> 59:30.000\nThat's not the only thing.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:36.000\nBut we're not here to figure out what's wrong or what's right about anything that any of us are doing.\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:39.000\nJeff, do you remember a couple of Easter's ago when we all flew kites?\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:40.000\nIt was the best.\n\n59:40.000 --> 59:41.000\nIt was very fun.\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:42.000\nIt was great.\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:43.000\nThank you, Aaron.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:44.000\nThat's a nice thing to say.\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:45.000\nThe end.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:51.000\nWhat if Jeff just said the end after every sentence I ever uttered?\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:54.000\nWhat if I said the end and it actually was the end?\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:56.000\nThat'd be fucking paradise.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:58.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.000\nYou want to leave?\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nNo, he's saying he doesn't want me to say anything.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nChainsingers don't fucking work for me.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nThat's noted.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nBecause what doesn't happen in the Chainsinger is that there's no zinging at the end of the chain.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nWhat happens in your criticism of Chainsingers?\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nWhat's the payoff?\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000\nOnly the end of Chainsinging.\n\n01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nWell, that hasn't happened yet.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nSadly, no.\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nIn terms of the amount of verbiage that goes into something versus the amount of entertainment that comes out of it,\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nhow does Chainsinging compare to your criticism of it?\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nI think they completely cancel each other out.\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nNo, no, no, I'm miserable because of your totally needless hatred of something stupid.\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000\nAnd wait a minute, can I say something?\n\n01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nYes.\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nYou know what?\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nShe gave me a Chainsinger, which was really nice.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nRight.\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nIt was a compliment.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nAnd it was a compliment, and she said it with a smile, and then she gave me a hug.\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nAnd she could have gone on for half an hour, and I would have been fine with that.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nSee, I agree with that.\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nI'm an angel.\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nI'm an angel, buddy.\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nDan, you also know that my fake hatred of Chainsinging is only fake hatred.\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nI just don't quite understand.\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nI don't know about that.\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nIt's very convincing.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nThe King of the Nerds is over, right?\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nIt's over for another season.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nWhat's his name one?\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nWhat's his name one?\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nGod bless him.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nJonathan won.\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nDid we talk about our first male?\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nBut isn't that interesting, though, that this was the first male winner?\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nI can't remember if we talked about this, but is this the first season?\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nI'm sure this has happened on other reality shows, but this one began with the girls immediately making a macro alliance,\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nalmost exclusively across gender lines, excluding only two girls.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nAnd it was really effective, and they just squeezed the guys out of the toothpaste.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nAnd to a man, all of the guys were eliminated with absolutely no idea\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nthat this was going on.\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nThat's right.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nIt was like this biological phenomenon that just went,\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nand they just squeezed the testosterone, like popping a zit.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nPretty much.\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nBut the one guy that they led into that fucking alliance.\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nThey led in two.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nOh, was the other guy?\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nAnd the other guy, they wound up competing against each other at the end.\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nWhich was so biological.\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nIt was like those rhino beetles, you know?\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000\nTrying to throw each other off of a twig while these women watched.\n\n01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nBut I just think that's very interesting.\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nIt was the first season that I'd seen that happen where the girls did this really effective thing\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nthat almost threatened to kind of destroy the show.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nIt was so simple.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nI know.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nThat was the thing that I loved about it, was that these women got together,\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nand they wound up letting a couple of guys in.\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nBut before they let the guys in, the idea was cross-team alliance to keep men out.\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nBased on the very practical, simple solution,\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nwhich is that women built in, like they're in the women's bathroom together.\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nAnd they're like, they have that time together.\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nAnd no one is going to suspect anything is off kilter if all of them are gone for a half hour.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nAnd all come out at the same time.\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nBecause we don't know what goes on in there.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nIt's a super smart objective alliance technique because you can just say,\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nwell, it's just women because we're women, not because we don't like you or anything.\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nIf you did that with any other quality and your other attribute, genetically,\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nyou would be in big trouble.\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nAnd it's just the fairest skin.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nYeah, it's just the tall people.\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nThe short people got to go.\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nThat's all it is.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nBut mind you, as effective as it was as a strategy, two men wound up competing,\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nand one of them actually won.\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nSo there you are.\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nAnd it was the first male winner.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nAnd the one woman who was left out of the alliance was one of the final four.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nSo it really, it was a strange series of things.\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000\nBut I loved it.\n\n01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nI had a great time.\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nIt was a great season.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nWe really loved Colby.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nColby had a great.\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nSuch a fascinating archetype.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nHe was like, if a hack white writer wrote like a magical black reality show contestant.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nBecause he was there.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nThe reason he was a nerd is because he grew up in the streets and wanted to make his mom happy.\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000\nNow he's a math teacher.\n\n01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000\nAnd I knew all the students were watching.\n\n01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nEvery single thing he said, it was like, wait, did William Goldman write you?\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nI don't mean William Goldman's a hack.\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nI didn't mean that.\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nBut I mean, he wrote Goodwill Hunting and didn't even take credit.\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nColby was like, he had that mood shift.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nI don't know how much of this is editing, but he felt betrayed at one point.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nHe wrote him up, sacrificed him, and he never really recovered from that.\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nEmotionally, it looked like.\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nHe had an odd feeling with the rest of them.\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nHe wanted to be there, obviously, and he'd done what do you call it, Jeopardy.\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nHe'd won Jeopardy like three times or something.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000\nSo the guy has obviously had experience.\n\n01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nBut it's unusual when they get into that into Nerdvana.\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nIt does weird things to people.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nOne of the most outrageous things that had me clutching my fist and yelling at the TV\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000\nwas the moment when he came back.\n\n01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nThey had tried to kill him and failed.\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nSo now he comes back and there's always that weird thing in all reality shows.\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nLike, oh, you tried to slip my throat and your knives didn't work.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000\nSo let's play part cheesy.\n\n01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nBut I found it really culturally fascinating that here he is sitting there,\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000\na little dour, not totally willing to play Improv Star Wars with them.\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nMy read was that he was over it because there was kind of like a clicky group sex vibe a little bit.\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nYeah, there was that too.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAnd that's when they all started in with this thing that drove me a little crazy where they were like...\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nAlso, they were drinking and he wasn't.\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000\nThey started playing the Nerd card in order to try to...\n\n01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nThey're like, come on, we're all nerds, but betrayal is betrayal.\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000\nWe all know what it feels like to be picked on and kicked on.\n\n01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nYeah, but you less so right now at this particular age of March.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nAnd then they became the bullies on the bus when you were a kid that were like,\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nah, you've showered. Come on, man.\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nAnd then it's like the worst bullying.\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nI thought it was a really interesting family.\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nThe show continues to fascinate me because again, they're like, it's real nerds.\n\n01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nActually, the reality show shit is all the same,\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nbut it reveals more honest stuff than just like, oh, this Barbie doll broke in this way and this one broke in this way.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nIt's like, I like watching those dynamics.\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nThat heavy fellow that had the nervous breakdown was comparing himself to Razzal Ghoul.\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nUsing Razzal Ghoul as a mentor, he's like, look, here's the reason I'm acting this way,\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nbecause Razzal Ghoul would do this and that.\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000\nI'm like, well, that's okay. Batman hates him.\n\n01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nAnyways, you should watch it.\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nThey can watch it on Demand or something.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nYou can watch it on TBS on Demand or you can watch it on iTunes, I think.\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nAnd can we just check in about...\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nWe'll just bump it and glance off, but the topic of how Bobby's doing?\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nBobby Carradine was in a big car accident in Colorado the week of the last episode.\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nSo it was kind of distressing. He seems to be on the mend, however.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nWhich is absolutely a miracle.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nYou're given what that car looked like.\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nThank you.\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nWell, that's good. And his wife was in the car as well.\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nYeah, she was fine. Believe it or not. I mean, she walked away.\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nMan, there was nothing left of this car.\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nIf you see the picture of the car, there's nothing left of the car.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nWe're on the verge, in our lifetime, I think, unless actuarial tables are correct.\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nIn my lifetime, we will see self-driving cars.\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nWe will see a kind of Google grid of cars that take you...\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000\nI don't know that they won't have a steering wheel, but we're going to see this happening.\n\n01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nThe big question that Spencer and I have, we've been talking about it, is\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:36.000\nonce that starts happening and it has this incredible impact on the amount of car accidents that happen,\n\n01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nare they going to start making cars out of paper?\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nAre they going to be interested to watch human society decide,\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nwell, what about these 2017 safety standards that we keep jacking that up\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nand playing this game of insurance claims versus fatalities versus statistics versus traffic?\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nIf we were able to switch over to a system by which cars have gotten relatively few car accidents,\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nwould we immediately drop all that shit and then make cars really unsafe\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000\nso that the handful of times when a computer crashed a car,\n\n01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nit was this horrible human sacrifice on the altar of Skynet,\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nbut everyone just looked the other way.\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000\nThey're just like, well, we all got to go to work,\n\n01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nso our two paper cars crumbled into each other and it was just skull against skull.\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nI don't know, I wonder if they're going to do that\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:42.000\nor if they'll keep making cars out of these cages with these air balloons and stuff in a sophisticated way,\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nbecause it's very impressive what we've come to so far.\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nYes, it is.\n\n01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nYou know what? Poor taste for me to talk about it right now.\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000\nBut it was on my mind.\n\n01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nThank you for asking. No, he's doing well.\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nThat's fantastic.\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nAll right, so look, I mean, I think we didn't accomplish that much last week.\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000\nI think we might have only crossed the street last time.\n\n01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000\nWe got to get DeMorge up here.\n\n01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nDeMorge Brown!\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000\nCome on!\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000\nSo for the first time in a while, we have a full complement of our Shadowrun cast up here.\n\n01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nI love it.\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000\nFabulous, fantastic.\n\n01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000\nI was very excited last time, because remember Jen was here?\n\n01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nThe woman you called up for, is she here?\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000\nShe's not here tonight, but she was here last time.\n\n01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nAnd I finally got what I'm supposed to do.\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nOh, really?\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nJust from watching her.\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nYou're supposed to ask questions.\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000\nOh, really?\n\n01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000\nYeah, you can ask anything you want.\n\n01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nI know, I never thought about asking questions, until she said,\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000\ncan I do such and such?\n\n01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nAnd I went, oh my god, I should have been asking that.\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000\nSpencer loves that.\n\n01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nI know, I'm going to do it this time.\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000\nYeah, I love questions.\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000\nI watched last week's show, as it was happening.\n\n01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nI would kind of like to do my character, as Julia doing.\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000\nShe was interesting.\n\n01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nYeah, I saw her in line earlier, when I had my big mask on.\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000\nIs she here tonight?\n\n01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nShe is.\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000\nI'm not sure who, can you guys just check top and pass the rest down?\n\n01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nIt's always been that way.\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000\nJulia, how are you feeling?\n\n01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nYeah.\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nJulia, what are you on right now?\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000\nNope.\n\n01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nNope.\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000\nAll right.\n\n01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000\nAll right, Spencer, do we have a guest author of the recap?\n\n01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000\nYeah, but I can't remember who it is.\n\n01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000\nThere was someone on Reddit.\n\n01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000\nI'll get you back, Reddit guy.\n\n01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nShould we just give it a try?\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000\nAll right, Spencer, take it away from an anonymous recap author.\n\n01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nSorry, Reddit guy.\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nI'll say it was Frack.\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000\nLast time on Harmon Time Shadow Run.\n\n01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nMercy O'Donnell went into the burger tyrants.\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nAll right.\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000\nThat's it.\n\n01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nThat's how much ground we got there.\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000\nLet the punishment fit the crime because we didn't do shit.\n\n01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nShe had like a Carol Burnett laugh.\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nShe had a very delightful laugh.\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000\nCan you laugh?\n\n01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nCan you laugh?\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000\nLike that.\n\n01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000\nOh shit.\n\n01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000\nI enjoyed her.\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nShe was a delight.\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000\nShe was like a pine tree air freshener hanging from the roof\n\n01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nmirror of the stage.\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000\nShe was like a beautiful hot air balloon.\n\n01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000\nSpencer, she was going to meet, was it Anthony Spazuli?\n\n01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nArturo Spazuli.\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000\nArturo Spazuli.\n\n01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nSpaguli.\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000\nSpaguli, sorry.\n\n01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nMy writing is, wow.\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nSo we're meeting Arturo Spaguli.\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000\nYeah.\n\n01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000\nMercy is in there.\n\n01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nMercy is in there.\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nYou guys are outside actually.\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000\nJust kind of waiting, waiting for her.\n\n01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000\nI have a snack.\n\n01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000\nI don't know what I'm going to be doing.\n\n01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000\nI have made a mistake.\n\n01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nSomeone else do this.\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nSomeone else do this right now.\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nOkay.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000\nCome on.\n\n01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nCome on.\n\n01:13:51.000 -->

01:14:07.000\nI would like a hot dog wink.\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000\nCan I veto this?\n\n01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nYes.\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000\nYes.\n\n01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nOkay.\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nThat was my ode to Julia.\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000\nLet's get drunk after a girl.\n\n01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000\nAll right.\n\n01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nHi.\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000\nYou're standing in a burger tyrant.\n\n01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nRight.\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nAnd I'm looking for this guy's, I'm sorry.\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nThe plan was for you to go in and just lure this guy out using the oldest weapon in the\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nbusiness.\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nAll right.\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nOld Smith and Sexton.\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nHi.\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nHi.\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nHi, young man.\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000\nI know you hear this every day, but me and my girlfriend, it's my girlfriend's bachelorette.\n\n01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nOur stripper didn't show up and we would never ask you to strip.\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nBut a couple of the girls have a crush on you.\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nCould you just, could you just come out and take a picture with us quickly for a second?\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000\nArturo is, he's wearing a fine Italian suit and stuffing burgers in his face.\n\n01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000\nHe's holding a burger in each hand.\n\n01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nHis hands are full of burgers.\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nHe barely seems, you know, bothered by the words coming out of your mouth.\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000\nHe's like, no can do, honey.\n\n01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nSorry.\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nHe's like, um, um, um.\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000\nOkay.\n\n01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nUm, I'm going to use a con.\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000\nI think you already were.\n\n01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nAll right.\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nUm, how about negotiation?\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000\nOkay.\n\n01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nAll right.\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nHey, look, you come outside.\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000\nI'll give you a kiss on your balls.\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nOne single.\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000\nYou see, now, now we're playing shadow run.\n\n01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nSee, Julian, that's all you had to do.\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nThat was your crime was not doing that.\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nJust walk in, walk in and offer a ball kiss.\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nI'm a classy lady.\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nI just have this thing with kissing anonymous balls.\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000\nUm, just come outside and I'll just, I'll just give you a little kiss on the balls.\n\n01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nI'm kind of busy.\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nGive me, give me 20 minutes.\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nI'll be right out.\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nYeah, this guy's just like me.\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nYou said the process.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nWhat?\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:28.000\nHe's like, wait, when someone says, kiss your balls, you say, give me 20 minutes.\n\n01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nCan I, can I use perception to see like why, why the delay?\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nUh, what can I use perception to understand like why he doesn't want his balls kissed\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nimmediately?\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nUm, you see, you don't see a reason why he doesn't want his balls kicked.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nI'm, um, kissed.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nIs it possible that, uh, from a distance I might cast a spell?\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nIf you can, yeah, anyone you can see you could probably cast a spell at.\n\n01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000\nMight I enter the room?\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nI enter the room.\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000\nOkay.\n\n01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nYou enter the room and the, the guy, he drops his burgers and draws two pistols.\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000\nThe fry cooks each drop pistol and appointment.\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nYou guys are like, get the fuck out of here, boy.\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nSorry, that's rude.\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nWell, I'm sorry.\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nHard to get it.\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nHard to go to Swedish, right?\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nThere's black people in Sweden.\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nWell, that raises the question.\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nIs it hard to go black?\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nIt's a, I don't know.\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nIt's hard to go black.\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nAbsolutely not.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nThen it's fine.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nIt's all fine.\n\n01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000\nIt's all fine.\n\n01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nThe problem of being a boy is that I am tiny and short.\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nAnd I have certain possibilities that I might.\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nAnd I'll wait for the awkward conversation between Special and the Borge Lady.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nHowever, I feel like it's happening right now.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nGiven, given, uh, given, uh, the landscape that you have, uh, left out.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nI believe shouting at me that I can see you.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nAnd given that I can see you, perhaps I can cast a spell.\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000\nAll right.\n\n01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nWhat do you want to cast?\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nA spell of stupidity in which you are open to suggestion.\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000\nCan I, can I?\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nIs that a real thing?\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nYes.\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nCan I pull horticard aside for a second?\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000\nUh, I'm standing.\n\n01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nWe're in the middle of a move.\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nLike, well, you're, you're a good 10, 15 feet off and there's like four guns on the guys.\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nSo, okay.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nYou're, I mean, you could do something, but it might.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nMight as cast a spell of susceptibility then.\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nUh, is that a spell that you have?\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nThat just makes you more hurt by things?\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nNo.\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nIt makes the subject more susceptible.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nCould I, may I ask a question?\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nCould I cast a spell and put him into a complete troll skin?\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nWait, what?\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nA troll skin.\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nIt's armor.\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nAnd I'm the doctor.\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nI think you have troll skin.\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nNo, according to, excuse me, but, but according to this, uh, I've got, I've got, I can, I\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\ncan, uh, well, maybe it is me.\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nI think it's you.\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nIs it under armor?\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nTroll skin.\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nNever mind.\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000\nYou can put it on and run in front of it.\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nSeriously.\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000\nIs there a susceptibility spell?\n\n01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000\nI don't mean to, if there is, you could do it.\n\n01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nI've heard of it, but however, let's try this.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nYou're making up spells?\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nNo.\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000\nThis is one that I've read up.\n\n01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nIs it on your spell list?\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nIt has to be one of the spells that you know.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nI don't think it is.\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nAre you trying to cheat Shadowrun?\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nMight I use, no.\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nI would like to cast turn everyone into pillows.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000\nI don't, I don't think that's a spell you have.\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nMight I use a mind pro to find what his resistance is to the face that no one can resist?\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nUh, who?\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000\nThe, the guy with the burgers?\n\n01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nMr. Burgers.\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nUh, yeah.\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nOkay.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nSo fun fact, casting a spell, it takes some time and if you cast a spell, people will\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.080\nknow you're casting a spell and casting spells also causes like apocalypses and people's\n\n01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.000\nheads to explode, so it might be really, really a threatening thing to do.\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nRight, put the mind probe.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nBut he's saying like it's the, they got their guns on you and they told you to get the fuck\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nout.\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nIf you cast a spell, it's the equivalent of pulling a gun out.\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nLike they, they might shoot you.\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nYeah.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nRight, so maybe, maybe do more good for me.\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000\nSo do less, do less.\n\n01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nAll we want is to get our tourist bagouli out of there.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nMercy or Donald asked, I'll suck your dick or lick your balls.\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nI will kiss your balls.\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nI'll kiss your balls.\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nA single time.\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nHe said he'll be out in 20 minutes.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nShould we just wait him out or should we?\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nAll right.\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\n20, yeah, let's wait him out.\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nWell, I'm.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000\nCan we just cool our heels for 20 minutes or should we?\n\n01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nWell, I mean, yeah, like a horde of guards, get out of there.\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000\nIs it possible that I might order a burger?\n\n01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nNot.\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000\nThat's possible.\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nWhich given might take 35 minutes or so.\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nYou go outside and you leave your weapons outside and then you come back and you get\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nall the burgers you need, my friend.\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nI require one.\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nOK.\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000\nIs it even that amount?\n\n01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000\nI got in the comic and say, everybody, let's just buy it our time.\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000\n20 minutes.\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nMercy's going to kiss a couple of balls.\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nWe're going to get our tourist bagouli out here.\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nWe'll take him.\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000\nWe'll get the money.\n\n01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nThat's going to be good, right?\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nI apply a lot of chapstick.\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nIs Curtis's character in the car with me?\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nYeah.\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000\nI'm school there.\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nAll right.\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nDialogue break.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nSo, I haven't been on a lot of shadow runs with you.\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nWell, you know, these always make me very nervous.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000\nThe shadow runs.\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nHow does a man in medicine become such a destructive force?\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nThat's the problem.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nIs I figure sometimes I try to resist, but sometimes I have powers and it's more than\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nI can do to control them.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nYou go on shadow runs to exercise your powers?\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nI go on shadow runs in case anyone else is hurt.\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nThat's my job as a doctor.\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nBut sometimes, sometimes, when we get into these kinds of situations, I do have powers\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nand I lose control over them.\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nLike that agony spell?\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nI was just thinking about that one.\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nI remember that.\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000\nBecause I was thinking that if there's a problem in there, I may have to use the agony spell,\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nwhich goes against all of my rules as a doctor.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nI'm kind of conflicted because, you know, I want this one to go clean, but I really loved\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nyou casting that agony spell.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nI wanted to do the troll skin, but I wasn't allowed to.\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nSo now I'm going to have to do the agony spell.\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nReady?\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nNo.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nYou're going to do it now?\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nNo, don't.\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nNo.\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nI jump on the comic and go, boys, if you're thinking about casting agony spells, can\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nwe just wait 15 minutes to get this fucking done?\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000\nWe're just sitting in a car waiting.\n\n01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nI mean, I can do it just through the window.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000\nWe know.\n\n01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nGuys, on the comic, I'll kiss everyone's balls, just wait.\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nWait a second.\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000\nI go on the comic and say, Mercy, would you go kiss a doctor's balls and fucking have\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nhim lay low for a second?\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nKiss everybody's balls so we can just get Anthony Spraguli out of here.\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nArturo Spraguli.\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nThe thing is, it's an empty offer, but it usually works.\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nWhy is it an empty offer?\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nBecause I've never actually kissed any balls.\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nWhy haven't you kissed any balls before?\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nWhy would anyone just kiss balls?\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nI mean, if anything, it's just a show that I'm subservient and I'm not.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nI mean, it's something that turns guys on.\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nI feel like kissing balls is its own reward.\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000\nWill you show me how to kiss balls?\n\n01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nWill you kiss the doctor's balls?\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nOkay, I will.\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nAll right.\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nThank you.\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nOkay, I walk up to the doctor and I say, doctor, I'm going to kiss your balls.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nI'm going to do it for one reason, because we're going to find out the importance of\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nkissing balls, the ratio of ball kissing to pay off, where you don't have to jump in\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nand cast agony spells and make any kind of cause.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nEve, Eve, Eve.\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nWoman to woman, you're going to blow my cover.\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000\nGetting your balls kissed, I don't think is actually that great.\n\n01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nIt's just something I say, but please don't.\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nBut don't just, if you start kissing balls, then the deflation of ball kissing.\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nBut you said you've never kissed balls before.\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000\nHow do you know what they're about?\n\n01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nNo, I know, because I never had to.\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nWe're not doing this, we have to.\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nWe're doing this.\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nI mean, you kiss all the balls you want, but you don't have to do a study about how\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nworthless it is to have your balls kissed.\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nSpencer, is there a way for me and Mercy to talk privately on the Comlink?\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nOr is it always over the hole?\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000\nMercy, this is Eve on a direct message.\n\n01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nHello?\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000\nHey, hi.\n\n01:25:38.000 -->

think they went off channel.\n\n01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nCan you keep a secret?\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000\nYeah, yeah, girl, if you want.\n\n01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000\nYou got to promise me, Mercy, you can keep a secret.\n\n01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nWho can hear me?\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nCheck, check.\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nI'm here, I can hear

01:26:02.000\nMercy, I'm not doing this for you.\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nI'm not doing this for the mission.\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nI'm doing this because I want to kiss the doctor's balls.\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nI think that's beautiful and powerful, and I think that's great.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nAnd if you don't have to talk to me about it, but if you want to tell me about it, you can.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nI think I deserve to be heard in this conversation.\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nWhat if I don't want my balls kissed?\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nWhat do you get out of it if you do kiss my balls?\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nYou can hear them?\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nI just know you get the shame of not taking the balls kissed.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nI go offline.\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nWhere am I, and where is the doctor?\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000\nYou guys are all in the truck.\n\n01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nI'm in the car.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nOkay, I just start kissing the doctor's balls.\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nWe're all just in a car, right?\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nAren't we just in a car?\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nIt's just like prom night in Milwaukee.\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nCan you explain, did you unzip his pants and then cradle his balls out of his pants?\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000\nYes, precisely.\n\n01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000\nWhat did you do with his dick?\n\n01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nDid you touch his dick?\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nThe dick has nothing to do with what I'm doing.\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nThis is simply about me?\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nYou just fished his balls out like a goldfish bag at a carnival?\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nHey guys, we're all in the same car.\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nWatch me work.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000\nIt's one elf, one doctor, two.\n\n01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nIt's just as rewarding.\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000\nTwo balls.\n\n01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nLet me fucking do my thing, and I start gently kissing the doctor's balls.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000\nI placed my author about 15 minutes ago.\n\n01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nI just wanted to get any progress on the background.\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nI would like to take this moment to say that I really appreciate all the work that Spencer does\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nand all the work that he puts into these.\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nThank you.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nThanks.\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nIt was a great job.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nYou don't think that when he writes the maps and the descriptions of different rooms\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nand then we spend a half hour kissing balls that he's not like, phew, I gotta wake up.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nI'm certain that he's like, yeah.\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000\nIt's all good.\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000\nSo I'm kissing the doctor's balls.\n\n01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nI mean, yeah, what does the doctor have to say about that, right?\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nWell, I gave up.\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nI thought I had an opinion, but I guess I don't, so I'm just going with it.\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nDoctor, I'm kissing your balls.\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nAnd it's up to you.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nDoctor, friend, whether you, I'm just trying to prove a point,\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000\nwhether we could have gone and kissed this guy's balls and got him out of here.\n\n01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nWait, you're still insisting that there was a point?\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nYou said this was about your wife and your niece.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nOkay, guys, truth be told, I just want to kiss his balls.\n\n01:28:37.000

the\n\n01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:40.460\nburgers he's eating are probably made of children too soon organized crime is\n\n01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:45.460\nall about code right and you protect children they have dances and you have\n\n01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:50.860\nto buy their organized crime movies that we've seen play out a particular story\n\n01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.740\nwhich is that organized crime much like capitalism itself like it's slowly\n\n01:35:54.740 --> 01:36:01.300\neroded by its own code which is profit above all else so what starts as the\n\n01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:07.140\nblack hand in Sicily and it becomes La Cosa Nostra turns into just a bunch of\n\n01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:11.920\nbusiness people okay okay I walk out and I come back in again and I say two\n\n01:36:11.920

from up above so let me know when\n\n01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.100\nI'm up there let me know what my options are you're up there it's there's some\n\n01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:45.140\nsmall fist size pipes for ventilation yeah not people size all right nothing\n\n01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:51.260\nnothing cinematically sized no I'm afraid not all right fine go going back\n\n01:36:51.260 --> 01:37:02.060\ndown okay reality check it's a trope called well it's it's the you know it's\n\n01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:06.540\nnot much ventilation in a burger tyrant of course not why would there be I don't\n\n01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:15.220\nknow what it will prohibit it for me to go use my other an alternate identity as\n\n01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:20.980\na security guard yeah but you still look the same exactly so secondly is it\n\n01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:26.380\npossible that the doctor could give me another skin I don't I think the troll\n\n01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:30.780\nskin is just something he has if he if he could disguise I go in the comic and\n\n01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:34.700\nI asked our whole team why is it so hard to get one guy out of a fucking burger\n\n01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:42.020\nplace it's not a helpful question we have to be able to get one guy out of a\n\n01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:46.340\nburger place let's let's just muscle up and go get this I'm gonna have organized\n\n01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:51.140\nhow do I use my organized scrap my organized crime skill to get him out can\n\n01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.020\nI use that also under qualities it says moderate egg allergy that's not a\n\n01:37:55.020 --> 01:38:01.300\nquality that is an absolutely a quality it's it's what made me want to work for\n\n01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:07.860\nyou I I want to when I get a turn what was the other question organized crime\n\n01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:14.180\nhow do I use your knowledge of organized crime to learn stuff I mean I want to\n\n01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:20.980\nlearn how to lure this guy outside using my organized crime knowledge nothing\n\n01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:28.300\nthat's like looking at the walkthrough for a video game for me what a
