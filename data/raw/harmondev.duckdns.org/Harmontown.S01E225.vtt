{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.520\nIt's a beautiful Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and the fantastically groovy comedy theater\n\n00:23.520 --> 00:26.040\nbrought to you by the Wheeler Center.\n\n00:26.040 --> 00:33.040\nLook, guys, we were in Brisbane last night, so this is like being in Paris or Rome.\n\n00:33.040 --> 00:43.040\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:43.040 --> 01:05.040\nLadies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure and my honor to introduce to you Spencer Crittenden.\n\n01:05.040 --> 01:15.040\nI'm the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:15.040 --> 01:18.040\nThank you.\n\n01:18.040 --> 01:21.040\nThank you so much.\n\n01:21.040 --> 01:22.040\nThis is exhilarating.\n\n01:22.040 --> 01:23.040\nThank you, Melbourne.\n\n01:23.040 --> 01:24.040\nMelbourne.\n\n01:24.040 --> 01:25.040\nWe did it.\n\n01:25.040 --> 01:26.040\nI find it hard.\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:28.040\nI don't want to cross the threshold where you start.\n\n01:28.040 --> 01:31.040\nIt's like when you're the Melbourne thing.\n\n01:31.040 --> 01:32.040\nIt's Melbourne to me.\n\n01:32.040 --> 01:37.040\nI know it's not to you, but then it's like in the movies when the first time the teenage\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:43.040\ndaughter calls the adopted dad, dad, you know, like I feel like if we went through an earthquake\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:47.040\ntogether and then I helped you make a tourniquet or something, and then there were like werewolves\n\n01:47.040 --> 01:49.040\nand then we finished and we were the only survivors.\n\n01:49.040 --> 01:50.040\nIt was just me and you.\n\n01:50.040 --> 01:52.040\nAnd then you'd be like, thanks, Dan.\n\n01:52.040 --> 01:54.040\nAnd I'd be like, thanks, Melbourne.\n\n01:54.040 --> 02:01.040\nBecause I was always like chewing my gum and calling you Melbourne the whole time.\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:08.040\nDan spent I think 85% of last night's show and Brisbane just haraying the audience about\n\n02:08.040 --> 02:09.040\nyour guys' accents.\n\n02:09.040 --> 02:12.040\nWell, no, I mean, mistakes were made last night.\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:17.040\nI came out in the hat and the shorts and the...\n\n02:17.040 --> 02:22.040\nI don't know who started it and what made the show as...\n\n02:22.040 --> 02:26.040\nThe brow of the show was lower last night and it wasn't Brisbane's fault.\n\n02:26.040 --> 02:28.040\nBut it was like a cool rock and roll hanger.\n\n02:28.040 --> 02:31.040\nI don't know if everyone's been to the Trifids in Brisbane.\n\n02:31.040 --> 02:32.040\nIt's an awesome venue.\n\n02:32.040 --> 02:34.040\nBut it's like more of a rock concert.\n\n02:34.040 --> 02:36.040\nThis is a very civilized theater kind of thing.\n\n02:36.040 --> 02:38.040\nBut it was like a prison riot.\n\n02:38.040 --> 02:39.040\nIt was...\n\n02:39.040 --> 02:41.040\nEverybody was yelling at each other.\n\n02:41.040 --> 02:43.040\nThey all hated where everybody else was from.\n\n02:43.040 --> 02:46.040\nIt was like it was really barbaric.\n\n02:46.040 --> 02:47.040\nAnd they're not...\n\n02:47.040 --> 02:52.040\nThis is not a classist thing, but have you guys seen the movie Gremlins?\n\n02:52.040 --> 02:55.040\nNo, no, I'm kidding.\n\n02:55.040 --> 03:00.040\nIt was more like we've done shows in Madison and Milwaukee, my hometown.\n\n03:00.040 --> 03:05.040\nI don't know, maybe it's like...\n\n03:05.040 --> 03:08.040\nIt was like they were watching TV and they were just like all of them.\n\n03:08.040 --> 03:10.040\nThey were just like, no, that's not true.\n\n03:10.040 --> 03:13.040\nAnd it was like, it often isn't true what I say.\n\n03:13.040 --> 03:15.040\nI shouldn't be saying anything I'm saying.\n\n03:15.040 --> 03:21.040\nSo if 700 people are each individually monitoring that and calling out to me,\n\n03:21.040 --> 03:23.040\nthat's actually not true.\n\n03:23.040 --> 03:26.040\nOkay, all right, well, that's okay.\n\n03:26.040 --> 03:29.040\nAnd then some poor fucker admitted that he was from Ipswich,\n\n03:29.040 --> 03:31.040\nand there was a...\n\n03:31.040 --> 03:35.040\nThey nearly crucified him.\n\n03:35.040 --> 03:37.040\nIt was really...\n\n03:37.040 --> 03:39.040\nIt got ugly, but then we all like...\n\n03:39.040 --> 03:41.040\nI took a bunch of like the young Armenians, we all,\n\n03:41.040 --> 03:43.040\nbecause you crapped out, you were pooped.\n\n03:43.040 --> 03:44.040\nI was so exhausted.\n\n03:44.040 --> 03:47.040\nListen, if you guys ever see me...\n\n03:47.040 --> 03:50.040\nI'm not going to say I was unprepared for last night,\n\n03:50.040 --> 03:55.040\nbut it would take an effort to do a transcontinental version of this show.\n\n03:55.040 --> 04:01.040\nBut if you ever see me initiate a game of audience sound effects,\n\n04:01.040 --> 04:04.040\nwhich is what I did last night...\n\n04:04.040 --> 04:06.040\nYeah, we went straight up who's Lennon's anyway last night.\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:08.040\nI was just looking at Jeff like, I don't know,\n\n04:08.040 --> 04:10.040\nmaybe what if...\n\n04:10.040 --> 04:13.040\nDo we have a celebrity on the phone?\n\n04:13.040 --> 04:15.040\nI didn't really know what to do.\n\n04:15.040 --> 04:18.040\nIt was my fault because I came out dressed like Paul Hogan.\n\n04:18.040 --> 04:20.040\nI was dressed like a fucking lunatic,\n\n04:20.040 --> 04:22.040\nand I was obsessed with the accent,\n\n04:22.040 --> 04:24.040\nand I was trying to prove I could do the accent,\n\n04:24.040 --> 04:26.040\nand I did, I spent hours...\n\n04:26.040 --> 04:28.040\nIt wasn't an insulting...\n\n04:28.040 --> 04:32.040\nI was so proud because I finally figured out how to say...\n\n04:32.040 --> 04:37.040\nOh, like that hat might...\n\n04:37.040 --> 04:39.040\nWhy?\n\n04:39.040 --> 04:43.040\nThat's all the vowels that I...\n\n04:43.040 --> 04:45.040\nExcept for some way...\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:47.040\nSpencer and I still don't know how to do O.\n\n04:47.040 --> 04:49.040\nWhat's the rule with O here?\n\n04:49.040 --> 04:51.040\nYou gotta go like...\n\n04:51.040 --> 04:53.040\nNo!\n\n04:53.040 --> 04:55.040\nNo!\n\n04:55.040 --> 04:57.040\nNo?\n\n04:57.040 --> 04:59.040\nYeah, that's... Jeff had it.\n\n04:59.040 --> 05:01.040\nBut now we're doing it again, now we're doing it again.\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:03.040\nIt's gonna turn into Jerry Springer.\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:05.040\nWe're the fucking monsters.\n\n05:05.040 --> 05:07.040\nYou guys don't know how many times Dan said,\n\n05:07.040 --> 05:10.040\nOh, I like that hat, mate!\n\n05:10.040 --> 05:13.040\nBecause it was 120.\n\n05:13.040 --> 05:15.040\nIt was a lot of times.\n\n05:15.040 --> 05:17.040\nWhy did it, when you do it, it's so stressed?\n\n05:17.040 --> 05:19.040\nBecause I'm concentrating on each thing.\n\n05:19.040 --> 05:21.040\nI know it says...\n\n05:21.040 --> 05:23.040\nThey have a playful, relaxed thing.\n\n05:23.040 --> 05:25.040\nYou're not supposed to...\n\n05:25.040 --> 05:27.040\nIt's supposed to flow over your tongue,\n\n05:27.040 --> 05:29.040\nlike a medicine ball or something.\n\n05:29.040 --> 05:31.040\nYou know how those flow.\n\n05:31.040 --> 05:33.040\nI like that hat, mate!\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:35.040\nAnd then it's like, there's all these rules.\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:37.040\nIt has to go up, it has to be a question.\n\n05:37.040 --> 05:39.040\nWe're doing it again! This is how I started the show in Brisbane!\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:41.040\nAnd I'm not gonna say it was a bad show.\n\n05:41.040 --> 05:43.040\nIt was a very Brisbane show.\n\n05:43.040 --> 05:45.040\nIt was a great show, but the inmates...\n\n05:45.040 --> 05:47.040\nWe had a good time.\n\n05:47.040 --> 05:49.040\nThe inmates were running the prison last night.\n\n05:49.040 --> 05:51.040\nAnd there's smart, wonderful,\n\n05:51.040 --> 05:53.040\njocular, jolly inmates.\n\n05:53.040 --> 05:55.040\nThey were not...\n\n05:55.040 --> 05:57.040\nThey were not bad people.\n\n05:57.040 --> 05:59.040\nTo be fair, half of them were from Ipswich.\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:01.040\nFucking animals.\n\n06:01.040 --> 06:03.040\nYeah.\n\n06:03.040 --> 06:05.040\nBut now we are,\n\n06:05.040 --> 06:07.040\naccording to Joseph Campbell's\n\n06:07.040 --> 06:09.040\ntracking of our journey,\n\n06:09.040 --> 06:11.040\nwe're now at the meeting with the goddess.\n\n06:11.040 --> 06:13.040\nWe're in the taint of Australia.\n\n06:13.040 --> 06:15.040\nWe're down...\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:17.040\nWe're down under.\n\n06:17.040 --> 06:19.040\nWe're down, like, around and under.\n\n06:19.040 --> 06:21.040\nI'm sure I'm about the first person to point this out.\n\n06:21.040 --> 06:23.040\nMaybe we can go, we can just get on a boat\n\n06:23.040 --> 06:25.040\nand cradle the balls of Tasmania.\n\n06:25.040 --> 06:27.040\nYeah.\n\n06:27.040 --> 06:29.040\nAnd we're in this wonderful historic theater.\n\n06:29.040 --> 06:31.040\nThis theater, then,\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:33.040\nis where the typewriter was invented.\n\n06:33.040 --> 06:35.040\nYeah.\n\n06:35.040 --> 06:37.040\nYeah!\n\n06:37.040 --> 06:39.040\nThere was a guy\n\n06:39.040 --> 06:41.040\ndownstairs that's running the Wheeler\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:43.040\nthing or whatever the guy.\n\n06:43.040 --> 06:45.040\nThe Wheeler Center, yes.\n\n06:45.040 --> 06:47.040\nThe Wheeler Brothers.\n\n06:47.040 --> 06:49.040\nThey're in a huge feud, but they can only get along\n\n06:49.040 --> 06:51.040\nduring these fine\n\n06:51.040 --> 06:53.040\nshowcases of artistic...\n\n06:53.040 --> 06:55.040\nI don't know what the Wheeler thing is.\n\n06:55.040 --> 06:57.040\nI don't know what it is.\n\n06:57.040 --> 06:59.040\nThe Wheeler Center is\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:01.040\nanother theater that they use when they have big venues,\n\n07:01.040 --> 07:03.040\nlike big shows like this,\n\n07:03.040 --> 07:05.040\nthey hire out the comedy theater\n\n07:05.040 --> 07:07.040\nthat we're in right now.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:09.040\nHe was saying that\n\n07:09.040 --> 07:11.040\nit's not this theater, but that down the street\n\n07:11.040 --> 07:13.040\nthere's a theater.\n\n07:13.040 --> 07:15.040\nHe said,\n\n07:15.040 --> 07:17.040\nMax Wayne performed down there.\n\n07:17.040 --> 07:19.040\nMax Wayne.\n\n07:19.040 --> 07:21.040\nAnd I was like, oh, Max Wayne,\n\n07:21.040 --> 07:23.040\nhe clearly needs me to pretend to know who that is\n\n07:23.040 --> 07:25.040\nor he'll think I'm stupid.\n\n07:25.040 --> 07:27.040\nHe was saying Mark Twain.\n\n07:27.040 --> 07:29.040\nI would never...\n\n07:29.040 --> 07:31.040\nI love you guys, but we'll never\n\n07:31.040 --> 07:33.040\nunderstand each other.\n\n07:33.040 --> 07:35.040\nI asked him who the name of the Prime Minister was\n\n07:35.040 --> 07:37.040\nand he said something turtle.\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:39.040\nTurtle?\n\n07:39.040 --> 07:41.040\nIt's Daniel Andrews.\n\n07:41.040 --> 07:43.040\nNo, no, that's...\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:45.040\nThat's the premier.\n\n07:45.040 --> 07:47.040\nWho are you asking about?\n\n07:47.040 --> 07:49.040\nThe PM.\n\n07:49.040 --> 07:51.040\nOh, the Prime Minister.\n\n07:51.040 --> 07:53.040\nThat's Pauline Henson.\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:55.040\nHello!\n\n07:55.040 --> 07:57.040\nCome on, Hulkamaniacs!\n\n07:57.040 --> 07:59.040\nLet me hear you!\n\n07:59.040 --> 08:01.040\nI got my hooks into Pauline Henson last night\n\n08:01.040 --> 08:03.040\nand I coasted across that finish line.\n\n08:03.040 --> 08:05.040\nThank you for that ripcord.\n\n08:05.040 --> 08:07.040\nI was sweating.\n\n08:07.040 --> 08:09.040\nThere's no show!\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:11.040\nAudience sound effects!\n\n08:11.040 --> 08:13.040\nAnd then someone mentioned Pauline Henson\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:15.040\nand it was like, aha!\n\n08:15.040 --> 08:17.040\nDan started doing a rap about liking\n\n08:17.040 --> 08:19.040\nthat hatmate and he went out into the crowd\n\n08:19.040 --> 08:21.040\nand then went upstairs into the balcony\n\n08:21.040 --> 08:23.040\nand when he came back he looked like\n\n08:23.040 --> 08:25.040\nhe had just gotten out of the shower.\n\n08:25.040 --> 08:27.040\nI was just covered\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:29.040\nand I don't know how much of that was\n\n08:29.040 --> 08:31.040\nflop sweat and how much was just exercise.\n\n08:31.040 --> 08:33.040\nIt was kind of humid.\n\n08:33.040 --> 08:35.040\nI think it was very much both.\n\n08:35.040 --> 08:37.040\nAgain, not a bad show, but totally got to experience\n\n08:37.040 --> 08:39.040\nwhat it would be like.\n\n08:39.040 --> 08:41.040\nYou don't have an act.

You don't have an act.\n\n57:33.040 --> 57:35.040\nYou're a podcaster.\n\n57:35.040 --> 57:37.040\nLet's just suffer.\n\n57:37.040 --> 57:39.040\nThe next chapter is the atonement\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:41.040\nwith the father,\n\n57:41.040 --> 57:43.040\nbut that's heteronormative.\n\n57:43.040 --> 57:45.040\nIt's like the\n\n57:45.040 --> 57:47.040\nlittle story circle where the middle of the show\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:49.040\nwe just met with the goddess,\n\n57:49.040 --> 57:51.040\nSincero,\n\n57:51.040 --> 57:53.040\nnot to put too fine a point on it.\n\n57:53.040 --> 57:55.040\nNow we have to pay the price.\n\n57:55.040 --> 57:57.040\nShe literally described\n\n57:57.040 --> 57:59.040\nwhat it was we were doing.\n\n57:59.040 --> 58:01.040\nWe can't keep reacting now.\n\n58:01.040 --> 58:03.040\nWe're moving forward. We now have to have volition.\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:05.040\nWe have to decide we want to accomplish something\n\n58:05.040 --> 58:07.040\nand that's when we're going to get our asses.\n\n58:07.040 --> 58:09.040\nYou and I have talked about a couple of times doing,\n\n58:09.040 --> 58:11.040\nmaybe this is a bad pitch,\n\n58:11.040 --> 58:13.040\nand I don't know, Spencer, you're probably not prepared for this.\n\n58:13.040 --> 58:15.040\nLike Dan and I,\n\n58:15.040 --> 58:17.040\nwe're not allowed to. We can't do it anymore.\n\n58:17.040 --> 58:19.040\nNo, let's do it. I decided in the green room, let's do it.\n\n58:21.040 --> 58:23.040\nAs long as it's not medieval fantasy,\n\n58:23.040 --> 58:25.040\nI think we're going to do it.\n\n58:25.040 --> 58:27.040\nWe were talking about bringing back\n\n58:27.040 --> 58:29.040\na little bit of role playing back into the show.\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:33.040\nI'll take the heat on this one.\n\n58:35.040 --> 58:37.040\nYeah, I mean there's concern\n\n58:37.040 --> 58:39.040\nbecause Harmon Quest, and are we stepping on toes?\n\n58:39.040 --> 58:41.040\nWe'll take, we'll take,\n\n58:41.040 --> 58:43.040\nI'll take, it'll be like a promotion.\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:47.040\nYeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n58:47.040 --> 58:49.040\nThis is like a big commercial for Harmon Quest on CISO\n\n58:49.040 --> 58:51.040\nwhich you probably can't even watch here\n\n58:51.040 --> 58:53.040\nbecause your country doesn't have it.\n\n58:53.040 --> 58:55.040\nSpencer, I don't reckon you have any dice on you, probably.\n\n58:55.040 --> 58:57.040\nWhat?\n\n58:57.040 --> 58:59.040\nDice.

across this and do a little\n\n01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040\nfashion of a crude rope bridge.\n\n01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.040\nOr\n\n01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.040\nunless you've got a sexy

01:27:15.040\nCrude rope bridge montage.\n\n01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.040\nThere's only one thing wrong with this crude rope bridge.\n\n01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.040\nWhat?\n\n01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.040\nTo non-crude.\n\n01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.040\nIt's a real rope bridge.\n\n01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.040\nWe're wonderful together.\n\n01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.040\nCan someone please remember to carry my body?\n\n01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.040\nI pick up Jenna\n\n01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.040\nand throw her over my shoulder\n\n01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040\nlike fireman

the counterweight on this side.\n\n01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.040\nOh!\n\n01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.040\nWe can pull her over later.\n\n01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040\nI'm not smart.\n\n01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.040\nI have an intelligence of three.\n\n01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040\nI've been left behind, but I'm out of it.\n\n01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.040\nWho knows?\n\n01:28:05.040 -->

wall.\n\n01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040\nLook, one at a time and I won't hit me.\n\n01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.040\nExactly, right.\n\n01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040\nYou're into one of those sleepy coke binge things\n\n01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.040\nthat happens to nobody.\n\n01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.040\nI picked the wrong class.\n\n01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.040\nI picked the guy that just talks.\n\n01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.040\nThat's all I am.\n\n01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040\nYou got a pretty fancy...\n\n01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040\nWhat's that big staff?\n\n01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.040\nThat big wooden stick that you have\n\n01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040\ninto your knapsack there.\n\n01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.040\nIt looks kind of mystical and magical.\n\n01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040\nYou mean the eye of everything?\n\n01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040\nIt's called the eye of everything?\n\n01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040\nI push the center of the eye.\n\n01:28:53.040

stuck.\n\n01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.040\nOh, okay, well then I won't use it again.\n\n01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.040\nI think that's a really old callback.\n\n01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.040\nIt's from the movie.\n\n01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.040\nWe made a movie about ourselves and they watched it.\n\n01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.040\nWe really owe them a lot.\n\n01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.040\nIt's more than just a ticket price.\n\n01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.040\nAll right, so we're all across the bridge,\n\n01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040\nexcept for Jenna.\n\n01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.040\nI use my macho strengths\n\n01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.040\nand I pull her across\n\n01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.040\nand hoist her up and...\n\n01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.040\nThank you.\n\n01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.040\nOh, you're awake?\n\n01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.040\nShe hasn't smashed into the wall\n\n01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.040\nand I woke her up.\n\n01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.040\nAll right, of course.\n\n01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.040\nWhile you were passed out,\n\n01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040\nwe used you to counterweight our bridge.\n\n01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.040\nI don't know if you're putting on weight,\n\n01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.040\nbut we used you\n\n01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.040\nto counterweight our bridge.\n\n01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.040\nNever talk about a woman's weight, okay?\n\n01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.040\nI was making a joke.\n\n01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.040\nYou're a tiny little whisper of a thing.\n\n01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.040\nI appreciate it.\n\n01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.040\nWe hit a point where we killed the barbarians.\n\n01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.040\nWe could have ended it there.\n\n01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.040\nNo, we're across the chasm now.\n\n01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.040\nThis is a threshold.\n\n01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.040\nTo what end?\n\n01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040\nTo Ipswich.\n\n01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.040\nYou're going to give up now?\n\n01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040\nOne button gets stuck\n\n01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.040\nand you just fucking want to call it a day.\n\n01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.040\nI don't know if I like your style.\n\n01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.040\nDo you mean\n\n01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.040\nto say that even though we met with the goddess,\n\n01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.040\nnow that things are falling apart?\n\n01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.040\nI think that maybe\n\n01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.040\nit's time that\n\n01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.040\nwe should split up company\n\n01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.040\nand find out if\n\n01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.040\nflight can be magic.\n\n01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.040\nI hate you.\n\n01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.040\nI never knew my parents.\n\n01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.040\nWe're fighting.\n\n01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.040\nI go away.\n\n01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.040\nOkay.\n\n01:30:57.040 -->

here with a fifth of vodka.\n\n01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.040\nI met it Jeff\n\n01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.040\nand I punch a rock and I eat an iguana.\n\n01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.040\nWe're not friends anymore\n\n01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040\nand conflict, conflict.\n\n01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040\nIf you want to be a dick about it,\n\n01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040\nme, Bodie and Jenna will get in my truck\n\n01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040\nand we'll take care of business ourselves.\n\n01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.040\nFine, I hope I never see you again.\n\n01:31:31.040 -->

01:31:39.040\nFucking made a bridge.\n\n01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.040\nI thought you had a bridge that's metaphorical\n\n01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.040\nfor crossing the difficult\n\n01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.040\nfrom one place to the other.\n\n01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.040\nI say whoever kills Pauline Henson and Ipswich\n\n01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.040\nis the real post-apocalyptic
