WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.520
It's a beautiful Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and the fantastically groovy comedy theater

00:23.520 --> 00:26.040
brought to you by the Wheeler Center.

00:26.040 --> 00:33.040
Look, guys, we were in Brisbane last night, so this is like being in Paris or Rome.

00:33.040 --> 00:43.040
Harmontown is now in session.

00:43.040 --> 01:05.040
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure and my honor to introduce to you Spencer Crittenden.

01:05.040 --> 01:15.040
I'm the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.040
Thank you.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.040
Thank you so much.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
This is exhilarating.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.040
Thank you, Melbourne.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.040
Melbourne.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.040
We did it.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
I find it hard.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.040
I don't want to cross the threshold where you start.

01:28.040 --> 01:31.040
It's like when you're the Melbourne thing.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.040
It's Melbourne to me.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.040
I know it's not to you, but then it's like in the movies when the first time the teenage

01:37.040 --> 01:43.040
daughter calls the adopted dad, dad, you know, like I feel like if we went through an earthquake

01:43.040 --> 01:47.040
together and then I helped you make a tourniquet or something, and then there were like werewolves

01:47.040 --> 01:49.040
and then we finished and we were the only survivors.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.040
It was just me and you.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.040
And then you'd be like, thanks, Dan.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.040
And I'd be like, thanks, Melbourne.

01:54.040 --> 02:01.040
Because I was always like chewing my gum and calling you Melbourne the whole time.

02:01.040 --> 02:08.040
Dan spent I think 85% of last night's show and Brisbane just haraying the audience about

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
your guys' accents.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.040
Well, no, I mean, mistakes were made last night.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.040
I came out in the hat and the shorts and the...

02:17.040 --> 02:22.040
I don't know who started it and what made the show as...

02:22.040 --> 02:26.040
The brow of the show was lower last night and it wasn't Brisbane's fault.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.040
But it was like a cool rock and roll hanger.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.040
I don't know if everyone's been to the Trifids in Brisbane.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.040
It's an awesome venue.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
But it's like more of a rock concert.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.040
This is a very civilized theater kind of thing.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.040
But it was like a prison riot.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.040
It was...

02:39.040 --> 02:41.040
Everybody was yelling at each other.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
They all hated where everybody else was from.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.040
It was like it was really barbaric.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
And they're not...

02:47.040 --> 02:52.040
This is not a classist thing, but have you guys seen the movie Gremlins?

02:52.040 --> 02:55.040
No, no, I'm kidding.

02:55.040 --> 03:00.040
It was more like we've done shows in Madison and Milwaukee, my hometown.

03:00.040 --> 03:05.040
I don't know, maybe it's like...

03:05.040 --> 03:08.040
It was like they were watching TV and they were just like all of them.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.040
They were just like, no, that's not true.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.040
And it was like, it often isn't true what I say.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.040
I shouldn't be saying anything I'm saying.

03:15.040 --> 03:21.040
So if 700 people are each individually monitoring that and calling out to me,

03:21.040 --> 03:23.040
that's actually not true.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.040
Okay, all right, well, that's okay.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.040
And then some poor fucker admitted that he was from Ipswich,

03:29.040 --> 03:31.040
and there was a...

03:31.040 --> 03:35.040
They nearly crucified him.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.040
It was really...

03:37.040 --> 03:39.040
It got ugly, but then we all like...

03:39.040 --> 03:41.040
I took a bunch of like the young Armenians, we all,

03:41.040 --> 03:43.040
because you crapped out, you were pooped.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.040
I was so exhausted.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.040
Listen, if you guys ever see me...

03:47.040 --> 03:50.040
I'm not going to say I was unprepared for last night,

03:50.040 --> 03:55.040
but it would take an effort to do a transcontinental version of this show.

03:55.040 --> 04:01.040
But if you ever see me initiate a game of audience sound effects,

04:01.040 --> 04:04.040
which is what I did last night...

04:04.040 --> 04:06.040
Yeah, we went straight up who's Lennon's anyway last night.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.040
I was just looking at Jeff like, I don't know,

04:08.040 --> 04:10.040
maybe what if...

04:10.040 --> 04:13.040
Do we have a celebrity on the phone?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.040
I didn't really know what to do.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.040
It was my fault because I came out dressed like Paul Hogan.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.040
I was dressed like a fucking lunatic,

04:20.040 --> 04:22.040
and I was obsessed with the accent,

04:22.040 --> 04:24.040
and I was trying to prove I could do the accent,

04:24.040 --> 04:26.040
and I did, I spent hours...

04:26.040 --> 04:28.040
It wasn't an insulting...

04:28.040 --> 04:32.040
I was so proud because I finally figured out how to say...

04:32.040 --> 04:37.040
Oh, like that hat might...

04:37.040 --> 04:39.040
Why?

04:39.040 --> 04:43.040
That's all the vowels that I...

04:43.040 --> 04:45.040
Except for some way...

04:45.040 --> 04:47.040
Spencer and I still don't know how to do O.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.040
What's the rule with O here?

04:49.040 --> 04:51.040
You gotta go like...

04:51.040 --> 04:53.040
No!

04:53.040 --> 04:55.040
No!

04:55.040 --> 04:57.040
No?

04:57.040 --> 04:59.040
Yeah, that's... Jeff had it.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.040
But now we're doing it again, now we're doing it again.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.040
It's gonna turn into Jerry Springer.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
We're the fucking monsters.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.040
You guys don't know how many times Dan said,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.040
Oh, I like that hat, mate!

05:10.040 --> 05:13.040
Because it was 120.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.040
It was a lot of times.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
Why did it, when you do it, it's so stressed?

05:17.040 --> 05:19.040
Because I'm concentrating on each thing.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.040
I know it says...

05:21.040 --> 05:23.040
They have a playful, relaxed thing.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.040
You're not supposed to...

05:25.040 --> 05:27.040
It's supposed to flow over your tongue,

05:27.040 --> 05:29.040
like a medicine ball or something.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.040
You know how those flow.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
I like that hat, mate!

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
And then it's like, there's all these rules.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
It has to go up, it has to be a question.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
We're doing it again! This is how I started the show in Brisbane!

05:39.040 --> 05:41.040
And I'm not gonna say it was a bad show.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
It was a very Brisbane show.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.040
It was a great show, but the inmates...

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
We had a good time.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.040
The inmates were running the prison last night.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.040
And there's smart, wonderful,

05:51.040 --> 05:53.040
jocular, jolly inmates.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.040
They were not...

05:55.040 --> 05:57.040
They were not bad people.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.040
To be fair, half of them were from Ipswich.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.040
Fucking animals.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.040
Yeah.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.040
But now we are,

06:05.040 --> 06:07.040
according to Joseph Campbell's

06:07.040 --> 06:09.040
tracking of our journey,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.040
we're now at the meeting with the goddess.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.040
We're in the taint of Australia.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
We're down...

06:15.040 --> 06:17.040
We're down under.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.040
We're down, like, around and under.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.040
I'm sure I'm about the first person to point this out.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.040
Maybe we can go, we can just get on a boat

06:23.040 --> 06:25.040
and cradle the balls of Tasmania.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.040
Yeah.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.040
And we're in this wonderful historic theater.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.040
This theater, then,

06:31.040 --> 06:33.040
is where the typewriter was invented.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.040
Yeah.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.040
Yeah!

06:37.040 --> 06:39.040
There was a guy

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
downstairs that's running the Wheeler

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
thing or whatever the guy.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.040
The Wheeler Center, yes.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.040
The Wheeler Brothers.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.040
They're in a huge feud, but they can only get along

06:49.040 --> 06:51.040
during these fine

06:51.040 --> 06:53.040
showcases of artistic...

06:53.040 --> 06:55.040
I don't know what the Wheeler thing is.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.040
I don't know what it is.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.040
The Wheeler Center is

06:59.040 --> 07:01.040
another theater that they use when they have big venues,

07:01.040 --> 07:03.040
like big shows like this,

07:03.040 --> 07:05.040
they hire out the comedy theater

07:05.040 --> 07:07.040
that we're in right now.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
He was saying that

07:09.040 --> 07:11.040
it's not this theater, but that down the street

07:11.040 --> 07:13.040
there's a theater.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.040
He said,

07:15.040 --> 07:17.040
Max Wayne performed down there.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.040
Max Wayne.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
And I was like, oh, Max Wayne,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.040
he clearly needs me to pretend to know who that is

07:23.040 --> 07:25.040
or he'll think I'm stupid.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.040
He was saying Mark Twain.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.040
I would never...

07:29.040 --> 07:31.040
I love you guys, but we'll never

07:31.040 --> 07:33.040
understand each other.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.040
I asked him who the name of the Prime Minister was

07:35.040 --> 07:37.040
and he said something turtle.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.040
Turtle?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.040
It's Daniel Andrews.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.040
No, no, that's...

07:43.040 --> 07:45.040
That's the premier.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
Who are you asking about?

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
The PM.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
Oh, the Prime Minister.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.040
That's Pauline Henson.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.040
Hello!

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
Come on, Hulkamaniacs!

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
Let me hear you!

07:59.040 --> 08:01.040
I got my hooks into Pauline Henson last night

08:01.040 --> 08:03.040
and I coasted across that finish line.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.040
Thank you for that ripcord.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.040
I was sweating.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.040
There's no show!

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
Audience sound effects!

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
And then someone mentioned Pauline Henson

08:13.040 --> 08:15.040
and it was like, aha!

08:15.040 --> 08:17.040
Dan started doing a rap about liking

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
that hatmate and he went out into the crowd

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040
and then went upstairs into the balcony

08:21.040 --> 08:23.040
and when he came back he looked like

08:23.040 --> 08:25.040
he had just gotten out of the shower.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.040
I was just covered

08:27.040 --> 08:29.040
and I don't know how much of that was

08:29.040 --> 08:31.040
flop sweat and how much was just exercise.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
It was kind of humid.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.040
I think it was very much both.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.040
Again, not a bad show, but totally got to experience

08:37.040 --> 08:39.040
what it would be like.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.040
You don't have an act. What if you were in Brisbane?

08:41.040 --> 08:43.040
You don't know.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.040
I didn't know what that meant.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.040
They were like, come on, hey, my name is Henry.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.040
I was like, okay, Henry, what do you need?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.040
I liked shoes.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.040
I was like, all right, fine.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
But then someone else would be like,

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
you don't like shoes, you like socks.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
Well, Henry,

08:59.040 --> 09:01.040
I don't know

09:01.040 --> 09:03.040
what to do. Let's just all eat paste.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.040
I think

09:05.040 --> 09:07.040
that sounded reductive.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.040
That's not what I mean.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
I'm talking about my ability to control the room.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
I'm not talking about Brisbane's...

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
We don't like when the audience is drunker than us.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.040
And that was the case last night.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.040
No, they were funnier, smarter.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.040
But we like oceanographer...

09:21.040 --> 09:23.040
You bailed. We met a woman that

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
kills Crown of Thor and Starfish

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
with a giant robot dick.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.040
And it's done killing the Starfish,

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
so now they just gave it sentience.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
It sounds like they just

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
told it to go kill more things

09:35.040 --> 09:37.040
and turned it loose in the ocean.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.040
Maybe they were drunk.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.040
I went out

09:41.040 --> 09:43.040
with a gang of them.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
We went out into karaoke and 30 of us piled

09:45.040 --> 09:47.040
into a room built for nine people

09:47.040 --> 09:49.040
and it was really good.

09:49.040 --> 09:51.040
And I woke up and said, pockets full of drugs.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.040
I was like, I can't...

09:53.040 --> 09:57.040
I'm getting on a plane in two hours.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.040
So I did all of them.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
I can...

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
Thank you, guys.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.040
And definitely for real,

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
I feel like a real Australian

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
because something...

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
There's a weird bump on my forehead.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.040
Something definitely got me last night.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.040
I don't think you can see it, but I know it.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.040
You got a red jacket? What are they called?

10:17.040 --> 10:19.040
I got a flip-flap or a red stripe or something.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
Like, lusted golly-nobbin' down my wainscotting.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.040
Something got me.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.040
It's the ones you can't see.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.040
It'll fucking kill you, right? You know that.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.040
That's how you welcome us here.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.040
Welcome to Australia.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.040
There hasn't been a spider death in 30 years.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.040
No one else knows that.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
That sounds like a lie.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.040
You guys just reshuffle the statistics.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.040
All right, again, I'm doing what I did last night.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.040
I'm making them feel like

10:43.040 --> 10:45.040
they're just Australian.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.040
Can I take a moment?

10:47.040 --> 10:49.040
You guys are human beings.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.040
I could sit up here and talk about

10:51.040 --> 10:53.040
random shit.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.040
What the fuck is a bishop?

10:55.040 --> 10:57.040
I don't know what a bishop is within the Catholic Church.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.040
I don't understand.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.040
I looked it up and I can't...

11:01.040 --> 11:03.040
There's a whole internet. I don't even know what it is still.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.040
A bishop, yeah.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.040
I always thought it was like a being a lieutenant

11:07.040 --> 11:09.040
in the Catholic army.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.040
Like there is a priest, like street priests, you know?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.040
The ones that get down in there.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
Yeah.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.040
Oh, yeah.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.040
So Nintendo...

11:21.040 --> 11:23.040
See, I can speak Italian to you guys.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
You're cosmopolitan.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.040
But then there's like bishops and cardinals

11:27.040 --> 11:29.040
and then the Pope.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.040
Archbishops and all that.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.040
Yeah, but bishops can get married.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.040
I don't know what the fuck...

11:35.040 --> 11:37.040
I looked it up because they watched a movie

11:37.040 --> 11:39.040
called The Bishop's Wife and the whole time

11:39.040 --> 11:41.040
they're not explaining.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.040
Why does he have a wife?

11:43.040 --> 11:45.040
Carrie Grant's an angel and

11:45.040 --> 11:47.040
he comes in and he goes like,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.040
I'm here to help you build the new church

11:49.040 --> 11:51.040
and the bishop's like, yeah, I like that.

11:51.040 --> 11:53.040
And he's like, but do you like your wife?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.040
And he's like, what? Why are you talking about my wife?

11:55.040 --> 11:57.040
Why are you looking at her like that?

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
And Carrie Grant's like, like her, I like her.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
And the guy's like, okay,

12:01.040 --> 12:03.040
but you're gonna help me get my church done, right?

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
And he's like, I don't know, do you like the church

12:05.040 --> 12:07.040
more than your wife?

12:07.040 --> 12:09.040
Like it's a crazy movie, but that's not the point.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.040
Like it's just like a weird couple in Tennessee.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.040
Is it Carrie Grant a ghost in that one or something?

12:13.040 --> 12:15.040
He's an angel, which I was just

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
typically a ghost. What's the difference?

12:17.040 --> 12:19.040
An angel is a ghost, but

12:19.040 --> 12:21.040
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
An angel is a

12:23.040 --> 12:25.040
holy creature created

12:25.040 --> 12:27.040
as a servant

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
to the Lord.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.040
A ghost is a departed spirit

12:31.040 --> 12:33.040
of the living. Yeah, but

12:33.040 --> 12:35.040
okay, all right, all right.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.040
And that was

12:39.040 --> 12:41.040
Spencer Crittenden logic moments.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
I have one wheelhouse

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
and it's knowing what monsters are.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.040
Every once in a while,

12:47.040 --> 12:49.040
yeah, we stumble

12:49.040 --> 12:51.040
right into your garden and act like we own it.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.040
I do.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.040
That's all I got. Well, all right,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.040
Spencer, where is Jeff going?

12:57.040 --> 12:59.040
It's not important.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
Let's ignore it. What are you, are you from

13:05.040 --> 13:07.040
For the listeners, Jeff is

13:07.040 --> 13:09.040
opening a bar at the side of the

13:09.040 --> 13:11.040
theater.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.040
For those of you who are only listening,

13:13.040 --> 13:15.040
you'd think Jeff was from Ipswich right now.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
Now he's going into

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
the bar himself.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.040
He found a bar.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.040
I think a bouncer is coming.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.040
Oh, and just one more thing

13:27.040 --> 13:29.040
about last night's show. A disabled lady

13:29.040 --> 13:31.040
which we brought up on stage told me I needed to

13:31.040 --> 13:33.040
take care of myself and everyone applauded.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
Yeah, well,

13:35.040 --> 13:37.040
that's gonna keep happening.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.040
That stuck with me.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.040
Right.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.040
She's had a terrible life.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.040
She had a back injury and her back's all fucked up

13:45.040 --> 13:47.040
and I like to bring people up sometimes.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
Who's having a terrible time and she shared

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
all this stuff and then I was like,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.040
well, can we give you,

13:53.040 --> 13:55.040
within our means, is there anything we could do

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
since you shared your pain with us?

13:57.040 --> 13:59.040
Yeah, can you lose some fucking weight, fatty?

13:59.040 --> 14:01.040
Do us all a favor.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.040
Yeah.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.040
Get on a goddamn treadmill.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.040
That was her pitch.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.040
Dan, when I went down

14:09.040 --> 14:11.040
to this bar, for the listeners,

14:11.040 --> 14:13.040
there's a neon sign underneath

14:13.040 --> 14:15.040
the John Wilkes booth's like overhang

14:15.040 --> 14:17.040
and

14:17.040 --> 14:19.040
it says bar, but it's pointing

14:19.040 --> 14:21.040
to just this ominous black curtain.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.040
In there is a bar right off of stage right,

14:23.040 --> 14:25.040
audience left. Right.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
And I went down there. Was it Mike? Who's the cat that runs the wheeler center?

14:29.040 --> 14:31.040
Huh? It's Trick.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
That's what she said.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.040
John? John Turtle?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.040
He said,

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
do we want it open?

14:39.040 --> 14:41.040
He can send somebody down there and open up this bar.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.040
For them?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.040
They're reacting like you think for them.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
Yeah.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
Why are we wasting a bar

14:51.040 --> 14:53.040
at our show?

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
It's a chance to make

14:55.040 --> 14:57.040
the wheeler center some money, John.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.040
I want 10% of this action.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.040
We've performed

15:03.040 --> 15:05.040
in rooms where there's a bar

15:05.040 --> 15:07.040
we haven't liked it.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
People ordering drinks

15:09.040 --> 15:11.040
while you're trying

15:11.040 --> 15:13.040
to have an act.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.040
You want me to go close the curtain?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.040
I'm going to go out there anyway

15:17.040 --> 15:19.040
because we want to do a new segment

15:19.040 --> 15:21.040
and I want to...

15:23.040 --> 15:25.040
Just that neon sign

15:25.040 --> 15:27.040
is that just like art department

15:27.040 --> 15:29.040
or is there actually a thing there?

15:29.040 --> 15:31.040
I've never seen a bar that close to the stage.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.040
That's really Australian.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.040
That's what Angela Lansbury is doing.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.040
Love letters? She can just go get fucked up during the show?

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
That's the Australian...

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
That's their fire department.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
That's their code.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.040
They demanded it.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.040
Then I...

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
I know about the brushfires.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.040
I'm not being insensitive.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.040
They have brushfires

15:55.040 --> 15:57.040
like every week here

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
where people die and it's awful.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.040
They have a 9-11

16:01.040 --> 16:03.040
like every 11.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
Are you doing that in a way?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.040
Are you sending out a signal?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.040
I'm fun to

16:15.040 --> 16:17.040
pay attention to.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.040
It's not like a SeaWorld show.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
I'm not going to...

16:23.040 --> 16:25.040
I'm not like a magician.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
Usually what we do is

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
we never have anybody up that doesn't want to be up

16:29.040 --> 16:31.040
and then sometimes we ask for specific stuff.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.040
I go, oh, is there anybody in the thing

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
that's like...

16:35.040 --> 16:37.040
I don't know.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.040
Anybody have a terrible day or a good day?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.040
But when we go out of town, a lot of people are like,

16:41.040 --> 16:43.040
oh, shit, the carnival's in town.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.040
I want to just be on stage.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.040
You're not a bad person for wanting that necessarily.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.040
So I'm kind of looking for some of those people

16:49.040 --> 16:51.040
because we want to do a segment

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
where we're going to just ask an Australian.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.040
And we're like,

16:55.040 --> 16:57.040
I want to run through a couple of people.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.040
Your time will be limited but intense.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.040
You won't be bullied.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.040
Let's go with a very thin lumberjack.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.040
It's clothing optional.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.040
Yeah, I like this guy's spirit

17:07.040 --> 17:09.040
and he looks like a...

17:09.040 --> 17:11.040
This is...

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
He just looks like a Harmontown listener.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.040
What's your name, sir?

17:15.040 --> 17:17.040
What's your name? Jackson.

17:17.040 --> 17:23.040
He's coming up and up and up.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.040
All right, Jackson, you want to...

17:31.040 --> 17:33.040
For the listeners at home,

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
Jackson looks like a police composite sketch of me

17:35.040 --> 17:37.040
but saying he's attractive.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
I thought you said crack dealer.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.040
You said attractive.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
Yeah.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.040
An attractive crack dealer.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.040
All right, so what I also want to do

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
with each guest we bring up

17:49.040 --> 17:51.040
is want to confirm your authenticity as an Australian.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
So I've written some Australian phrases

17:53.040 --> 17:55.040
and we'll make sure you...

17:55.040 --> 17:57.040
When you read them.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
Let's do that top one in boldface there.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.040
You see that one?

18:01.040 --> 18:03.040
That one.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.040
That one.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.040
When you do that top one in boldface there,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.040
you see that one?

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
Word around the bushes, you stole my sunnies.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.040
Prepare to die by knife.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.040
Sounds pretty Australian to me.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.040
But if you ramped up...

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
I put a little mustard on it.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.040
You see how laid-back he is?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
I know.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.040
No, I'm not.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.040
Guess what? I'm not Australian.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.040
I'm ashamed to tell you.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.040
Try to say that you like my hat

18:31.040 --> 18:33.040
in a laid-back fashion like Jackson here.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.040
Oh, I like that hat, mate.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.040
It's getting there, you're getting there.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.040
I like that hat, mate.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.040
Because I'm concentrating on my vowels.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.040
Who does that? That's not a relaxed thing to do.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.040
I have to concentrate. They don't.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.040
They're Australian.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.040
I didn't come here to coach you guys.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.040
But, you know, you kind of laid it on thick at the end.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.040
All right.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.040
You know, the eyes are oise, but not in a cartoon way.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.040
Have some respect.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
Well, my accent is quite neutral as it is.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.040
So I always feel self-conscious about

19:03.040 --> 19:05.040
not being Australian.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.040
Well, isn't Brisbane more

19:07.040 --> 19:09.040
accent-y?

19:09.040 --> 19:11.040
Yes.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.040
Brisbane is a...

19:13.040 --> 19:15.040
Oh, and by the way,

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
Brisbane is a big country town.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.040
Oh, by the way, they don't tell you...

19:19.040 --> 19:21.040
You're not supposed to tell them that.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.040
They don't like...

19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
No one wants to be called a big country town.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.040
Oh, we've got...

19:27.040 --> 19:29.040
It's like a country town stitched together

19:29.040 --> 19:31.040
in a country town laid on top of each other.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
Because, oh, we've got things and junk.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.040
Whoa!

19:35.040 --> 19:37.040
Forget about it.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.040
Sir, I happen to love Melbourne.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.040
Melbourne's a guy.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.040
Melbourne's a guy.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.040
It's beautiful here.

19:45.040 --> 19:47.040
That brings me to the question.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
Why is it called capsicum?

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
They're bell peppers.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.040
Why?

19:59.040 --> 20:01.040
Is it...

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
I don't know.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.040
You want to pass on that question?

20:05.040 --> 20:07.040
I don't know the answer to that one.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
Why was the Ferris wheel

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
$6 million?

20:11.040 --> 20:13.040
Well...

20:13.040 --> 20:15.040
I don't know why it cost

20:15.040 --> 20:17.040
$6 million, but I do know

20:17.040 --> 20:19.040
at one point this probably

20:19.040 --> 20:21.040
didn't help with the budget.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.040
It got really hot one year,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.040
and it melted, basically.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.040
It melted?

20:27.040 --> 20:29.040
Structurally unsound.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.040
The Ferris wheel melted.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.040
That's what the guy said.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.040
It wasn't meant for summer weather or something.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.040
Did it test it?

20:37.040 --> 20:39.040
What part of it melted?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
The whole thing.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.040
It buckled.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.040
Jesus Christ.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.040
Have you ever been on it, Jackson?

20:47.040 --> 20:49.040
No.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.040
Not only that, but it overlooks

20:51.040 --> 20:53.040
the docklands.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.040
There's nothing to see there.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.040
I've witnessed a shipping container.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.040
Oh, the joy.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.040
They had to move it, right?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.040
They had to pick it up and move it at one point?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.040
Or no, they moved to a Home Depot?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
I think they were going to,

21:07.040 --> 21:09.040
but I think they just planned, because there's nothing around it.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.040
I think they'd build stuff around it instead.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.040
In London, they have one of those.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.040
I don't know if that was what this is based on,

21:15.040 --> 21:17.040
because it's called the I.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.040
Is the London one smaller?

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
No, the London one is much bigger.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
They were so fucking proud of it.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
You're an American, you go to London,

21:25.040 --> 21:27.040
and you're like, what is this shitty ass thing?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.040
And they're like, excuse me, Govna?

21:29.040 --> 21:31.040
They bristle.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.040
Like, whether they're tea drinking,

21:33.040 --> 21:35.040
lily, lily, lily...

21:35.040 --> 21:37.040
They were all up in arms about it at the beginning.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.040
They thought it was an eyesore, but now they like it.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.040
Same with the Eiffel Tower.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.040
All the Parisians hated the Eiffel Tower.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.040
You can't fucking...

21:45.040 --> 21:47.040
It happens that fast, huh?

21:47.040 --> 21:49.040
Maybe you guys love this little white chocolate fairs wheel.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.040
Yeah, because copy...

21:51.040 --> 21:53.040
How long has it been here?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
If the Eiffel Tower was second,

21:55.040 --> 21:57.040
I don't think people would have fallen in love with it after a while.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.040
They'd have gone, yeah, no, it's still just a copy

21:59.040 --> 22:01.040
of the shittier thing.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.040
Right. How long has it been here?

22:03.040 --> 22:05.040
I think it's been operating for two, three years.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.040
Uh-huh.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.040
By applause, who has been on the...

22:09.040 --> 22:11.040
Five, ten...

22:11.040 --> 22:13.040
Three people!

22:15.040 --> 22:17.040
Well, there really would be a cooper

22:17.040 --> 22:19.040
if it was fast.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.040
Nobody's going on the fairs wheel

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
after they announce...

22:23.040 --> 22:25.040
Release notes!

22:27.040 --> 22:29.040
Fixed melting bug!

22:29.040 --> 22:31.040
No one's buying that app!

22:31.040 --> 22:33.040
I live in Los Angeles.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.040
I've never been on the subway.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.040
I'm not going. There's earthquakes all the goddamn time.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
You're not getting me into a hole.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.040
Addressed a problem where the fairs wheel melted.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.040
All right.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.040
Well, I'll give you a bonus one

22:45.040 --> 22:47.040
since you're all the way up here.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.040
But we just want to double confirm this.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.040
So...

22:51.040 --> 22:53.040
We were told at one point

22:53.040 --> 22:55.040
that in Queensland, I know now we're in Victoria,

22:55.040 --> 22:57.040
we were told that in Queensland

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
that Jeff is slang

22:59.040 --> 23:01.040
for finger-banging.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.040
Like, getting

23:03.040 --> 23:05.040
gifed. It's fact. It's true.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.040
Have you heard that? Not only of the butt.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.040
Oh, really?

23:09.040 --> 23:11.040
No, you just... Well, we got...

23:11.040 --> 23:13.040
No, no, no, no, but you're...

23:13.040 --> 23:15.040
Has anybody here ever heard of getting

23:15.040 --> 23:17.040
gifed being finger-blasted?

23:17.040 --> 23:19.040
No.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.040
Only make noise

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
if it's a yes. Otherwise, we assume it's a no.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
Right.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.040
Okay, so there's a couple people.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.040
Enough people.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
It seems like a great place to get

23:31.040 --> 23:33.040
gifed to be atop the fairs wheel.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.040
Right.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.040
I'm telling you buckles.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.040
Whenever I'm learning someone's name,

23:39.040 --> 23:41.040
my nervous system is going,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.040
my nervous system's name is so important,

23:43.040 --> 23:45.040
so I never remember the name. Jackson.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.040
What's your name? Jackson.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.040
Let's hear it for Jackson.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.040
Jackson!

23:51.040 --> 23:53.040
All right.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.040
Thank you.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.040
See, you've burned through them.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.040
I don't know what I'm talking about.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.040
I want to teach him how to play bass

24:01.040 --> 24:03.040
and start a band.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.040
Like, he has great hair.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.040
That was some good hair.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.040
Dan is now wandering amongst the crowd.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.040
Australian's because they're wonderful.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.040
They have a rare blend of

24:13.040 --> 24:15.040
jocularity and warmth.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.040
Yeah, jocularity

24:17.040 --> 24:19.040
piece of shit.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.040
Fucking question. I mean, I'm American.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.040
I'll fucking drone strike your ass.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.040
Wow.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.040
Shit, fucking.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.040
Their army invented Wi-Fi, they're so bored.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.040
Do you know that, Jeff?

24:31.040 --> 24:33.040
Yeah, by a woman.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.040
Australia's so fucked up,

24:35.040 --> 24:37.040
their women are inventing shit down here.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.040
You know?

24:39.040 --> 24:41.040
Wow.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.040
That's been our show. Thanks for coming, everybody.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.040
Yeah, no, I have to remember.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.040
So, yeah.

24:47.040 --> 24:49.040
In America now, the liberals,

24:49.040 --> 24:51.040
not liberals with a capital L,

24:51.040 --> 24:53.040
liberals with a small L,

24:53.040 --> 24:55.040
are the ones who are now constitution nuts

24:55.040 --> 24:57.040
and are probably stockpiling weapons.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.040
Because there's a Nazi

24:59.040 --> 25:01.040
that got elected.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.040
Over here,

25:03.040 --> 25:05.040
people who want to secede from the crown,

25:05.040 --> 25:07.040
those are progressives, Jeff,

25:07.040 --> 25:09.040
and they're called labor, even though in the states,

25:09.040 --> 25:11.040
people who labor are the people that elected

25:11.040 --> 25:13.040
Trump.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.040
But would never want to be called labor,

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
because they're so fancy, they're just a lottery ticket away

25:17.040 --> 25:19.040
from being president.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.040
Hey, John, is that Bar open yet?

25:21.040 --> 25:23.040
I just wanted to straighten

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
that shit out. It's very complicated.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.040
It sounds nice.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.040
But when in doubt, if you're having a bad show,

25:29.040 --> 25:31.040
you just go Pauline Hansen's a piece of shit,

25:31.040 --> 25:33.040
and then they all applaud.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.040
Pauline Hansen is the

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
Ipswich of government.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.040
I don't even know what an Ipswich is.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
Ipswich sounds like it.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
When I was in high school,

25:43.040 --> 25:45.040
there was an ice cream cookie

25:45.040 --> 25:47.040
sandwich called a chip switch.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.040
That's all I think of.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.040
I think of delicious ice cream and cookies.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.040
You know what a Pauline Hansen is.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.040
It's when you take a picture.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.040
Sorry, what was that, sir?

25:57.040 --> 25:59.040
You're fucking wrong.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.040
He's just wrong about everything.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.040
No, no, Ipswich

26:03.040 --> 26:05.040
apparently is not all about ice cream and cookies.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.040
Wait, is it just a complete shit hole?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.040
Well, I think that he's...

26:09.040 --> 26:11.040
Yeah.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
What?

26:13.040 --> 26:15.040
16 and pregnant.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.040
Well, that's very brave of you to admit that, madam.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.040
This is the place

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
where we can open up to each other, you guys.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
Is that what's on the license plate frames?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.040
Ipswich?

26:25.040 --> 26:27.040
Garrett says don't die.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.040
Drive safe for whatever the fuck.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.040
All right, well, I want to do gender balance.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.040
Not that we adhere to a binary

26:33.040 --> 26:35.040
cisnormative fucking thing,

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
but I'm just saying

26:37.040 --> 26:39.040
from the other end of that spectrum...

26:39.040 --> 26:41.040
Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan,

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
don't turn around. Don't turn around.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.040
Just don't stop moving.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.040
Just don't fucking turn around.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.040
Just be very still.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.040
Her visual acuity is based on movement, Dan.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.040
Fuck it.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.040
If you're going to turn around, turn around very slowly.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.040
Jesus.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.040
Okay.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
I thought it was a huntsman.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
They're everywhere.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.040
All right.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.040
Are you coming up?

27:07.040 --> 27:09.040
Or are you just coming back from the bathroom?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.040
No, she was going to her seat.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
Oh, okay.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.040
She just took a giant shit.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.040
She's coming back to her seat.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.040
Did you want to come up?

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
Yeah, come on up.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
Poop lady, everybody.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
Hello, madam.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.040
Hello, madam.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
Hello, madam.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.040
Hello, madam.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.040
Sorry, I couldn't quite hear that.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.040
Your name again?

27:35.040 --> 27:37.040
Claire, Claire, everybody.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.040
Welcome, Claire.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.040
Claire, okay, Claire.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
I'm going to confirm your Australian authenticity.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.040
Could you read this top line in bold face for me?

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
Don't go in the loop for a while.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.040
I just dropped a polline handsome.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
I wrote that in the green room.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.040
And then it worked perfectly.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.040
Who would imagine that I do have taken a shit?

27:55.040 --> 27:57.040
I didn't hear a thing, I swear.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.040
Perfect timing.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
There's no coincidences on the gunner, Dan.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.040
Everything eventually leads there.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.040
Okay, here's your question.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.040
Oh, what we've been doing while you were pooping is we were...

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
Fill me in.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.040
We're bringing Australians up and we're asking them questions.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.040
She might have been doing coke.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.040
We don't know, Dan.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.040
I have a question.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
I could ask.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.040
Do you have a question?

28:21.040 --> 28:23.040
I could ask.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.040
Do you have a burning one?

28:25.040 --> 28:27.040
Let's just say the same one.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.040
Why is it called Capsicum?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.040
Well, I wasn't aware that bell pepper and capsicum

28:31.040 --> 28:33.040
were the same thing for such a long time.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.040
So I know you guys called chili pepper.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.040
Yeah.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.040
Chili peppers, you know.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.040
So I don't know if that was always confusion for me,

28:41.040 --> 28:43.040
but no, I can't answer your question.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.040
I got one. Can I ask one, Dan?

28:45.040 --> 28:47.040
Maybe it's on your list, I don't know.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.040
Because we don't prepare anything.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.040
I went to a place in Brisbane to get a burger,

28:51.040 --> 28:53.040
a veggie burger,

28:53.040 --> 28:55.040
and there are three cheese options.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.040
One was like a fancy Parmesan kind of situation.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.040
And the other two

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
were cheddar and the other

29:01.040 --> 29:03.040
tasty.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.040
Okay.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.040
So I woke up and this burger shack was really good.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.040
They're all Korean

29:09.040 --> 29:11.040
people that work behind the...

29:11.040 --> 29:13.040
It's a Korean-run burger restaurant.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.040
And I was like, what is tasty cheese?

29:15.040 --> 29:17.040
That's one of our cheeses.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.040
You know, it's tasty cheese.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.040
And we just

29:21.040 --> 29:23.040
did a Celtic knot mobius strip conversation.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.040
Yeah.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
Cody took a picture of it.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.040
There was three cheese crackers and the flavors

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
were mild,

29:31.040 --> 29:33.040
or low-tasty...

29:33.040 --> 29:35.040
Extra tasty, super tasty.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.040
It's like, mother fucker,

29:37.040 --> 29:39.040
give me the tastiest cracker.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.040
Why would I want the least...

29:41.040 --> 29:43.040
I don't have time for this shit.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.040
I'm American.

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
If you got a less tasty one,

29:47.040 --> 29:49.040
give it to your family.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.040
Don't sell it to me.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
People don't know this about them,

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
but when he's talking about crackers,

29:55.040 --> 29:57.040
he becomes Bill Cosby.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.040
Well, you've given me the perfect opportunity

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
to talk about how American cheese is not cheese.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.040
I'm sure everyone here will agree with me.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.040
Thank you.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
I mean, it's literally...

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
They call it processed cheese food.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.040
Also, you caught us at our least patriotic.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.040
Like, you could say anything you wanted.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.040
The Statue of Liberty is a dildo.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.040
Probably.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.040
But no, basically,

30:21.040 --> 30:23.040
any cheese versus American.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.040
I personally haven't tried it,

30:25.040 --> 30:27.040
but I'm sure all of us can tell just by looking at it.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.040
It's not cheese.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
No, I mean...

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
American cheese is not cheese.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.040
Like, are singles?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.040
Why is that on the table?

30:37.040 --> 30:39.040
American cheese is like a building material.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.040
Like, it's fucking...

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
Jesus Christ.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.040
For the listeners.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.040
Dan threatened to show off his rippling abs.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.040
But, yeah, what you guys call, like, single cheese?

30:57.040 --> 30:59.040
I call that plastic cheese.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.040
I don't know if I'm alone here, but...

31:01.040 --> 31:03.040
We all hate it.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.040
No one likes it.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.040
No, it's not...

31:07.040 --> 31:09.040
The bar was low, you know?

31:09.040 --> 31:11.040
Like, what else are you better than...

31:11.040 --> 31:13.040
Also, your guys...

31:13.040 --> 31:15.040
Your guys' Kit Kats taste better here.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
Oh, so good.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.040
Like, the chocolate here is better than American chocolate.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.040
We have shit chocolate.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.040
Yeah, from what I hear,

31:23.040 --> 31:25.040
it's like American, Australian,

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
and then English as far as sugar goes.

31:27.040 --> 31:29.040
So, England is like the most sweet.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.040
Yeah, their sweeties are pretty good.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.040
Yeah, no, I have a British friend who says

31:33.040 --> 31:35.040
Australian chocolate just tastes awful.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.040
I can't find here.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.040
And Canada, and the thinking one is

31:39.040 --> 31:41.040
the coffee crisp.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
Have you ever had that? No.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.040
Oh, it's a fucking...

31:45.040 --> 31:47.040
Yeah.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.040
Okay, I love the coffee crisp.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.040
Did they have them here? Did they have them in Oz?

31:51.040 --> 31:53.040
You're Canadian. Those are good, right?

31:53.040 --> 31:55.040
Yeah, it's like a giant coffee-flavored Kit Kat.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.040
I'll fucking get you there.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.040
See you all the way there, Holmes.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.040
You know, there's more...

32:05.040 --> 32:07.040
Coffee crisp.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.040
Hey, Jeff...

32:09.040 --> 32:11.040
Wait, we never asked...

32:11.040 --> 32:13.040
I already forgot your name. Claire.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.040
Jackson.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.040
Miss Jackson, if you're nasty.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.040
Claire.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.040
What's his name from Die Hard?

32:21.040 --> 32:23.040
Wait, did we ever ask her a question?

32:23.040 --> 32:25.040
Oh, here's a question.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.040
Where are the homeless people?

32:27.040 --> 32:29.040
Where are they?

32:29.040 --> 32:31.040
I can't speak for Brisbane,

32:31.040 --> 32:33.040
but in Melbourne, once it hits nine,

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
they come out at night.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
So they have homes, maybe?

32:37.040 --> 32:39.040
Do they have homes?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.040
I'm not from Melbourne, personally,

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
so I can't really say.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.040
I'm usually here at night, so...

32:45.040 --> 32:47.040
Oh, shit.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.040
Oh, it's turning Brisbane in here.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.040
It's getting Brisbane-y!

32:51.040 --> 32:53.040
All right, well,

32:53.040 --> 32:55.040
let's have a hand for Claire, and we're going to...

32:55.040 --> 32:57.040
Claire, everybody.

32:57.040 --> 33:03.040
Thank you very much.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.040
I'm going to go get another Aussie.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.040
It's been good, right?

33:11.040 --> 33:13.040
No, no, it's fine.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.040
You're a fisher of people.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.040
Oh, like Jesus.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.040
Yeah.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.040
He made the angels.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.040
There's a holy ghost.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.040
Ghosts are involved there.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.040
God can be a ghost, and the angels are probably...

33:27.040 --> 33:29.040
That's Jesus' ghost.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.040
Because he died.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.040
That's not true.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.040
Prove it.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.040
Do you have any bishops in the house?

33:37.040 --> 33:39.040
I got my eye on this guy.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.040
What's your name, sir?

33:41.040 --> 33:43.040
Owen.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.040
Owen, come on up.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.040
Owen.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.040
Making his way to the stage, and leaps and bounce.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.040
All right.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.040
What's going on with these guys?

33:55.040 --> 33:57.040
Look at these fuckers. Everybody looks cool.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.040
Hello, Owen.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.040
How's it going?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.040
I like your pants.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.040
I like those pants a lot.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.040
I didn't even play music, because I was too dazzled by his trousers.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.040
Those are exciting.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.040
Am I playing this microphone?

34:11.040 --> 34:13.040
Yeah, yeah.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.040
Try this top one to see if you're Australian.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.040
Which one's this one?

34:17.040 --> 34:19.040
The top one in boldface.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.040
How's the serenity?

34:21.040 --> 34:23.040
So much serenity.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.040
All right.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.040
Try that other one.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.040
Yank train.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.040
I put a boogie doll down.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.040
I kind of made that one up.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.040
Okay, all right.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
Try this top one.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.040
No, no.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.040
I can't be doing that one.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
A lot of girls tell me my dick looks like a boomerang,

34:43.040 --> 34:45.040
because it's flat and wouldn't invent.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.040
I don't think you're Australian.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.040
Well, both my parents are Irish.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.040
But I've lived here all my life.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.040
Oh, okay.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.040
Pick it up for Broad Meadows.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.040
Yeah.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.040
That's why you're wearing a chart and have green hair.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
You really are Irish.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.040
A different take.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.040
Okay, so here's our question for you.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.040
Forgot your name.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.040
Owen.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.040
You're three for three then.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.040
That's fine.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.040
Okay, Owen.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.040
Is it isolation

35:17.040 --> 35:19.040
you endure for control

35:19.040 --> 35:21.040
or is it that once you gain control

35:21.040 --> 35:23.040
you crave isolation?

35:27.040 --> 35:29.040
What does that even mean?

35:29.040 --> 35:31.040
Yeah.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.040
It means I'm about to get a podcasty.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.040
Oh, shit.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.040
All right, maybe that's a...

35:37.040 --> 35:39.040
Wait, wait, wait.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.040
I'll save that question for someone else.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.040
All right, let's see.

35:45.040 --> 35:47.040
Have you tried... Have you played

35:47.040 --> 35:49.040
Mario Run yet?

35:49.040 --> 35:51.040
Mario Run?

35:51.040 --> 35:53.040
It's on the iPhone? Okay.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
A lot of people.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.040
Don't feel bad.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.040
All right, okay. Owen, what are utes

35:59.040 --> 36:01.040
and why are they scandalous?

36:01.040 --> 36:03.040
Because I suppose

36:03.040 --> 36:05.040
a lot of people fuck at the back of them

36:05.040 --> 36:07.040
in country towns and stuff.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.040
So what's a ute?

36:09.040 --> 36:11.040
It's like a truck. It's a truck.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.040
That's what the deal is.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.040
It's a pickup truck.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.040
Okay, like a lorry.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.040
We call them lorries.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.040
It's a lot of crazy. People drive utes.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.040
It's for like tradies and stuff, I suppose.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.040
What are the pickup trucks

36:25.040 --> 36:27.040
that have like weird cages in the back?

36:27.040 --> 36:29.040
Is everyone just like

36:29.040 --> 36:31.040
captured a crocodile? What are those?

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
You know what I'm talking about?

36:33.040 --> 36:35.040
For the homeless?

36:35.040 --> 36:37.040
All right, okay.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.040
We got that sorted.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.040
I think someone said Dippy Bag

36:41.040 --> 36:43.040
that truly answers the question.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.040
This is...

36:45.040 --> 36:47.040
It's really... It's happening again.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.040
No, I know.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.040
Yeah, I mean it's...

36:51.040 --> 36:53.040
It's our fault. We're too liberal

36:53.040 --> 36:55.040
with the lower case.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.040
Someone either yelled haggis or faggots.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.040
I don't know what that one was.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.040
Well, we can't drag Owen up here

37:01.040 --> 37:03.040
and expect him to be a ute expert.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.040
I think you're asking the wrong person.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.040
I'm not a type of person that drives a ute.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.040
Do you have any other Australian questions?

37:09.040 --> 37:11.040
Um, okay.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.040
Uh...

37:13.040 --> 37:15.040
Yes. No.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.040
I have a question.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.040
Owen, what do you do here in Brisbane?

37:19.040 --> 37:21.040
I mean, sorry, Melbourne.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.040
Fucking...

37:23.040 --> 37:25.040
Go back to Ipswich.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.040
I just wanted to see if you guys were listening, man.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.040
What do you do here in Melbourne?

37:29.040 --> 37:31.040
I roll burritos in a place called Fonda.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.040
Nice.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.040
Yeah, man.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.040
On Chapel Street.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.040
What's the secret to a properly rolled burrito?

37:39.040 --> 37:41.040
I just love, man.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.040
I love it, man.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.040
It's why my burritos...

37:45.040 --> 37:47.040
We're from Southern California.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
When I travel to places that aren't Southern California,

37:49.040 --> 37:51.040
I don't really go for Mexican food

37:51.040 --> 37:53.040
because I get so much at home.

37:53.040 --> 37:55.040
But there's a lot of Mexican joints around here.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.040
What you really want is an

37:57.040 --> 37:59.040
Australian-Ira steward rolling your burrito.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.040
You really do. With love.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.040
Is the Mexican food good here?

38:03.040 --> 38:05.040
No, no, no. It's terrible.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.040
It's terrible.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.040
It's terrible.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.040
It's really good.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.040
I was in London for a couple weeks

38:13.040 --> 38:15.040
and there was all these Mexican places.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.040
I'm not going to get guacamole

38:17.040 --> 38:19.040
from London avocados.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.040
I don't think I coincidentally

38:21.040 --> 38:23.040
ate at the only good restaurant in Melbourne.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.040
There must be great restaurants here

38:25.040 --> 38:27.040
because I had the best Italian dinner in my life tonight

38:27.040 --> 38:29.040
before the show.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.040
But there's a lot of Italian people here

38:31.040 --> 38:33.040
and they kind of grew this country.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.040
There wasn't a lot of Mexican dudes

38:35.040 --> 38:37.040
that came down and said,

38:37.040 --> 38:39.040
I want to build a restaurant here.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.040
Both my bosses are Australian dudes

38:41.040 --> 38:43.040
that spent two weeks in Mexico.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.040
So it's just like

38:45.040 --> 38:47.040
you can't spend two weeks

38:47.040 --> 38:49.040
and know how to make food.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.040
This is ridiculous, man.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.040
Are they Australian or Irish?

38:53.040 --> 38:55.040
They're Australian dudes.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.040
So they just kind of backpack down there?

38:57.040 --> 38:59.040
Yeah, they're not even chefs.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.040
One was a firefighter.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.040
It doesn't make any sense.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.040
Is that the logo?

39:05.040 --> 39:07.040
A firefighter and a lawyer?

39:07.040 --> 39:09.040
There's a pen and a hose crossing each other.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.040
And one guy said to the other,

39:11.040 --> 39:13.040
I love these burritos!

39:13.040 --> 39:15.040
Yeah, yeah.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.040
I like that burrito mic!

39:17.040 --> 39:19.040
I don't know, it's confusing.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.040
The burritos are great.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.040
But you can't just go down and get high in Mexico

39:23.040 --> 39:25.040
over two weeks and come back and think

39:25.040 --> 39:27.040
that you know how to make a goddamn burrito.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.040
The first burrito they opened up

39:29.040 --> 39:31.040
was visibly.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.040
Are you scared of kangaroos?

39:33.040 --> 39:35.040
Yeah, man.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.040
They're scary, right?

39:37.040 --> 39:39.040
They have human arms.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.040
And if they bite you,

39:41.040 --> 39:43.040
they try and kill your dog.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.040
And if they bite you, you become one, right?

39:45.040 --> 39:47.040
Yeah.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.040
And you'd have to kill the head of the bloodline

39:49.040 --> 39:51.040
to gain your freedom.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.040
If a kangaroo walked up to you,

39:53.040 --> 39:55.040
you're not going to go, oh, adorable.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.040
You're going to put your fucking fists up.

39:57.040 --> 39:59.040
And that plays right into their game, right?

39:59.040 --> 40:01.040
That's when they pull out a mob of kangaroos.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.040
It's not a fun time.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.040
They travel in packs?

40:05.040 --> 40:07.040
Yeah, they travel in mobs.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.040
It's like a murder of crows.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.040
Just like across the streets of Melbourne at night?

40:11.040 --> 40:13.040
Yeah.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.040
That's the...

40:15.040 --> 40:17.040
All right, well...

40:17.040 --> 40:19.040
And that's where the homeless people go.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.040
They get into fucking one-on-one fights.

40:21.040 --> 40:23.040
They morph into kangaroos.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.040
Yeah, I thought maybe there was

40:25.040 --> 40:27.040
a Highlander thing happening.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.040
All right.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.040
Well, let's have a hand for...

40:31.040 --> 40:33.040
I already forgot.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.040
Thank you, brother.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.040
They're good people.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.040
They're polite.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.040
They're warm.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.040
They're jocular.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.040
You fucking dick.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.040
It's a good word.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.040
Jolly, silly.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.040
They're amicable.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.040
They're gregarious.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.040
They're Karangamagi.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.040
That guy just keeps yelling weird ass shit up there.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.040
I think he said bangerang.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.040
But also it's okay if you...

41:05.040 --> 41:07.040
What's bangerang?

41:07.040 --> 41:09.040
Some bullshit.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.040
It's from Hook.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.040
It's a line from Hook.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.040
It's what the kids say when they jump around

41:15.040 --> 41:17.040
and ruin the pre-ruined myth of Peter Pan.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.040
Why is it every eight years

41:19.040 --> 41:21.040
rich people in Hollywood think

41:21.040 --> 41:23.040
that poor people

41:23.040 --> 41:25.040
indulge their fucking youth obsession

41:25.040 --> 41:27.040
with this...

41:27.040 --> 41:29.040
Who the fuck cares about Peter Pan?

41:29.040 --> 41:31.040
Rich people love Peter Pan.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.040
Every eight years, some director's like,

41:33.040 --> 41:35.040
I love Peter Pan.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.040
Yeah, because you're fucking weirdo.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.040
You were raised in a vat

41:39.040 --> 41:41.040
underneath Malibu.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.040
Peter Pan is lame.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.040
Sorry, I didn't know Peter Pan was here.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.040
For me,

41:47.040 --> 41:49.040
for me,

41:49.040 --> 41:51.040
the interesting thing about Peter Pan

41:51.040 --> 41:53.040
was Wendy in that little night dress.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.040
I mean, the dog was...

41:55.040 --> 41:57.040
I was 6'2", motherfucker.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.040
I didn't start watching

41:59.040 --> 42:01.040
when I was 28.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.040
I'd like to get some of that Wendy.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.040
But you know what's...

42:05.040 --> 42:07.040
I mean, you ever see...

42:07.040 --> 42:09.040
You ever see like a...

42:09.040 --> 42:11.040
A grown man naked?

42:11.040 --> 42:13.040
You know, like a lady

42:13.040 --> 42:15.040
dressed as Peter Pan? That's pretty hot.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.040
Yeah, because I have a short

42:17.040 --> 42:19.040
hair fetish.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.040
Girls dressed like elves,

42:21.040 --> 42:23.040
I'm pretty into it.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.040
There was a girl one time

42:25.040 --> 42:27.040
that worked at this bar in our neighborhood

42:27.040 --> 42:29.040
and she dressed as David Bowie from Man It Felt Earth

42:29.040 --> 42:31.040
with the short red hair

42:31.040 --> 42:33.040
and kind of the Aladdin-sane kind of Bowie.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.040
Like a Pauline Henson kind of.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.040
Look.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.040
You see a picture of her? Huh?

42:39.040 --> 42:41.040
Pauline Henson kind of looks like the Man It Felt Earth.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.040
A little bit.

42:43.040 --> 42:45.040
Really? Do you see a picture of her?

42:45.040 --> 42:47.040
Doesn't she look like that?

42:47.040 --> 42:49.040
They showed me a picture after I talked about her

42:49.040 --> 42:51.040
for 40 minutes last night.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.040
There she is. I was like, oh, she looks like a...

42:53.040 --> 42:55.040
Did you go home and have some private night thoughts

42:55.040 --> 42:57.040
about Pauline Henson that night?

42:57.040 --> 42:59.040
You know,

42:59.040 --> 43:01.040
judge not,

43:01.040 --> 43:03.040
lest ye be judged, Melbourne.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.040
Did you give it the old

43:05.040 --> 43:07.040
banger ring?

43:07.040 --> 43:09.040
I jeffed her.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.040
Let's hold Jeff Pauline

43:11.040 --> 43:13.040
Henson tonight, shall we?

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
You do nothing else tonight.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
Try to Jeff Pauline Henson

43:17.040 --> 43:19.040
with all your heart.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.040
That's the only way we'll win.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.040
We're not going to win with shame and hate.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.040
We can't wait for them to become honest.

43:25.040 --> 43:27.040
Just Jeff.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.040
Jeff the liberals.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.040
That's a weird calling them liberals.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.040
All right.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.040
So,

43:35.040 --> 43:37.040
I don't know if this is interesting,

43:37.040 --> 43:39.040
but by all means, lay it out.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.040
I only paid $1,000 for a ticket.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.040
And what? Fuck you.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.040
I flew here.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.040
It was expensive. Well, yeah, because it was first class.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
You know what? Keep pulling threads, man.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.040
Maybe I won't come back. Fine with me.

43:51.040 --> 43:53.040
Fine with you.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.040
This is actually how Dan thinks.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
He just...

43:57.040 --> 43:59.040
He'd say, it's the way they invented the boomerang.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.040
Very passive aggressive people.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.040
Did you just throw

44:03.040 --> 44:05.040
something at me? No.

44:05.040 --> 44:09.040
If I did, why would I still have it?

44:17.040 --> 44:19.040
I meant because it was past them

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
and then it was coming back around

44:21.040 --> 44:23.040
to hit them in the back of their head.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.040
Yeah, but mine was funnier.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
Yeah.

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
So, we were on the airplane coming out

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
and Cody, my girlfriend,

44:37.040 --> 44:39.040
her device,

44:39.040 --> 44:41.040
the screen thing

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
got stuck on the setting

44:43.040 --> 44:45.040
for blind people

44:45.040 --> 44:47.040
where it describes

44:47.040 --> 44:49.040
in audio everything that's happening on screen.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.040
Oh, yeah. The video screened for the films

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
on the flight.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.040
And then we, like,

44:55.040 --> 44:57.040
lean into it.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.040
You know how all the movies begin

44:59.040 --> 45:01.040
with logos?

45:01.040 --> 45:03.040
Title cards and things.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.040
The person that

45:05.040 --> 45:07.040
describes the movie for the blind

45:07.040 --> 45:09.040
describes the logos, and I wrote

45:09.040 --> 45:11.040
three of them down.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.040
It was amazing.

45:13.040 --> 45:15.040
So, here.

45:15.040 --> 45:17.040
Yeah.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.040
And then the guy goes,

45:19.040 --> 45:21.040
searchlights sweep an evening sky

45:21.040 --> 45:23.040
carrying a towering edifice

45:23.040 --> 45:25.040
in the form of 20th Century Fox

45:25.040 --> 45:27.040
with the lights of Hollywood,

45:27.040 --> 45:29.040
palm trees, and the hills

45:29.040 --> 45:31.040
beyond.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.040
He says that.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.040
To me, it feels like I'm sure we have blind

45:35.040 --> 45:37.040
listeners. I mean, I would hope we do.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.040
I would hope that maybe we could be a part

45:39.040 --> 45:41.040
of a visually impaired person's

45:41.040 --> 45:43.040
enjoyment of life.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.040
And so I guess I confess to that person

45:45.040 --> 45:47.040
and it would be fun

45:47.040 --> 45:49.040
to talk to a visually impaired

45:49.040 --> 45:51.040
person about this stuff, but

45:51.040 --> 45:53.040
do we have anybody tonight by any chance?

45:53.040 --> 45:55.040
No!

45:55.040 --> 45:57.040
Don't jump!

45:57.040 --> 45:59.040
Are you

45:59.040 --> 46:01.040
visually impaired

46:01.040 --> 46:03.040
up there?

46:03.040 --> 46:05.040
Like,

46:05.040 --> 46:07.040
you're not blind yet.

46:07.040 --> 46:09.040
You're going blind.

46:09.040 --> 46:11.040
Jesus Christ!

46:11.040 --> 46:13.040
This guy is not

46:13.040 --> 46:15.040
fucking convinced, baby.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.040
You're

46:17.040 --> 46:19.040
going blind.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.040
How, uh,

46:21.040 --> 46:23.040
you shut it.

46:23.040 --> 46:25.040
Are you going blind too?

46:25.040 --> 46:27.040
Yeah.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.040
It doesn't matter.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.040
I think we've gotten off of the track here.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.040
I was just

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
I was just

46:35.040 --> 46:37.040
reading these descriptions. This guy is just going

46:37.040 --> 46:39.040
blind drunk. She's actually got a fucking

46:39.040 --> 46:41.040
condition. We're all going to be blind in 10 years,

46:41.040 --> 46:43.040
sir.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.040
Basically, my eyes are going.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.040
Alright, that didn't land.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
What's your name up there, miss?

46:49.040 --> 46:51.040
Alice.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.040
How long do you think you have until

46:53.040 --> 46:55.040
you're completely blind?

46:57.040 --> 46:59.040
Say what?

46:59.040 --> 47:01.040
Five 10 years?

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
So what percentage vision do you currently

47:03.040 --> 47:05.040
have?

47:05.040 --> 47:07.040
Seven.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.040
You fucking

47:09.040 --> 47:11.040
kind of fucking Jeff you so hard, man.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.040
Jackson style,

47:13.040 --> 47:15.040
right in the ass.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.040
World's worst life coach.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.040
Listen, we're going to go to the show, but you're going

47:19.040 --> 47:21.040
blind. Why don't you stay on the balcony?

47:21.040 --> 47:23.040
I'm going to use the good ticket.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.040
And if you need any help or advice, I'll just yell

47:25.040 --> 47:27.040
back at you.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
Okay.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.040
And then it'll be $500.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.040
But, well,

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
look, I mean, I don't, well,

47:35.040 --> 47:37.040
you can, I'm going to ask you a yes or no question.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.040
It was at Alice, and

47:39.040 --> 47:41.040
you can just yell down.

47:41.040 --> 47:43.040
And to me, when I hear somebody

47:43.040 --> 47:45.040
describing something

47:45.040 --> 47:47.040
for the blind in this intense

47:47.040 --> 47:49.040
like rapturous voice,

47:49.040 --> 47:51.040
to me that seems almost

47:51.040 --> 47:53.040
mocking. Like,

47:53.040 --> 47:55.040
you wouldn't believe what you're seeing

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
what I'm seeing and you can't see.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.040
Like, oh my god, it's

47:59.040 --> 48:01.040
crazy. The lights are alive

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
over the 20th century.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
Doesn't that seem,

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
is that offensive?

48:07.040 --> 48:09.040
Yeah, probably.

48:09.040 --> 48:11.040
Yeah, that's as close as we're going to get.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.040
She's not blind yet.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.040
She's, like me, not blind

48:15.040 --> 48:17.040
and has my answer,

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
probably. We really need

48:19.040 --> 48:21.040
a blind person down here immediately

48:21.040 --> 48:23.040
if you're listening, make some calls.

48:23.040 --> 48:25.040
But anyways, but that's a, yeah,

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
but it's, and then, so here's

48:27.040 --> 48:29.040
two more.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.040
I rewind it a thousand times and,

48:31.040 --> 48:33.040
and...

48:33.040 --> 48:35.040
Dan and Cody were laughing so hard

48:35.040 --> 48:37.040
as the middle of the night flying across the ocean

48:37.040 --> 48:39.040
and they're just giggling so loud

48:39.040 --> 48:41.040
like, what are you guys watching?

48:41.040 --> 48:43.040
It's so completely descriptive

48:43.040 --> 48:45.040
and the guy is really into it.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.040
Can you imagine ever having to describe

48:47.040 --> 48:49.040
those fucking, like, title cards?

48:49.040 --> 48:51.040
The second one was

48:51.040 --> 48:53.040
a bearded bronze figure

48:53.040 --> 48:55.040
like a classical warrior shoots an arrow

48:55.040 --> 48:57.040
which flies through the holes

48:57.040 --> 48:59.040
in a row of ax blades.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.040
T.S.G. Entertainment.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
Like, if you could

49:05.040 --> 49:07.040
like, have that guy

49:07.040 --> 49:09.040
pitch back their logo

49:09.040 --> 49:11.040
to them while they were designing,

49:11.040 --> 49:13.040
that does sound stupid.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.040
It sounds a little busy.

49:15.040 --> 49:17.040
Why is he shooting an arrow

49:17.040 --> 49:19.040
through a row of ax blades?

49:19.040 --> 49:21.040
That's exactly what happens.

49:21.040 --> 49:23.040
I would like to see, like, Tristar,

49:23.040 --> 49:25.040
Pegasus is flying at you.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.040
An ordinary horse gallops

49:27.040 --> 49:29.040
across the horizon.

49:29.040 --> 49:31.040
Oh, it's got wings now.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.040
It's quickly sprouting wings.

49:33.040 --> 49:35.040
It soars over the viewer.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.040
A giant boy ruins the three-dimensionality

49:37.040 --> 49:39.040
of a crescent moon by sitting on it

49:39.040 --> 49:41.040
and fishing.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040
You wonder

49:43.040 --> 49:45.040
if the moon is up his ass crack

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
as he waits patiently

49:47.040 --> 49:49.040
for a fish that may never exist.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.040
That can't be comfortable.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.040
So, and then this is the last one.

49:55.040 --> 49:57.040
This is like, this one really

49:57.040 --> 49:59.040
like, like, like,

49:59.040 --> 50:01.040
light gleams off a metal letter C

50:01.040 --> 50:03.040
which hangs from a chain

50:03.040 --> 50:05.040
casting shadows on cinder black walls

50:05.040 --> 50:07.040
on either side of it.

50:07.040 --> 50:09.040
Two rectangles cut from the C

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
make the right-hand shadow

50:11.040 --> 50:13.040
look like an E.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.040
Churned in entertainment.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.040
No, I was watching that one before

50:17.040 --> 50:19.040
I turned the audio and that visual

50:19.040 --> 50:21.040
didn't even scan.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.040
Yeah, no, and then someone has to scan it

50:23.040 --> 50:25.040
and send it back.

50:25.040 --> 50:27.040
Shame on you, Churned in entertainment.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.040
Just make it like a tree that gets hit by lightning.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.040
Like a star war or something.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
A little robot

50:33.040 --> 50:35.040
is dancing around and then he's a bad robot.

50:35.040 --> 50:37.040
Like, you know,

50:37.040 --> 50:39.040
some people do it right.

50:39.040 --> 50:41.040
A lion who's had a long day

50:41.040 --> 50:43.040
is forced to roar like he's an actual lion.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.040
He's kind of

50:45.040 --> 50:47.040
phoning it in.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
MGM.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.040
You're a sound effect describer?

50:57.040 --> 50:59.040
Wait, sorry, I need to hear this.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.040
What did you say?

51:01.040 --> 51:03.040
I'm a describer.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.040
Oh, you're saying...

51:05.040 --> 51:07.040
Are you a person that does this for a living?

51:07.040 --> 51:09.040
You are a describer?

51:09.040 --> 51:11.040
And you've been sitting there quietly

51:11.040 --> 51:13.040
while this fucking lunatic over here

51:13.040 --> 51:15.040
is like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

51:15.040 --> 51:17.040
So this is what you do?

51:17.040 --> 51:19.040
Well, would you come up and talk to us?

51:19.040 --> 51:21.040
No?

51:21.040 --> 51:23.040
Describe a...

51:23.040 --> 51:25.040
It's...

51:25.040 --> 51:27.040
It's not part of my craft

51:27.040 --> 51:29.040
to be the center of the spotlight

51:29.040 --> 51:31.040
visually.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.040
I know I can't do your accent.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.040
That's the whole point.

51:35.040 --> 51:37.040
What's your name is?

51:37.040 --> 51:39.040
Sansara.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.040
Fantastic, welcome Sansara to the stage.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
You can take this...

51:51.040 --> 51:53.040
You can take this microphone.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.040
Sansara,

51:55.040 --> 51:57.040
you're like a thunder cat.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.040
No, that's Chitara, Dan.

51:59.040 --> 52:01.040
Why would Sansara be a thunder cat?

52:01.040 --> 52:03.040
There's no cat in the name.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.040
You just heard the aura part

52:05.040 --> 52:07.040
and connected the dumbest dot.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.040
It's more like the Wheel of Fortune.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.040
I'm sorry I was rude.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.040
So you do describing

52:13.040 --> 52:15.040
live theater?

52:15.040 --> 52:17.040
Yes, I do live theater.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.040
You're sitting next to somebody who's visually impaired

52:19.040 --> 52:21.040
and you can't hear it?

52:21.040 --> 52:23.040
No, no, we get put in a booth

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
and back and they get little headsets.

52:25.040 --> 52:27.040
So one ear they hear us

52:27.040 --> 52:29.040
and the other ear they're watching.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.040
And so you have to just freestyle

52:31.040 --> 52:33.040
and watch what's happening

52:33.040 --> 52:35.040
and then describe that for them?

52:35.040 --> 52:37.040
Oh, really, we actually usually see the show three times.

52:37.040 --> 52:39.040
Oh, so you're quite well rehearsed then?

52:39.040 --> 52:41.040
Yes.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.040
Is it scripted out or are you just kind of rolling with it?

52:43.040 --> 52:45.040
We just take some notes

52:45.040 --> 52:47.040
and then sort of go from that.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.040
We describe it pretty well.

52:49.040 --> 52:51.040
Not to put you on the spot.

52:51.040 --> 52:53.040
Everybody close your eyes.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.040
That guy close your mouth.

52:55.040 --> 52:57.040
Everyone else close your eyes.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.040
All right, wait.

52:59.040 --> 53:01.040
I'm trying to figure out

53:01.040 --> 53:03.040
because it's pantomime and that wouldn't make sense.

53:03.040 --> 53:05.040
Wait, don't yell stuff out.

53:05.040 --> 53:07.040
You're a terrible person.

53:07.040 --> 53:09.040
We're having a good show, sir.

53:09.040 --> 53:11.040
You will not ruin this.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
It's only...

53:13.040 --> 53:15.040
Holy shit, how much more time do we have?

53:15.040 --> 53:17.040
Three more hours.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.040
All right, okay.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.040
About a standard opera.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.040
All right, so...

53:23.040 --> 53:25.040
I'm going to try to do something physical.

53:25.040 --> 53:27.040
I guess it'll be like mining.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.040
So there's a middle-aged man

53:29.040 --> 53:31.040
with gray hair and a beard

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
in a gray t-shirt a bit dirty

53:33.040 --> 53:35.040
and creased cocky pants.

53:35.040 --> 53:37.040
Thank you.

53:45.040 --> 53:47.040
I feel violent.

53:47.040 --> 53:49.040
I feel Xeroxed.

53:49.040 --> 53:51.040
I didn't talk about issues.

53:51.040 --> 53:53.040
I feel like you faxed me.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.040
I was reduced.

53:55.040 --> 53:57.040
All right, that's great.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.040
Go ahead and then...

53:59.040 --> 54:01.040
So he raises his left leg as if to step.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.040
He grabs the foot.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.040
So he pretends to take off his shoe

54:05.040 --> 54:07.040
and holds it in front of him.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.040
He now pushes the shoe

54:09.040 --> 54:11.040
as if it had buttons.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.040
He holds the shoe to his ear

54:13.040 --> 54:15.040
and pretends to talk.

54:15.040 --> 54:17.040
You can talk too.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.040
She just describes the action.

54:19.040 --> 54:21.040
Hey, Kevin.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.040
It's been seven years since you've spoken

54:23.040 --> 54:25.040
to me on my shoe.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
Looks angry.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.040
He breathes heavily.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.040
I'll get it.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.040
There's a split screen.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.040
Honey.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.040
I'm sorry, you're on the phone.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.040
Oh, never mind the split screen.

54:39.040 --> 54:41.040
If you're on the phone,

54:41.040 --> 54:43.040
I can go back into the kitchen.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.040
There's a man in a dark suit.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.040
That's all you fucking need.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.040
I thought you were coming.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.040
Getting hair or anything.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.040
Are you guys like referees?

55:05.040 --> 55:07.040
Can we sue you and stuff?

55:07.040 --> 55:09.040
Yeah, we're classist.

55:11.040 --> 55:13.040
Honey, listen.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.040
I need to speak with you.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.040
Please come back.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.040
The man in the suit walks towards him.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.040
They stare at each other.

55:23.040 --> 55:25.040
He pulls out a gun and points it

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
at the man in the t-shirt.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.040
Honey, I'm leaving you.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.040
The man in the t-shirt holds out his hands

55:35.040 --> 55:37.040
imploringly.

55:37.040 --> 55:39.040
He points.

55:39.040 --> 55:41.040
He throws something.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.040
The shoe.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.040
The shoe hits the man in the suit.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.040
He falls to the ground.

55:47.040 --> 55:49.040
The older man runs up

55:49.040 --> 55:51.040
and grabs the gun.

55:51.040 --> 55:53.040
They wrestle.

55:53.040 --> 55:55.040
It points at the audience.

55:55.040 --> 55:57.040
It points to the left again.

55:57.040 --> 55:59.040
They grapple.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.040
They do the hokey pokey.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.040
They start doing a Charleston.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
They're now smiling.

56:09.040 --> 56:11.040
The man in the t-shirt

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
pretends to open up his chest.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.040
And a snake comes out.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.040
The man in the suit licks his fingers

56:21.040 --> 56:25.040
and jeffs the man in the t-shirt.

56:25.040 --> 56:27.040
Did she say jeffs?

56:27.040 --> 56:29.040
She said jeffs.

56:29.040 --> 56:31.040
All right.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.040
The lovely

56:33.040 --> 56:35.040
the lovely

56:35.040 --> 56:37.040
Thank you so much.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.040
Thank you.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.040
That was wonderful.

56:41.040 --> 56:43.040
That was so pro.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.040
That was absolutely great.

56:45.040 --> 56:47.040
Shit.

56:47.040 --> 56:49.040
How do we top sansara?

56:49.040 --> 56:51.040
I don't know.

56:51.040 --> 56:53.040
I don't know.

56:53.040 --> 56:55.040
She knows...

56:55.040 --> 56:57.040
She gathers information

56:57.040 --> 56:59.040
and she knows what jeffing is now.

56:59.040 --> 57:01.040
I don't want to jinx it,

57:01.040 --> 57:03.040
but we're having the best show we've ever had in our lives.

57:03.040 --> 57:05.040
It's fucking like...

57:05.040 --> 57:07.040
I don't want to make it a bad show

57:07.040 --> 57:09.040
by saying that.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.040
There's a thousand people there from a different continent

57:11.040 --> 57:13.040
and we're fucking nailing it.

57:13.040 --> 57:15.040
What time do we start?

57:15.040 --> 57:17.040
How much time do we have to...

57:17.040 --> 57:19.040
Fuck.

57:19.040 --> 57:21.040
We can end it right now.

57:21.040 --> 57:23.040
No, no, for God's sakes.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.040
It would hurt my feelings if you said yes.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.040
Thank you.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.040
Even though you were thinking yes,

57:29.040 --> 57:31.040
now would be a good time to end the show.

57:31.040 --> 57:33.040
It should be an hour long. You don't have an act.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.040
You're a podcaster.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.040
Let's just suffer.

57:37.040 --> 57:39.040
The next chapter is the atonement

57:39.040 --> 57:41.040
with the father,

57:41.040 --> 57:43.040
but that's heteronormative.

57:43.040 --> 57:45.040
It's like the

57:45.040 --> 57:47.040
little story circle where the middle of the show

57:47.040 --> 57:49.040
we just met with the goddess,

57:49.040 --> 57:51.040
Sincero,

57:51.040 --> 57:53.040
not to put too fine a point on it.

57:53.040 --> 57:55.040
Now we have to pay the price.

57:55.040 --> 57:57.040
She literally described

57:57.040 --> 57:59.040
what it was we were doing.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.040
We can't keep reacting now.

58:01.040 --> 58:03.040
We're moving forward. We now have to have volition.

58:03.040 --> 58:05.040
We have to decide we want to accomplish something

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
and that's when we're going to get our asses.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.040
You and I have talked about a couple of times doing,

58:09.040 --> 58:11.040
maybe this is a bad pitch,

58:11.040 --> 58:13.040
and I don't know, Spencer, you're probably not prepared for this.

58:13.040 --> 58:15.040
Like Dan and I,

58:15.040 --> 58:17.040
we're not allowed to. We can't do it anymore.

58:17.040 --> 58:19.040
No, let's do it. I decided in the green room, let's do it.

58:21.040 --> 58:23.040
As long as it's not medieval fantasy,

58:23.040 --> 58:25.040
I think we're going to do it.

58:25.040 --> 58:27.040
We were talking about bringing back

58:27.040 --> 58:29.040
a little bit of role playing back into the show.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.040
I'll take the heat on this one.

58:35.040 --> 58:37.040
Yeah, I mean there's concern

58:37.040 --> 58:39.040
because Harmon Quest, and are we stepping on toes?

58:39.040 --> 58:41.040
We'll take, we'll take,

58:41.040 --> 58:43.040
I'll take, it'll be like a promotion.

58:45.040 --> 58:47.040
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

58:47.040 --> 58:49.040
This is like a big commercial for Harmon Quest on CISO

58:49.040 --> 58:51.040
which you probably can't even watch here

58:51.040 --> 58:53.040
because your country doesn't have it.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.040
Spencer, I don't reckon you have any dice on you, probably.

58:55.040 --> 58:57.040
What?

58:57.040 --> 58:59.040
Dice. Oh, that's fine.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.040
Someone said they have dice.

59:01.040 --> 59:03.040
I'm sure.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.040
You've got multi-sided dice?

59:05.040 --> 59:07.040
Actually, half of our crowd has dice on them.

59:07.040 --> 59:09.040
You're not going to gather a thousand Australian

59:09.040 --> 59:11.040
Armenians and not have at least nine dice.

59:15.040 --> 59:17.040
Why don't we have him...

59:19.040 --> 59:21.040
Well, this guy's got a full-on sack of dice.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.040
It's Eric Werheim from Tim and Eric.

59:25.040 --> 59:27.040
Who's a very handsome person.

59:27.040 --> 59:29.040
I'm sure we'll get these back.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.040
What's your name, sir?

59:31.040 --> 59:33.040
Bodi? Bodi, alright.

59:33.040 --> 59:35.040
That's rugged.

59:35.040 --> 59:37.040
Stay and play with us since it's your dice.

59:37.040 --> 59:39.040
Okay, yeah.

59:41.040 --> 59:43.040
And then,

59:43.040 --> 59:45.040
let's use

59:45.040 --> 59:47.040
Giggly Pink Hair

59:47.040 --> 59:49.040
who was like, don't call on me.

59:49.040 --> 59:51.040
I don't want to sit next to the...

59:51.040 --> 59:53.040
Do you want to come up?

59:53.040 --> 59:55.040
You don't have to come up.

59:55.040 --> 59:57.040
I can't hear what you're saying.

59:57.040 --> 59:59.040
Blue hair. I don't see through that lens.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040
You could have been anything.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.040
What's your name?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.040
Jenna.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.040
Okay, Jenna, everybody.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.040
You know what?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.040
Hello, Jenna.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.040
It occurs to me that for our

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.040
listeners, because we're not live streaming us,

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.040
we should just have a sensora at all times

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.040
just describing

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.040
the visual bits.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.040
Oh, yeah.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.040
And then we cannot pay her for her services

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040
that she gets paid for.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.040
It's a soft spot with Spencer.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
He's

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.040
been officially

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.040
an audience guest

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.040
for three and a half years.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.040
It's just, you know, I don't know.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.040
That just seems like literally her job.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040
No, yeah.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.040
I mean, it's like, yeah, notice she didn't

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.040
like bound up here. She was like,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.040
she got to go sat there. It was like,

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.040
we made her come up. She's like, yeah,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040
fucking, I do this at parties too.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.040
It's worth money.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.040
That's why I got the bling.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.040
Jenna, are you a local?

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.040
Ish.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.040
Where are you from?

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.040
Oh, grab that mic behind you there.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.040
Yeah.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.040
Yeah.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.040
A bearded man behind the folding

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.040
table gets turned on.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040
I'm not going to participate in this.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.040
You're not? No. What?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.040
I'm originally from Moe, which is a very

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.040
good. Wow.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.040
Yeah. I only know that because I know

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.040
Scottish friends.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.040
Wait, what are you participating in?

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.040
What do you mean? I didn't hear that part.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.040
She doesn't want to participate.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.040
Oh, in this? Oh, you don't have to, for God's

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.040
sake. I'm up here now.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.040
Oh, well, wait, are you, come on.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.040
You get to decide whether you want to be

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.040
up here or not be up here. You're not playing

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.040
that. I'm interested in what I've got myself

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.040
into, so we'll play it out.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.040
All right. Okay.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.040
I shouldn't have made someone come up.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040
You're going to have a great time,

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.040
but it's consensual.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.040
What's happening is

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040
my point.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.040
Honestly, before I came up here,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040
I thought this was all staged and now

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.040
because I wasn't prepared for this, I know

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.040
it's not, so it's great.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.040
And now the show called

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.040
and it's in her turning into a tiger, at

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.040
which point you realize the whole thing is staged.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.040
What branch of science

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.040
are you involved in? Pharmaceutical science.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.040
All right.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.040
Not the good kind.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040
What do you mean? The bad kind?

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.040
Poison.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.040
I don't get to take the drug, so it's not that great.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.040
Right. So do you manufacture,

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.040
create them, market them? What do you do?

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.040
Help lead them into clinical trials.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.040
Cool.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.040
Do you work for like some sort of evil pharmaceutical

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.040
company? No.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.040
But we facilitate them.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.040
Yeah.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.040
We don't work for them. We make billions

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.040
off of them.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.040
We're not for profit.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040
Wait, you are? Not for profit?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
In America, that doesn't mean anything.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.040
Because you can't put a price on hegemony.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.040
Are nonprofits like a big deal here?

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.040
Like, in America, like,

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040
there's for-profit companies that just decide

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.040
to operate as nonprofits in America

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.040
because no one gives a fuck.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040
There's probably strict standards here, right?

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.040
I know what my boss tells me.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.040
Right. No, I never implied

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.040
you weren't. I'm sure you're

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.040
a great employee. Yeah.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.040
All right. Well...

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.040
Are you currently on some of your own supply right now?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040
I wish.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.040
This is good. Remember what I said.

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.040
We're proceeding through volition and we're going to get our asses

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.040
kicked, right? Yeah.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.040
We met with the goddess. We did what was easy.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.040
Yeah. Now going back up the other side of the circle

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.040
is a hand-over-hand climb back up into the conscious realm.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.040
So now we're going to improvise a role-playing game

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040
because we don't have character sheets.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040
We don't have a race.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040
Now, Brody. But, Brody, sorry.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.040
Brody, I can safely assume

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.040
that you are a role-playing enthusiast

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.040
because you have a sack of dice on you.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.040
Yeah.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.040
Let's not jump to conclusion.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.040
He might just be

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.040
a weird gambler.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.040
The world's

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.040
kiniest pedophile. Come on,

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.040
19!

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.040
And, Jenna,

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:15.040
have you ever played

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040
a D&D Pathfinder role-playing game before?

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040
I'm more of a game watcher.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.040
It's 9-11.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.040
It's 9-11, kills our crowd.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.040
So, Jesus,

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.040
you insensitive

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.040
Antipodeans.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.040
We have feelings on the other side of the world.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.040
All right.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.040
That was a horrifying interlude.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.040
Have you ever had any experience

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.040
with this, Jenna, before we proceed?

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.040
No. I'm more of a game watcher

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040
than a game player because I have rage issues.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.040
You have rage issues?

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040
Yes. We should be a barbarian.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.040
Probably.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.040
Is this going to suit me?

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.040
Spencer will kind of create

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.040
a little world for us right now.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.040
Do you want to do characters first

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.040
and then the world or other way around, do you think?

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.040
She can be a pharmaceutical barbarian.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Okay.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.040
What do you want to be?

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.040
A pharmaceutical barbarian is fucking awesome.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.040
You, like, pop a bottle of pills

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.040
and then you just bust through a wall or something.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040
That'd be amazing.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.040
Isn't that kind of the story of Popeye?

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.040
Yeah.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.040
He's kind of a drug addict barbarian.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.040
Hey, don't knock him. He's amazing.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.040
He's great. Yeah.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.040
He's a sailor.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.040
Bode, what do you want to be?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.040
What class and race do you want to be?

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.040
Is this fantasy?

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.040
It's whatever.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.040
Whatever you want.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.040
Let's make it kind of shadow-running

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040
if she's a post-apocalyptic baby

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.040
in a George Miller tradition.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.040
What's the wizard of that?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.040
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.040
Like a psychic or you could just be magic.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.040
You pick and then I'll either tell you it's dumb

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.040
or we'll let it go.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.040
Bode, what do you

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.040
love to play in the normal

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.040
milieu that you play?

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.040
Wizards is 100%.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040
We need a good magic user.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.040
Let's get that going on.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.040
You want to just let him be a wizard in this milieu?

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.040
Yeah. No, that's great.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.040
I want to be a person

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.040
that

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.040
is real smart

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.040
and is good

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.040
at talking

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.040
and entertaining people.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.040
All right.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.040
Because I always play rogues.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.040
I want to go for fighter. I want to be like a tough guy

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.040
because I never do that.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.040
I'll be like just a straight up.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.040
Can you be an elf fighter?

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.040
Sure.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.040
I'm an elf fighter named

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Smorf.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.040
Good, good.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.040
Okay.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.040
All right.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.040
You want to give them a theme?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.040
Let's do that.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.040
That's what you guys want.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.040
That's what you starve for down in this desert.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.040
You want that sweet

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.040
fucking dungeon master

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.040
sound?

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.040
You want a ssss?

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.040
Nature box.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.040
No, I'm not going to do that again.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.040
Okay.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:17.040
It's been years since Pauline Henson

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.040
turned into a robot

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.040
and took over the entire continent.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040
The scattered peoples

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.040
of Australia have

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.040
summoned their will to fight

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.040
but have largely been crushed down

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.040
and pushed to the far corners

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.040
of the outback.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.040
That brings us to today

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.040
where our heroes are driving in a

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.040
Ute

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.040
up towards Ipswich.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.040
You find yourself

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.040
blocked.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.040
A roadblock is in your way

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040
guarded by several barbarians

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.040
like post-apocalyptic ones

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.040
like Mad Max shit situation

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.040
because that's the world you're in.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.040
Okay.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.040
Roadblock, barbarians, Mad Max

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.040
shit, Ute

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040
go.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.040
We're all in the same Ute.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.040
What's the truck called?

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.040
Ute?

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.040
Ute?

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.040
Like the Native American Indian tribe?

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.040
Right. Seems offensive.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.040
Like a utility.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.040
Not here though.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.040
All right. Here you go.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:29.040
The dude abodes.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.040
All right. I'm drunk. I'm drunk. I'm drunk.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.040
No, that's good.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.040
Take me to jail.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.040
Don't apologize.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.040
I'll just break out. It's all made out of

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.040
rabbit pelts.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.040
All your jails.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.040
I think the show's taking a turn.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.040
Yeah. It's a detonement.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.040
Yeah.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.040
Are there rabbits here?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.040
Okay.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.040
What are those called?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040
Acabora?

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040
Acuba?

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.040
The $400 ones are made out of rabbit pelts.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040
We learned that in Brazil.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.040
Not pelts hide.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040
Six rabbits to make a hat.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.040
Six rabbits?

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.040
Right.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.040
I like rabbits. Can we not kill them, please?

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:17.040
I agree.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040
I'm killing my end of the bargain.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.040
All right.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.040
I'm driving this ute.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.040
I'm the tough meathead guy.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.040
I'm driving my ute.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.040
But it's also got one of those dudes

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.040
in the front.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.040
In Fury Road that plays guitar.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.040
That's me.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.040
I'm the bard kind of guy.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040
You're a bard?

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.040
Yeah.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.040
He's a popular, well-liked talking guy.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.040
Talking and making people look like things.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.040
What's your name? What's your character's name?

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
Dan.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.040
Hamo.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.040
Hamo.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.040
Dan Hamo.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.040
You call me Hamo because it's a George Miller wasteland.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.040
Hey! Hamo!

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.040
Oi!

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.040
It's like we got company up in front of us.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.040
Struth.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.040
Is Jenna with us right now or no?

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040
Yeah, you're all together.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.040
Yeah, we're all the same.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.040
What's your character's name, Jenna?

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.040
Can I just be Jenna?

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.040
Yeah, that's easy.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.040
Shaza.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.040
We can go with that. It's very Australian.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040
Shaza?

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.040
Yeah, we'll go with Shaza.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.040
It sounds dirty.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.040
What's your character?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.040
Filtor the Purifier.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.040
Oh, yeah.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.040
Filtor?

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.040
Yeah, like it's a joke on filtration, I think.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.040
Filtor?

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.040
Filtor.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040
Filtor the Purifier.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.040
What's up?

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.040
I didn't get that. I just loved the passion.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.040
This is...

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Are you related to Britta?

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.040
Everyone starts shooting at you.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.040
Oh, wait!

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.040
I turned the car hard left

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040
and go into like a drift

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.040
in my ute.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040
And I kick open the passenger door

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.040
and I take out

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.040
my sawdough shotgun

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040
that has

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:39.040
four barrels.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040
Okay.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.040
You try to pull a drift

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.040
but your ute is too top heavy

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.040
and it tumbles over.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.040
Jesus Christ!

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.040
You manage to pull yourself out with your shotgun

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.040
and you're like on top of it

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.040
and now Dan is all sprawled out.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.040
Dan!

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.040
You all right, mate?

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.040
Yeah.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.040
Where are the guys,

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.040
the barbarian guys?

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.040
They're in front of you.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040
I...

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.040
I wave surrender.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.040
I...

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.040
All right, all right.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040
Fair dinkum!

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.040
They hold their multiple rifles

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.040
above your head

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.040
and fire several warning shots

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.040
a couple feet above your head

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.040
and they're badass or cool or something.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040
I got it, I got it.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.040
Fair dinkum.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:39.040
Good day, sirs.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.040
My name is Dan Hammo.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.040
We're merely

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.040
requesting passage across your wasteland

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.040
for we have...

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.040
Dan, I've got this. I can offer some heroin.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.040
As the pharmacy to go by a baron,

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.040
I've got it.

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.040
I didn't hear most of what she said.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.040
She has heroin.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.040
Do you just want to let us know?

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.040
Oh, we...

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.040
We have...

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040
We'd be happy to pay a toll for passage

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.040
in the form of narcotics.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.040
Yeah, we'll take that.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.040
We'll take all of it.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.040
Could I whisper...

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.040
Do you know these guys?

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.040
I don't want to assume,

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.040
but did you go to the barbarian school or something?

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.040
I aced barbarian school.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.040
Do you recognize them?

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.040
Barbarian med school.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.040
I say, well, I talked to them

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.040
and they want to take all of our stuff.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.040
And I give them that look

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.040
that says, you guys have talked

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.040
about this before.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.040
I now just duck behind the thing

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.040
and you guys go crazy.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.040
I say, oh, yeah, sure.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.040
Hey, Jenna,

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.040
give me all of your heroin

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.040
and I'll go over there

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.040
and give it to them.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.040
And I mean,

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.040
really give it to them.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.040
I'm sure you will.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.040
Okay.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.040
You made it sound sexual.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.040
I was trying to make it sound violent.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.040
I was not...

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.040
Okay.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.040
I take the heroin.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040
All right.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040
And what...

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.040
And as I take it from her,

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040
I take one of my small

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.040
proximity mines,

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.040
the grenades that I have

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.040
in my little pouch.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.040
And it should be noted that long ago,

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.040
I have this prosthetic

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040
post...

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.040
this wasteland prosthetic leg

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.040
that's like guitar parts.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.040
And I've been

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.040
strumming a certain...

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.040
It's like a thing that lowers their armor class.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.040
Or wait, raises it?

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.040
It lowers their defenses.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.040
It lowers enemy defenses.

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.040
It's like a buff or a...

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.040
Yeah, well, why don't you could

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.040
make it easier to hit them?

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.040
Yeah, I make my teammates

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040
better at combat.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.040
I inspire them with like a...

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.040
It's a critical inspire.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.040
And that would have been way more offensive

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.040
where we come from, but it's great to

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.040
just did it down here. It doesn't matter.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.040
When I said proximity mine,

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.040
it's a remote mine.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.040
It's a little tiny thing.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.040
I attach to the bottom of the bag of heroin.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040
And I have a remote control.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.040
And I go, okay guys,

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040
don't take all of our heroin.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040
Just take as much as you need.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.040
We'll take all of your heroin

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.040
and even more than that.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.040
We'll take other stuff.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.040
Maybe we'll take you slaves, you know?

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040
Oh, yeah.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.040
I give them the heroin and I go,

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.040
hey, here, you take the heroin.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.040
I forgot, back in the Ute,

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.040
I've got a whole bunch more stuff.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.040
I'll be right back.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.040
Hey guys, help me carry all the gold

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.040
and gasoline

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040
over to our captors.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.040
And we all kind of walk back

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.040
out of range of my explosive defense.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.040
All right. Barbarian guy won.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.040
He motions to someone else

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.040
to come over and test the heroin.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.040
He's kind of poking around

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.040
with his finger and touching it

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.040
to his eye and stuff.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040
Are they all...

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.040
How closely grouped are they

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040
to the heroin?

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.040
They're about five meters

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.040
across. They're kind of spread out.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
There's about seven of them.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.040
There's maybe three of them.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.040
Okay, my character doesn't know metric.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.040
Oh, you're in Australia, bitch.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040
Five meters as well.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040
Okay, I know it's five meters.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.040
So I say, yeah, guys,

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.040
it's the best heroin in town.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.040
Get right in there.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.040
We're going to carry the shit over

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.040
to you. And then when we're far

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040
enough out of range,

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.040
the detonation device

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.040
I have in my cyber eye

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.040
because I have a cyborg eye.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.040
And whenever I want things to blow up,

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.040
I go blank. I wink.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.040
And I detonate

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040
the explosive heroin.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.040
All right.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.040
Okay, yeah.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.040
All right. Your mind blows up

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.040
tearing them limb from limb.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040
Three of the barbarians

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040
and knocking the other four

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.040
to the ground.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.040
Did we lose our shit anyway?

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.040
You're welcome. Thank you.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.040
Attack, Bode, get them.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.040
Could I do like an atmospheric smoke effect

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:43.040
around us with my

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.040
sandpunk

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.040
stuff? Yeah.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.040
Waving your hands in a magical manner.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.040
You kick up a dust shield.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.040
Good job, Bode.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.040
Good job.

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.040
Can we still see them now?

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.040
Or are we all just hiding behind

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.040
a dust wall? You can't see

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.040
too well.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.040
So

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.040
we had the upper hand

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.040
and now we're just in a dust storm.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.040
Let's get to the ute.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.040
Everyone feel around for the ute.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.040
Oh, you can see the ute, but it's on its side now.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.040
It's on its side only.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.040
Right. No, we got to finish

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040
these barbarians off and steal

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.040
what they got. This is a wasteland.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.040
We got to get their goods. We got to steal what they got?

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.040
That's like

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.040
sucking on a mosquito.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.040
They were robbing us. They don't have anything.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.040
Maybe they rob everybody. Maybe they're the

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.040
richest people in town. Maybe they rob everybody.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.040
This is what I just said.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.040
Maybe they rob everybody.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.040
Yeah, maybe they rob everybody.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.040
That's not bad.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.040
One barbarian, one kind of barbarian

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.040
doesn't rob everybody.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.040
Why don't barbarians rob other barbarians?

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.040
They'd have all the stuff.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.040
They rob people.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.040
All right.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.040
Yeah.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.040
All right.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.040
Jenna, what is

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.040
your specialty again?

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.040
Pharmaceuticals.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.040
Pharmaceutical barbarian.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.040
Go get them.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.040
Go get them with what?

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040
Take drugs and beat them.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.040
I already got them to take heroin. Surely that'll

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.040
lock them in and they'll be right.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.040
They'll die eventually from their habit.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.040
Yeah, eventually.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.040
It's a slow thing,

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.040
but it'll work.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.040
Bullets cut through the air.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.040
Jesus, you said in your contract with us

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040
you would take drugs and beat people.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040
You said that was your thing.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.040
I have still not been offered cocaine.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.040
That would make me angry and that would definitely

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.040
make me do that.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.040
Take the cocaine on your couch.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.040
I take cocaine and I bash everybody up.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.040
Pray.

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.040
For those who came here

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.040
tonight with your parents,

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040
thanks for convincing them to drive you down.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.040
Thank God my parents aren't here

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.040
because they'd be so disappointed in me right now.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.040
She's going into a cocaine

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.040
field barbarian rage right now?

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.040
All right.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.040
How are you going to attack?

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.040
I'm going to be all

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.040
legs.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.040
Okay.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.040
Not a lot of people have an answer to that.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:15.040
That's great.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.040
Leaping into the dust shield

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.040
you take a bullet to the shoulder

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.040
but you wrap your legs

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.040
tightly around one of the barbarians

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.040
popping his head clean off.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.040
That's all.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040
I use relentless

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.040
voice shout.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.040
It's a Nord thing from Skyrim.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.040
I learned it at the throat of the world.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.040
What does it do?

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.040
It creates a

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.040
force

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.040
in a radius

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.040
equivalent to my level

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.040
that removes outward

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:07.040
diminishing one foot

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.040
pound per hex

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040
as it knocks

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.040
any ready warriors

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.040
back into a stunned position

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.040
and makes flat footed any previously

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.040
alerted monsters.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.040
I stopped paying attention

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.040
when Steve showed up.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.040
You do that.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.040
It works.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.040
They're all flat footed.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.040
Also, the force

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.040
it knocks clean the road block

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.040
but the truck's still on its side.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040
Let's take one of their barbarian trucks

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.040
or let's each...

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.040
You guys should get trucks.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.040
We still have a ute though, right?

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.040
Am I strong enough

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.040
to write the truck

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.040
on my ownership?

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.040
Is that a teamwork tendency?

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.040
You don't know.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.040
I'm in a cocaine rage.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.040
Hey, Cokie McTavish.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.040
Go set the truck right.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.040
Yeah, I can do that.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.040
Yeah, it's done.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.040
Yeah, it's done.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.040
So confident.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.040
It's all legs.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.040
It's all legs.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.040
Yeah, because you're supposed to lift from the legs

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.040
and if you're all legs, then you're...

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.040
Perfect. That's all you got.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.040
It's a live gut.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.040
Are they all dead?

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.040
No, there's three alive.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.040
Bullets continue to cut through the air.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.040
Let's jump in the car

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.040
and just mow them down.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.040
So we get back in the utes

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.040
and I hit the gas pedal and aim at them.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.040
Can I do, like,

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.040
an unseen servant thing to drive

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.040
so none of us have to feel bad about it?

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.040
Oh, sure. Okay, nice.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.040
It's very culturally sensitive.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.040
This is a new...

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.040
really is a new outback.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.040
All right.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.040
They've really learned to cringe here.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.040
Hammo, you take a bullet in the arm.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.040
Ow!

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.040
I didn't sign up for this.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:07.040
I'm too old for this.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.040
I suck the bullet out of his arm.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.040
All right.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.040
It's great.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.040
And I spit it...

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.040
I'm probably not going to work,

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.040
but I spit it as hard as I can back at them

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.040
to see if I can shoot.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.040
It goes a good seven feet,

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.040
but it doesn't hit anyone.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.040
It's pretty good.

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.040
I think I said that message.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.040
So where's the

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.040
unseen servant driving, then?

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.040
Oh, just into the Bob area.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.040
Oh, yeah.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.040
All right. You run over one of them.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.040
Just one.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.040
The other two kind of roll off to the side,

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040
but with the roadblock...

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.040
Oh, so none of us have to feel bad about running people over.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.040
I thought you meant about the servitude.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.040
Oh.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.040
Yeah, you don't see it.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.040
I thought he meant that someone wouldn't have to feel bad about driving.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.040
Just the other people.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.040
That's why I praised him.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.040
I'm American.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.040
And rich.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.040
All right. Sorry.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.040
You were saying...

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.040
You continue past the roadblock with your momentum.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.040
You've passed the barbarians

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040
that are still alive.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.040
I...

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040
I roll down the window

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.040
and flip them off.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.040
All right. That happens.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.040
Fair dinkum.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:25.040
All right. We got to get into Ipswich.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.040
I...

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.040
I think I know the way.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.040
I have local knowledge.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.040
It's 11.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.040
Everyone knows where it is.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.040
Well, up yours.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.040
All right. So I drive us towards Ipswich.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.040
And you guys...

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.040
We're going into the belly of the beast right now.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.040
You guys understand this.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.040
Yeah. Let's get Pauline.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.040
You're on the outskirts of Ipswich,

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.040
but it seems that there's a giant chasm

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:57.040
in the road.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.040
It's Pauline.

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.040
It's barring your forward

01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.040
progress in a u...

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040
How... Why is the chasm?

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.040
Uh...

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.040
Uh...

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.040
Four meters.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040
Four meters.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.040
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Seven meters.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.040
Seven meters.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.040
That's what I meant.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.040
I get out of the u

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.040
of the edge of the chasm.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.040
I scratch my chin.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.040
Pauline!

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.040
I hear no echo.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.040
Yeah.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.040
I look down

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.040
and this chasm is kind of beautiful.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.040
It's kind of like the Grand Canyon.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:39.040
I take a moment

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:41.040
to look at our group

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.040
and I say,

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.040
how's the chasm?

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.040
I look down and this chasm is kind of beautiful.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.040
It's kind of like the Grand Canyon

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.040
when I say,

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.040
how's the serenity?

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.040
It's good, it's good.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.040
So much serenity.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.040
Can I be peeing?

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.040
Oh, always.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.040
Sure.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:05.040
I've had too many drugs and I've already passed out.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.040
You passed out on Coke?

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.040
Yeah.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.040
That's impressive.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.040
I didn't know you could do that.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.040
I'm not a well-trained drug taker.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.040
Wizard

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.040
Bode

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.040
Filtor

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.040
Do you have a spell that can get us across this chasm?

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.040
I think it might.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:31.040
Did you just cast magic heckler?

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.040
I think it might or something.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.040
It's a flight.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.040
I think it might.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.040
He's just an Australian,

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:43.040
malfunctioning.

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.040
Might!

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040
Outback, outback,

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040
crocsplashin'.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.040
Seven meters.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.040
I've got a bunch of rope in the back.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.040
We could try

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.040
to grappling hook across this and do a little

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040
fashion of a crude rope bridge.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.040
Or

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.040
unless you've got a sexy spell.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040
Filtor.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.040
I can help out with magic

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.040
and so we don't have to throw it.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.040
Crude rope bridge montage.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.040
There's only one thing wrong with this crude rope bridge.

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.040
What?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.040
To non-crude.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.040
It's a real rope bridge.

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.040
We're wonderful together.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.040
Can someone please remember to carry my body?

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:41.040
I pick up Jenna

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.040
and throw her over my shoulder

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.040
like fireman style.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.040
Cast.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:49.040
Filtor.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.040
Part of the magic is that I use her body

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.040
as the counterweight on this side.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.040
Oh!

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.040
We can pull her over later.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.040
I'm not smart.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.040
I have an intelligence of three.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.040
I've been left behind, but I'm out of it.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.040
Who knows?

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.040
You're attached to that.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.040
We can just hoist you back over across.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.040
It might come thumping into the opposite wall.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.040
Look, one at a time and I won't hit me.

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.040
Exactly, right.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040
You're into one of those sleepy coke binge things

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.040
that happens to nobody.

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.040
I picked the wrong class.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.040
I picked the guy that just talks.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.040
That's all I am.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040
You got a pretty fancy...

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:35.040
What's that big staff?

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.040
That big wooden stick that you have

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.040
into your knapsack there.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.040
It looks kind of mystical and magical.

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.040
You mean the eye of everything?

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.040
It's called the eye of everything?

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040
I push the center of the eye.

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.040
It gets stuck.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.040
Yay!

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.040
The button gets stuck?

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.040
Yeah, no, the button gets stuck.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.040
Oh, okay, well then I won't use it again.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.040
I think that's a really old callback.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.040
It's from the movie.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.040
We made a movie about ourselves and they watched it.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.040
We really owe them a lot.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.040
It's more than just a ticket price.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.040
All right, so we're all across the bridge,

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040
except for Jenna.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:27.040
I use my macho strengths

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.040
and I pull her across

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.040
and hoist her up and...

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.040
Thank you.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.040
Oh, you're awake?

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.040
She hasn't smashed into the wall

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.040
and I woke her up.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.040
All right, of course.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.040
While you were passed out,

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.040
we used you to counterweight our bridge.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.040
I don't know if you're putting on weight,

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.040
but we used you

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.040
to counterweight our bridge.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.040
Never talk about a woman's weight, okay?

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:59.040
I was making a joke.

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.040
You're a tiny little whisper of a thing.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.040
I appreciate it.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:07.040
We hit a point where we killed the barbarians.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.040
We could have ended it there.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.040
No, we're across the chasm now.

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.040
This is a threshold.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.040
To what end?

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.040
To Ipswich.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.040
You're going to give up now?

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040
One button gets stuck

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.040
and you just fucking want to call it a day.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.040
I don't know if I like your style.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.040
Do you mean

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.040
to say that even though we met with the goddess,

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.040
now that things are falling apart?

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.040
I think that maybe

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.040
it's time that

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:39.040
we should split up company

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.040
and find out if

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.040
flight can be magic.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:45.040
I hate you.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.040
I never knew my parents.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.040
We're fighting.

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.040
I go away.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.040
Okay.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.040
Jesus.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.040
You're turning into Twitter.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.040
You can't be as drunk as me.

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.040
I was the one up here with a fifth of vodka.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.040
I met it Jeff

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.040
and I punch a rock and I eat an iguana.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.040
We're not friends anymore

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.040
and conflict, conflict.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.040
If you want to be a dick about it,

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040
me, Bodie and Jenna will get in my truck

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.040
and we'll take care of business ourselves.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.040
Fine, I hope I never see you again.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.040
I'm going with him.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.040
You're going to go with him?

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.040
You know what, fuck both of you then.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.040
Fucking made a bridge.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.040
I thought you had a bridge that's metaphorical

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:43.040
for crossing the difficult

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.040
from one place to the other.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.040
I say whoever kills Pauline Henson and Ipswich

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.040
is the real post-apocalyptic warrior.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.040
Phil Torre,

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.040
are you coming with me?

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:55.040
Are you going with these ding-dongs?

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.040
I'm with you.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.040
We get into the Ute and we just hit the pedal.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.040
We'll see you at the finish line.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:03.040
Tick-suck.

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.040
Jenna's character.

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.040
Give us Adderall.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.040
I am the one with the drugs

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.040
so we all know I'm going to win.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.040
Right?

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.040
You're walking, I'm driving at full speed.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.040
See, I've invented this drug

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.040
that means we can run at Superman speed.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.040
So we're going to beat you.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.040
I said Adderall.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040
Give us the...

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:27.040
It's up there.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.040
It's the orange tube on your shoulder.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.040
Break it open.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:33.040
She does.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.040
Whatever you need.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.040
What's that?

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.040
Whatever you need.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.040
Nice.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:49.040
Art imitates life.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.040
Oh, no.

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040
Oh, boy.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.040
I just realized it.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:57.040
Why is the show dragging?

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.040
I have a medical condition.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.040
I got the ADD robot.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.040
That's what they all say.

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.040
All right, now we're running.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.040
We've got the AD and D.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.040
We're running.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040
We're running, apparently we're running.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.040
All right, well, we're driving.

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.040
Where are you guys going?

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040
To Ipswich.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.040
But you're split up?

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.040
Yeah, because we're going to...

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.040
We're fighting.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.040
We're going through second act crisis.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.040
No, I got there as conflict.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.040
Now, it just seems like you're doing the same thing.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:35.040
We want to prove that we can do it better.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040
They're trying to run at Superman speed

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:39.040
because they're taking super drugs.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.040
And then we'll end up working together.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.040
Which of the purifier and I, we're in the car,

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.040
we're going fucking hell for leather.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.040
We're limitless.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.040
Like the movie.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.040
I can't hear you driving.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:53.040
You know, it's like we're not working together.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.040
Send it in the text.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.040
You continue to drive.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.040
You see the buildings

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.040
and shacks of Ipswich.

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.040
But out of the corner of your eye,

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.040
you see a brown blur.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:09.040
A kangaroo smashes into your windshield,

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.040
the car off the road.

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.040
I mean, you're ute off the road.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.040
Well, you're fucked.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.040
We run past it.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:25.040
Oh, no, this is like miles ahead of you.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:27.040
We run toward it.

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.040
We had the agility, but you were fucked.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.040
The car is totaled.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.040
The ute is totaled.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.040
Is the kangaroo alive or dead?

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.040
Oh yeah, it's alive.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.040
It's shaking itself like it's head

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.040
and it's like, ah, getting up, you know, and pain.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.040
Filter, can you cast a spell that

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.040
can you possess

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.040
that kangaroo

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.040
and kick Jenna and

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.040
and hammers ass?

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.040
Again.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.040
No, you're way behind us.

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.040
You're way behind us.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.040
Like make the kangaroo

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.040
like a threshold guardian to slow them down

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.040
so we can just keep pressing on.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.040
The kangaroos don't know.

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.040
No.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.040
Yeah, I'm a fucking kangaroo.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.040
What the hell?

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.040
The hell do you think I am?

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.040
I will happily punch a kangaroo in the face

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.040
so it's not a problem.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.040
Miles away.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.040
Kangaroo,

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040
we need to get to Ipswich.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:25.040
We're sorry about hitting you.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.040
Can you carry us in your pouch to Ipswich?

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.040
Yeah, my name's not kangaroo.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.040
Sorry, I was being

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:33.040
mammal normative.

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.040
Well, it's fine.

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.040
I understand why. It's just a bit rude.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.040
What is your name?

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:41.040
Charles. Charles.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.040
It's my one name I think of.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.040
Quick, filter. Let's hop in the pouch

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.040
and we'll make it worth your while, Charles.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.040
What the fuck?

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:51.040
You just have all these designs on me.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.040
I'm sorry. I busted up

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.040
your car. I was just trying to cross the road.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.040
Why?

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040
Because

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.040
we're trying to get

01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:03.040
out.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.040
We're trying to gather the resistance.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:07.040
We're planting a big assault.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.040
The kangaroo resistance?

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:11.040
Yeah.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.040
What the hell do you think we are?

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.040
We lead the resistance.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.040
Take us to the kangaroo resistance.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.040
We'll help. We want to join your cause.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.040
Alright, hop in.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.040
Meanwhile,

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.040
I

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.040
think we're

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:33.040
going to do good. I could

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.040
swear, I could see up ahead. Looks like

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:37.040
they got into some trouble. You see

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.040
a total beaut and kangaroo

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.040
prints leading away.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:43.040
Looks like a kangaroo

01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:45.040
Adam.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.040
It's honestly fair enough.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.040
We don't even have to probably fight

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.040
Pauline Henson in order to win.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.040
I feel like we could go home right now and everything would be okay.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.040
Let's go harm.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.040
Sorry. Sorry.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.040
I'm on your team.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.040
Don't fuck with me.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.040
Alright.

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.040
Let's go to Ipswich anyway because that's where I live.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.040
You get to your house

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.040
on the outskirts of Ipswich.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.040
To think this is where it all began.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.040
Come in.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.040
Opening the tiny round door.

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.040
Crawling in.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.040
I'm a normal sized person but I built

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:27.040
a hobbit sized home.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.040
So I could always feel like a visiting wizard.

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.040
You look over.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.040
What? Whoa.

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.040
Whoa.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.040
Let's see how this plays out at least.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040
You look over

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.040
and on the horizon you see

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.040
a huge wall

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.040
with a column of kangaroos

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040
and on the two biggest kangaroos

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.040
filter the purifier

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.040
and I, Smorf, are writing them like

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.040
tauntons.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.040
And we have like

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.040
we're like honorary kangaroo people now.

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.040
I've done like a spell

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.040
to make the ones that were on like Godzilla kangaroos.

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.040
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:15.040
He cast super kangaroo.

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:17.040
Yeah. And I

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:19.040
produced the eye of everything

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:21.040
and show it to the kangaroo.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.040
And I look down at my kangaroo and go

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.040
don't worry, it's the button stuck.

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.040
Shit, don't work.

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.040
Alright, the kangaroos hop forward.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.040
They're ranks approaching.

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040
They're

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.040
the line of kangaroos stretches as far as

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.040
the eye can see and they're just

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.040
steadily moving forward. They're about

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.040
40 feet off now.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:49.040
I hope this fails.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.040
I hope that's racist from kangaroo.

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.040
They

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.040
they stop.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.040
They stop.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.040
They stop.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040
They stop.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.040
They stop.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.040
They stop.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.040
They stop.

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.040
They stop.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:11.040
They stop.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:13.040
They stop.

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.040
They stop.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.040
Hello, Nick.

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.040
Who's that, too?

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.040
The head kangaroo.

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.040
The biggest one.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.040
The biggest one is being ridden by

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.040
Filtor.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.040
Hello, Nick.

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040
Hey.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040
It would appear

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.040
the apocalypse makes for strange

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.040
bedfellows.

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.040
I say to Nick and Charles

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:41.040
that

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.040
first off,

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.040
before I get to the meat and potatoes,

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.040
what I'm going to say,

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.040
whimsical names you kangaroos give each other.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.040
And second, I say,

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.040
don't bother with these two.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.040
They're not going to help.

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.040
The first thing they want to do is give up and walk away

01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.040
when the shit is hitting the fan.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.040
Yeah, I'm certain that's true.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.040
But all the same, he used the sacred kangaroo

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:05.040
call and we must respect that.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.040
Excuse me, but I

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.040
never said

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.040
you wouldn't do that.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.040
And isn't that

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:15.040
the Australian spirit that unites

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.040
all of them, be they

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.040
labor or liberal, be they

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.040
Ipswichian or Brisbaneian.

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.040
All Australians

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.040
are the same in that they are the one

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.040
seventh of the planet that will remain

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.040
when the rest has gone to naught.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.040
For they are

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:37.040
pre-abandoned.

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:39.040
They know not the shame

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040
of isolationism, nor

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.040
the intimidation of global trade.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.040
They have always been

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:47.040
confused and

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.040
happy and

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.040
jocular, you fucking prick.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.040
And is it not written in the Australian

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:01.040
Bill of Rights

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:07.040
that the prison marshals wrote

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.040
on the coast of Perth

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.040
when they first founded

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.040
this island nation?

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.040
Does it not say

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.040
that all men

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:19.040
are equal to kangaroos?

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:21.040
And women, and women.

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.040
Right, it says that, I'm sure.

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.040
I'm sure, because the document's older than 40 years

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.040
I'm sure it definitely

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.040
I'm sure it was definitely super

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.040
non-misogynist.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.040
Anything other than a Judy Bloom

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.040
novel, I'm sure it was.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.040
But anyways, I forgot

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.040
my point and I'm

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.040
bad at ending these things,

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040
but my name is Dan Hammo

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040
and I think we should all

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.040
team up. Nature,

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.040
man, scientist,

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.040
wizard, speaker,

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:57.040
elf, person,

01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.040
fighter, and

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:01.040
and defeat Paulie and Hansa.

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.040
Once and for all,

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.040
easy target may she be

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.040
creatively.

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:13.040
She will prove a tough adversary

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.040
in this narrative. Jenna, do you have anything

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.040
that you can give to the kangaroo army

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.040
that will like enhance

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.040
their powers as we attack? I'm not going to

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.040
help you. You're not going to help?

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.040
I'm definitely not going to help.

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.040
Okay. I'm against you.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.040
I feel like I'm against you. Okay.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.040
All right.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.040
Or maybe, wait,

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.040
do you feel like some MDMA?

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.040
Before we attack,

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.040
let's all just trip fucking hard.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.040
Let's roll like fucking

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.040
tumbleweeds.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.040
All right.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.040
Do you have enough for the whole kangaroo army?

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.040
I always have enough.

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.040
I love that. All right.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.040
We take that and now we're ready to do

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.040
it. Is MDMA's

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.040
ecstasy, right? Yeah. You're less,

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:03.040
you're now less ready.

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.040
We're not, you're not worthless.

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.040
Well, let's wait, we can

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.040
listen to some people. The kangaroos

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.040
feel the walls.

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.040
Oh my god,

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:17.040
this pouch is so soft.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:19.040
Feel this pouch,

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.040
you guys. This is amazing.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.040
What is that? Is that slime?

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.040
It's so nice.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:27.040
You guys, we don't call each other enough.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.040
Why do we only talk to each other when we're rolling?

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.040
We always talk. We should be talking.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.040
I don't even have your number on my phone.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.040
We definitely need to hang out more.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.040
I'm going to grind

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:41.040
everyone's teeth.

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.040
We don't grind each other's teeth

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.040
enough.

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:49.040
I say, is it weird that we're kind

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.040
of reclaiming Australia from

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.040
reclaim Australia?

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.040
It's like a political thing.

01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:57.040
I can't hear

01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:59.040
most of what you're, you got to eat that mic.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.040
Sorry. Well,

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.040
I didn't, I don't want to ruin your joke,

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.040
but I didn't understand it.

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.040
I say, is it kind of

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.040
ironic that we're reclaiming Australia from

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040
reclaim Australia kind of?

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040
Oh, I don't. That's a political slogan.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040
It's like a bunch of racists.

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040
Just stay here a bit longer

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.040
and you'll understand it.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.040
Listen, it's all topsy-turvy.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.040
I come from the land up over.

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:27.040
There's a guy

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.040
who began his political career

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.040
by making the black president

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.040
prove he wasn't a secret foreigner

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.040
who's more Russian than

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.040
a James Bond villain.

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.040
It's fucking insane right now.

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.040
I'm going to eat a brick

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.040
of glass and just

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.040
bang my head into a wall and die.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.040
I've never happy

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.040
ever anymore.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.040
I was wiping my ass the other day

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:53.040
and I used too much toilet

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.040
paper on accident and then I thought,

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.040
why do I care how much toilet paper I use?

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.040
Trump got elected and then I just used

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.040
a million pounds of toilet paper

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.040
and I stuffed my toilet,

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.040
my own toilet!

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.040
What, there's no system

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.040
getting destroyed except my own toilet

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.040
and my own planet, but I'm like,

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.040
everything is, that's what's happening

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.040
back over, over, over, over.

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.040
You got some bad molly, bro.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.040
Yeah, I'm freaking out, man.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.040
I feel like the pavement is dinosaur skin.

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.040
I apologize, I'm not the cleanest

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.040
of makers.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.040
I just use what's at hand.

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.040
I got it, I got it.

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.040
She stepped on this shit, man.

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:37.040
She put God knows what

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:39.040
in it.

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.040
All right, let's go, let's go.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:43.040
Yeah, I'm coming down, let's go attack.

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.040
Let's go attack.

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.040
We go up to the Death Star or whatever we're fighting.

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.040
All right.

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.040
Third act.

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040
Yeah, the kangaroos are advancing

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:55.040
on the, god damn it.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.040
What's her name? Pauline Hanson?

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.040
Yeah. Pauline Hanson Stronghold.

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.040
We don't care about her.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.040
Okay.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.040
What do you do?

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.040
Let her die.

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:09.040
She's a robot.

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.040
Robots can't die.

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.040
They must be destroyed.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:15.040
Or, you know, left alone, I don't know.

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.040
Let's go get her.

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:19.040
Let's go get her.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.040
I was describing that.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.040
I know, well, then she said she doesn't, you know.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:25.040
No, no, I get it.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:27.040
It's great.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.040
Mortar shells rain down.

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:31.040
Oh, god.

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.040
Exploding bursts

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.040
of dirt and sand as

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.040
kangaroo parts

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.040
are ripped asunder

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:41.040
like so much

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.040
mispackaged and mislabeled

01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:45.040
meats.

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:47.040
That happens.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.040
You make it to the wall.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.040
They're now too close

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.040
to shell.

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.040
All right. I start climbing the wall.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:57.040
Okay. Me too.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.040
You get to the top of the wall.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.040
Wait, what? I like to like

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.040
double bounce on the kangaroos.

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.040
I like to double like a trampoline.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.040
Right.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.040
Nice.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.040
I love

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.040
double bouncing.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.040
I'm just going to boost people, but I feel like

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.040
there's jack shit, so I'm going to just step out.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:21.040
Wait, I didn't hear it.

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.040
You're going to boost what?

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.040
I was just going to give everyone a boost.

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.040
I feel like I'm no use, so I'm just going to

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.040
prop everyone else up.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.040
Oh, nice.

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.040
I'm working together. You scale

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.040
the wall

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.040
and or double bounce up the

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.040
wall.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:41.040
Now you're at the top of the wall.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.040
You see several small spindly

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.040
robots actuating

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.040
various mortars and howitzers

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.040
at the top of the wall of the stronghold

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.040
of Hansen.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.040
I got this.

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:58.040
Oohhhh.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.040
Laser.

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.040
Shout.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.040
All right.

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.040
A focused beam

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.040
of audio energy

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.040
taught to me by the greybeards

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.040
atop Mount Hrothgar

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.040
in Skyrim.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:30.040
All right. You scream loudly. Your breathy burst of voice echoes out over the bram parts and

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:39.920
smashes into the spindly robots dealing 26 damage. The robot falls all to pieces.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:46.040
They both do? Or just one? Just one. How far down are they? What? You're on the wall,

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:55.600
they're on the wall. Oh, I have a double weapon. I have two swords and I go into, what's the one

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.120
you spin around and you do a crazy dazzling display kind of thing? No, just double attack

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:07.920
where I spin and fucking just. Rhythm gymnastics? My swords both have ribbons on the end of it,

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:15.640
so it's pretty cool. It's like a tribute to Scooby-Doo or some weird shit. I attack with

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:22.640
two swords. Attacking with both swords, you cut a devastating swath of, well, no, there's

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:28.040
not actually that much stuff. You would if there were more enemies, but instead you spin

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:38.600
like a whirling dervish, slicing the robot with your wicked blades, dealing, uh, seven.

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:47.920
Only one damage. Yeah. All right, now the robot operators of the Howitzers are dead.

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.800
You're on the ramparts. Pretty safe for now. I turn to the group and say, guys, we only

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:58.880
have four minutes left. We got to get this done. But Bodie and Jenna, whatever your character's

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:05.320
names are, it's time you did the perfect teamwork move, the two of you. One of you will do one

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:12.960
thing and then the other does the other thing, and then you defeat the whole thing. No pressure,

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.480
no pressure. Well, even though I'm a pharmaceutical barbarian, I picked up a couple of double

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:24.560
shotguns, so I just, I shoot some fuckers in the head. Okay. All right. How does that

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:31.400
go down? Well, let's see. You hear a terrible cracking sound as the interior of the stronghold

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:39.000
breaks apart and the shadowy towering colossus-like form of Pauline Henson bot emerges from the

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:48.000
stronghold, her eyes glowing and red with blood coming out of her, whatever. That's a,

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.600
yeah, it's great. She's coming at you with crazy robot claws, but you're shooting shotgun

01:50:54.600 --> 01:51:02.040
shells and slugs all at her body parts. Oh yeah. It's doing damage. How much damage?

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:12.720
I'm about to say because, yeah, math, 22 damage. Yeah. Way to go, Jenna. I'll take

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:21.440
it. I'll take it. The shells impact her body. It's great. You love it. Filter. Go purify

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:31.280
that bitch. I cast flight on myself. All right. As I like launched towards her with

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:37.560
my staff like held out to like stab her in the face. You're what now? My sand, sand punk

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:44.360
stuff. Oh, your staff. Okay. Sorry. All right. And then I, as I do that, I say, I don't like

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:59.600
it. That's the new flag. That's the new don't tread on me. All right. I guess a wooden staff

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:08.200
breaks through the giant metal robot because it's powered by not liking it. I turned to

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:12.080
the group and I said, look, you guys remember how I blinked earlier and I set off an explosive

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:18.080
because I'm part cyborg. What I didn't tell you guys is that when I was made, like when

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:27.480
I put the cyborg stuff in me, if I do a hard double wink, I turn into a giant bomb and

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:32.720
I'm just going to go to take one for the team. We fought. I was hoping that'd be how that

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:45.040
panned out. Look, you're, you're being combative and that's, that's, that's not on me. Jeff.

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:56.920
Who? Jeff. Smorf. Smorf. Smorf. I'm sorry we fought. It's okay. I want to, I want to,

01:52:56.920 --> 01:53:05.000
is this too contrived if I sing you? You should sing a bridge. If you sing me, if you, I'm

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.640
a bard. So if I sing, if I, I could sing you to the, to the bull's eye of Pauline Henson's

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:17.400
and then I'll just blow, blow her up. Yeah. Yeah. I will launch you on the voice of right.

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.120
All right. Jen has gone on record as a conscientious objector. Okay. She doesn't have a fighting

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:27.760
fire with fire. Use, use your bard powers. Power me up with your song. I'm not okay with

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:41.440
this. I'm just going to point it out now. I start running in slow motion. You see the

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:47.240
music bars come out of his mouth and become manifest. I get on them like a magic carpet

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:56.040
and I'm writing, writing these music, music notes and then staff lines. Aim your notes

01:53:56.040 --> 01:54:06.920
towards her, towards her butt. I, I'm flying up towards image, tell, tell us, uh, 80 meters.

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:13.440
I, I, I'm flying up in like right up towards her butt cheeks. Right in the hole, he, right

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.280
in the hole, Phil tour broke with a stick and I put my hands together like, like this

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:23.200
and I'm just trying to wedge through and I scream. I look back at the group and I waved

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:30.880
goodbye. Can you stop describing it and just do it already? I, I, I put a pin in that passive

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:45.200
aggressive shit. Try and, and I look up towards the hole that, that, that Phil tour made and

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:54.960
I said, I, I was one, I opened up my eyes and as I close my eyes, I scream, get jiffed.

01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:02.000
Everything explodes. Australia's saved. Wait, get, get the final, final description of it

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:10.520
from Sinsara. All right. Oh no. What does it look like? We see his feet just waving

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:17.640
outside the hole of the bus and suddenly there is just an explosion of red blood and gore

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:25.480
and oil and circuitry. Nice. That's how it's done everybody. Thank you so much. You guys

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:38.320
are awesome. Let's hear for Jenna, Bodie. Also, it's Sinsara, Jackson, Claire, Owen,

01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:46.840
Alice, the great people at Wheeler Center and the Comedy Theater. Let's hear it for

01:55:46.840 --> 01:56:00.320
Dan's baby, kicky dance. Spencer Crittenden in everybody. I become controller, Jeff Davis,

your mayor once again is Dan Harmon. You're allowed to go. You don't have to stick around
