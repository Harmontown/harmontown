00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Hello Arlington! Guess what? I've got very good news. Harmontown is now in session!

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Welcome to the Arlington draft house. Won't you please welcome the mayor of Harmontown,

00:25.000 --> 00:37.000
Dan Harmon. Dan Harmon! He's got a camera on his head. Dan Harmon! There's a camera on his head.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Dan Harmon! He's got a camera on his head. You all have to sign a release form later because

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
he has a camera on his head. He's got a camera on his head. I've got a camera on my head.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
But that doesn't matter because the most important 300 people are here in Arlington!

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
Welcome! 10 minutes from the front door of the forces that oppress us. Fuck these guys.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
You mean Washington D.C.?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah man. Aren't we like 10 minutes from the White House?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I don't know.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
With traffic maybe 18? There's no traffic?

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
You guys in this town, you want to talk about politics tonight, right? No, you love it.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
That's why you live here. You want to talk about politics.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Are you going to wear that camera on your head the whole show?

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Once the red light goes out it means we're out of, what do you call it, film now or footage?

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
iCloud? Whatever's in there, it'll run out. I'll take it off pretty soon.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Aren't you concerned about brain cancer? You've got a thing on your head.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm getting kind of a high off of the reduced blood flow. It's sort of a perfect thing.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Dan is wearing, lean forward Dan and show them what can only be described as a jockstrap on your head.

01:54.000 --> 02:03.000
It's like a biker's helmet without the protection and all the capacity to film your impending doom.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Let's do an experiment. Let's get Spencer out here immediately.

02:07.000 --> 02:17.000
Alright, we've never done it. Dan, we've never, hang on Spencer, what's your, oh shit, Spencer, Spencer.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
We've never brought him up this earlier. It's like in chess, bringing the queen out too early.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
They warn you not to bring your queen out too early in chess, Dan.

02:25.000 --> 02:36.000
You see a four-armed Spencer emerge from the bushes. He has an apple sweatshirt on and a full beard, full of beardness.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
He takes his seat way too early in the show. He is Spencer.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Thank you for joining us, Spencer.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Thanks.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Again, for those of you that possibly don't know who Spencer is, Spencer is our dungeon master we've been traveling with.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
At some point in the show we play Dungeons and Dragons with Spencer, who has truly been a wonderful companion on the road.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Thank you. And an indispensable Spencer. Dispensable? It doesn't matter.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Can I get more posters on my poo?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Can we turn my mic down a bit?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Can we get a winterbok and a windscreen for Jeff?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, all these mocks.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
My check.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
That's better, thank you.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm a town is the place to be.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Saw your mama with an ant and a bee.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Insect colony.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Saw your mama with a bug.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
That was just gibberish.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Confession. A couple of those last words weren't real words.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
But the art form of it is that's how insects talk.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
That was trophallaxis. It was vomit drop.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Insect wrap.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
How about a real wrap?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Here in Arlington?

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Oh, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Yo, yo, Arlington.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Oh, yo, yo, yo.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Place to be in a town I don't know.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Fuck your mama in the rain in the snow.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I'm like a mailman, do it in weathers.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Oh, fuck your mama with Carl Weathers.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Okay, you're not ready yet.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Let me warm up.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
We just met these people.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah, I'm sorry. We predicted backstage we always do this.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
We're like, there's a potential this will be a weird show.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Like we don't know, like this is a weird seating thing.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
For those of you in podcast land, we've got,

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
it's a perfect storm of comfort and alienation.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Everybody here is their own Captain Picard.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
They've all got these.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
They're all in these beautiful.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
That's exactly what it is.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
They're all in great reclining leather thrones.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Every single audience member in the Arlington Draft House

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
gets a fucking enterprise bridge captain's chair.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Which is fantastic.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
The fear to see the expendables too.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
It's a great place to watch a Quentin Tarantino movie.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It might be a horrible place to interact with me.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
These are all, you seem more powerful to me.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
Any one of you could tell us whether or not to engage at any point.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
They've all engaged in baskets of fries.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
This is the height of comfort.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
People have plates in front of them.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
It's not chosen.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Plates.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Plates.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Plosives.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Windscreen. Occupation zero.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
P-Hero.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
A little audio humor for you.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
Everyone is in a state-of-the-art Ikea rolling office chair.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
And every two people has a wonderful Formica table

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
loaded with the appetizers and beverages of their choices.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I just feel like Dan, we might be the only comedy show

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
to ever be the headliner for a Twilight movie.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Was anyone here?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Did anyone have to come in, watch a Twilight movie,

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
then leave and come back?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Who was here and watched Twilight and came back for us?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Thank you. Thank you, nobody.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Nice.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Thank God for that.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Okay, I'm not joking.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
I've never seen a Twilight.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I don't know what a Twilight...

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I mean, I know what Twilight is.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I know it's the thing between light and night.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
But is it vampires or chupacabras or werewolves?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
It's vampires.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Huh?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Vampires and werewolves?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
There's a few werewolves, yeah.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
But they're like Native Americans.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Wait, the werewolves are like Native Americans?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, they're not true.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
They're not afflicted by likeanthropy.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
They're Native Americans who are more...

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
They're shaped-shifted into these CG wolf creatures.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
In a world you notice has no hiding place.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I don't know. Shut up.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
Arlington Draft House, number one in accommodations

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
for the talent coming through.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I will say that, right?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
We're not going to offend anybody by saying that.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Certainly not.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We got ushered in here and the guy whose job it is

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
when we were asked if you get on a line is also...

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
He'll bring you chicken fingers.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And he'll do both with equal facility, I believe.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And with equal pride in his job.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I kept going like, I don't...

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
When we were asked before the show by a lovely guy named Jesse,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
he's like, let me know.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
If anybody in the audience gets too wild and woolly

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
or too interactive, I'll take care of it.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
We're like, if we call your name out, Jesse, that means...

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, and only if we call your name out.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Jesse, don't...

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
He's not Beetlejuice. If I say his name three times...

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
What if Jesse turned out to be the problem?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
What if as soon as he...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Okay, they started the show and then he goes in the back

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
and he ties his arm off and he shoots some smack.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Special security smack.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
It's a little black bag that says security on it.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
And then he comes out here and he's like,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
What did you shoot the fuck up?

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
You're not safe enough.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, so first in accommodations of the talent,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I've got a belly full of deep fried chicken fingers.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
This is our first show on...

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
This is day, what, eight?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Okay, how do we...

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I think it's not day eight, but it's our eighth show

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
and I think in nine days.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
This is our only show where we didn't have a hotel.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Our tour bus is like a block and a half away

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
and we landed at five o'clock p.m.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
It's now 10 or 30 p.m.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And we just got dressed on the bus

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and they've been wandering Columbia Pike

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
or wherever the fuck we are.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
And so this is the least together you're going to see us.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Spencer.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
One of the guys making the documentary

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
we were at this Thai food restaurant

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
and he said, hey, are you all right?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And he's like, yeah, I'm fine.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
And I said, are you going to be able to dungeon master tonight?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
And he said, yeah, give me the name of a monster.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
And someone said, werewolf.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And he said, leaping from the bushes,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
its arms raised in aggression and protest,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and werewolf started.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I said, yeah, I'd turn it on and on.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Should we try that out right now?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Let's try a couple.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
Spencer, anyone from the audience?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Not a real monster.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Make up a new monster.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Something out of your own imagination.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
The what?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
The tooth beast.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Spencer, the tooth beast.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
You hear the gnashing and grinding of ivory against ivory.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I'm going to fucking die.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm going to die.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Should I even go on at that point?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
No, you should.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
You could or you couldn't, it doesn't matter.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm going to die.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I'm going to die of happiness.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
You hear the gnashing and mashing of ivory against ivory.

10:27.000 --> 10:34.000
Spencer, I was pretty sure I loved you the moment we met you at Meltdown.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Now what are you doing?

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
It's grown and grown by a very logical, geometrical line.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
That's what we call a direct correlation.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
That's just the teeth.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
You're only making it more exponential.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
Your curve gets parabolic as it exponentializes into the hazy mist of mathematical curvature.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
As X becomes closer to Y, I don't know.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
You hear the gnashing and mashing of ivory against ivory.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
The gnashing of ivory against ivory.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
It's like right off the top, like Dan and I, we both have speech impediments.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
Dan goes, I, I, I, I, I, I, I start sentences.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
A bunch of times like too.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
You have the Hugh Grant, I have the Woody Allen maybe.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Jimmy Stewart.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
Hugh Grant versus Woody Allen.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Spencer, you speak so distinctly.

11:38.000 --> 11:47.000
Like, there's no stuttering, there's no ums, or urrs, or us, or whatever, it's just, it's very articulate, very specific, very precise, if you say so.

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
I do.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
Can we unveil my partial bridge to the chicken noodle dick song? I want to...

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know if Jeff approves of it yet, but this is what I came up with.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
I, I...

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
Here I am, I ain't got a dick, I got a chicken noodle can.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
All my life, I've been put in this can as I'm a chicken noodle wife.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Chicken noodle god, come down from the mountain sing, chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan, feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
Soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon, spoon to the mouth, you're gonna get well soon.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
That's all I got.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon, spoon to the mouth, you're gonna get well soon.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It's not really, it's not really a bridge, it's another verse.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I don't know what it is, I don't know what it is.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
We need a musician to write us like, we need to move to like a minor key there.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't know what it is, nor did the people who built our nation's railroads.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Like, they didn't go to music college.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
They went by instinct and God, like God went through them.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
When you break a man down to his fundamentals, he becomes Beethoven.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Like they didn't need to know, oh, oh, is it the bridge or the chorus?

13:12.000 --> 13:28.000
I don't fucking know, like put another fucking railroad hinge in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the rail, rail, rail pocket.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
Spencer, railroad monster.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
You hear the sound of far-off pistons firing.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Steam rises to the east.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
You hear the horrendous grinding of teeth, and then you see it.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
Half man, half locomotive, all monsters.

13:49.000 --> 13:59.000
He's fucking so good. He's so good.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
He's a national treasure.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
He's a national treasure whose parents dropped him off at the bus.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
I have a picture of Spencer and his mom and dad, and they look like our age.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Yeah, of course.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And they're like older than you guys.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Barely. Your mom was in my chemistry class.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
My mom's like 20 years older than you.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
It still, it doesn't matter.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
What's their secret, Spencer? Why do your parents look so youthful?

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Um, they drain the souls of other people.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Uh, uh, Spencer parent monsters.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah, the parent monster.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Opening the door to your room.

14:33.000 --> 14:43.000
You quickly turn off your computer screen.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Jesus Christ.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Why are we up here and why are you back there?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
This whole thing is fucking backwards.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
That's what I just thought.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Tonight, that's what's important about tonight.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I officially cede the show to Spencer.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah, I do.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Advocate.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Like, like, like.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Jesus Louise.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh man.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
That's a super power.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
There was a conversation on a tour bus.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Dan is busy, like, sitting in the front section,

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
which I call the, the, the, the folksal of our tour,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
of our tour bus.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
The four castles, but it's called folksal.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Any sailors out there?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah, good stuff.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, there's a couple of sailors.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
That's safe to assume.

15:27.000 --> 15:37.000
Uh, it is our nation's capital.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
We're near Annapolis, Maryland.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
There might be some midshipmen out there, right?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Of course, there usually is.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Any bachelorette parties?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
No, it's, it's Harmonians.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
They, it's, it's, yeah, it's.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
He loves his yacht.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Spencer, Spencer, yacht monster.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Off the port back.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
You see a spout of rising water.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
I don't know, that's all I got that time.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It's all right, it's all right.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Free style DM.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm pretty sure that was Moby Dick, but that's still, that's still good.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah, you see a hump like a snow hill.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
There she blows, quick, quick, cried.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
Let me tell you about how knots work.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That was just Moby Dick.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
I think I know how they work.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I just don't have a time, any of them.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I think they all work on the principle of making rope hard to pull.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, he was, he was making a joke about Moby Dick,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
which most of it is about the minutiae of, you know, of being aboard a ship.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah, I read a book, people.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
A literacy monster.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
You see a stumbling towards you.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
It looks at the sign standing in front of you.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
It falls into the pit that was clearly labeled.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm gonna fucking die of a god damn pleasure attack.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
He's on a stage here in Arlington.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm gonna die of happiness.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
I have never, we gotta stop, we stop putting him on the spot.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
But this is where we reveal that this whole thing has been a ruse,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
that you and I are gonna leave the stage, like we're gonna pretend, like,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
oh, we're demoralized, we're gonna leave, and then Spencer's gonna leave

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
and come out dressed like Dolly Parton and he's gonna sing a song,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
and you're gonna find out he can tap dance so he can do anything.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
And then the usurpation will be complete.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
Arlington facts, Jeff.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Okay, let's hear him.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Dan boasts of his ability to, while he's shirking his responsibilities

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
for a screenplay or as TV show scripts,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Wikipedia is the town that we've just dropped into.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So let's hear what you got, Dan.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Jeff, did you know that Arlington, Virginia is the rape state?

17:54.000 --> 18:04.000
So-called by Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1910,

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
who was then six years old and had been raped by his own mother.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Who, let me finish, invented the typewriter.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
We are in a fascinating historical...

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
What a legacy.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
What a career.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Virginia was the 17th state to leave the union

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
and the 14th state to join the union,

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
thereby creating a time paradox in which it fought itself in 1920,

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
which resulted in the development of copper wire and the telephone

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
and the typewriter and marshmallow cream and license plates.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
And the movie Jaws was shot here.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
And the...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I didn't look anything up.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
And they lead the nation in eternal flame technology.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Yes, you guys...

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh yeah, yeah, there's a lot of...

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
Cemetery culture here is more advanced than ancient Maya and Aztecia combined.

19:16.000 --> 19:25.000
The word Aztecia was invented here by Carl Reiner in 1940.

19:25.000 --> 19:33.000
Thomas Edison choked to death here on a hooker.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
And that's where he got the idea for the flux capacitor.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Virginia was originally non-Virginia.

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
But it felt the name was too braggy.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
So it changed it to Virginia.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Dan, who do you like better?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Virginia, West Virginia, or East Virginia?

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
I think all my favorites is Mega Virginia.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
The secret Virginia developed by NASA scientists

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
that is in geosynchronous orbit with the other five Virginias.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
And yeah, watch us down on all of you.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
How many of you here tonight are from Virginia?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
A question for you guys.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
What is Virginia?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Is it a county? A state?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
A Commonwealth.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Don't get snippy.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I've been everywhere.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm like an astronaut now.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I'm walking in here with a swagger.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
I don't even know where I am.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
No, we're 10 minutes from the White House.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Let's scream something at them, Jeff.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
We're tired of your bullshit!

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
Why is it gotta be white?

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
Why do I have to take my shoes off every time I go through the airport?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Stupid.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
How many 9-11s have you stopped?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
With shoes.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
With shoe absence.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
For all we know, 100s.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
For all we know, none.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
And we do know.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
They stop when they go,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
He had a thing in his shoe!

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
He had a thing in his shoe!

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
They get excited about it.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But if somebody else blew up some heavy shit,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
they wouldn't call that a 9-11.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
They'd probably call it whatever date that happened on.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
They'd call it a 4-14 or something like that.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
They'd call it either 9-12 or 10-11.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Wouldn't they?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
What if it happened in the spring?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't know.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Oh, September.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I just got that.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I just got that.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
I thought it was like 9-11.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
You know, every day since I was like,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
in middle school,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
you've loved me.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Come to me.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
No, I look at the clock.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Every single day I was very young,

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
and I see 9-11 on a clock once or twice a day.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
It's constant.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I can wake up out of sleep and pick up my phone,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
look at it, 9-11.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
I see it all the time.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I do.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I saw it today.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
I saw it today once.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
That's a phenomenon I read about on the Internet.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
It's your brain attributes significance to 9-11,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
and your brain works backwards.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I was in middle school way before 9-11.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And you remember seeing 9-11 a lot

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
before 9-11 happened?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Yeah.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
No.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Because back then it was 9-11.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It was the emergency call number.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And I would always see 9-11.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It got to the point where it used to scare me,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
but then I would see 9-11.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
If I would get into a friend's car and I'd pop in,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and I would look at their digital clock,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
and it would go 9-11,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
and I would see it,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
and it was like seeing the face of a friend.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
So now when I see it, I go like,

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
hey, buddy.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
And then when 9-11 happened,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
that all changed,

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
because now it's a whole different thing.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Well, moving on with our facts about Arlington.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Highest probability of anyone in the audience

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
having lost a loved one during 9-11?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And we're doing bits about it.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Yo, sensitive stuff.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Marshmallow fluff.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Invented in Summerville.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
But here's where you invented 9-11.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
It's a little less appetizing.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Acclaimed to fame, but...

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
You did it. Congratulations.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
What did Wisconsin do?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Shoes.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I think we invented shoes.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Cheese.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Okay.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
They invented Dan Harmon there,

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
as this gentleman says.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
All right, come on.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Let's move on and let's meet some people.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Let's stir some shit up.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Do we have a representative of Arlington, Virginia out there?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Anybody who feels that they have something to do with that?

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Do we have anybody that believes in ghosts?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Isn't this a big ghost state?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
Has anybody ever had an encounter with a ghost?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
A real one.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Holy shit, nobody...

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I think we just proved ghosts.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Okay, get up here.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
What's your name, sir?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Adam's coming up.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
We'll be with you in a second, probably, too.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I thought maybe...

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Because we're on the East Coast.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
There's more ghosts on the East Coast.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
It used to be called...

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
No, it's true.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
It used to be called the East Ghost.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
That's how it got its name.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Adam, tell us your ghost story.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I was like...

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I guess I was eight or nine years old,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
and I was in my parents' bedroom early on,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
on a Sunday morning.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
That was no ghost, Adam.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
That's called an erection.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
It was haunting, but natural.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
But I looked across the room,

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
and all of a sudden I saw this dark shadow figure,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
and I think his head popped off,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
and it was bouncing back and forth against the walls.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Oh my god, I just had a realization.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh my god, what a breakthrough.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
No, wait, I'm sorry.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
You saw a dark figure.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
You were in your parents' bedroom.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Were they there, too?

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah, we were all in the bed together,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
because that's not weird.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
How old were you, eight, nine?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I was like eight or nine.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
I slept with my mom a lot during my parents' separation.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Did you see a dark figure into the room?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
My parents separated,

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
and my mom moved to South Milwaukee.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
We never pronounced the H there.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
She was living above her mom's place, my grandma,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
and every night I would hear her calling on the phone to my dad

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and going, I said, I don't know what's going on.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And it was emotionally put me in a bubble.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
But I remember sleeping in my mom's bed,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
because I could have sworn my mom wanted me to.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I could have sworn it was not my choice.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I bet I was all fucked up, too.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
But this is the most distinct emotional memory I have.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
My dad came over to visit my mom.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
They were separated.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
And my dad came over and was like,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
ah, I guess we're going to go to the zoo.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Tiki, that was my nickname.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Wait, sorry, what?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Let's get back to that later.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
My nickname was Tiki.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And then my mom said,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
can I talk to you alone for a second?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
To my dad.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
So that meant I had to leave.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
So I left the room, but I listened at the door,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
because it was like, what the fuck?

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I guess they're going to talk about me, obviously.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
They're not going to talk about the stock market.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
And my mom really threw me under the bus.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
I listened at the door, and I heard my mom go,

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
this is really fucking up your son.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
He sleeps in bed with me every night.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
It's traumatizing him.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
And I remember thinking, you bitch.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
You hit on me.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
You wanted it.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I feel that way about my mom sometimes, Dan.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
For real?

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
Yeah, she's constantly very, really, really affectionate,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
but almost to a point that it feels almost sexualized.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Or fake.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Or fake, targeted.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
No, not fake.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Do you have siblings?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I have one older brother, but we have different moms.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
They say there's a thing, referred to as silent seduction,

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
where a mother will pick one of two or more male offspring,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
and that one receives all of the love, all of the affection.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Because she wants to change.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
All the craziness, all the anger.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
That's absolutely true.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Yeah, so I think I had that one, too.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
You're involved in an unwitting, emotional kind of relationship,

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
like a dating relationship with this woman.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
Yeah, it skips me out sometimes.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
That's why I don't live near her.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Did you get to an age when, I remember being like 12 or 13,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and my mom coming up behind me and kind of like,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
giving me like a shoulder rub and kind of,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
and then me going like, knock it off.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I think that's just a puberty thing, right?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
She was going through puberty?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
No, I was.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
I think the reason I remember it is because I was like,

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I decided, okay, no more affection.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Like, I don't, you know, I'm a man now.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't want my mom touching me.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Or did she see you going through puberty and goes,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm going to get this power up?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
A man!

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Yeah, I don't know, man.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
God damn it, we need more open books on this stuff.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
You hear me, White House?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Where's your committee on this shit?

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Stop making us take our shoes off at the airport.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
And start figuring out our mom's brains.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Why do they want to fuck us so bad?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So, Adam, you feel like you were the lightning rod

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
for all of your mothers, like, attention in that way?

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Oh, and when it comes to the craziness, definitely.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Like, my parents got divorced, like, four years ago,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
which, you know, I was surprised by, like,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
it usually doesn't happen that much later in a person's life.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Like, I was 21 when it happened,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and basically, whenever I had to go home.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And they come to you, you're in a bar in your deck,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
and they're like, it's not your fault.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
It's important for you to know.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
My dad doesn't even talk about that sort of stuff,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
or anything real, for that matter.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I remember my dad trying to talk to me

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
about our parents' separation and me getting so embarrassed.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
I was reading, like, a Spider-Man comic

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
on the front scene of our stage,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
and my dad finally started to broach the subject,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
like, way too late, way too late.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Like, everything was, the luggage was moved,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
everything was topsy-turvy, and, like,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I was reading a Spider-Man comic,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
which was to shut down and become autistic.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And I remember my, you know,

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
or commit to an already prevalent autism.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And my dad was, like, driving, and he just,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
I don't know, I was like,

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
you know, your mother and I are going through some changes.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
And I was like, just, I was like,

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
focus on the Spider-Man!

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
You know, it's important for you to know

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
it's not your fault.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
It's just stumbling through this thing,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
like, no, finish it up, play them off!

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And then, like, they're being in this pause,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
and they go, you know, it's just important for you to know that

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
if you'd stop reading your fucking comic book,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I got really mad, and I was like, I know!

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
God, Jesus!

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Like, I remember that moment, too.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Like, my dad, like, reaching out to me,

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
it was just painful.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I said, let's connect here, let's look inside the eye.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, but it was too late and too artificial, too focused.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And how old were you at that point?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
9-11.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Or 9-11.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Spencer, just disaffected emotional parent monster encounter.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Hold up, hold up.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Trying to get her attention,

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
your mother looks over with a lazy, glazed-over look.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
She seems exhausted as if the weight of the world

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
rest on her shoulders.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
Do you think that this might not be the best time to ask for ice cream?

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
I'm going to fucking die.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Alright, so Adam, you're ghost, the ghost.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
A dark figure comes in, the head's popping about,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
and then moving about, right?

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Yeah, it's just sort of popping about and making this sort of hissing sound.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
All I can really remember is, like, I couldn't breathe at all.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That's a thing.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Sorry, I'm stammering.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
I remember being in my bed,

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
there's a chemical in your brain that paralyzes you when you're asleep, right?

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
So that you don't, if you have a dream that you're like a fucking hot dog,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
that you don't get up and fuck a hot dog.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Which won't be a hot dog, it'll be the ironing board,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and you'll hurt your family.

32:16.000 --> 32:23.000
When you go into deep sleep, they're supposed to be like,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
your body can't move, and so your brain goes into this state where,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
no matter how much flailing around you're doing in your sleep,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
you're not actually moving.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
But then there's this weird thing that happens.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
We've all had this experience, probably everyone in this room,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
where you wake up and you're fully awake,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
but that chemical has still paralyzed your body,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
and you can't move.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
You're awake and you can't move.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
And sometimes you can't breathe, that doesn't happen to you?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I've never had that.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
That's sleep paralysis, yeah, that happens.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
That's right, for me, they say like,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
your dreams, like when you're trying to run,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
or just even jog up a hill,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
your legs are sluggish and you can't move,

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
that your brain, knowing that the chemicals your brain administers

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
while you sleep, to make you really just fall asleep,

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
and your eyelids shut, and everything work, and shut down,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
and your brain knows that, so you're kind of paralyzed during your dreams.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I've never had that in my waking state.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
So when people are, yeah,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
all this shit that happens to you in your sleep,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
it's all just various combinations of different sleep disorders.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Like sometimes that paralysis chemical is not working right,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
which is sleep walking.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
But Adam, were you awake?

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
Yeah, like I had been awake for a few minutes when it happened,

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
and all I remember is I was hearing, you know,

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
the hissing sound and the head popping back and forth,

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
and I kept wanting to say something, like wake my parents up,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
and tell them what was happening, and I couldn't,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
and then like the next thing I knew, it just disappeared.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
Yeah, but then after it disappeared, did you then go,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Ah!

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
Even though it was too late, that's what I did.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
I remember like waking up, I remember being wide awake in my bed

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
when I was like 17,

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
and I remember the full on perfectly vivid image

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
of an absolute like corporeal woman.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Like a witch in a black robe,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
starting from the corner of my bedroom behind my bedroom door,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
taking full strides over to my bed,

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
and like covering, like getting in my face,

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
like a real person, and I was wide awake,

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
and I just couldn't move while she was doing it,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
and then it kind of like disappeared in a cloud,

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
but I was wide awake and in cold sweats,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
and then as soon as I regained my faculties,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I went, Mom!

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
I was 17, it was so embarrassing.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
They say, they say,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
And she rolled over and goes, What is it?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Real nice, Jeff.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
And I say, Steph, give me shoulder rubs,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
and get to the real deal.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Is there anybody in our audience,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
and don't be embarrassed,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
you're not going to get bullied like for real,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
like buy up, I guess buy applause only because we can't see you.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Is there anybody who is like,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
you're just waving very,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
is there anybody in the audience who wants to just wave?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
But beyond that, is there anybody in the audience

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
that believes in alien abduction, like mythology,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
like the idea that there are aliens?

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
How about a woman? Any gals here believe in it?

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Well, there was applause.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Anybody want to come up and talk about it?

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Is there anybody willing to come up and talk about it a little bit?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
You believe in it, right?

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Alright, he's not a lady, but he believes in it.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Let's welcome whoever you are.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
What's your name, sir? Casey.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Casey, to the stage, everybody.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Spencer, alien monster.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Is that a...

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
You see a circular beam of light

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
floating down from the heavens

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
as a green, ghastly figure with a large, oversized head.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
It's like an alien.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Alright.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
That was too over the plate.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I don't do sci-fi.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Message there.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Spencer's board, that was the message.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Some bullshit's happening.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
Go to Hot Topic if you want this kind of crap.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I cater to a specific crowd.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Go fuck yourself.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
Alright, Casey, you believe in alien encounters, abductions?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah, sure.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
Is that based on anything?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
What do you base that belief on?

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
That it would be rad.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That it would be rad?

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
That's why I believe in hot tub parties.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
I was writing a screenplay when I was 23-ish,

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
something like that.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
That was an alien abduction comedy.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
It's going to be like a new Ghostbusters.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
And I started researching all this alien abduction shit,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and it got really freaked out,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and I got frequent nosebleeds as a kid,

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
and I had all this stuff when I was asleep,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
and I started experiencing it.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
It gets in your head.

37:06.000 --> 37:14.000
I really thought aliens were about to give me Jeff.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
People have instances where they have blacked out,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
or something weird has happened,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
and then the next morning you wake up,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and there's a physiological difference.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Maybe you lost some hair, or an ear, or something.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
An ear?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
It may have occurred.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
Does anyone in the audience think they've been abducted by an alien?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
Applaud, if you can.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
If you can overcome your telepathic chip.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
Casey, you're just saying your mind is open to that possibility.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
You think that people, you believe, you want to believe,

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
that people have been interacted with by aliens.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
Yeah, my mind is unencumbered, in that way.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
That's real groovy, Jackson.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Mine too, I wouldn't rule it out.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Why bother ruling anything else?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I don't believe in ghosts.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
I have a logical, skeptical mind.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I don't believe that ghosts come around,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
and fuck with you, and throw a plate across the room.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
However, I had an apartment that is now our friend Rob Schrab's apartment.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Rob Schrab is how I know Dan Harmon.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
They were writing partners,

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
and I had to move out of an apartment in LA, Casey,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
and it was a great apartment.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
But I couldn't afford it, and my roommate moved out, and I was broke.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
But the day that my friend and I moved in, it was Halloween,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
but we didn't think about that.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And also, the number, the prefix for the phone number

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
that the telephone company wanted to give us was 666,

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
because mine is 665, but that's like 664 or 663.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
That's that neighborhood, but they can't get rid of the 666s

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
because people are Catholic and shit, you know, or whatever.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
So my roommate was Irish Catholic.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
He's like, oh, no, I can't do that.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
My mother never called me. She never called.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
And so we got another number, and so we checked in this new place,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
and we were the third residents to ever live there,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
but the apartment was built in the 50s.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
The first resident, a LAPD homicide detective,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
and then an old married couple, and the husband died.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Not in that apartment, I don't know, a hospital, rather,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
and the wife moved to a one-bedroom in the building.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
So then it's a great place, and every time the two of us

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
were out of the house, out of the apartment,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
something crazy happened. We bought a brand new clock.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Every time we left, we'd come back.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
The clock would be stopped at a certain time,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and all of the pictures on the wall would be off the wall,

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
but thrown across the hallway to the opposite side and broken.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Yeah, so the painting was on the right side of the hallway.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
It would be thrown to the left side of the hallway and smashed,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
and left to right and smashed,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
and things would be tipped over and broken.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
So we thought, okay, somebody has our keys,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
and they're coming in to wreck in our place.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
So we asked Helene, the widow of the dead guy,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
who'd lived there for 35 years,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
does anybody else have these keys?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
He goes, no, we just put new locks on.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I don't even have the keys. You and the landlord,

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
and he's an 80-year-old guy, like only you guys have the keys.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
So usually one or the other of me and Paul

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
would be at the apartment at one time,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
because we had very different schedules,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
because I was an alcoholic and he was an animator.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
So he was up early, and I was out dancing.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
So we were usually, somebody was at home,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
but any time the two of us went to the market together,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
we'd come home and everything was busted.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
The pictures were all thrown around, clocks would stop,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
and the bathtub would, there would be,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
just doesn't matter everywhere.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.000
Not like stuff, like if the drain spat out stuff,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
or not if it backed up, there was just a random splatter pattern

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
of stuff all over the bathtub,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
and we just thought, someone's fucking with us,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
what's going on?

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
That kind of goes away a little bit.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
We find there's an attic in it.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
We go up into the attic and we look up,

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
and it's LA, it's like 78 degrees out always,

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and in the attic it should be hotter,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
because the heat rises.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I get up into the attic and I look up,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
and I see some old Christmas decorations and stuff,

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
and instantly the temperature drops to what feels like 55 degrees,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
outside the draft house right now,

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
and it's like, isn't it just crazy chill comes over me?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I kind of get this weird feeling,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
and I don't think, ooh scary ghosts,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I just drop back down the little ladder,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
and I go, Paul, go check it out,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
there's some cool stuff up there,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
like to get a real reading on this,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
and he cleans the ladder and puts his head right down,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
and he goes, Jeff, we're never going up there again.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
All right, so time passes a little bit,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and in that bedroom, I had the bedroom with a husband slept,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
because they were an old married couple,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
and I think you find that often they sleep in different rooms,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
because the husband snores and farts,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
and the woman wants to get a night's sleep,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
and I had his room, and I was getting undressed,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I'm down to my boxers, and I just have a feeling

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
that absolutely somebody's behind me,

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
like somebody's on the carpet behind me,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
and I turn around and I'm like, okay, fucking enough,

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
I never did shit, I never did this, you're dead,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
you don't live here anymore,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I live here now, so fucking stop it!

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Stop it!

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
And nothing ever happened again, so I still...

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
It's just that simple,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
story is far from over.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
The only reason they made a bigger deal out of it

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
in the exercise is because obviously

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
that would be a shitty movie.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Suck it off!

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I got work in the morning!

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
My roommate goes, what the hell's going on?

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
I go, I just exercised my bedroom as a fucking guy,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
so the end, I lived there for another eight months,

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
and everything weird ever happens,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I never thought the place was haunted,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
there was this weird activity that kept fucking happening,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
but there was a time when I felt there was a motherfucker

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
standing behind me, and not because the guy had died,

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
he didn't die there, I was not implanted with this knowledge,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
I didn't really care about it,

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
so Rob Schrab moves in a year later when I move out,

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
and...

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Story's halfway done.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Oh, no, this is like page two of 100.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
So we're at a bar, Rob Schrab is at the drawing room,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
he's at the burgundy room, and Rob comes out,

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
and he just gets a screwdriver, and just, boom, drops it,

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
gets a bartender, another, drinks it straight down,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
another, and he's drinking it, and I go,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
Rob, what the fuck? I've never seen you drink like this,

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
he's like, oh man, I don't want to go home sober.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm like, what's up, Maron?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Like with the girlfriend or the girl you're dating?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
He's like, no, I'm just like, I don't know, stupid,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I don't want to talk about it, I just don't...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
He's about to cry, I'm like, what the fuck's going on?

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
This is...

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
The place on Lowry is like,

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
anything weird ever happened there to you?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And I was like, what do you mean?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I still, again, I don't instantly leap to ghosts,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I never really thought there was going to be

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
just a bunch of weird shit happening.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
And he goes, I don't know, I was like...

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
You slept in the bedroom I slept in, right?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I sleep, and I go, yeah, and he goes,

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
is it haunted?

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
I go, oh yeah, totally.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And Rob goes,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
oh, don't see that!

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Don't see that!

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
He starts crying, I go, what happened?

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
What the fuck happened? He goes,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
ever since I moved in there,

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
I hung on this artwork up,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
and every time I left the place and there was nobody in there,

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I would come back and all the paintings were off the walls,

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
and they were all broken.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
And each time I hung a picture of somebody's face on it,

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
all the pictures were gone,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
and it was smashed across the room.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And last night, there was all this weird shit going on,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
but last night I was laying in bed,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
and the door opened, and I felt,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I heard somebody walking across the carpet into my room,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
and I felt the weight of a person's body

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
getting onto my bed,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
and I was like, were you awake or were you asleep?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I was on my stomach, which is rare for me,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
but I looked at the clock, and it was 4 or 10 a.m.,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
and I thought, are Dan and Jeff still here?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Did we watch a movie together?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
No, they're not here.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
I had this conscious thought,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
and I felt this person get on top of me,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
and I thought, it's a burglar,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
like burglars in my room, or rapists.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Yeah, certainly not.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Not until tonight.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
And the weight of a body

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
got on top of him, and he heard a voice

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
in his ear going, and the voice said,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
what are you doing in my room?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
And Rob jumped up across the room,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
and nothing was there.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
So I went with Rob to the apartment again,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
and I went, get the fuck out of here, man!

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
You're dead!

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Rob made me go back and be

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
the world's shittiest exorcist.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
This has been a Halloween,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Halloween Arlington,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Arlington National Cemetery,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
spooky, ookey, Harmon Toonies.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
The end.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Jesus Christ.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I think you've told that story before on the podcast.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Is that right?

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I don't give a shit.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
No?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Yeah, in your face.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Thank God.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I was lost with a camera on your head.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Yeah.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Alright, Casey,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
what do you want?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
But I mean that in the actual,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
not the passive-aggressive sense.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
What do you really want?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
A sip of whatever that is you're drinking.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
That goes without saying.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Load them up, load them up.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
But I mean,

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
while you load that up,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I want to hear what you want.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
An adjective, a sentence, a phrase,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
a thought.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
What do you want?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
We're going to give it to you figuratively.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
If you could go home tonight and tell your loved ones

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
something happened tonight,

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
what would that be?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Joy.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
You want joy?

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Did someone boo?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Joy?

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
We really are ten minutes from the White House.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Pancakes.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
No, no, no, not in that case.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Don't cater to that asshole.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
He said pancakes.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I thought he said in that case.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Pancakes, joy and pancakes.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Casey wants joy and pancakes.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Can we just real quick, Jeff?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Oh, it's a rap?

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I thought it would be like a movie,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
like a quick movie.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
A movie called Joy and Pancakes?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Alright, starring Casey.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
With me is Casey.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And Casey is he you?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Right here, fuck him.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Casey everybody, welcome Casey.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
The year is 1939.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Hitler's armies have crossed

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
into Poland.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
World War II has begun.

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
In combat.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
Sir, Lieutenant Casey reported for duty, sir.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Where are my pancake, soldier?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Sir, I tried to get them as far as Verdun.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Soldier, stand in attention

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
when you're in front of your commanding officer.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Sir, yes sir.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I'm apologize, sir.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It was Verdun, sir.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Verdun was World War I.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
You're in the wrong war, sir.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Soldier, we are fighting in a wrong war.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Yes sir, sir, yes sir.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
World War II, sir, sir.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I tried to keep track of it, sir.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I tried to make pancakes, but I couldn't, sir.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
What war was Hamburger Hill?

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Sir, you're making me hungry, sir.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
No, that wasn't the trick or trick question.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
That was Korea.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Sir, D-Day's coming.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
D-Day?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Does D stand for delicious?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I don't know, sir. I wasn't authorized.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Don't come back into my tent until you have pancake, soldier.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Do you hear me?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Or I'll send you to Leavenworth.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Yes, sir.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Even though we're not in the Navy.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm just a soldier without a war.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
Trying to bring pancakes, but I need more.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
Don't know what place to shoot or duck.

49:03.000 --> 49:09.000
Germans in both wars don't give a fuck.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Ah!

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
No, no, no.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
During my song, I wandered across enemy lines.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
There's a mortar attack.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I got to dive into this foxhole.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
No, no, no. Englander?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
See.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I speak a little English.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
I am a German pancake-meister.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
It's coming!

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Oh, sorry.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I'm sorry.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I thought you were beatboxing.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Forgive me.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I am from the future.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Listen.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
This war is needless.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
War is all about destruction and annihilation

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
and separation between the people.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
The lines are connected.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
A human from a lesser human being.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I always had that sense.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Can I tell you a simple story?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
See.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
About 11 years ago,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
before Rob Schrab lived in this apartment,

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
I lived in an apartment with an Irish roommate.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And it was Halloween.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
And the phone company, it's six hours later.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Holy shit.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
The war is over.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Huh?

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
So then I climb up into the attic

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
and I look around and I get the weird

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
that the temperature just changes.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
And so I go back down.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
12 years later.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And I...

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
The cold war is over.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Or beginning.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Actually, we're right kind of in the middle

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
of the cold war right now.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Johan.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Yes, Sebastian?

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
Casey for short.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I don't have much time left.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I'm now 93.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I feel...

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I feel like I wasted about 24 years

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
on a story about a ghost.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It's okay.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
I really should have just given you a recipe

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
for pancakes that could have stopped

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
both World War I and World War II.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
You see, I am a timeless pancake meister.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Yes.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I was there at the Battle of Valley Forge.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Yes.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I was there...

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Flashback to Valley Forge.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Washington Soldiers!

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Charge!

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I'm George Washington!

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Cross it!

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Keep crossing it!

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Don't stop!

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Get your pancakes!

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
Get your German future pancakes!

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Sir, sir!

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
My name is George Washington.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I'm trying to cross this area.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
You need to get clear, sir. Get clear!

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I would give you George Washington

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
the recipe to my secret German future pancakes.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
However, if I did that, war would end.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
But I cannot do that.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
You see, I'm here to cast a sad light on humanity.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
You see, war is a

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
perpetual state of humanity.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Hey, man, I don't...

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
My teeth are made of wood.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I don't have time for this climbing ocean.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
The hippopotamus lied.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
The hippopotamus bone.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Flash forward to the

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
spine of the...

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Yeah?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You were at Valley Forge?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Yeah.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
So anyway,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
throughout time,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I could have given Alexander the Great

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Napoleon pancakes, and all wars would have ended.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
But you see, I withhold pancakes.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Because war is a part of...

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
It's a part of who we are.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
It's a nutritious breakfast

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
of humanity.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
It's part of this nutritious breakfast of humanity.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Like the orange juice is pain,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
and the milk is...

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Casey, don't worry about war.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Wars will solve themselves.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
What you should worry yourself most with

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
is aliens.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Cut to

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Manhattan

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
2019

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
A.D.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Hovercar.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
In the news,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Neil President

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
who did the thing.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's not a dirty word anymore.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Language is changing.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Postage stamps are the new fuel.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Pennies are worth a dollar.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Bottle caps are hats.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Corn is

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
corn is a potato.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Hey man,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
you got these shoes?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
And by shoes, I mean sleeves?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
No, leave me alone.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Everything's different.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
It's 2019.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Hello.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Identity door recognized.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Opening.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Identity door closing.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
We're having recognized you.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
General Casey.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Yes.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Reporting for duty, sir.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I have bad news for you.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
We thought that we had mastered war.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
We haven't.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
It turns out we are under attack

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
by a pancake monster.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Slowly,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
it rises over the horizon.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
One,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
two,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
seven full pancakes

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
covered in butter.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
It opens its juicy

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
mind, leaks

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
glistening syrup.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It charges.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Yes.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Pancakes have evolved.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
They have cheeks and a maw.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Casey, are you okay?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I'm fine.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I guess if this could be a 70s movie,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
it could just end here.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Right?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
That's kind of a...

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Yeah.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
In the 80s, then they started to have

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
a whole third act after that.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Then you blow up the pancakes,

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
and no one cares, so it gives a shit.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Take your kids to it.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
In the 70s, you could just end there.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Gene Hackman would run out of frame.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Hey, you!

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
You'd hear a gunshot credits.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
It's a beautiful time to be alive.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
What was that one?

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Taking a one, two, three?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
That was a French connection.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
A French connection.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
No spoilers possible.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Because it's...

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
You make up your own ending.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
That's the 70s.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Like, Omega Man, Charlton Heston is just

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
hanging out with zombies.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
They're like, you're your zombie.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I don't know.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Good night.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
God, that ghost story is so long.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I could have sworn you told that before.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I don't know. I've told you before.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Yeah.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Okay.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Yeah, no politics.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
No more ghost stories.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
No more ghost stories.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Aliens? Race?

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
We've said a lot of things about race.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Should we try to break our record?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Because our record at Harmontown shows

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
is two black people. Do we have more than two tonight?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Oh, my God.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Wait, why is that white guy raising both his hands?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Wait, Casey?

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Casey's half a black person.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
He was already up here.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Two?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Okay, there's, yeah.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Four? Six? Holy shit.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Wow.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Let's get a moniker. All black people.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
All black people to the stage.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Omega Black Harmontown.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Omega Black Harmontown.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
It's the half dozen man march.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Yes!

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
I want all black people up on the stage.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
If possible.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Here we are.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
If you're a black person and you're in the audience right now,

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
you are selling out your race.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Yeah.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
All right.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
One, two, three, four, five,

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
six, seven and a half.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Seven and a half black people, everybody.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
All right.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Come forward. Come forward.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Should we have them do the Rihanna Chorus,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
the Dido Hook for the...

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Oh, fuck, hell yeah.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I'll spit some fire and then

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I'll just do that.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
You guys are joining too, but the visual,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
oh my god.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Hold up.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Harmontown's getting more and more sophisticated.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Where the hell, oh yeah.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Okay, so, do you want to teach him a lyric?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
We'll do one. Those of you that know it,

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
get in there and do it.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I can't remember it. I'm so drunk.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Turn it frown upside down.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
P is yellow.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
P is brown.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Yo.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Turn your frown upside down.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
P is yellow.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
P is brown.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Colors.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
What do they mean?

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Could you go from a scene to a scene?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
If your skin was pale white

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
or dark as night,

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
would you be allowed to do

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
a flying kite maneuver

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
over the city?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
I fucked your mama

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
because I loved your juicy titty.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I squeezed the toe of the milk come out

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
and the milk was white,

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
but did that give it more clout?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I don't know.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
What if her milk was black?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Wouldn't that give your white ass a heart attack?

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Would it be worth more or worth less?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
What if her mama's milk was purple?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Hermann Hesse.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Turn that frown upside down.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Race.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
P is yellow.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
P is brown.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Struggle in the city, in the streets.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Every manhole cover is another

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
piece of meat.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Pick it up like a piece of roast beef.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Flip it up in the air and do it like

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Keith for Sutherland.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
He was a famous

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
person that loved gene meat.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Sorry, sorry.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Starting over.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Fuck your mama.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Come on down to Harmontown.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Moonwalk.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Turn that frown upside down.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Race.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
P is yellow.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
P is brown.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Africa.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Hux to bulls.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Bill Cosby.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Everybody's going from Norman Lear,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
straight to me.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I'm the new representative of their voice.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Nobody black has another choice.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You're black, so it comes to me.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I'm like Spider-Man.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I'm the Peter Parker of the new generation.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I'm going to speak for the black

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
people of the station.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Here's the things that they like in the order

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
of this. They like carrots

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
and lettuce and kiss.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It goes like that.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Don't ask them.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You've got to come through me.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
What?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Rap battle.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Rap battle.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
When it doesn't mean I could rap.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I would rather be sitting down

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and having sex.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I feel as though Harmon...

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I totally pay for his showman.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I'd rather part with Harmon.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Turn to Harmontown.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Turn that frown upside down.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Race.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
P is yellow.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Poop is brown.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Skinagne down to Harmontown.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Complexion, melanin, molecules,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
People ridicule each other

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Motherfucker, I'm spitting

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I fucked your momma so hard, she said

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm titting, it's a new phrase

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It means your tits will explode

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I fucked your momma so hard

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I generated loads of semen

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
All across her chest

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I fucked your momma so hard

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
She told me I was the best

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Come on, let's go

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Turn that brown upside down

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Race

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Poop is brown

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Urban

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Differences

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Everyone is different

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
That's the lesson you should learn

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Everyone is different

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I'm being sarcastic

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Everyone's the same

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It's really really stupid that we come up with different names

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
There's a class system entrenched in our culture

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And the only people that profit off of it

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Are parasitic vultures

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
They sit at the top and they capitalize on us

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
They're a bunch of rich motherfuckers

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Fuck them, god damn it, fuck them

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Come on down

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Turn that brown upside

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Fuck them

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Poop is brown

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Ownership

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Come on down

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I'm sorry, I criminalized all of you by association

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I'm sorry, I disseminated a film, The Nation

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I'm declaring it once and for all

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I'm so fucking sick and tired

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Of all of these fucking assholes

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Suck my balls

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I hope I go home

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And my house is burnt to the ground

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Because I'm a horrible person

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And a criminal

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I got a little too drunk, I'm sorry

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Let's hear it for our nation's capitals

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Black people

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
They earned this

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
All Arapaho Indians

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
To the stage, please

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Nope, none left

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
We've got that up already

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
This show could have existed 300 years ago

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
We could have done something

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Let's do

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
We should do another movie with everybody up here right now

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Really?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Another way

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
We've got to play Dungeons & Dragons

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Stay up here

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Do you want all black people to play Dungeons & Dragons with us?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Yeah, let's do that

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
We're going to play Dungeons & Dragons with all black people tonight

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
There's a new character

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Right Spencer?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Right

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Alright

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I mean is that possible?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I don't know, ask Spencer, is it possible to have this many people spring on you for the D&D?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I mean they could exist in the game world

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Alright

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I don't have character

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Are you guys standing awkwardly up on stage in the background like that?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yeah

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You can't just ask a group of people to stand up here

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
They're just waiting to find out if they're involved

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
We could just miss them, I don't know

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It's an awkward situation

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
You know what, it's metaphorical

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Let's deal with it, head on

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
What are we supposed to do?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
This is my favorite form of affirmative action

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Like my whole life

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
This is the best

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I say, Jeff, here's what I say

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
We break a pool cue in half

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And we put it on the floor

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
No, sorry, that's not

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
That's the way we've been handling it

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Let's play Dungeons & Dragons

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
And have all black people

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
That want to be a part of it

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Represent all black people in the whole nation

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And they can play a character

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That will make up on the fly

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Spencer, we'll leave it to you

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
To include our seven and a half black people up here

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So did you say one character

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
For all of them?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Yeah

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
All black people have to play one character

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I mean look, we've done it

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
We've done it

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I mean look, we've done so much

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
We're bending over backwards here

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
What do we want us to do?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This wasn't my problem

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I inherited this

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I think I'm being pretty heroic

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
By providing them with one D&D character

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
He can be super strong

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
He won't be a kleptomaniac

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Or have a stutter

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
He'll be the dentist

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Or the next-door neighbor

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Let's start this stuff

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Erin McGathy to the stage please

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Erin McGathy

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Yes, yes

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Okay, here we go

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Spencer?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Phil

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Phil

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Alright

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
When we last met

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
This was funny

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Okay

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You guys busy?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Yeah, I'm all good you guys

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Alright

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
On the last episode

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Our heroes had defeated Dave

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
The airship pilot

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
And gained control of the ship

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
After tormenting some crew members

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The group had to find the engine room

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And enlisted the help of

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
A couple of imps

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Who were tasked with servicing the ship's engines

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
After finding some sovereign glue

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
The ship seemed prepared

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Sharpie decided that they should press onward

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
In an attempt to take the fight to Admiral Darkstar

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
It was just then that a calamitous impact

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Shook the entire ship

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Before casting everything into darkness

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Alright

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
You were all knocked unconscious

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You wake up in the hole of the black ship

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
What's left of it at any rate?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You can see that the hole

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Has been ripped into two halves

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Through the wreckage

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You can see dull red walls

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Slick with slime surrounding you

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You seem to be at the bottom of a pit

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
As above you stretches in black expanse

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Go

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Alright

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Didn't we meet some people that were going to walk us down the road?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Yeah, okay

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
So like that I didn't write

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Because I thought we'd just do it right now

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But do you want to just

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I look up and I look around

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And see if there's any people that will help us down the road

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Three white figure

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Three white clothed figures approaching

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
This isn't you, you guys are elsewhere

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
It seems like with a quick edit

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
You could make this very appropriate

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Do what?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Can't there be seven and a half black figures around there?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Seven and a half black figures

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Approach

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Why can't it just be a full

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Eighth black person?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
He said he was half black

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Okay, he's a halfling

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Seven black people and a black halfling

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Approach

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Alright, so right now you guys

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
That's you Casey

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Holy hell

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Casey's mutated

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Alright

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
So you guys have been living

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
In the belly of this great beast

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
For quite some time, you're quite used to it

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
But you just saw this ship

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Crash down to the floor

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It's quite a new occurrence for you guys

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I mean, stowaways and shipwrecks

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Occasionally happen, but it's quite rare

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
So that's your motivation as you're approaching this wreck

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So our ship crashed inside the mouth

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Of the Infinifish

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Correct, and I should mention Jeff

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Your crystal

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Your healing pendant shatters

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Into a billion piles of little crystals

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That's like in a video game

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Because we would have been able to use that

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
As this happens, you feel some of the crystals dissolving

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Healing you to full health

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
You see a small pile of crystals remaining

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I gather those crystals

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Alright, you gather them

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Where are my hit points at right now?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
They're at full now

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Can we get our character sheets?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Alright Spencer, I walk up to one of the

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
To this group of people

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And I find a person

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That seems to be the leader

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And she has a red and blue feather

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
A pink and blue feather in her ear

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And I assume she's the leader

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
So I come up and address her

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And say

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Can you please help us?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
If we could help you

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
We'd help ourselves

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
We're stuck here

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
How long have you been stuck here?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I don't know, we don't have any clocks

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Or calendars

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It's felt like years

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Okay, so a long time

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I noticed that she's wearing a handmade

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
This feels terrible vest

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
But I regard

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I think it's awesome

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That's all, sorry

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
We do get iTunes and podcasts here

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
That's like the only wifi

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
The wifi is great

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But it's totally convoluted now

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Well, so you guys

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
So

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You guys, if you knew how to get out of here

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
You would have gotten out of here

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Hell yeah

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I mean, we had tongue stew for a million years

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Like cutting off tongue of

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
The beast's mouth and making

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Soup isn't really enjoyable

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I'd rather, you know, some

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Thing else

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It's a fried chicken

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And watermelon

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Wow

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Pick something else to look at

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I roll versus blushing

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
You save

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Where did you

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Black figures, are they figures?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
They're people, they're figureheads

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Like you and I

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Where are you from?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Your mama

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Geez

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Spencer, where are they from?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Where are you guys from?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
From here

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
You were, okay

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
They mentioned that they were actually the third generation

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Of people born in this fish

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Oh my god, the metaphor's back

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I like it

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So you don't know any different

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
You've been born inside the belly

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Of this savage beast

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
This is your ordinary world

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And you have an instinctive sense

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That it's not a healthy place

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
But it's all you know

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I examine our surroundings to look for exits

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Or portals to cross

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
To what I'm going to call south

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
For, you know, sake of

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Directionality

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
You see what appears to be a large

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
That's a great reason to call it south

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
There's no, that's actually the only reason to call it south

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I gotta draw a map

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
You know, for my reference

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
And I can't, like, there's no south of a fish

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
But there's down on a paper

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Okay

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Anyway, you see a curtain

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It appears to be made out of some sort of fleshy meat-like substance

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
A meat curtain?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
A meat curtain

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
A wizard sleeve

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
A portable hole

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I thrust myself headlong

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
For the meat curtain

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I must warn you, strange traveler

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
No one who's gone to that curtain has come back

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We've lost many siblings

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
To the meat curtain

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Are you saying that once you go through

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
This particular meat curtain

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
You never go back?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Is that what I'm hearing?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Heatless of a warning, I thrust myself

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Through the fleshy folds of the

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Meat curtain

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
You see

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
What appears to be a snake-like appendage

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Whip out of the curtain

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
It's a dick inside a pussy

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Yeah

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
You got me

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
The tentacle whips at you

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But misses by a hair

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Come on in, guys, it's okay

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I approach the whipping

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Serpent

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
And I whip my hair around

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
And I attempt to calm it down

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Or maybe to just make it straighter

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
The curtain

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Opens

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Three more tendrils reveal themselves

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Slipping themselves out

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Busy lady

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
They also miss

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Are we armed?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
You guys are actually armed with

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Daggers and spears

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Sorry, you guys

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Spencer

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
It's not his fault

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Spears are going to be really useful

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
As you'll see later

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I can't do anything

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Alright

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Guys, you've been here for

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Three generations

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
If we don't go through this meat curtain

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Together, we've got no chance of getting out

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I say follow me with your spears

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And daggers

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I say we send one of the black people in first

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Is that cool?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
You already went in first

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Oh, that's right, I'm already in there

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Before they go in, I shoot

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
One arrow

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
At the

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
At the

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Sorry?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I shoot 14 arrows

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Or two

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
One of the arrows strikes the meat curtain

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It shudders violently

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Are we all through the curtain right now?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
No one's even tried to go through it

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Everybody

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Let's all charge

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Charge the meat curtain

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I peek cautiously through the meat curtain

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
You guys

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
You guys want to go through the thing?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
We should go

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
We should go

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I lead my army

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Of black people through the meat curtain

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Yes

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Failing to regard

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We thrust our daggers and

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Spears

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Through the meat curtain towards the tentacles

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Brandishing your weapons

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Dangerously

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
You charge through the curtain

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
The tentacles whip back and forth

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
But you manage to subdue them and make it through

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Black adventure

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Adventure

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Sorry guys

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Mixed reaction

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So we're beyond the tentacles now?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
You are beyond the tentacles

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
What do we see?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
A brown tunnel

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
It seems to get smaller and smaller

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I've tried to summon squirrels

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But there's no squirrels inside the

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Infinifish

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Black friends

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Is there a way to take the spears

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And to prop them up

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
So as to keep the blue

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Tunnel wide

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Sorry

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I need to stop listening to people yelling

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
The spears

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Can you take your spears and stick them up

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
So the tunnel can't close

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Well we have

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
We have heard strange legend of

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
An exit which if stimulated

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Properly expands

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Excellent

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Exit this beast but none have ventured

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
This far previously

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh my god

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I'm having way too much fun

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
There's a legend

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Of a thing that expands

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
When you stimulate it

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Yeah

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Well that sounds

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
What is your secret

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Woman to stimulate

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
The tunnel

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
To make it expand

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
My

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
African-American elder

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
As African-American elders

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Tend to be very wise

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Once told me

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Of a sacred dance that can only

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Be performed when you have a

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Seven and a half

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Seven and a half African

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Dark-skinned beings

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And three pale-skinned people

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Can only create this dance

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
To arouse the

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Exit

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You're saying we all have to dance together

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
To coax the opening

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
To widen for us to pass through

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Cease and yore

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Wait wait, cease and yore

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
The three of us

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Have only

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Danced in the shape of square

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Can you show us how to dance

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Sometimes in a line

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000
When things get hotter than a hoochie-coochie

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
If vows have

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
A beat to drop, we may proceed

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I'm getting very uncomfortable

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
No, we're black, so it's okay

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
That's what's making me

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I do not want to see the TMZ headline

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I feel comfortable

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I'll leave the charge

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
This will actually be embarrassing

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Open up, open up

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Giant lake, open up

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Open up

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Gonna take my trunk, it's not imaginary

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I'm gonna fuck your mama like an aviary

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Bird to bird, feather to feather

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Gonna fuck your mom like my name was Carl

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Weather's gonna fuck her dick

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Fuck her butt, I'm gonna fuck her salted

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Ass peanuts, I'm gonna fuck her cashew

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Fuck her almond, gonna fuck her name

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Like my name was Phillip Drummond

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Fuck her like a different stroke

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I'm gonna fuck your mama like my dick was a joke

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
You gotta set up all my nuts

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Gotta punch on all my tips

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Fuck your mama, that's how I'm hit

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
That's like an open sesame

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
The rhythmic pounding of feet and limbs

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
And the flailing of your bodies

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Seems to do nothing at first

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
But then you feel the expanding

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And contracting muscular action

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Jesus

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
The esophageal tube

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Opens and widens

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Revealing a larger antichamber

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
So we're going down the throat

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Into the belly of this

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Infinifish

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You're going down an esophageal tube

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It may or may not be a throat

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It opens into a large chamber

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Dungeon snap

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Dungeon snap

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
You can see several wooden

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Constructions built together

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
They seem to have been made out of parts of old

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Ships or perhaps other crates

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And boxes

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But they hold together quite nicely

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
There seems to be about 16 or 17

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Of the dwellings

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
This is where you guys have

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Have lived

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Your parents, you know, they came

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I said third generation

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So your parents came

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
On ships and they built these into

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Village so that's where you guys live

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Wait, so they

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
They've lived here?

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Yeah

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Have they been here before?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
They've lived here for three generations

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
But they usually take a different path

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
A less dangerous way

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
So we just took a hard way to get here

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
That's just like the corner drug store

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Wait, they could have told us how to get home

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Is that

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Is that your doorbell? We all do a dance

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And that's how you get home? You guys saw the meet

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
We incorporate new people into our culture

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
That's too embarrassing

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
That makes sense

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
They don't have TV, just wifi

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So now we're

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
At the home of these people

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
This is your guys home

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
You love it

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Once you feng shui the organs

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
No, that's someone else's joke

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Sorry guys

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It's beautiful here

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It's great here guys

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I've never seen such a nice place inside

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
In a soffigial tube before

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I love what you've done

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
With the throat

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
We try

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
We get more of the steward living on the wifi

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So we try to make cozy

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
You really started from a place of nothing

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And built from the scraps

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Of a, you know, and created

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Something that's

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Equally appealing in a testament to the

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Environment that is this

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Infinifish

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
You could even say we found love in a hopeless place

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It seems like

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
You did not land on this infinifish

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It seems like this infinifish landed on you

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
But I respect what you've done

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I think we can learn from it

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Like I

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
I pull mole rain aside

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Over to the wall of the

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Soffigial tube and I say

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Mole rain

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I don't know if you're watching this

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
There's a spark of connection between this

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Leader and Sharpie

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Whom you've been in love with

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You better, I warn you

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Be careful, I know about these

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Soffigial people

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yes

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Quirk, I saw it too

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
But I can't move like she can move

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I can shoot arrows

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And I can wave my hair

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And I can giggle

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
But you know

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I'm going to concede

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Don't tell him that I

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Your talent for passive aggression

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
seduces me

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That was some passive aggression

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
You couldn't hear me

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I heard the sound of someone needing more

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Than

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You know

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Are we going to talk about our actual relationship

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
In the middle of D&D

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I was just expressing that I was sad

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
It wasn't being passive aggression

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
It was similar to the van thing last night

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I take our new hosts out

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
To lunch at their local

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Ossophagus shack

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
While these two have sorted out the relationship

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
From the tour bus today

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
We're at the village

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Of these people

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Who have a weird habit

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Of making people go through a tentacle

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Ossophagus in order to get

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Where they already lived

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I mean

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
We can't do much more than that

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
We've done this for like a half hour

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
We should probably cut it off there

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
It's fine, avoid our issues

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
It's fine

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Let's hear it for America's black people

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
The Capital Steps

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I'm going to give them a name Jeff

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
The Capital Steps

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
What's everyone's name real quick

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
We got Casey

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
For the sake of credits

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Casey

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Lataya

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Nice to meet you

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Tori

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Nice to meet you

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Welcome again

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Vanessa

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Alia

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Phillip

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Andrew

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Thank you so much for coming up

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Wow

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Our salvation

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
There's nothing left

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
We have nothing left

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
We have nothing left

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
When we were

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Near Boston in Somerville

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I had a camper

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Come up to stage because I was a camp counselor

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I have another camper here

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Show off

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Just saying

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
You want to bring her up?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Let's get her up

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Alex Fox

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Sounds white

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
But fine

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Change of pace

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
You were asking for something

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Now you're being passive

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Alex Fox

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
You wanted to hear about it

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Alex Fox

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
When we were in Somerville, Massachusetts

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
We had another one of Erin's campers

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Come up and we talked about feminine wetness

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And then her mother came on stage

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And she got bananas

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
It got weird

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Did Erin dispense any

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Uncomfortable wisdom to you while you were at the camp?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I mean, Erin was just really my

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Sexual education

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Up until I was about

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
What, 14, 15

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I went to a really strict school

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Private Catholic school

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So I didn't know what sex was

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And Erin really was

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Really eager to talk about it

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
With just our 14-year-old selves

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
That's not why I brought her up

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Did she ever make you pass through her

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Flesh curtains?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
No, but she did show me

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
My first penis

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
No, I'm just kidding

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
You don't have a penis

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I'm just kidding

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Totally fine

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
You're normal

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Would I have to be okay if I had a penis?

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
No, totally fine

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
That would be even more educating

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Women having penises

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Is the new black

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
What we did tonight was kind of antiquated

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
We're not really breaking down any barriers

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
This is DC

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
We should have had transgender people up here

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Black people

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yawn

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
What is this? Gilligan's Island?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Issue solved

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Well, I

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Alex

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You were counseled by Erin

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
When you were younger

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Now we're all grown up

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
But Dan and Erin were about to talk about

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
A little spat they had today

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Which I know nothing about

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Maybe you could counsel them right now through this

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
You could kind of mediate

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Through this crisis

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I'd like to hear about it

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Alex, why don't you take the mic

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And walk them through it

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Hey, Alex Fox, so

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
For the show, I was talking to some fans

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
This is Dan's side of the story

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I was talking to

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Two fans about

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Glass Blowing

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Very interesting

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Providence last night

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I'm starting to be

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It's all the same

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Only the names are changed

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I was in Rhode Island

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Talking to you guys about Glass Blowing

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Signing on autographs

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Forgoing the opportunity

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
To write a TV show

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Having decided this is where I need to be

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Being a hero

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Of course

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
My girlfriend comes up to me

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And she says

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Hey, the van's leaving

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I don't know

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
If you wanted to go

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Or if you don't want to go

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
But the van's leaving

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Dan's side of the story

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
The van is the only mode of transportation

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I'll stay

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Is everyone leaving?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
There's two fans

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I'm not sure

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
What follows is a 25-minute conversation

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
About when the van's leaving

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
When the van's aren't leaving

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But I know the whole time

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Because I'm 40

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I know the whole time

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
That what she's saying

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Without saying it

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Is she wants to leave

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
She wants me to want to leave

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
She wants you to want to leave

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
She's saying everything else

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And I'm agreeing with it

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Because I don't give a shit

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And I'm going like

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Take what you're saying at Face Valley

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
If you want to get on the first van

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
25 minutes goes by

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
By my drunk estimation

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
At one point she walks away

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And goes like

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Goodbye, I'll see you back at the hotel

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Then she comes back

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Because there is no van

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And there is nothing

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And she goes like

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
There's another van

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And schedule van

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And I go again

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I don't care

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
She walks away

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And you love glass blowing

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I did that night

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I never heard anything about it

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
My first question was

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Do you take a bunch of sand and heat it up?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Does it turn into glass?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
The answer is no

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Dan, my van is leaving in a couple seconds

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I already know everything

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
About this

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
This is my one chance

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I'm talking to some dudes about blowing glass

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So then

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
So then what happened

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
The thing that really causes the fight

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Pops the champagne cork

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
On the beautiful frothy

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Anger bottle that is our relationship

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Is

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
The tour manager

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
The guy whose job it is

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
To tell you when

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
A van is coming and when it isn't

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Comes up to me and says

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Hey Dan, so there's a van leaving now

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And there's a van leaving in 15 minutes

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Which one do you want to be on?

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
And I go, I'll take the one in 15 minutes

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And he proceeds to go around the bar and tell everybody

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And when I see him telling it to Erin

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I was drunk and I was an asshole

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
And I was going

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
I was jiggling my ear

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And she's looking at me going

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
And she came over to me and I said

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I'm just saying, do you hear how that works?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Do you hear how easy that is?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
That's rude.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Yeah, well, fuck you guys.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I lost

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
38 minutes of glass

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Blowing talk

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And she asked for a little bit of dignity for 30 seconds

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I'll try to make my version a little

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Shorter.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I thought it wasn't a diss, but I think that is

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Yeah.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
You can afford to, Time Stealer

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
The 38 minutes you're talking about is 5 minutes

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm sure you're Justin Timberlake

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Arm readout has fucking 100

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Of my minutes on it

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
From just

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Because I spent all that time talking about vans

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Instead of fucking glass

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I would have been up here tonight

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Teaching motherfuckers how to blow a bottle

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Out of dirt

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But there's crucial

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Should I miss, all I know is that

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
We're fighting

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Alex, jump in, mediate for fuck's sake

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I want to hear her side of the story

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
There you go

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
First of all, those guys talking to Dan

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
About blowing glass, super cool

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Learned a lot from them

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I was also listening to them about glass

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
And the lightning striking the sand

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And that making these big branches

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Of glass and things, that was cool

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I also had a great time at the bar

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
I was tired

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Neil Berkeley, who's directing the documentary

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Was like, you know, we're gonna get in the van

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And go, sometimes transportation has been

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Tough and people have been left behind

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
So I was like, oh, well

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I'm gonna let Dan know that I'm gonna go

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Maybe he'll want to go too

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I love him, love him dearly

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Went up to him and was like, hey, there's gonna be

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
A van going in a little bit if you want to get on that van

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And he responded to me in a way

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
That made me think that he was like

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Oh, okay, I'll get on the van

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
If you want me to get on the van, like I had said

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Hey, we're getting on a van

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So if you want to be cool

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Get on the van, and he responded to me

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And I was like, I had said it that way

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So I was like, that didn't feel good

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And I walked away

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And because I can't walk away from things

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I was like, no, that was rude

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And I walked back and I tried to explain it to him

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And he was very snippy with me

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
And then I walked back

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And was talking to more people

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And that was when the tour manager went over

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
And told him about the 15th thing

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I didn't know it, but then afterwards

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
He did this, and then he yelled at me

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
And then I went back to the hotel room

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
And I was crying in the bathroom

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And he came in and he was like

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You're taking a shit!

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I don't know, I can't see tears

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
All I see is a closed bathroom door

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I start with a logic

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I walked out, my face

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Is red

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
And

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I said

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Because I was sitting there crying

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
And I was like, you know, I feel like I'm constantly

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
That whole fight happened

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Because I was worried he was going to get left behind

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Because call back to the

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Mom issues from earlier

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Sometimes I'm Dan's mom a little bit

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I get his food together

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I take care of him as best I can

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
What?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
That's normal

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Good job, Casey

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Alex

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
No, I met the guy from earlier

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I just saw that guy earlier, he was fucking great

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But he checked his eyes

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And his sleeves

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Sorry, Alex, go ahead

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
So yeah, it escalated

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It escalated from there

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And Dan

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Dan tore me a real good one

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And I was crying for a long time

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
He left the hotel room

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
He ran into Bobcat Goldthwaite

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Goldthwaite

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Sorry

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Bob Goldthwaite was in the room across the hall

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And so he leaves, he talks to him

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
And then he comes back and he's calmed down

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And he said, I'm sorry

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
He said a lot of mean things to me

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Including the C-word

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Which one?

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Which C-word?

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Cutie

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
It's not so bad

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And then this morning I was still bummed out about it

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
Even though he said I'm sorry

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But he said a lot of really

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Really cruel things to me

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
And made me feel pretty worthless

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Okay, Alex, you have a chance to

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Go ahead and mediate

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Here's my thing, if you apologize to her

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Then you're admitting that you did something wrong

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Or at least realizing that you hurt her feelings

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
In some capacity

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
So then, I mean

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I think it was mostly a miscommunication

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Between the two of you

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
You thought she was harassing you to get on this van

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
When in reality she was just concerned about

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Not leaving you behind

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I should say the crux of this argument

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
He thought I was lying

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
He thought that I was bullshitting him

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And I was not

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
The only thing to lie about

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And I don't think Erin would do that personally

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
However, just from an unbiased

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
No, I haven't, you're right

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
So I don't know, so I'm just saying

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
From an unbiased perspective, however

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Clearly her heart was in the right place

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
If she's saying that she thinks

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
She was going to leave you behind

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And you admitted that you were wrong about something

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Okay, so by applause

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Should they break up or stay together?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Stay together

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
That's my vote

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Thank you, Alex, that was very wise

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
That was lovely

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
We're staying together no matter what

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
We're staying together no matter what

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
That's the problem

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'm never going to leave her

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And if she leaves me, I'll kill myself

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Sounds healthy

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
There begin the problems

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
When you realize that you can't be without someone

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Then you go like

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Alright, what the fuck are you doing?

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Why are you, yeah

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
So maybe if that's true

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Instead of thinking that I'm someone who could never go away

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Think of me as someone who

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
You want to take care of and be nice to

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Because I'm never going to go away

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
You don't want this perfect

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Flower that you have to wilt

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
You want to nourish this flower

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Now, let's first of all

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Think Alex we're coming up and dispensing

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But I think it's very sound

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Sound counseling

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Thank you

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Let's see if we can sum this up

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Maybe we can heal these wounds

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Via our new anthem

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Let's try this one out

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
It's been a good night in Arlington

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Let's learn some things

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Oh yeah

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I told a pretty long story

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Everybody does something wrong

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But I'm gonna heal you

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
With a tender song

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I'm so sorry

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
To Aaron

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And Jeff

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
And Spencer

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
And all the black people

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I didn't mean to do you bad

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I just want to make you happy

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Not sad, I just want to go from

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Town to town and say

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Harmontown

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Where P is yellow and Poop is brown

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Harmontown

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Everybody's singing Harmontown

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Where P is yellow and Poop is brown

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I like the bread and the butter

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And the honey and the nutrients

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Grow on every tree

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
And the leaves go to the sky

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
And drip down on me

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And every piece of sustenance

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Makes me feel young and free again

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And I feel like I'm twenty again

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
That I swear I saw her

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
In a prison yard

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And I'm sorry that she got fucked

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
With my fleshy shard of love

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Fleshy shard of love

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I don't think the glove fits

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The hand in the

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Quitting process

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I'm sorry, I got thrown off the rail

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I'm sorry, I'm gonna start over again

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I got thrown off in Harmontown

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I'm really sorry

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
In Harmontown

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
But when your mama sucks dick

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Makes me feel like

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Caged neck

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
That's a guy that played

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
The guy in Snack Eyes

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
His name was

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Nicholas Cage and I fucked your mama

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
On this stage

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And I fucked your mama at home

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
On Ellen Page's back

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
And I fucked your mama while your daddy

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Smoked some crack

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And just watched cause your family sucks

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That's fucked up

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I fucked your mama

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
At the Arlington Draft

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Now it's in Virginia County

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I fucked your mama real hard

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Crane shot

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Gonna fuck your mama sweet and hard

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000

I fucked your mama so hard

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
She looked like Winnie the Pooh

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
She bled

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I fucked your mama on the top of a sled

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Fucked her downhill

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And then I decided to fuck her instead

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Uphill

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Into the top of a

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Hat

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I fucked your mama like that

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Inside a chilling bed

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And I took her to the bottom

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And then I put her lips and spat

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
On her face because your mama is fat

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
And fuck your mama, fuck your mama

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
In Harmontown

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Fuck Obama, fuck Obama

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
In Harmontown

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Fuck the legislators, fuck the senators

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
In Harmontown

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
You're not invited if you ever made a law

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
In this place, I fucked your mama

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Thank you so much for coming to Harmontown today everybody

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I fucked your mama

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Out of your draft house

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Shit, shit is stage dive

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Here it goes

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Let's hear it one more time

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Shit is stage dive

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Spread to a curtain blend

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Whoa

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Our black is half a teal chorus

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Shit is stage dive in the world

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
That's it

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Shit is stage dive in the world

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Shit is stage dive in the world

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Wait, it's happening

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Actually, it's not that bad

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Whoa

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Okay, they're tired, they're tired

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Okay, that's alright

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I fucked your mama

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
In Harmontown

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Alright, I'll be here for the rest of the night

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Alright, goodnight

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Thank you all

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Dan, are you okay?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Yeah, I'm alright

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Dan, cross the return threshold

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And make it back to the stage

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
If you bought anything, I'll sign it

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
That's the Harming guarantee

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
If you're black, I'll sign it twice

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
If you're half black, I'll sign it three times

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
That's the weird thing

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I don't know what message you're supposed to get from that

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I don't know

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Fuck your mama tonight

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I fucked your mama through the curtain the night

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Fucked your mama like a werewolf in a vampire ride

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Fucked your mama like a unicorn

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
And fucked you with the horn on her head

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I fucked your mama then I fucked your uncle's daddy instead

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I fucked your family and I fucked your god

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I fucked your mama till she had no body

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
She had no right to exist

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
You're a wimp

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I fucked your mama till she had no body

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
She had no right to exist

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
She had no right to exist

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And I said

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I wanna piss on your face

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
But

I wanna fuck you like my name was kicked

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I'd build a pyramid with

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Unpaid labor to me

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Honor me, I'm a god

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:49.000
This is Harmontown

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I'm Philip Seymour Hoffman

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
