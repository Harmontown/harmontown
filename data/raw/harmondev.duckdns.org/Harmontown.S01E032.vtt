historical...\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nWhat a legacy.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nWhat a career.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nVirginia was the 17th state to leave the union\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:32.000\nand the 14th state to join the union,\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:39.000\nthereby creating a time paradox in which it fought itself in 1920,\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:45.000\nwhich resulted in the development of copper wire and the telephone\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:50.000\nand the typewriter and marshmallow cream and license plates.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:53.000\nAnd the movie Jaws was shot

19:39.000\nAnd that's where he got the idea for the flux capacitor.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:44.000\nVirginia was originally non-Virginia.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:51.000\nBut it felt the name was too braggy.\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nSo it changed it to Virginia.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nDan, who do you like better?\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nVirginia, West Virginia, or East Virginia?\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:03.000\nI think all my favorites is Mega Virginia.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:07.000\nThe secret Virginia developed by NASA scientists\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:13.000\nthat is in geosynchronous orbit with the other five Virginias.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:18.000\nAnd yeah, watch us down on all of you.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nHow many of you here tonight are from Virginia?\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nA question for you guys.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nWhat is Virginia?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nIs it a county? A state?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nA Commonwealth.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nDon't get snippy.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nI've been everywhere.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nI'm like an astronaut now.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.000\nI'm walking in here with a swagger.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nI don't even know where I am.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nNo, we're 10 minutes from the White House.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nLet's scream something at them, Jeff.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nWe're tired of your bullshit!\n\n20:52.000 --> 21:00.000\nWhy is it gotta be white?\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.000\nWhy do I have to take my shoes off every time I go through the airport?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nStupid.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nHow many 9-11s have you stopped?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nWith shoes.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nWith shoe absence.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nFor all we know, 100s.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nFor all we know, none.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nAnd we do know.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nThey stop when they go,\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nHe had a thing in his shoe!\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nHe had a thing in his shoe!\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:26.000\nThey get excited about it.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nBut if somebody else blew up some heavy shit,\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nthey wouldn't call that a 9-11.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nThey'd probably call it whatever date that happened on.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nThey'd call it a 4-14 or something like that.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:37.000\nThey'd call it either 9-12 or 10-11.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nWouldn't they?\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nWhat if it happened in the spring?\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nI don't know.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nOh, September.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nI just got that.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nI just got that.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:59.000\nI thought it was like 9-11.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nYou know, every day since I was like,\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:05.000\nin middle school,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:08.000\nyou've loved me.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nCome to me.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nNo, I look at the clock.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nEvery single day I was very young,\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:17.000\nand I see 9-11 on a clock once or twice a day.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nIt's constant.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nI can wake up out of sleep and pick up my phone,\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nlook at it, 9-11.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nI see it all the time.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nI do.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nI saw it today.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nI saw it today once.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nThat's a phenomenon I read about on the Internet.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:31.000\nIt's your brain attributes significance to 9-11,\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:32.000\nand your brain works backwards.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nI was in middle school way before 9-11.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nAnd you remember seeing 9-11 a lot\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nbefore 9-11 happened?\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nYeah.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:40.000\nNo.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nBecause back then it was 9-11.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nIt was the emergency call number.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:46.000\nAnd I would always see 9-11.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nIt got to the point where it used to scare me,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nbut then I would see 9-11.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nIf I would get into a friend's car and I'd pop in,\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nand I would look at their digital clock,\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nand it would go 9-11,\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nand I would see it,\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nand it was like seeing the face of a friend.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nSo now when I see it, I go like,\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nhey, buddy.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nAnd then when 9-11 happened,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nthat all changed,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nbecause now it's a whole different thing.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nWell, moving on with our facts about Arlington.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nHighest probability of anyone in the audience\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:11.000\nhaving lost a loved one during 9-11?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.000\nYeah.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nAnd we're doing bits about it.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nYo, sensitive stuff.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nMarshmallow fluff.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:24.000\nInvented in Summerville.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:27.000\nBut here's where you invented 9-11.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nIt's a little less appetizing.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.000\nAcclaimed to fame, but...\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:37.000\nYou did it. Congratulations.\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nWhat did Wisconsin do?\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nShoes.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nI think we invented shoes.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nCheese.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nOkay.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nThey invented Dan Harmon there,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nas this gentleman says.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:48.000\nAll right, come on.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:49.000\nLet's move on and let's meet some people.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nLet's stir some shit up.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:59.000\nDo we have a representative of Arlington, Virginia out there?\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nAnybody who feels that they have something to do with that?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nDo we have anybody that believes in ghosts?\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nIsn't this a big ghost state?\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:11.000\nHas anybody ever had an encounter with a ghost?\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nA real one.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nHoly shit, nobody...\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nI think we just proved ghosts.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nOkay, get up here.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:21.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nAdam's coming up.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:27.000\nWe'll be with you in a second, probably, too.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nI thought maybe...\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nBecause we're on the East Coast.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nThere's more ghosts on the East Coast.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nIt used to be called...\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nNo, it's true.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nIt used to be called the East Ghost.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nThat's how it got its name.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.000\nAdam, tell us your ghost story.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nI was like...\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nI guess I was eight or nine years old,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:52.000\nand I was in my parents' bedroom early on,\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\non a Sunday morning.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nThat was no ghost, Adam.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nThat's called an erection.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nIt was haunting, but natural.\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nBut I looked across the room,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:08.000\nand all of a sudden I saw this dark shadow figure,\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nand I think his head popped off,\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nand it was bouncing back and forth against the walls.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nOh my god, I just had a realization.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nOh my god, what a breakthrough.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nNo, wait, I'm sorry.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nYou saw a dark figure.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nYou were in your parents' bedroom.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nWere they there, too?\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.000\nYeah, we were all in the bed together,\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nbecause that's not weird.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:32.000\nHow old were you, eight, nine?\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nI was like eight or nine.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nI slept with my mom a lot during my parents' separation.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nDid you see a dark figure into the room?\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nMy parents separated,\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:47.000\nand my mom moved to South Milwaukee.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:50.000\nWe never pronounced the H there.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:54.000\nShe was living above her mom's place, my grandma,\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:59.000\nand every night I would hear her calling on the phone to my dad\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nand going, I said, I don't know what's going on.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nAnd it was emotionally put me in a bubble.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:08.000\nBut I remember sleeping in my mom's bed,\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:11.000\nbecause I could have sworn my mom wanted me to.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nI could have sworn it was not my choice.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:16.000\nI bet I was all fucked up, too.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:20.000\nBut this is the most distinct emotional memory I have.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nMy dad came over to visit my mom.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nThey were separated.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:29.000\nAnd my dad came over and was like,\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nah, I guess we're going to go to the zoo.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nTiki, that was my nickname.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nWait, sorry, what?\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:38.000\nLet's get back to that later.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:40.000\nMy nickname was Tiki.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nAnd then my mom said,\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\ncan I talk to you alone for a second?\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nTo my dad.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nSo that meant I had to leave.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nSo I left the room, but I listened at the door,\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nbecause it was like, what the fuck?\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nI guess they're going to talk about me, obviously.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nThey're not going to talk about the stock market.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\nAnd my mom really threw me under the bus.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:05.000\nI listened at the door, and I heard my mom go,\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:09.000\nthis is really fucking up your son.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:13.000\nHe sleeps in bed with me every night.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:16.000\nIt's traumatizing him.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:19.000\nAnd I remember thinking, you bitch.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:25.000\nYou hit on me.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:28.000\nYou wanted it.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nI feel that way about my mom sometimes, Dan.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nFor real?\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:38.000\nYeah, she's constantly very, really, really affectionate,\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.000\nbut almost to a point that it feels almost sexualized.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nOr fake.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nOr fake, targeted.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nNo, not fake.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nDo you have siblings?\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nI have one older brother, but we have different moms.\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:54.000\nThey say there's a thing, referred to as silent seduction,\n\n27:54.000 --> 28:01.000\nwhere a mother will pick one of two or more male offspring,\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:04.000\nand that one receives all of the love, all of the affection.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nBecause she wants to change.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nAll the craziness, all the anger.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nThat's absolutely true.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nYeah, so I think I had that one, too.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:17.000\nYou're involved in an unwitting, emotional kind of relationship,\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nlike a dating relationship with this woman.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nYeah, it skips me out sometimes.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nYeah?\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nThat's why I don't live near her.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:29.000\nDid you get to an age when, I remember being like 12 or 13,\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nand my mom coming up behind me and kind of like,\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:35.000\ngiving me like a shoulder rub and kind of,\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nand then me going like, knock it off.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nI think that's just a puberty thing, right?\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:42.000\nShe was going through puberty?\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nNo, I was.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nI think the reason I remember it is because I was like,\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nI decided, okay, no more affection.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nLike, I don't, you know, I'm a man now.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.000\nI don't want my mom touching me.\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nOr did she see you going through puberty and goes,\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI'm going to get this power up?\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nA man!\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nYeah, I don't know, man.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:01.000\nGod damn it, we need more open books on this stuff.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nYou hear me, White House?\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nWhere's your committee on this shit?\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:08.000\nStop making us take our shoes off at the airport.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:11.000\nAnd start figuring out our mom's brains.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nWhy do they want to fuck us so bad?\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nSo, Adam, you feel like you were the lightning rod\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nfor all of your mothers, like, attention in that way?\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:20.000\nOh, and when it comes to the craziness, definitely.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:23.000\nLike, my parents got divorced, like, four years ago,\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:26.000\nwhich, you know, I was surprised by, like,\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:29.000\nit usually doesn't happen that much later in a person's life.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nLike, I was 21 when it happened,\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nand basically, whenever I had to go home.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nAnd they come to you, you're in a bar in your deck,\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nand they're like, it's not your fault.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nIt's important for you to know.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nMy dad doesn't even talk about that sort of stuff,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nor anything real, for that matter.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nI remember my dad trying to talk to me\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:49.000\nabout our parents' separation and me getting so embarrassed.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nI was reading, like, a Spider-Man comic\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\non the front scene of our stage,\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\nand my dad finally started to broach the subject,\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nlike, way too late, way too late.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nLike, everything was, the luggage was moved,\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\neverything was topsy-turvy, and, like,\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nI was reading a Spider-Man comic,\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nwhich was to shut down and become autistic.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nAnd I remember my, you know,\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.000\nor commit to an already prevalent autism.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nAnd my dad was, like, driving, and he just,\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nI don't know, I was like,\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:19.000\nyou know, your mother and I are going through some changes.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nAnd I was like, just, I was like,\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:24.000\nfocus on the Spider-Man!\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nYou know, it's important for you to know\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nit's not your fault.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nIt's just stumbling through this thing,\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:34.000\nlike, no, finish it up, play them off!\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nAnd then, like, they're being in this pause,\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:39.000\nand they go, you know, it's just important for you to know that\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nif you'd stop reading your fucking comic book,\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:44.000\nI got really mad, and I was like, I know!\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:46.000\nGod, Jesus!\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:48.000\nLike, I remember that moment, too.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:51.000\nLike, my dad, like, reaching out to me,\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nit was just painful.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nI said, let's connect here, let's look inside the eye.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nYeah, but it was too late and too artificial, too focused.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nAnd how old were you at that point?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\n9-11.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nOr 9-11.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:12.000\nSpencer, just disaffected emotional parent monster encounter.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nHold up, hold up.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:18.000\nTrying to get her attention,\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nyour mother looks over with a lazy, glazed-over look.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:24.000\nShe seems exhausted as if the weight of the world\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:27.000\nrest on her shoulders.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nDo you think that this might not be the best time to ask for ice cream?\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:36.000\nI'm going to fucking die.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:40.000\nAlright, so Adam, you're ghost, the ghost.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:42.000\nA dark figure comes in, the head's popping about,\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nand then moving about, right?\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nYeah, it's just sort of popping about and making this sort of hissing sound.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:50.000\nAll I can really remember is, like, I couldn't breathe at all.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nThat's a thing.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nI couldn't breathe, I couldn't move.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:57.000\nSorry, I'm stammering.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nI remember being in my bed,\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:04.000\nthere's a chemical in your brain that paralyzes you when you're asleep, right?\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:08.000\nSo that you don't, if you have a dream that you're like a fucking hot dog,\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nthat you don't get up and fuck a hot dog.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:14.000\nWhich won't be a hot dog, it'll be the ironing board,\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nand you'll hurt your family.\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:23.000\nWhen you go into deep sleep, they're supposed to be like,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nyour body can't move, and so your brain goes into this state where,\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nno matter how much flailing around you're doing in your sleep,\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nyou're not actually moving.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nBut then there's this weird thing that happens.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nWe've all had this experience, probably everyone in this room,\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:39.000\nwhere you wake up and you're fully awake,\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.000\nbut that chemical has still paralyzed your body,\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:44.000\nand you can't move.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:47.000\nYou're awake and you can't move.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:50.000\nAnd sometimes you can't breathe, that doesn't happen to you?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nI've never had that.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nThat's sleep paralysis, yeah, that happens.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nThat's right, for me, they say like,\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nyour dreams, like when you're trying to run,\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nor just even jog up a hill,\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nyour legs are sluggish and you can't move,\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:06.000\nthat your brain, knowing that the chemicals your brain administers\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nwhile you sleep, to make you really just fall asleep,\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:13.000\nand your eyelids shut, and everything work, and shut down,\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:16.000\nand your brain knows that, so you're kind of paralyzed during your dreams.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:18.000\nI've never had that in my waking state.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:20.000\nSo when people are, yeah,\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:22.000\nall this shit that happens to you in your sleep,\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:25.000\nit's all just various combinations of different sleep disorders.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nLike sometimes that paralysis chemical is not working right,\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nwhich is sleep walking.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nBut Adam, were you awake?\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:34.000\nYeah, like I had been awake for a few minutes when it happened,\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:37.000\nand all I remember is I was hearing, you know,\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:40.000\nthe hissing sound and the head popping back and forth,\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:43.000\nand I kept wanting to say something, like wake my parents up,\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nand tell them what was happening, and I couldn't,\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nand then like the next thing I knew, it just disappeared.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:51.000\nYeah, but then after it disappeared, did you then go,\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nAh!\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:56.000\nEven though it was too late, that's what I did.\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:59.000\nI remember like waking up, I remember being wide awake in my bed\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nwhen I was like 17,\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:06.000\nand I remember the full on perfectly vivid image\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.000\nof an absolute like corporeal woman.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nLike a witch in a black robe,\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nstarting from the corner of my bedroom behind my bedroom door,\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:18.000\ntaking full strides over to my bed,\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:22.000\nand like covering, like getting in my face,\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:26.000\nlike a real person, and I was wide awake,\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:29.000\nand I just couldn't move while she was doing it,\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:32.000\nand then it kind of like disappeared in a cloud,\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:35.000\nbut I was wide awake and in cold sweats,\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:38.000\nand then as soon as I regained my faculties,\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nI went, Mom!\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nI was 17, it was so embarrassing.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nThey say, they say,\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.000\nAnd she rolled over and goes, What is it?\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nReal nice, Jeff.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nAnd I say, Steph, give me shoulder rubs,\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nand get to the real deal.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nIs there anybody in our audience,\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:02.000\nand don't be embarrassed,\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nyou're not going to get bullied like for real,\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.000\nlike buy up, I guess buy applause only because we can't see you.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nIs there anybody

there anybody in the audience\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:22.000\nthat believes in alien abduction, like mythology,\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:25.000\nlike the idea that there are aliens?\n\n35:25.000 -->

Any gals here believe in it?\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:32.000\nWell, there was applause.\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nAnybody want to come up and talk about it?\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:37.000\nIs there anybody willing to come up and talk about it a little bit?\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nYou believe in it, right?\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:42.000\nAlright, he's not a lady, but he believes in it.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nLet's welcome whoever you are.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:45.000\nWhat's your name, sir?

She never called.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:04.000\nAnd so we got another number, and so we checked in this new place,\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:06.000\nand we were the third residents to ever live there,\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nbut the apartment was built in the 50s.\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:11.000\nThe first resident, a LAPD homicide detective,\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:14.000\nand then an old married couple, and the husband died.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:17.000\nNot in that apartment, I don't know, a hospital, rather,\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:20.000\nand the wife moved to a one-bedroom in the building.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:24.000\nSo then it's a great place, and every time the two of us\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:26.000\nwere out of the house, out of the apartment,\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nsomething crazy happened. We bought a brand new clock.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.000\nEvery time we left, we'd come back.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nThe clock would be stopped at a certain time,\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\nand all of the pictures on the wall would be off the wall,\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:38.000\nbut thrown across the hallway to the opposite side and broken.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:41.000\nYeah, so the painting was on the right side of the hallway.\n\n39:41.000 --> 39:45.000\nIt would be thrown to the left side of the hallway and smashed,\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nand left to right and smashed,\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nand things would be tipped over and broken.\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nSo we thought, okay, somebody has our keys,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:54.000\nand they're coming in to wreck in our place.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:57.000\nSo we asked Helene, the widow of the dead guy,\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nwho'd lived there for 35 years,\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\ndoes anybody else have these keys?\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nHe goes, no, we just put new locks on.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nI don't even have the keys. You and the landlord,\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:08.000\nand he's an 80-year-old guy, like only you guys have the keys.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:11.000\nSo usually one or the other of me and Paul\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nwould be at the apartment at one time,\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nbecause we had very different schedules,\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nbecause I was an alcoholic and he was an animator.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:21.000\nSo he was up early, and I was out dancing.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:25.000\nSo we were usually, somebody was at home,\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nbut any time the two of us went to the market together,\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nwe'd come home and everything was busted.\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:32.000\nThe pictures were all thrown around, clocks would stop,\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:35.000\nand the bathtub would, there would be,\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\njust doesn't matter everywhere.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:42.000\nNot like stuff, like if the drain spat out stuff,\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nor not if it backed up, there was just a random splatter pattern\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nof stuff all over the bathtub,\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nand we just thought, someone's fucking with us,\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nwhat's going on?\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nThat kind of goes away a little bit.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nWe find there's an attic in it.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nWe go up into the attic and we look up,\n\n40:57.000 --> 41:01.000\nand it's LA, it's like 78 degrees out always,\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nand in the attic it should be hotter,\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nbecause the heat rises.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nI get up into the attic and I look up,\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nand I see some old Christmas decorations and stuff,\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:13.000\nand instantly the temperature drops to what feels like 55 degrees,\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:16.000\noutside the draft house right now,\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:20.000\nand it's like, isn't it just crazy chill comes over me?\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nI kind of get this weird feeling,\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.000\nand I don't think, ooh scary ghosts,\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nI just drop back down the little ladder,\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nand I go, Paul, go check it out,\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nthere's some cool stuff up there,\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nlike to get a real reading on this,\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:35.000\nand he cleans the ladder and puts his head right down,\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nand he goes, Jeff, we're never going up there again.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:41.000\nAll right, so time passes a little bit,\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nand in that bedroom, I had the bedroom with a husband slept,\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nbecause they were an old married couple,\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nand I think you find that often they sleep in different rooms,\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nbecause the husband snores and farts,\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nand the woman wants to get a night's sleep,\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nand I had his room, and I was getting undressed,\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nI'm down to my boxers, and I just have a feeling\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nthat absolutely somebody's behind me,\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:00.000\nlike somebody's on the carpet behind me,\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nand I turn around and I'm like, okay, fucking enough,\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:07.000\nI never did shit, I never did this, you're dead,\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:10.000\nyou don't live here anymore,\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nI live here now, so fucking stop it!\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:15.000\nStop it!\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:18.000\nAnd nothing ever happened again, so I still...\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nIt's just that simple,\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nstory is far from over.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nThe only reason they made a bigger deal out of it\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nin the exercise is because obviously\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:28.000\nthat would be a shitty movie.\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:29.000\nSuck it off!\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nI got work in the morning!\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nMy roommate goes, what the hell's going on?\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nI go, I just exercised my bedroom as a fucking guy,\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.000\nso the end, I lived there for another eight months,\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nand everything weird ever happens,\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nI never thought the place was haunted,\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nthere was this weird activity that kept fucking happening,\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nbut there was a time when I felt there was a motherfucker\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:50.000\nstanding behind me, and not because the guy had died,\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:53.000\nhe didn't die there, I was not implanted with this knowledge,\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nI didn't really care about it,\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:58.000\nso Rob Schrab moves in a year later when I move out,\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nand...\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nStory's halfway done.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:05.000\nOh, no, this is like page two of 100.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nSo we're at a bar, Rob Schrab is at the drawing room,\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nhe's at the burgundy room, and Rob comes out,\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:12.000\nand he just gets a screwdriver, and just, boom, drops it,\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:15.000\ngets a bartender, another, drinks it straight down,\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nanother, and he's drinking it, and I go,\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:20.000\nRob, what the fuck? I've never seen you drink like this,\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:25.000\nhe's like, oh man, I don't want to go home sober.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nI'm like, what's up, Maron?\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nLike with the girlfriend or the girl you're dating?\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nHe's like, no, I'm just like, I don't know, stupid,\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nI don't want to talk about it, I just don't...\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nHe's about to cry, I'm like, what the fuck's going on?\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nThis is...\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nThe place on Lowry is like,\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nanything weird ever happened there to you?\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nAnd I was like, what do you mean?\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nI still, again, I don't instantly leap to ghosts,\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nI never really thought there was going to be\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\njust a bunch of weird shit happening.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nAnd he goes, I don't know, I was like...\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nYou slept in the bedroom I slept in, right?\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nI sleep, and I go, yeah, and he goes,\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nis it haunted?\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:01.000\nI go, oh yeah, totally.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nAnd Rob goes,\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\noh, don't see that!\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nDon't see that!\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nHe starts crying, I go, what happened?\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nWhat the fuck happened? He goes,\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\never since I moved in there,\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nI hung on this artwork up,\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nand every time I left the place and there was nobody in there,\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nI would come back and all the paintings were off the walls,\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nand they were all broken.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nAnd each time I hung a picture of somebody's face on it,\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nall the pictures were gone,\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nand it was smashed across the room.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nAnd last night, there was all this weird shit going on,\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nbut last night I was laying in bed,\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nand the door opened, and I felt,\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nI heard somebody walking across the carpet into my room,\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nand I felt the weight of a person's body\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\ngetting onto my bed,\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nand I was like, were you awake or were you asleep?\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nI was on my stomach, which is rare for me,\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nbut I looked at the clock, and it was 4 or 10 a.m.,\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nand I thought, are Dan and Jeff still here?\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nDid we watch a movie together?\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nNo, they're not here.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nI had this conscious thought,\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nand I felt this person get on top of me,\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nand I thought, it's a burglar,\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nlike burglars in my room, or rapists.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nYeah, certainly not.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nNot until tonight.\n\n45:03.000 -->

going to play Dungeons & Dragons with all black people tonight\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nThere's a new character\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nRight Spencer?\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nRight\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nAlright\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nI mean is that possible?\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nI don't know, ask Spencer, is it possible to have this many people spring on you for the D&D?\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nI mean they could exist in the game world\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nAlright\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nI don't have character\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nAre you guys standing awkwardly up on stage in the background like that?\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nYeah\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nYou can't just ask a group of people to stand up here\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nThey're just waiting to find out if they're involved\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nYeah\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nWe could just miss them, I don't know\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nIt's an awkward situation\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nYou know what, it's metaphorical\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nLet's deal with it, head on\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nWhat are we supposed to do?\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nThis is my favorite form of affirmative action\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nLike my whole life\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nThis is the best\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nI say, Jeff, here's what I say\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nWe break a pool cue in half\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nAnd we put it on the floor\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nNo, sorry, that's not\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nThat's the way we've been handling it\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nLet's play Dungeons & Dragons\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nAnd have all black people\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nThat want to be a part of it\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nRepresent all black people in the whole nation\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nAnd they can play a character\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nThat will make up on the fly\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nSpencer, we'll leave it to you\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nTo include our seven and a half black people up here\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nSo did you say one character\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nFor all of them?\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nYeah\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nAll black people have to play one character\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nI mean look, we've done it\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nWe've done it\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nI mean look, we've done so much\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nWe're bending over backwards here\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nWhat do we want us to do?\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nThis wasn't my problem\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nI inherited this\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nI think I'm being pretty heroic\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nBy providing them with one D&D character\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nHe can be super strong\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nHe won't be a kleptomaniac\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nOr have a stutter\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nHe'll be the dentist\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nOr the next-door neighbor\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nLet's start this stuff\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nErin McGathy to the stage please\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nErin McGathy\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nYes, yes\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nOkay, here we go\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nSpencer?\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nPhil\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nPhil\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nAlright\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nWhen we last met\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nThis was funny\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nOkay\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nYou guys busy?\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nYeah, I'm all good you guys\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nAlright\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nOn the last episode\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nOur heroes had defeated Dave\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nThe airship pilot\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nAnd gained control of the ship\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nAfter tormenting some crew members\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nThe group had to find the engine room\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nAnd enlisted the help of\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nA couple of imps\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nWho were tasked with servicing the ship's engines\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nAfter finding some sovereign glue\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nThe ship seemed prepared\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nSharpie decided that they should press onward\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nIn an attempt to take the fight to Admiral Darkstar\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nIt was just then that a calamitous impact\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nShook the entire ship\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nBefore casting everything into darkness\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nAlright\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nYou were all knocked unconscious\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nYou wake up in the hole of the black ship\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nWhat's left of it at any rate?\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nYou can see that the hole\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nHas been ripped into two halves\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nThrough the wreckage\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nYou can see dull red walls\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nSlick with slime surrounding you\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\nYou seem to be at the bottom of a pit\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nAs above you stretches in black expanse\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nGo\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nAlright\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nDidn't we meet some people that were going to walk us down the road?\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nYeah, okay\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nSo like that I didn't write\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nBecause I thought we'd just do it right now\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nBut do you want to just\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nI look up and I look around\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nAnd see if there's any people that will help us down the road\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nThree white figure\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nThree white clothed figures approaching\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nThis isn't you, you guys are elsewhere\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nIt seems like with a quick edit\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nYou could make this very appropriate\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nDo what?\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nCan't there be seven and a half black figures around there?\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nSeven and a half black figures\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nApproach\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nWhy can't it just be a full\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nEighth black person?\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nHe said he was half black\n\n01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nOkay, he's a halfling\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nSeven black people and a black halfling\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nApproach\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nAlright, so right now you guys\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nThat's you Casey\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nHoly hell\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nCasey's mutated\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nAlright\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nSo you guys have been living\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nIn the belly of this great beast\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nFor quite some time, you're quite used to it\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nBut you just saw this ship\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nCrash down to the floor\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nIt's quite a new occurrence for you guys\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nI mean, stowaways and shipwrecks\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nOccasionally happen, but it's quite rare\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nSo that's your motivation as you're approaching this wreck\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nSo our ship crashed inside the mouth\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nOf the Infinifish\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nCorrect, and I should mention Jeff\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nYour crystal\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nYour healing pendant shatters\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nInto a billion piles of little crystals\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nThat's like in a video game\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nBecause we would have been able to use that\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nAs this happens, you feel some of the crystals dissolving\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nHealing you to full health\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nYou see a small pile of crystals remaining\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nI gather those crystals\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nAlright, you gather them\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nWhere are my hit points at right now?\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nThey're at full now\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nCan we get our character sheets?\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nYeah\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nAlright Spencer, I walk up to one of the\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nTo this group of people\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nAnd I find a person\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nThat seems to be the leader\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nAnd she has a red and blue feather\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nA pink and blue feather in her ear\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nAnd I assume she's the leader\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nSo I come up and address her\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nAnd say\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nCan you please help us?\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nIf we could help you\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nWe'd help ourselves\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nWe're stuck here\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nHow long have you been stuck here?\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nI don't know, we don't have any clocks\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nOr calendars\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nIt's felt like years\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nOkay, so a long time\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nI noticed that she's wearing a handmade\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nThis feels terrible vest\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nBut I regard\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nI think it's awesome\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nThat's all, sorry\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nWe do get iTunes and podcasts here\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nThat's like the only wifi\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nThe wifi is great\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nBut it's totally convoluted now\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nWell, so you guys\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nSo\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nYou guys, if you knew how to get out of here\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nYou would have gotten out of here\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nHell yeah\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nI mean, we had tongue stew for a million years\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nLike cutting off tongue of\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nThe beast's mouth and making\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nSoup isn't really enjoyable\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nI'd rather, you know, some\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nThing else\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nIt's a fried chicken\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nAnd watermelon\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nWow\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nI\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nPick something else to look at\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nAnd\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nI roll versus blushing\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nYou save\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nWhere did you\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nBlack figures, are they figures?\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nThey're people, they're figureheads\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nLike you and I\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nAnd\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nWhere are you from?\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nYour mama\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nGeez\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nSpencer, where are they from?\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nWhere are you guys from?\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nFrom here\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nYou were, okay\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nThey mentioned that they were actually the third generation\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nOf people born in this fish\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nOh my god, the metaphor's back\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nI like it\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nSo you don't know any different\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nYou've been born inside the belly\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nOf this savage beast\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nThis is your ordinary world\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nAnd you have an instinctive sense\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nThat it's not a healthy place\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nBut it's all you know\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nI examine our surroundings to look for exits\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nOr portals to cross\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nTo what I'm going to call south\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nFor, you know, sake of\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nDirectionality\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nYou see what appears to be a large\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nThat's a great reason to call it south\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nThere's no, that's actually the only reason to call it south\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nI gotta draw a map\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nYou know, for my reference\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nAnd I can't, like, there's no south of a fish\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nBut\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nBut there's down on a paper\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nOkay\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nAnyway, you see a curtain\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nIt appears to be made out of some sort of fleshy meat-like substance\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nA meat curtain?\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nA meat curtain\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nA wizard sleeve\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nA portable hole\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nI thrust myself headlong\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nFor the meat curtain\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nI must warn you, strange traveler\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nNo one who's gone to that curtain has come back\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nWe've lost many siblings\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nTo the meat curtain\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nAre you saying that once you go through\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nThis particular meat curtain\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nYou never go back?\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nIs that what I'm hearing?\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nHeatless of a warning, I thrust myself\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nThrough the fleshy folds of the\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nMeat curtain\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nYou see\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nWhat appears to be a snake-like appendage\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nWhip out of the curtain\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nIt's a dick inside a pussy\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nYeah\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nYou got me\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nThe tentacle whips at you\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nBut misses by a hair\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nCome on in, guys, it's okay\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nI approach the whipping\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nSerpent\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nAnd I whip my hair around\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nAnd I attempt to calm it down\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nOr maybe to just make it straighter\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nThe curtain\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nOpens\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nThree more tendrils reveal themselves\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nSlipping themselves out\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nBusy lady\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nThey also miss\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nAre we armed?\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nYou guys are actually armed with\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nDaggers and spears\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nSorry, you guys\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nSpencer\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nIt's not his fault\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nSpears are going to be really useful\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nAs you'll see later\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nI can't do anything\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nAlright\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nGuys, you've been here for\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nThree generations\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nIf we don't go through this meat curtain\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nTogether, we've got no chance of getting out\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nI say follow me with your spears\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nAnd daggers\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nI say we send one of the black people in first\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nIs that cool?\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nYou already went in first\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nOh, that's right, I'm already in there\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nBefore they go in, I shoot\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nOne arrow\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nAt the\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nAt the\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nSorry?\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nI shoot 14 arrows\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nOr two\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nOne of the arrows strikes the meat curtain\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nIt shudders violently\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nAre we all through the curtain right now?\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nNo one's even tried to go through it\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nEverybody\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nLet's all charge\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nCharge the meat curtain\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nI peek cautiously through the meat curtain\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nYou guys\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nYou guys want to go through the thing?\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nWe should go\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nWe should go\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nI lead my army\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nOf black people through the meat curtain\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nYes\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nFailing to regard\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nWe thrust our daggers and\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nSpears\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nThrough the meat curtain towards the tentacles\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nBrandishing your weapons\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nDangerously\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nYou charge through the curtain\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nThe tentacles whip back and forth\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nBut you manage to subdue them and make it through\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nBlack adventure\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nAdventure\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nSorry guys\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nMixed reaction\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nSo we're beyond the tentacles now?\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nYou are beyond the tentacles\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nWhat do we see?\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nA brown tunnel\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nIt seems to get smaller and smaller\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nI've tried to summon squirrels\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nBut there's no squirrels inside the\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nInfinifish\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nBlack friends\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nIs there a way to take the spears\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nAnd to prop them up\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nSo as to keep the blue\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nTunnel wide\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nSorry\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nI need to stop listening to people yelling\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nThe spears\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nCan you take your spears and stick them up\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nSo the tunnel can't close\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nWell we have\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nWe have heard strange legend of\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nAn exit which if stimulated\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nProperly expands\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nExcellent\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nExit this beast but none have ventured\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nThis far previously\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nOh my god\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nI'm having way too much fun\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nThere's a legend\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nOf a thing that expands\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nWhen you stimulate it\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nWell that sounds\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nWhat is your secret\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nWoman to stimulate\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nThe tunnel\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nTo make it expand\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nMy\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nAfrican-American elder\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nAs African-American elders\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nTend to be very wise\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nOnce told me\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nOf a sacred dance that can only\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nBe performed when you have a\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nSeven and a half\n\n01:17:13.000

only create this dance\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nTo arouse the\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nExit\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nYou're saying we all have to dance together\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nTo coax the opening\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nTo widen for us to pass through\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nCease and yore\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nWait wait, cease and yore\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nThe three of us\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nHave only\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nDanced in the shape of square\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nCan you show us how to dance\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nSometimes in a line\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nWhen things get hotter than a hoochie-coochie\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nIf vows have\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nA beat to drop, we may proceed\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nI'm getting very uncomfortable\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nNo, we're black, so it's okay\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nThat's what's making me\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI do not want to see the TMZ headline\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nI feel comfortable\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nI'll leave the charge\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nThis will actually be embarrassing\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nOpen up, open up\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nGiant lake, open up\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nOpen up\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nGonna

01:19:11.000\nYou gotta set up all my nuts\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nGotta punch on all my tips\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nFuck your mama, that's how I'm hit\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nThat's like an open sesame\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nThe rhythmic pounding of feet and limbs\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nAnd the flailing of your bodies\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nSeems to do nothing at first\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nBut then you feel the expanding\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nAnd contracting muscular action\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nJesus\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nThe esophageal tube\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nOpens and widens\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nRevealing a larger antichamber\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nSo we're going down the throat\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nInto the belly of this\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nInfinifish\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nYou're going down an esophageal tube\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nIt may or may not be a throat\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nIt opens into a large chamber\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nDungeon snap\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nDungeon snap\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nYou can see several wooden\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nConstructions built together\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nThey seem to have been made out of parts of old\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nShips or perhaps other crates\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nAnd boxes\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nBut they hold together quite nicely\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nThere seems to be about 16 or 17\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nOf the dwellings\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nThis is where you guys have\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nHave lived\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nYour parents, you know, they came\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nI said third generation\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nSo your parents came\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nOn ships and they built these into\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nVillage so that's where you guys live\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nWait, so they\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nThey've lived here?\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nYeah\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nHave they been here before?\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nThey've lived here for three generations\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nBut they usually take a different path\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nA less dangerous way\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nSo we just took a hard way to get here\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nThat's just like the corner drug store\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nWait, they could have told us how to get home\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nIs that\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nIs that your doorbell? We all do a dance\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nAnd that's how you get home? You guys saw the meet\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nWe incorporate new people into our culture\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nThat's too embarrassing\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nThat makes sense\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nThey don't have TV, just wifi\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nSo now we're\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nAt the home of these people\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nThis is your guys home\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nYou love it\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nOnce you feng shui the organs\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nNo, that's someone else's joke\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nSorry guys\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nIt's beautiful here\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nIt's great here guys\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nI've never seen such a nice place inside\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nIn a soffigial tube before\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nI love what you've done\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nWith the throat\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nWe try\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nWe get more of the steward living on the wifi\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nSo we try to make cozy\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nYou really started from a place of nothing\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nAnd built from the scraps\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nOf a, you know, and created\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nSomething that's\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nEqually appealing in a testament to the\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nEnvironment that is this\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nInfinifish\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nYou could even say we found love in a hopeless place\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nYeah\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nIt seems like\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nYou did not land on this infinifish\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nIt seems like this infinifish landed on you\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nBut I respect what you've done\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nI think we can learn from it\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nLike I\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nI pull mole rain aside\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nOver to the wall of the\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nSoffigial tube and I say\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nMole rain\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nI don't know if you're watching this\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nThere's a spark of connection between this\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nLeader and Sharpie\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nWhom you've been in love with\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nYou better, I warn you\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nBe careful, I know about these\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nSoffigial people\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nYes\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nQuirk, I saw it too\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nBut I can't move like she can move\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nI can shoot arrows\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nAnd I can wave my hair\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nAnd I can giggle\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nBut you know\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nI'm going to concede\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nDon't tell him that I\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nYour talent for passive aggression\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nseduces me\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nThat was some passive aggression\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nYou couldn't hear me\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nI heard the sound of someone needing more\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nThan\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nYou know\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nAre we going to talk about our actual relationship\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nIn the middle of D&D\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nI was just expressing that I was sad\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nIt wasn't being passive aggression\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nIt was similar to the van thing last night\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nI take our new hosts out\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nTo lunch at their local\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nOssophagus shack\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nWhile these two have sorted out the relationship\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nFrom the tour bus today\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nWe're at the village\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nOf these people\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nWho have a weird habit\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nOf making people go through a tentacle\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nOssophagus in order to get\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nWhere they already lived\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nI mean\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nWe can't do much more than that\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nWe've done this for like a half hour\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nWe should probably cut it off there\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nIt's fine, avoid our issues\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nIt's fine\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nLet's hear it for America's black people\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nThe Capital Steps\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nI'm going to give them a name Jeff\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nThe Capital Steps\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nWhat's everyone's name real quick\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nWe got Casey\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nFor the sake of credits\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nCasey\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nLataya\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nNice to meet you\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nTori\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nNice to meet you\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nWelcome again\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nVanessa\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nAlia\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nPhillip\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nAndrew\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nThank you so much for coming up\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nWow\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nOur salvation\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nThere's nothing left\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nWe have nothing left\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nWe have nothing left\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nWhen we were\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nNear Boston in Somerville\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nI had a camper\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nCome up to stage because I was a camp counselor\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nI have another camper here\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nShow off\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nJust saying\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nYou want to bring her up?\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nLet's get her up\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nAlex Fox\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nSounds white\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nBut fine\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nChange of pace\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nYou were asking for something\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nNow you're being passive\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nAlex Fox\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nYou wanted to hear about it\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nAlex Fox\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nWhen we were in Somerville, Massachusetts\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nWe had another one of Erin's campers\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nCome up and we talked about feminine wetness\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nAnd then her mother came on stage\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nAnd she got bananas\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nIt got weird\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nDid Erin dispense any\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nUncomfortable wisdom to you while you were at the camp?\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nI mean, Erin was just really my\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nSexual education\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nUp until I was about\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nWhat, 14, 15\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nI went to a really strict school\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nPrivate Catholic school\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nSo I didn't know what sex was\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nAnd Erin really was\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nReally eager to talk about it\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nWith just our 14-year-old selves\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nThat's not why I brought her up\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nDid she ever make you pass through her\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nFlesh curtains?\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nNo, but she did show me\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nMy first penis\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nNo, I'm just kidding\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nYou don't have a penis\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nI'm just kidding\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nTotally fine\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nYou're normal\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nWould I have to be okay if I had a penis?\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nNo, totally fine\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nThat would be even more educating\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nWomen having penises\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nIs the new black\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nWhat we did tonight was kind of antiquated\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nWe're not really breaking down any barriers\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nThis is DC\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nWe should have had transgender people up here\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nBlack people\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nYawn\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nWhat is this? Gilligan's Island?\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nIssue solved\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nWell, I\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nAlex\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nYou were counseled by Erin\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nWhen you were younger\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nNow we're all grown up\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nBut Dan and Erin were about to talk about\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nA little spat they had today\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nWhich I know nothing about\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nMaybe you could counsel them right now through this\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nYou could kind of mediate\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nThrough this crisis\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nI'd like to hear about it\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nAlex, why don't you take the mic\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nAnd walk them through it\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nHey, Alex Fox, so\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nFor the show, I was talking to some fans\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nThis is Dan's side of the story\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nI was talking to\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nTwo fans about\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nGlass Blowing\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nVery interesting\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nProvidence last night\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nI'm starting to be\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nIt's all the same\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nOnly the names are changed\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nI was in Rhode Island\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nTalking to you guys about Glass Blowing\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nSigning on autographs\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nForgoing the opportunity\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nTo write a TV show\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nHaving decided this is where I need to be\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nBeing a hero\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nOf course\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nMy girlfriend comes up to me\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nAnd she says\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nHey, the van's leaving\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nI don't know\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nIf you wanted to go\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nOr if you don't want to go\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nBut the van's leaving\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nDan's side of the story\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nThe van is the only mode of transportation\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nI'll stay\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nIs everyone leaving?\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nThere's two fans\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nI'm not sure\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nWhat follows is a 25-minute conversation\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nAbout when the van's leaving\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nWhen the van's aren't leaving\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nBut I know the whole time\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nBecause I'm 40\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nI know the whole time\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nThat what she's saying\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nWithout saying it\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nIs she wants to leave\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nShe wants me to want to leave\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nShe wants you to want to leave\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nShe's saying everything else\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nAnd I'm agreeing with it\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nBecause I don't give a shit\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nAnd I'm going like\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nTake what you're saying at Face Valley\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nIf you want to get on the first van\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\n25 minutes goes by\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nBy my drunk estimation\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nAnd\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nAt one point she walks away\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nAnd goes like\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nGoodbye, I'll see you back at the hotel\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nThen she comes back\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nBecause there is no van\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nAnd there is nothing\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nAnd she goes like\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nThere's another van\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nAnd schedule van\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nAnd I go again\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nI don't care\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nShe walks away\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nAnd you love glass blowing\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nI did that night\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nI never heard anything about it\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nMy first question was\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nDo you take a bunch of sand and heat it up?\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nDoes it turn into glass?\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nThe answer is no\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nDan, my van is leaving in a couple seconds\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nI already know everything\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nAbout this\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nThis is my one chance\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nI'm talking to some dudes about blowing glass\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nSo then\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nSo then what happened\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nThe thing that really causes the fight\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nPops the champagne cork\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nOn the beautiful frothy\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nAnger bottle that is our relationship\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nIs\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nThe tour manager\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nThe guy whose job it is\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nTo tell you when\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nA van is coming and when it isn't\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nComes up to me and says\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nHey Dan, so there's a van leaving now\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nAnd there's a van leaving in 15 minutes\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nWhich one do you want to be on?\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nAnd I go, I'll take the one in 15 minutes\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nAnd he proceeds to go around the bar and tell everybody\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nAnd when I see him telling it to Erin\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nI was drunk and I was an asshole\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nAnd I was going\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nI was jiggling my ear\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nAnd she's looking at me going\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nAnd she came over to me and I said\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nI'm just saying, do you hear how that works?\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nDo you hear how easy that is?\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nThat's rude.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nYeah, well, fuck you guys.\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nI lost\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\n38 minutes of glass\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nBlowing talk\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nAnd she asked for a little bit of dignity for 30 seconds\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nI'll try to make my version a little\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nShorter.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nI thought it wasn't a diss, but I think that is\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nYou can afford to, Time Stealer\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nThe 38 minutes you're talking about is 5 minutes\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nI'm sure you're Justin Timberlake\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nArm readout has fucking 100\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nOf my minutes on it\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nFrom just\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nBecause I spent all that time talking about vans\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nInstead of fucking glass\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nI would have been up here tonight\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nTeaching motherfuckers how to blow a bottle\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nOut of dirt\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nBut there's crucial\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nShould I miss, all I know is that\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nWe're fighting\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nAlex, jump in, mediate for fuck's sake\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nI want to hear her side of the story\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nThere you go\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nFirst of all, those guys talking to Dan\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nAbout blowing glass, super cool\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nLearned a lot from them\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nI was also listening to them about glass\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nAnd the lightning striking the sand\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nAnd that making these big branches\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nOf glass and things, that was cool\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nI also had a great time at the bar\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nI was tired\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nNeil Berkeley, who's directing the documentary\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nWas like, you know, we're gonna get in the van\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nAnd go, sometimes transportation has been\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nTough and people have been left behind\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nSo I was like, oh, well\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nI'm gonna let Dan know that I'm gonna go\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nMaybe he'll want to go too\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nI love him, love him dearly\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nWent up to him and was like, hey, there's gonna be\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nA van going in a little bit if you want to get on that van\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nAnd he responded to me in a way\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nThat made me think that he was like\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nOh, okay, I'll get on the van\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nIf you want me to get on the van, like I had said\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nHey, we're getting on a van\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nSo if you want to be cool\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nGet on the van, and he responded to me\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nAnd I was like, I had said it that way\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nSo I was like, that didn't feel good\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nAnd I walked away\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nAnd because I can't walk away from things\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nI was like, no, that was rude\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nAnd I walked back and I tried to explain it to him\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nAnd he was very snippy with me\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nAnd then I walked back\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nAnd was talking to more people\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nAnd that was when the tour manager went over\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nAnd told him about the 15th thing\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nI didn't know it, but then afterwards\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nHe did this, and then he yelled at me\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nAnd then I went back to the hotel room\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nAnd I was crying in the bathroom\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nAnd he came in and he was like\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nYou're taking a shit!\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nI don't know, I can't see tears\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nAll I see is a closed bathroom door\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nI start with a logic\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nI walked out, my face\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nIs red\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nAnd\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nI said\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nBecause I was sitting there crying\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nAnd I was like, you know, I feel like I'm constantly\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nThat whole fight happened\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nBecause I was worried he was going to get left behind\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nBecause call back to the\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nMom issues from earlier\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nSometimes I'm Dan's mom a little bit\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nI get his food together\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nI take care of him as best I can\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nWhat?\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nThat's normal\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nGood job, Casey\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nAlex\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nNo, I met the guy from earlier\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nI just saw that guy earlier, he was fucking great\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nBut he checked his eyes\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nAnd his sleeves\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nSorry, Alex, go ahead\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nSo yeah, it escalated\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nIt escalated from there\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nAnd Dan\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nDan tore me a real good one\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nAnd I was crying for a long time\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nHe left the hotel room\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nHe ran into Bobcat Goldthwaite\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nGoldthwaite\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nSorry\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nBob Goldthwaite was in the room across the hall\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nAnd so he leaves, he talks to him\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nAnd then he comes back and he's calmed down\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nAnd he said, I'm sorry\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nHe said a lot of mean things to me\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nIncluding the C-word\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nAnd\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nWhich one?\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nWhich C-word?\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nCutie\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nIt's not so bad\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nAnd then this morning I was still bummed out about it\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nEven though he said I'm sorry\n\n01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nBut he said a lot of really\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nReally cruel things to me\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nAnd made me feel pretty worthless\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nOkay, Alex, you have a chance to\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nGo ahead and mediate\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nHere's my thing, if you apologize to her\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nThen you're admitting that you did something wrong\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nOr at least realizing that you hurt her feelings\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nIn some capacity\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nSo then, I mean\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nI think it was mostly a miscommunication\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nBetween the two of you\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nYou thought she was harassing you to get on this van\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nWhen in reality she was just concerned about\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nNot leaving you behind\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nI should say the crux of this argument\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nHe thought I was lying\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nHe thought that I was bullshitting him\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nAnd I was not\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nThe only thing to lie about\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nAnd I don't think Erin would do that personally\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nHowever, just from an unbiased\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nNo, I haven't, you're right\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nSo I don't know, so I'm just saying\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nFrom an unbiased perspective, however\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nClearly her heart was in the right place\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nIf she's saying that she thinks\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nShe was going to leave you behind\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nAnd you admitted that you were wrong about something\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nOkay, so by applause\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nShould they break up or stay together?\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nStay together\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nThat's my vote\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nThank you, Alex, that was very wise\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nThat was lovely\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nWe're staying together no matter what\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nWe're staying together no matter what\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nThat's the problem\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nI'm never going to leave her\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nAnd if she leaves me, I'll kill myself\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nSounds healthy\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nThere begin the problems\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nWhen you realize that you can't be without someone\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nThen you go like\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nAlright, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nWhy are you, yeah\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nSo maybe if that's true\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nInstead of thinking that I'm someone who could never go away\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nThink of me as someone who\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nYou want to take care of and be nice to\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nBecause I'm never going to go away\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nYou don't want this perfect\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nFlower that you have to wilt\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nYou want to nourish this flower\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nNow, let's first of all\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nThink Alex we're coming up and dispensing\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nBut I think it's very sound\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nSound counseling\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nThank you\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nLet's see if we can sum this up\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nMaybe we can heal these wounds\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nVia our new anthem\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nLet's try this one out\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nIt's been a good night in Arlington\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nLet's learn some things\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nOh yeah\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nI told a pretty long story\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nEverybody does something wrong\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nBut I'm gonna heal you\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nWith a tender song\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nI'm so sorry\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nTo Aaron\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nAnd Jeff\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nAnd Spencer\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nAnd all the black people\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nI didn't mean to do you bad\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nI just want to make you happy\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nNot sad, I just want to go from\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nTown to town and say\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nHarmontown\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nWhere P is yellow and Poop is brown\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nHarmontown\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nEverybody's singing Harmontown\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nWhere P is yellow and Poop is brown\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nI like the bread and the butter\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nAnd the honey and the nutrients\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nGrow on every tree\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nAnd the leaves go to the sky\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nAnd drip down on me\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000\nAnd every piece of sustenance\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nMakes me feel young and free again\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nAnd I feel like I'm twenty again\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nI fucked your mama so hard\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nThat I swear I saw her\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nIn a prison yard\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nAnd I'm sorry that she got fucked\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nWith my fleshy shard of love\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nFleshy shard of love\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nI don't think the glove fits\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nThe hand in the\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nQuitting process\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nI'm sorry, I got thrown off the rail\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nI'm sorry, I'm gonna start over again\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nI got thrown off in Harmontown\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nI'm really sorry\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nIn Harmontown\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nBut when your mama

stage\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nAnd I fucked your mama at home\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nOn Ellen Page's back\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nAnd I fucked your mama while your daddy\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nSmoked some crack\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nAnd just watched cause your family sucks\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000\nThat's fucked up\n\n01:39:09.000
