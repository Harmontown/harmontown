00:00.000 --> 00:17.760
From the cozy confines of the Starburns Industries recording booth, Harmontown is now in session.

00:17.760 --> 00:29.840
Put your hands together for Steve Levy, everybody, and the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:29.840 --> 00:37.600
All right. Thank you for waiting. Can I get a little more of my favorite person in my headphones?

00:37.600 --> 00:39.840
Is that possible to hear myself better? You want more of me?

00:42.880 --> 00:49.360
I tried to dance around it, but it's me. Thank you for waiting if you're a subscriber and you're

00:49.360 --> 00:57.280
watching. Sorry, if it came up late, it was my fault. I got here late. And also, you know,

00:57.280 --> 01:01.600
here's some apologies. We'll just start with the show with apologies, because this is like our

01:01.600 --> 01:05.040
second really official week doing this out of here. We did one week where it was like

01:06.080 --> 01:09.760
church was running around with a camera. This is our second week of like, all right, here we go.

01:09.760 --> 01:14.640
We're broadcasting from this booth. So it's, you know, it's lit like a preschool, you know,

01:14.640 --> 01:22.480
and we're gonna try to make it a little prettier. We'll try to come up with a system where we're

01:22.480 --> 01:27.520
starting right at eight so that you, the subscribers can at least be gaining things from this transitional

01:27.520 --> 01:33.840
period. Like, okay, at least I know it's on time now that there's no audience. Who knows if you

01:33.840 --> 01:39.200
like the audience more or hate the audience and are so happy that we're doing this, but in any case,

01:39.200 --> 01:46.800
like, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're in progress, like we're gonna keep on like evolving this.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.560
Is the castle going to be a thing again? Is that gonna get back online?

01:50.560 --> 01:57.200
Like, yeah, we are currently as active as as human beings possibly could be in trying to

01:57.200 --> 02:05.520
legitimize that space. It's a bunch of city hall stuff. Burbank is a city where, you know,

02:06.800 --> 02:13.200
parrots are wild. They have wild parrots in Burbank. It's a, it's a crazy town. You can still

02:13.200 --> 02:17.360
walk in off the street into a vacuum cleaner repair shop. Those are my favorite.

02:17.360 --> 02:25.760
It's a, it's an old world community underneath a frozen chocolate shell of,

02:26.480 --> 02:34.080
of antiquity and provinciality. And they saw 900 millennials on a sidewalk at, you know,

02:34.080 --> 02:37.840
late at night and they freaked out. And I'm not saying they, they, well,

02:37.840 --> 02:41.120
also we were in violation of a thousand codes that we didn't know we were in violation.

02:41.120 --> 02:47.920
Chilly John's runs unhindered. That place just, just deals in diarrhea and yet they,

02:48.800 --> 02:52.240
they're allowed to funk in freely. So there's a whole process and maybe we can,

02:52.240 --> 02:55.440
I don't know, people with a little NPR of us, but maybe we can make it part of the,

02:56.640 --> 03:00.640
maybe we can do like remote pieces where we have Nolan like check in with us,

03:00.640 --> 03:04.400
basically his full-time job because he used to eat what he killed in terms of booking the room.

03:04.400 --> 03:11.680
Now, now he's just a man without a country. So we're paying him as much as we can to make his

03:11.680 --> 03:17.760
job to like get the venue legitimized. So he's like having to interact with city hall people

03:17.760 --> 03:22.480
and, and he's got to go to meetings and things. We should be documenting that. Is it possible

03:22.480 --> 03:26.720
for us to take like a little zoom and go out there and, and like podcast from city hall

03:26.720 --> 03:30.320
where we're, where we're trying to clear this crap up? A zoom and Microsoft zoom?

03:30.320 --> 03:37.680
A Microsoft zoom. Now what's the little recording thing? A zoom, a zoom. I just hadn't heard the

03:37.680 --> 03:42.160
word zoom in a while. I don't know what they're called. I like that we have churches hanging

03:42.160 --> 03:48.080
out in the booth with us. Yeah, I like it too. Hello church. So yeah. Church is wearing her,

03:48.720 --> 03:51.520
what can only be described as matrix trash bag outfit.

03:51.520 --> 04:00.640
And as long as we're, we're, we're shining a spotlight on some of the, uh, like, like,

04:00.640 --> 04:05.200
Nolan's out there hitting the hard, sweaty streets of Burbank, dodging wild parrots,

04:05.200 --> 04:11.440
trying to get our permits back. And, uh, you know, let's, let's doff our cap to Kris Boruff, who,

04:12.080 --> 04:16.160
you know, we're, we're, we're crammed into Burbank's largest,

04:16.160 --> 04:20.160
Harmon owned, uh, VO booth. When I, when we were building the studio,

04:20.160 --> 04:24.800
the room that we're sitting in right now was, uh, was full of like boxes of, uh,

04:24.800 --> 04:31.280
social security numbers and inspirational posters from a failed tax, uh, company. And

04:31.280 --> 04:37.360
there was literally a guy in the, in the corner of the room with the last phone plugged into the

04:37.360 --> 04:43.440
wall, no desk standing and basically saying, um, yeah, I got to call you back into the phone

04:43.440 --> 04:48.960
next to a garbage bin full of everyone's taxes. I mean, if you were nefarious, if you were a dumpster

04:48.960 --> 04:53.840
diver, you could have walked out of this place with like, it would have been like an Equifax on a

04:53.840 --> 04:58.640
very low scale because probably a bunch of Burbank business owners, uh, social security numbers.

04:58.640 --> 05:03.680
But anyways, this place was a pile of garbage we built. And I said, let's build a booth, uh,

05:03.680 --> 05:07.680
you know, the partners at star burns were like, all right, and we started talking specs. And I

05:07.680 --> 05:12.160
was like, guys, one of these days we're going to be podcasting out of this thing, make it big,

05:13.200 --> 05:17.760
still not big enough to podcast out of comfortably. I mean, not make it look cool.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.040
And Chris is therefore, my point is Chris, Chris is a hero right now.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.440
This is the same size as Howard Stern's little.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.880
Well, I think, I don't think that's true. I think, you know how it is like in TV, it's like

05:26.880 --> 05:31.520
whenever, um, uh, and I'm sure you at home, you know how this works when they build a set for your

05:31.520 --> 05:36.240
TV show. Uh, it's like, it always looks way too big. You know, you always go like, oh,

05:36.240 --> 05:39.920
the show about poor people, why is their house so big? And then like, then the DP always says,

05:39.920 --> 05:45.440
trust me, it's going to look like confined. I think that the Howard Stern room is probably

05:45.440 --> 05:48.960
twice the size of it. No, it's, it's the cameras make it look bigger because have you ever seen

05:48.960 --> 05:55.520
the wheel of fortune, the actual physical wheel? It's tiny. It's, it's like, it's like five feet

05:55.520 --> 06:03.120
across. It looks 20 feet across. But if you, like, like everything on TV, the Jeopardy set is

06:03.120 --> 06:07.360
like as big as this room, but you put four cameras in there and you get some angles going

06:07.360 --> 06:11.840
and it looks giant. It's all bullshit. Well, I mean, you're kind of implying that Chris is doing

06:11.840 --> 06:17.200
a bad job because it's like, if it looks cramped in here, then you're saying it's on him. I've not

06:17.200 --> 06:21.120
seen it on camera, but we don't have the same kind of, we don't have Jeopardy cameras in here.

06:21.120 --> 06:26.960
We've got also our, uh, I think bottoming off our list of apologies. Like last week,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.480
I think, I think we were like, I was in a full on blackout, not so much from drunkenness, but

06:32.480 --> 06:38.400
just from like, uh, man shame. Um, I didn't hear the show, but you told me a little bit about it.

06:38.400 --> 06:43.280
Uh, but, but, and I didn't watch it and I'm afraid to listen to it, but I, but what I do

06:43.280 --> 06:46.880
know is that apparently our faces were behind the microphones the entire time. Like, I think

06:46.880 --> 06:50.640
that people by and large are like, Hey, I like it. I'm a person that listens to the podcast.

06:50.640 --> 06:55.760
I, I, I wasn't getting as much, maybe they're getting something indirectly out of the 200

06:55.760 --> 06:59.440
people in the audience, but then there's other things to be gained from our ability to focus

06:59.440 --> 07:06.000
and things. I'm sure it's a mixed bag. I'm sure it's a mixed bag, Aunt Natalie, but you're subscribers

07:06.000 --> 07:14.400
so we take you very seriously. Uh, did you solve, uh, sexism and, uh, and sexual assault last week?

07:14.400 --> 07:18.400
And I didn't set out to what I, I don't, I don't know what I said. I talked for two hours trying

07:18.400 --> 07:22.160
to convince people I was a good person, but my important, the important thing that I wanted

07:22.160 --> 07:26.880
to talk about that week was it's time for guys to be having those conversations with guys and

07:26.880 --> 07:31.680
with each other, with each other and with themselves. And, and, and it's, and, and maybe, and, and the

07:31.680 --> 07:37.040
guys and, and then, and then having said that, I wanted to confine things to expressing my own

07:37.040 --> 07:41.360
self to, to set an example. And I don't want to say, well, guys are like this and girls are like

07:41.360 --> 07:46.160
that, but I'm sure I said a bunch of that. But like what I, what I wanted to do was say like,

07:46.160 --> 07:52.880
okay, from now on, the rule is we speak for ourselves. Um, you know, and, and so I wanted to

07:52.880 --> 07:59.360
just say like, that's where I'm at. Consciousness has been upheaved. Um, that's good. You have to

07:59.360 --> 08:06.000
aerate soil, you have to, uh, chisel the ice when you clean the freezer, tightly packed things that

08:06.000 --> 08:12.880
you don't have to think about. They're flawed things. Whether your revolution is racial,

08:13.440 --> 08:21.200
class based, gender based, whatever it is, however, one man, a million man, non binary march,

08:21.200 --> 08:27.680
any, whatever, whatever the movement is, I think it's all, as my therapist said, it can all be

08:27.680 --> 08:34.960
summed up as consciousness, examining unconsciousness and saying you need to be examined. You can't,

08:34.960 --> 08:40.800
you can't keep ruling from beneath. And as a, I'm sure I'm saying stuff that I already said

08:40.800 --> 08:45.520
last week, but as a writer, I celebrate the unconscious. I was always like the, oh, I'm the

08:45.520 --> 08:50.000
grimy monster. I'm going to teach you that the things that you don't think about are more important

08:50.000 --> 08:52.640
than the things that you do think about. And you're being dishonest with yourself, but

08:52.640 --> 08:59.680
narcissism is out. It's not fashionable anymore. Oh no. Yeah. I was just getting good at it. And

08:59.680 --> 09:04.720
like, because it's okay to be a big baby, it's okay, but you got it. But now I think the new rule is

09:05.360 --> 09:11.680
okay, but don't like, don't just brag about it and be like, okay, I'm going to do nothing about

09:11.680 --> 09:18.960
this. Like, otherwise, I feel like a fossil. Well, yeah, I mean, we're dinosaurs, like,

09:18.960 --> 09:23.360
like we're not even that old, but, but our way of thinking is just not going to do it anymore.

09:23.360 --> 09:31.920
Like we, we're not allowed to skate by on the, the presumption that what we say goes, because

09:31.920 --> 09:40.800
that was never a cool presumption in the first place. But now it's, we, we have to adjust. We,

09:40.800 --> 09:48.400
we must adjust. We must, we must, we must adjust our bust. The bigger, the better, the tighter,

09:48.400 --> 09:52.000
the sweater. Hey, can I, can I do a little house cleaning and talk about an issue that I don't

09:52.000 --> 09:57.120
know the answer to? Okay. We're sitting here holding some beautiful glassware made by Jane Cook,

09:57.760 --> 10:04.720
one of our solid lifelong harmonians. And yet I've, it's been brought to my attention that she

10:04.720 --> 10:12.400
has now left the fold that she's boycotting us or what's happening? I know what you know.

10:12.400 --> 10:17.680
I don't know anything. I don't, yeah, I don't know. Was it because of last week? Because of your,

10:18.480 --> 10:23.280
I don't know. I don't know. I would find that hard to believe. I don't think so. I think it's

10:23.280 --> 10:27.040
possible. She tested me today and said that she was at the library bar in New York and wished I

10:27.040 --> 10:31.280
was there. And so that, I mean, it's, it's not like she's mad at me. Maybe she's just mad at you

10:31.280 --> 10:37.200
or a Harmontown or. Is it definitive? Is it, is it safe to say she's mad? I don't know. I don't,

10:37.200 --> 10:41.840
I don't know if it is. What, what, what do we know? Like, I tell you what I know. I got a text

10:41.840 --> 10:46.800
from her saying that she was going to stop listening to the show, stop kind of following it.

10:46.800 --> 10:55.440
Like, but she didn't characterize it as, as a, like, as a complaint. But we're used to processing

10:55.440 --> 11:00.560
the announcement that you're going to sever connection with something as punitive. But

11:00.560 --> 11:05.200
I don't, also then the question would be, well, then what would you do if you wanted to be healthy?

11:05.200 --> 11:09.840
You know, an honorable discharge. What would you, what would you do? I, you know, she's in a

11:09.840 --> 11:13.840
unique position because most people have the luxury of, uh, they can just stop listening to

11:13.840 --> 11:18.320
podcasts. We asked, we asked her tonight to come from New York to be on the show. She declined.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.360
She didn't have the guts to show up and defend herself. I think when you look at it from her

11:23.360 --> 11:27.920
perspective, I'm gonna, I'm gonna speak as objectively as possible without any speculation

11:27.920 --> 11:33.760
of her subjective, uh, experience. But I would say as somebody, it's pretty easily observable that

11:33.760 --> 11:38.640
she was very entrenched with the listenership. She was, she was basically running a kind of

11:38.640 --> 11:44.640
unofficial slash official, emotionally official, uh, Facebook page, Facebook group of, of, of

11:44.640 --> 11:48.240
listeners and all these things that like, like when you're that, when you're that, when you're

11:48.240 --> 11:53.440
listening is that active, then you're, then you're, then something that for the rest of us can just

11:53.440 --> 11:58.000
be, eh, forget Game of Thrones. It has to be an announcement. Yeah. I mean, but like, I've always

11:58.000 --> 12:04.880
thought it's kind of like a sign of, uh, emotional maturity and awesomeness when our, when our,

12:04.880 --> 12:09.520
our regular people stopped coming. Like NT doesn't go to the show anymore. Once in a while, maybe,

12:09.520 --> 12:13.200
but, but a lot of people just go to the drawing room while we're doing this.

12:14.240 --> 12:18.640
That's their Harmontown now is being at the bar. Some people, yeah, they fill up their little cup.

12:19.440 --> 12:23.600
Who was the Russian guy? What was his name? Anatoly. Yeah. Anatoly used to come. He was, you know,

12:24.640 --> 12:29.040
it's like, and then like, if you're immature, you go like, oh, so you just wanted attention and now

12:29.040 --> 12:32.960
that you're not like a special audience member, now you're just gonna bail. But it's like, there's a

12:32.960 --> 12:36.720
positive way of saying that, which is, oh, you were like a friend of the show and like, you

12:36.720 --> 12:41.760
experienced the show on a higher level. But also like, like, if, if I went to five Grateful Dead

12:41.760 --> 12:47.280
concerts, I could go, I've seen enough Grateful Dead concerts. And if you were, but if the Grateful

12:47.280 --> 12:52.000
Dead brought you up on stage for three of the concerts and, and you therefore had a Twitter

12:52.000 --> 12:56.880
account where people were like asking you Grateful Dead questions, then when you decided not to go

12:56.880 --> 13:03.440
to a Grateful Dead concert, you might have to announce, I'm moving on. I'm not going to be

13:03.440 --> 13:07.440
listening to the Grateful Dead anymore. I will not be at the next concert. And then someone might go,

13:08.240 --> 13:14.400
is he mad? But the answer might be not really. From talking to Nolan, who I guess has been around

13:14.400 --> 13:19.200
the meltdown for so long, it seems like there were like classes, like groups of people who,

13:19.200 --> 13:25.200
who came to Harmontown seeking out like-minded people. And they like, became really close

13:25.200 --> 13:29.440
friends and they would go every week and then eventually like graduated from the program. And

13:29.440 --> 13:34.480
then like every, I feel like it was like every year he said, like there would be a new group of

13:34.480 --> 13:38.720
people that would come in and get the first row of chairs. And then they would all become friends.

13:38.720 --> 13:42.480
And then they would move on. And like, we, if you go back through the years, you know, you

13:42.480 --> 13:47.440
definitely see like- Well, Kevin Day just, just sent me some posts. There was the

13:48.400 --> 13:53.600
Jane, like Giff of the Harmontown sticker being taken off the car. Right. And then

13:53.600 --> 14:01.600
then Jane said, enough of Harmontown nonsense. Time to find some new nonsense. Hashtag

14:01.600 --> 14:06.640
Harmon frown. Hashtag moving on. Harmon frown. Okay. Well, some negative connotation.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.920
Harmon frown. All right. Well, Jane, if you're listening, first of all, busted.

14:13.280 --> 14:17.920
But, and second of all, as we're learning from so many of our, our sisters,

14:17.920 --> 14:23.680
um, step, you got to step forward, speak up and say what happened to you so that it can be addressed.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.320
We can't, we can't, if something bad happened, um, and you want us to talk about it,

14:29.440 --> 14:33.280
then the first step is you got to, you can't, you can't communicate with animated gifts.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.800
The fact that she was texting me friendly like today makes me think that there's no,

14:36.800 --> 14:44.720
no harm done or like no sour, you know, apples. But, um, also leaving Harmontown isn't a bad thing.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.880
Like, like you, there's no reason why you should always listen to this. I think, I think saying

14:48.880 --> 14:54.720
Harmon frown is a bad thing. Harmon frown. Yeah. You got to turn that Harmon frown upside down.

14:54.720 --> 15:00.560
All right. Because P is yellow and poop is brown. Uh, yeah. On the off chance that the

15:00.560 --> 15:05.920
offense was a lack of attention, um, we are now participating in an unhealthy syndrome. So let's

15:05.920 --> 15:12.000
move on. All right. Uh, what else is going on? How's Spencer's new car? I wish he was here to

15:12.000 --> 15:17.840
talk about it, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts about it. Uh, Spencer got a Honda CRV.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.160
And it's, yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't really have anything to say about it. I mean,

15:22.160 --> 15:25.360
if Spencer was here, it'd be funny to talk about it. Didn't he already have one or he'd afford

15:25.360 --> 15:29.760
something rather, right? He had a, what was that thing? It was, it was as iconic as the mystery

15:29.760 --> 15:35.680
machine. It was just so Spencer. I don't even know this. I don't know. It was purple and it was,

15:35.680 --> 15:41.520
and it was, you know, it was infused with pot. When you get, when you get your, your,

15:41.520 --> 15:44.880
because you've been talking to Dan, sometimes you talk about how rich you are. And then lately

15:44.880 --> 15:48.800
you've been saying that you're, you're broke or pretty broke, but then you're going to get this

15:48.800 --> 15:55.120
Rick and Morty fortune that's coming. I'll be rich. I will soon be rich. I might even, like,

15:55.120 --> 15:59.120
I'll make a pitch and I might even help you out on this one because I want this to be a thing.

15:59.120 --> 16:04.400
Can we get Spencer like, like a mystery machine? Like, can we get him an airbrushed, like Ford

16:04.400 --> 16:11.520
O'Connor line van with bubble windows and vikings and dragons. Why are we, why is there, why are

16:11.520 --> 16:16.000
you campaigning to get the guy who just got a brand new car? I'm saying we could step up his,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.920
we could step up that Spencer game a little bit. What about stepping up my game? He just,

16:19.920 --> 16:25.200
Levy just got an Audi. Then now Spencer's got a CRV. Spencer drives me to work every day. I have

16:25.200 --> 16:30.960
no car. I got a bicycle. But you don't want a car. I don't, I don't need one. I do want one. You

16:30.960 --> 16:36.240
don't, you do. I need my next car to be a Tesla, which I cannot afford. So I'm waiting.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.320
Why don't we, didn't you meet Elon Musk or what's his name? Yeah, but I wanted to be

16:41.520 --> 16:45.120
different and not ask him for a Tesla. Okay, here's my new pitch. Since you're,

16:45.120 --> 16:53.680
since your buddy is with the scientific famous people, have him make you a hybrid van or an

16:53.680 --> 17:02.320
electronic like e-van? I mean, somebody suggested that I ask Elon, my friend, first name basis,

17:04.080 --> 17:09.040
to make me a dedicated hyperloop from my home to work. That makes sense. What's a hyperloop?

17:09.680 --> 17:16.960
It's a, it's a, it's an imaginary L train for rich people. That you just go zip zip. It's super

17:16.960 --> 17:21.520
fast. Just from like, it's one of his many dreams. Right. Because I always said like,

17:21.520 --> 17:25.920
I, the only reason people want to live up in the hills and the Hollywood Hills, you know,

17:25.920 --> 17:29.760
but like, what if you forgot your wallet? You got to drive all the way back up there. It's a

17:29.760 --> 17:34.320
nightmare. But if you did live up there and you were like Drew Carey money or, you know,

17:34.320 --> 17:41.120
Sam Simon money, you're up living at the top of Mulholland Drive, you get a zipline to the three

17:41.120 --> 17:47.280
places that you like to go. Did we talk, did we talk about this once? Or ski lifts? No, you

17:47.280 --> 17:52.800
fucking have a system of ski lifts where you just get in a chair and go to wherever your job is,

17:52.800 --> 17:59.120
go back to like, up to your house. Little Dom's drawing room. You have a, you have a, like a

17:59.120 --> 18:04.000
four ski lift system. Every boy you get, you get, you get a number of ziplines that are proportional

18:04.000 --> 18:09.120
to your financial bandwidth, contribution to society, whatever metric you want to promote.

18:09.120 --> 18:14.640
And then, and so I'm a five zipliner. So I get five. It's like having a fast travel. If I, if I,

18:14.640 --> 18:20.480
if I just had a slow ski lift from the drawing room to back to my place, that would be worth

18:20.480 --> 18:23.920
its weight in gold. Well, kind of what you're talking about. Would you die though? Huh? Because

18:23.920 --> 18:30.480
you just be drinking all the time. I do it anyway. I'm still here. But I might die in a lift going

18:30.480 --> 18:34.800
back and forth. Also, there's like liquor in our houses. We're grown men. Yeah. Like we're not.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.640
I don't really have intervention. I almost never have actual liquor in my place. Once in a while,

18:38.640 --> 18:43.680
like if it's a gift, I like to go out to drink. Well, yeah, I don't drink, I don't drink at home

18:43.680 --> 18:47.680
unless I'm with someone else. Right. We talked about the ziplines. It was years ago as our

18:47.680 --> 18:53.440
UCB show in New York when we were doing the Great Minds pilot. Oh. And you guys were on

18:53.440 --> 19:02.480
Absooth and Spencer was back when Jane was our friend. Yeah. Yeah. The zip. Yeah. Yeah. I know

19:02.480 --> 19:07.360
we talked about the zipline thing was it was it was a podcast episode. But I'm upgrading zipline

19:07.360 --> 19:11.680
to ski lift because I don't want to have to do like hold on to shit. Why don't you just get

19:11.680 --> 19:18.080
why don't you just be like the old lady in gremlins and take a take a fancy stair chair lift

19:19.040 --> 19:25.040
the stair. We'll just make Los Angeles like the Winchester mansion and where those stairs go.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.600
They don't really go anywhere. That's just when Jeff needs to get to Glendale.

19:30.480 --> 19:34.640
But it's but I just got a bike, which is kind of like a kind of like the healthy version. You

19:34.640 --> 19:39.600
looked really good on that. I'll tell you what, man, from where we live, if you take a if you get

19:39.600 --> 19:44.000
on the bike and go down to Sunset Junction, which is what we did. And I had a then you're fucked.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.920
You got to go uphill. I know. But I'm saying like the zipline, you'd be fucked too. That's why

19:47.920 --> 19:53.920
ski lifts ski lift one direction. Yeah. It was a great to create a wonderful experience. I was

19:53.920 --> 19:58.000
like, I can't believe what if you had one direction, the band actually just carry you like on a

19:58.000 --> 20:07.600
litter. You just like Schrab now. Just connecting dots. If you really had money and you could afford

20:07.600 --> 20:11.920
at some point, everyone has their price. You could get one direction to carry you like on

20:11.920 --> 20:16.960
their shoulders to places if you really, really had the dough. I don't know why you would do that.

20:16.960 --> 20:22.720
I worked with them once. Yeah. On iCarly. All right. Yeah, they only showed up for a shoot day.

20:22.720 --> 20:28.640
So I was a stand in for, I believe it was Zane. And I had to learn their song and it was before

20:28.640 --> 20:34.080
they got big, like in the United States. And so like during run throughs, I'd have to sing that

20:34.080 --> 20:41.120
song in front of all the Nick execs. Can you give us a little piece of it? Give me a little bit.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.880
Church, what has that song go that that's what makes you beautiful? It's like the,

20:44.880 --> 20:52.240
what's the hook? Nope. All right. It was like, that's what makes you beautiful. I don't remember

20:52.240 --> 20:57.840
the, I don't remember the words. I honestly don't. I try to forget. I don't even know what anyone's

20:57.840 --> 21:05.120
talking about because I'm just thinking about Elon Musk is beautiful, tall, worked out, masculine,

21:05.120 --> 21:08.080
intelligent frame. What was it good in those pictures? What was the circumstance that you

21:08.080 --> 21:12.080
guys met each other? I leave town for four days and you're hanging out with Elon Musk.

21:12.080 --> 21:18.960
Yeah. I thought, you know, I, he's got, he's got kids and those kids are at that Rick and Morty age.

21:20.320 --> 21:24.080
Griffin and, or wait, no, wait, I don't know if his kids, I don't know. Griffin? Well, you don't

21:24.080 --> 21:28.080
name your kid Griffin. It's a fucking horrible monster. You're not fucking with my friends,

21:28.080 --> 21:34.320
children. Wait, the Griffin isn't that horrifying. Well, I stopped myself. I don't know. I don't

21:34.320 --> 21:37.760
know what the rule is with Billionaires. If their kids' names aren't public or something.

21:39.040 --> 21:44.160
I'm kidding. I pretend I'm kidding. Strike his name from, I don't know. Did I dox one of his kids

21:44.160 --> 21:47.040
or something? Is that actually his name or are you just like, through a name? No, it's not.

21:49.040 --> 21:53.760
His daughter Chimera, his son Gorgon. I don't know what the rules are with people's kids.

21:53.760 --> 21:58.240
You know, like Adam Savage had a, I was hanging out with him and his kid at Comic-Con. I took a

21:58.240 --> 22:03.680
picture of him. I tweeted it. And then a lot of Adam Savage fans that know him better were like,

22:03.680 --> 22:08.640
he doesn't, his kid is not, his kid is off limits. He doesn't want people tweeting pictures and

22:09.680 --> 22:16.480
his kid is actually a myth. So I put the, so I took the picture down and Adam texted me and said,

22:16.480 --> 22:19.920
yeah, but he just turned 18. He's his own man now. He'd love, he'd love for you to,

22:19.920 --> 22:26.160
so my point is everybody's got their own rules, you know, like which, and who are we too. So then

22:26.160 --> 22:32.800
I caught myself. I'm like, I don't know if my friend Elon Musk, my new best friend. I can only

22:32.800 --> 22:37.360
speak for myself. He's my new best friend. I can't like name his kids. How did you guys, because

22:37.360 --> 22:42.720
of Rick and Morty? Okay. Here's the story. McMahon, he tweeted at the Rick and Morty account,

22:42.720 --> 22:46.560
I believe, responding to something McMahon had written. And then they had like a fun

22:46.560 --> 22:55.520
conversation about simulations back and forth. And then his assistant reached out to us to set

22:55.520 --> 22:58.960
up. So now we're in contact with his assistant. And I think, you know, I didn't want to push,

22:58.960 --> 23:05.120
I didn't want to smother. I was thinking like, be a, be a delicate, cool dude, sit down, have some

23:05.120 --> 23:11.280
chicken with him. Talk to him about a couple of things. Justin did the voice for the kids.

23:11.280 --> 23:16.880
Did you mean just, is a new toddler daughter, Medusa? Come on.

23:16.880 --> 23:21.280
Ignoring. I'm not going to let you threaten my new friendship. You two are going to get along.

23:21.280 --> 23:26.240
I'm jealous. I want to, I met Adam Savage through you and I was very excited. And he was walking

23:26.240 --> 23:33.120
around Comic Con in New York with a Neanderthal, Neanderthal femur, which is hard to say. He had

23:33.120 --> 23:37.360
a femur with him. Just a leg. And he was saying it was going to be part of his costume. But he

23:37.360 --> 23:40.720
wasn't wearing the costume. He was carrying it around like a beat stick. But he's famous for

23:40.720 --> 23:44.720
these like incredible costumes that are so extreme that you can't tell it's Adam Savage.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.800
Doesn't our friend Ryan Nagata make some of that shit for him? Like the space outfits and stuff?

23:48.800 --> 23:53.520
I didn't know that, but I'm not. I think he does. He made like a full on NASA space outfit.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.240
I think they call them space outfits. But I'm going to give it, I'm going to give it a couple

23:58.240 --> 24:05.200
weeks. Let it cool. You know, not to play these like red pill dating rules, but you know, not seem

24:05.200 --> 24:11.280
desperate. Then we reach out to the assistant. Would Elon like to come on Harvintown? Just have

24:11.280 --> 24:16.400
a chat. Oh, okay. He seems like, I don't know, I don't know how available he is. But in the

24:16.400 --> 24:22.560
answer, if the answer is, oh no, he does podcasts all the time. Then I'm like, all right, final,

24:22.560 --> 24:29.200
will he do ours too? But if the answer is, he never does them. He never does them. Then I'm like,

24:29.920 --> 24:34.960
okay, cool, but maybe he'll do ours. Because then I've beaten Merit.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.960
And you know we do. I've beaten Merit. Because, because, because presidents are just schmucks,

24:38.960 --> 24:45.680
the four year parasites, billionaire philanthropist effect. This guy's a historical figure. It's

24:45.680 --> 24:49.680
like having Howard Hughes on your show. Yeah, it's like Einstein. It's like having Howard Hughes on

24:49.680 --> 24:55.200
your show. And it's like having Howard Hughes on Howard Hughes's show. Dan is pointing at himself

24:55.200 --> 25:01.280
with two thumbs right now. In case you didn't want to spend $5 on this. What am I if not the

25:01.280 --> 25:07.200
Elon Musk of stupid people, you know? Like I like, it's like, it would be a historical event for

25:07.200 --> 25:12.000
him to come on the show and have a chat. And from the brief little, you know, conversations I had

25:12.000 --> 25:15.680
with him, I just think it would be a really fun conversation because a couple things that I'm

25:15.680 --> 25:22.880
really stoked about. My new friend, he likes all the same video games I do. He's like so into like

25:22.880 --> 25:27.120
the Bethesda stuff, the fallout and stuff. He even just talking to him about Fallout 4 made me

25:27.120 --> 25:35.280
want to go play Fallout 4 again. And also, I really, without over sharing, because I want him to know

25:35.280 --> 25:38.640
when it gets back to him, you know, being friends with Dan Harmon isn't going to put you at risk of

25:38.640 --> 25:47.280
any over, what do you call it, leaking, over sharing, over, you know, he's not going to Chevy

25:47.280 --> 25:53.040
Chase you, you know? He's a very private guy. You can have a very discreet friendship with your

25:53.040 --> 25:56.640
new friend, Dan Harmon. How does he know that you're not going to Chevy Chase him?

25:56.640 --> 26:01.280
That's what I'm saying. I was using the verb Chevy Chase to mean what I did to Chevy, which is

26:01.280 --> 26:06.080
like air, like, like, like play his voicemail. I got you. Ilan can leave me a voicemail saying

26:06.080 --> 26:14.560
like, oh, so I don't really, um, am I having trouble with this mountain, mountain digging

26:14.560 --> 26:19.280
machine? I just need your help. And I know you play a lot of Minecraft. And I'll like call,

26:19.280 --> 26:24.800
I'm not going to tell the audience, oh, guess what's going on? Like, because that'll ruin it,

26:24.800 --> 26:33.680
you know? He's a, but, but, uh, so what was my point? Oh, without, without over, uh, sharing,

26:33.680 --> 26:40.560
I just want to say about my new best friend, Ilan Musk, that I really liked one thing about

26:40.560 --> 26:45.600
him in particular, from an emotional, like spiritual perspective is like, during the

26:45.600 --> 26:51.280
conversation, we briefly touched on an area of where he was like, he was, he was explaining,

26:51.280 --> 26:55.920
there was a, there was a guy, basically he didn't like, there was a guy whose point of view he

26:55.920 --> 27:00.800
didn't write. He thought was, uh, as he called it, very dangerous. We were talking about the AI

27:00.800 --> 27:04.080
thing. And then he was talking about the guy. And I really liked the fact that he was like,

27:04.800 --> 27:12.080
like simultaneously, totally adamant. No, totally adamant about, uh, uh, like how this guy is like

27:12.080 --> 27:17.200
so, so his thinking is so dangerous. And he's, but also like, he never called the guy an idiot.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.680
He didn't like dismiss him because the guy is dangerous. Like he, you know, it's like that cool

27:21.680 --> 27:27.360
kind of like, he was like a general, like observing, like, you know, this guy has got a lot of popular

27:27.360 --> 27:33.760
thoughts about this, the direction of this technology. And that guy is like, he's a dangerous

27:33.760 --> 27:39.200
thinker. And when he, when he kind of enumerated the things that were dangerous about this person,

27:39.200 --> 27:43.440
he was all rooted in honesty. He was like, he was like, this guy's good at this, this, this,

27:43.440 --> 27:47.360
and that. And all of those things that have in common, they're all, they're all about deception.

27:47.360 --> 27:53.120
They're all about manipulation. Like, and I really, you know, that's, that's why we're going to be

27:53.120 --> 28:02.000
like fucking capital B, capital F, capital Fs. It's because we were like, you know, and, and,

28:02.000 --> 28:06.800
but, but like, it'll be like you, me and, you know, big, big, big fat fuckers.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.880
You're gonna get along with him. I'm jealous. I want to meet him.

28:10.880 --> 28:15.520
Well, you, you go like, don't fucking up again. You're, you're making, you're making it sound

28:15.520 --> 28:19.600
like you're going to steal Elon Musk away from the world and you guys are going to go live on a

28:19.600 --> 28:24.800
little beach together. No, no, no, no. You would, you want to. I was reading this article, he just,

28:25.360 --> 28:30.800
so Tesla's have the automated driving systems and apparently insurance companies hike up

28:30.800 --> 28:37.120
premiums on Tesla's. So they created their own and like ensure they've done it internationally,

28:37.120 --> 28:40.960
but are now starting to do it. They paired up with Liberty Mutual, I think, to offer

28:42.320 --> 28:49.520
cheaper insurance because self-driving cars are, I guess, statistically safer than regular cars.

28:49.520 --> 28:55.920
So the insurance premium shouldn't be raised. They should be lowered. And as our society moves

28:55.920 --> 29:00.400
closer and closer to having all self-driving cars, it's going to, the insurance companies are going

29:00.400 --> 29:07.120
to take a massive hit because drivers will be much safer. They'll be all automated.

29:07.120 --> 29:11.520
Is it Liberty, is it Liberty insurance that there's always some assholes sitting having a

29:11.520 --> 29:15.440
coffee in front of the statue of Liberty? Yeah. And they say some really dumb stuff.

29:15.440 --> 29:20.320
You just bought a car and then you drove it into a tree. But guess what? That wasn't the smartest

29:20.320 --> 29:25.360
thing you ever did. And now they want to know, it's like, fuck you. Like, I'm just trying to watch

29:25.360 --> 29:30.720
news. Insurance has to be one of the, yeah. That's like the dorsal fin on the shark of

29:32.160 --> 29:37.840
capitalism. Like, it's like, no, that's not a good metaphor because the dorsal fin just warns

29:37.840 --> 29:46.320
you that it's there. It's like, it's the ridge on the Rhodesian ridgeback. It's where it hits

29:46.320 --> 29:52.720
its worst, isn't it? You go from just regular capitalism, which is arguably like, look,

29:52.720 --> 29:56.800
it's going to happen anyway. People are going to trade favors. They're going to trade boots for

29:56.800 --> 30:01.200
chickens. So when we really knuckled down and said, look, let's create poker chips and we can

30:01.200 --> 30:05.760
like, but then you go from that to banking, which is, oh, I'll watch your money while you're gone.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.680
And can I give your money to other people, but only theoretically, and then when I hold it,

30:09.680 --> 30:12.880
they hold it, and then you hold it, hold it, and then I ensure the holdings and then without

30:12.880 --> 30:16.320
like, okay, it starts to get really sketchy. Then it goes to corporations, which are like,

30:16.320 --> 30:20.160
okay, well, this isn't really a person. This is just a company. It's a group of people and it'll

30:20.160 --> 30:24.160
actually live longer than the people that started it. And it also has an interest in

30:24.160 --> 30:31.040
politically. But the real height of it all, the biggest evil of all is where it's indistinguishable

30:31.040 --> 30:36.320
from organized crime. When people are coming to your home and saying, it would be a pity for

30:36.320 --> 30:41.040
something to happen to this fucking house, wouldn't it? It would be really bad. You love your kids,

30:41.040 --> 30:45.760
don't you? Sure would hate to see them die. Sure would, but they'd hate to see you die.

30:45.760 --> 30:51.040
Hate to see you break your kneecaps at Liberty Mutual. Like, when you get your kneecaps broken,

30:51.040 --> 30:57.040
your kids don't have to, you know, starve to death. Yeah, just give me $200 a month and I'll

30:57.040 --> 31:02.240
make sure that the inevitable doesn't happen. And it really, I mean, the worst, people think I'm

31:02.240 --> 31:06.960
kidding when I tell this anecdote. This is like, this is now a decades old thing. I definitely

31:06.960 --> 31:13.600
know I've talked about this before in the podcast, but whatever. I got, when I was living in my

31:13.600 --> 31:17.920
apartment, I remember like, I was like, it was part of my, I was just like, I was like 27,

31:17.920 --> 31:24.560
and I was like, I'm out. I'm out of society. I can't do this anymore. I got an envelope

31:24.560 --> 31:29.920
from an insurance company in my mailbox, and there was a photo of Christopher Reeves on it,

31:29.920 --> 31:37.840
who wasn't dead yet, who had just sustained a horrible crippling injury. And it was a photo

31:37.840 --> 31:44.960
of him all fucked up, not as Superman, all fucked up. And, and there was a quote underneath it

31:46.880 --> 31:53.680
that said, don't let what happened to me happen to you. Make sure you're loved. Make sure you're

31:53.680 --> 31:59.600
insured so that you're loved. I was like, what the fucking if this was a Polaroid, you'd be a

31:59.600 --> 32:08.320
mafioso. Like, what the fuck is going on? This is extortion. Anyways. And then you, you'd look

32:08.320 --> 32:14.080
outside and there's a horse. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's just like, it's insane. It's like, it's like,

32:14.080 --> 32:17.280
oh, and so you're listening and then you're gonna, you're gonna get on your little keyboard and you're

32:17.280 --> 32:22.480
gonna go, oh, I got the donut crumbs on my face and the tears are mixing with it and it's making

32:22.480 --> 32:28.400
me extra briny. So I'm gonna take Dan Harmon to task with my slide rule and my, because I just

32:28.400 --> 32:33.280
like arguing with things. And if I argue with the president, he doesn't listen. So I'm gonna argue

32:33.280 --> 32:37.280
with Dan Harmon. So you're gonna typey type type. And here's what you're gonna say. So you're gonna,

32:37.280 --> 32:42.400
you're gonna use logic to say something about how, oh, that extreme thing that I said isn't

32:42.400 --> 32:49.360
technically true. Well, that's fantastic. You win. You're right. I didn't do any research.

32:49.360 --> 32:54.320
I didn't get a degree in this. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You proved me wrong.

32:54.320 --> 32:59.040
But I said it. You're drinking out of a glass by somebody that doesn't even listen to our show

32:59.040 --> 33:04.080
anymore. That's right. I'm an, I'm what they call an edge lord on Twitter. Someone signed me up for

33:04.080 --> 33:08.320
like some, I don't know, they've been coming after me. I'm getting these letters in the mail,

33:08.320 --> 33:18.800
like that I should reserve my, my plot in the ground and or my, like, like my ash canister

33:18.800 --> 33:25.440
or something. Like just take care of it now so that your loved ones don't have to. And every month

33:25.440 --> 33:31.040
I get these letters from some service in like Studio City or something. There's a picture of

33:31.040 --> 33:38.640
like a 29 year old guy with two chicks next to him. And it's like, Dale, Dale has planned his

33:38.640 --> 33:46.000
estate early. Like that's sexy. Like that's like a, yeah. Nothing turns on the ladies,

33:46.000 --> 33:54.000
like a reserved urn. It's never too early. If he cares that much about his own death,

33:54.000 --> 34:01.280
he's thinking about me. He's taking the burden off of my shoulders. I'm going to give him

34:01.280 --> 34:06.240
the best handjob of his life. And he's going to go down on me because he's thinking about the

34:06.240 --> 34:13.280
future. And if he dies, guess what? Everyone's a winner. Nothing, nothing. Wait, what did you say

34:13.280 --> 34:20.800
again? Nothing turns on the ladies like a reserved urn. Yeah, you have it out there. Just have it

34:20.800 --> 34:25.200
like, it's the first thing you see when you come into my apartment. I love the alliteration of

34:25.200 --> 34:33.200
reserved urn. Because it's like, it's also, it sounds like, like, it sounds wormy. Reserved urn.

34:33.200 --> 34:38.160
You know, it's like, it's like, it's nothing. It's the opposite of like, okay, so, hey, can you

34:38.160 --> 34:42.880
hand me some of those sandbags? I'm trying to help these flood victims here. Just a moment,

34:42.880 --> 34:54.480
I'm, I'm reserving an urn. Ooh, la la. This is stupid, but you were talking about capitalism.

34:54.480 --> 35:01.760
What do you think in the boots versus chickens economy? What, what, what is worth more? Like,

35:01.760 --> 35:06.640
how many boots per chicken or how many chickens per boot? Oh, I would say just going from everything

35:06.640 --> 35:11.600
I know about nature, I learned from Minecraft, I would say boots would require a great deal of

35:11.600 --> 35:17.680
crafting. Right. And a chicken is just, it's just running around. Okay. Yeah. You could use a chicken

35:17.680 --> 35:20.960
to make a boot, but you're going to need a bunch of chicken. Let's say I've got a nice pair of some

35:20.960 --> 35:25.040
labor. Let's say, no, let's say, let's say you've got a nice pair of boots that are my size. And

35:25.040 --> 35:29.200
how many chickens do you want for those nice pair of boots that you spent a good deal of labor on?

35:30.160 --> 35:34.400
Well, then we get into how many chickens do you have? Because it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,

35:34.400 --> 35:38.800
it's a seller's market. I need these boots. How many chickens are you going to make me give you?

35:38.800 --> 35:42.640
But our chickens, how many eggs do your chickens lay? Huh? Regular amount.

35:44.720 --> 35:49.840
Are they in an, are they in abundance? Like, you're going to fucking, I mean, what? I'm going to what?

35:49.840 --> 35:56.160
Bend you over a barrel? Welcome to, welcome to ancient Greece. They lay the most eggs. Okay, well

35:56.160 --> 35:59.920
good. Then that's going to lower your chicken number. Aren't you happy about that? I'm doing

35:59.920 --> 36:03.200
you a favor. Look, I got to talk to my manager. Let's see if we can finance these boots. Look,

36:03.200 --> 36:07.680
I got to get these boots. I got an appointment. Let's say I talk to my manager and it's like,

36:07.680 --> 36:12.480
it's looking really good. Like your chicken rating is high because it's great because if your chickens

36:12.480 --> 36:17.280
lay eggs, then an egg is essentially a chicken. You know? An egg just got laid while you were

36:17.280 --> 36:20.880
having this conversation. That's great. It's a great sign. What are these boots made of? I want

36:20.880 --> 36:25.600
to put you in a pair of boots right now. Given how many chickens do you want? Well, it's just that

36:25.600 --> 36:31.360
these boots that you're looking at right here, these are our VIP boots. Okay. Like, I don't,

36:31.360 --> 36:35.200
I want the best boots you have. I just want to look, I just want to put you, I just want to see

36:35.200 --> 36:40.480
you walking out of here. I'm lousy with chickens. I don't have a chicken shortage, but here's the

36:40.480 --> 36:45.920
thing. These are valuable to me because I can apparently trade them for all sorts of services

36:45.920 --> 36:50.800
and goods. Yeah. Yeah. I want to see you in these boots, but here's the thing. You know,

36:50.800 --> 36:54.720
they're going to depreciate in value. Okay. As soon as you walk off the lot. Right. And they're

36:54.720 --> 36:59.200
made to your foot. And I don't care about the resale value of these boots. I just need boots

36:59.200 --> 37:03.600
to last me through the year. Let me just put, let me just put you in a pair of boots that's

37:03.600 --> 37:07.040
in your, within your, your, your bracket. Because you're, you're in my chicken range.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.560
You don't have the chicken credit to like have these other boots that you are looking at.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.800
Okay. Two chickens. These boots here. I'll give you, I'll give you two chickens for these boots.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.280
Oh, if you're going to give us two chickens, I can show you the two chicken boots.

37:21.040 --> 37:26.080
I'm, look, again, I have an appointment. How many chickens do you want for these boots? Because

37:26.080 --> 37:31.440
the more I look at them, oh, I just tried one on. These are, these are lovely. Yeah, they should

37:31.440 --> 37:37.440
be. Those are 17 chicken boots. Whoa. Okay. Well, that's, that explains the comfort.

37:38.720 --> 37:44.000
I take off that boot and I go, it's nice almost doing business with you. And I leave with my

37:44.000 --> 37:50.480
18 chickens. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I, I, I, I get on my,

37:51.840 --> 37:58.320
in this story, do we have cell phone technology yet? Or do I get on my cell phone and I say,

37:58.320 --> 38:05.200
Siri, where, where can they get a nice pair of boots for eight chickens? And, and Siri says,

38:05.200 --> 38:11.040
I'm playing Phil Collins in the air tonight. That never works. Okay. I come back and look,

38:11.040 --> 38:15.360
I am in a hurry. I'll give you 10 chickens. I'll give you 10 right now. 10 chickens,

38:15.360 --> 38:21.600
10 chickens, eight for these 17 chicken boots. Yeah. But I'll walk out with them right now. I'm

38:21.600 --> 38:27.120
a size 14. These are size 14. But the odds of someone else walking in here with size 14 feet

38:27.120 --> 38:30.800
and has 17 chickens to give you? Sir, I think you got the wrong idea about the chicken cave,

38:30.800 --> 38:37.280
a boot cave. Like, we're not, we're not hagglers. What you do here is we provide a service. We try

38:37.280 --> 38:41.600
to put people that don't have boots into boots and it costs a certain amount to create those boots.

38:41.600 --> 38:46.720
And we just, we're essentially like a co-op. All right. So you hide, you hide balled me at 17.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.800
I lobald you at 10. Let's do business here. I disagree. I mean, you're looking at it from

38:50.800 --> 38:54.800
that perspective. I'm just looking at it from a guy that's like, if you have 10 chickens to spend,

38:54.800 --> 38:58.480
I can show you the 10 chicken boots. There's another egg. Another egg just came out. I mean,

38:58.480 --> 39:03.520
these chickens are just, they're egg factories. Can I, can I- Do you know what eggs are?

39:03.520 --> 39:08.640
Future chickens. Yeah, I don't. Yes, they're not. That's why they were part of your credit rating.

39:08.640 --> 39:15.680
Yes, yes. I want like fecund chicken. They're fecund as fuck. Fecund AF chicken.

39:17.520 --> 39:22.800
I have, have you considered, before we go any further, like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put you in

39:22.800 --> 39:27.760
a pair of 10 chicken boots. Don't want your 10 chicken boots. But I want you to-

39:27.760 --> 39:32.160
You can't walk me back from 17 chicken boots to 10 chicken boots. So the 10 chicken boots aren't

39:32.160 --> 39:35.920
good enough for you, but that's the amount of chickens you want to give for 17 chicken boots?

39:35.920 --> 39:39.120
I think, I think you're trying to rip me off here. Well, that's insane. That's a projection

39:39.120 --> 39:44.160
that you came into this cave with. I'm saying, look, this is a big city. I, there's, there's

39:44.160 --> 39:48.880
ether boot makers out here. And I, and some people like to do business. It's a loose knit,

39:48.880 --> 39:55.120
a network of caves in a world cell phone. If you think the next thing I'm gonna say is here,

39:55.120 --> 39:59.840
how about 14 chickens? You're out of your fucking mind. You started at 17. I went to 10. Now you

39:59.840 --> 40:04.160
make another offer. Have you even experienced me going up or down on any of my offers? As far as

40:04.160 --> 40:09.760
you know, I'm monolithic in my chicken boot. Well, like monoliths. I haven't hangled with you, sir.

40:09.760 --> 40:14.720
I'm not a dishonest person. Well, a monolithic business model is not a, is not a viable one.

40:14.720 --> 40:19.440
It's, you have to be able to move. Maybe, maybe what you're interested in is tiny boots for your

40:19.440 --> 40:24.160
chickens. They're over here in the women's section. Oh, see, now you're being, now that you, I don't

40:24.160 --> 40:27.440
know what you got from that, sir. I'm just trying to help you. Really? We have a wonderful

40:27.440 --> 40:32.560
section over here for all the women. So women, women, women wear tiny chicken boots. No, they just

40:32.560 --> 40:37.520
like to dress the chickens. You know, it's a more affordable hobby. It kills the time. I, now I

40:37.520 --> 40:41.120
don't want, as you know, women, I want these boots less and less one. Now that I know your

40:41.120 --> 40:49.120
politics. Oh, sir, I, my, my only politics are a, a bootless foot. And that women hating.

40:49.120 --> 40:54.080
It, no, sir, no. Diminished women. Okay, okay. We love women. How about 17 chickens? Who the

40:54.080 --> 41:00.480
fuck is this guy? This is Andre. Oh, Jesus Christ. Hey, I'm Andre. Hi, Andre. Hi. Look,

41:00.480 --> 41:05.440
I'm trying to get these boots. 17 seems high. 17 seems like a lot of chickens. Then buy the 10

41:05.440 --> 41:09.040
chicken boots. I don't want the 10 chicken boots. They look like shit. Shouldn't have even put them

41:09.040 --> 41:13.920
out. Look, I wouldn't pay 10 chicken, 10 chickens for those 10 chicken boots. Right. You'd probably

41:13.920 --> 41:18.000
pay four chickens for 10 chicken boots. I get your, I get your gist, sir. You're someone that

41:18.000 --> 41:21.840
thinks that they're entitled to more. Do you know what, do you, do you, have you ever raised a

41:21.840 --> 41:26.240
chicken? Do you know what it, what it takes? Do you know that the amount of, amount of care, TLC,

41:27.360 --> 41:32.800
husbandry goes into proper chicken raising? No, sir. Another egg, another egg. You're already

41:32.800 --> 41:36.000
down three chickens right now, by the way. If I walk out here right now, you just have three more

41:36.000 --> 41:40.160
chickens. These are all fertilized eggs popping out of my chickens right now. Oh, I see what you're

41:40.160 --> 41:46.320
saying. Yeah. The longer we talk about this, the less chickens you're getting. Okay. I'm not giving

41:46.320 --> 41:51.360
you these fertilized eggs and 17 chickens. How about this? What about this? 10 chickens, three eggs.

41:53.440 --> 41:58.880
But you got to raise the eggs. You got to, you have to incubate and take care of those young

41:58.880 --> 42:03.520
baby chicks. That's not a service you provide people that have eggs. People don't come to you

42:03.520 --> 42:09.280
with eggs. Sir, I'm here for boots. Well, if I'm getting into the business of chicken, egg owning.

42:09.280 --> 42:14.960
How about this? Okay, look, you give me an idea. What if you and I go into business together?

42:17.120 --> 42:22.880
It's kind of an anarcho-syndicalist idea. You, you give me some boots. Occasionally,

42:23.680 --> 42:30.000
you get all the chickens you want. You get eggs when you need them. Together, we corner a society

42:30.000 --> 42:37.680
that is basically boot and chicken-based. Yes. There's like, and we stop this idea that boots

42:38.640 --> 42:42.080
and chickens are worth more or less than it should. We enter the idea that power

42:42.080 --> 42:47.120
is for sale. See, now again, we own it. Well, you're making it, this seems more fun.

42:47.120 --> 42:51.760
Wait, you drew me out into it. I thought you were... No, I'm talking about, I'm talking about

42:51.760 --> 42:58.480
mutual benefits, like, you know, like, like, you know... Yeah, yeah, I like that too. You don't

42:58.480 --> 43:03.680
like power? I'm gonna go down to another bootstrap. Look, if you have power, you can use it to create

43:03.680 --> 43:08.720
communism, like, don't you want power? I can do lots of things with power. How long do you open?

43:08.720 --> 43:13.440
I'm gonna go check out a couple bootchops and maybe I'll come back. 9 p.m. 9 p.m. Andre,

43:14.080 --> 43:21.440
you're not helping. What else you got besides chickens? Andre, what are you doing this afternoon?

43:21.440 --> 43:29.280
I'm working. 10 chickens says you're my new assistant.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.600
What the... You're gonna give me 10 chickens to be your assistant?

43:32.160 --> 43:35.680
How about this? I'm gonna give you 10 chickens just to have lunch with me and hear me out.

43:35.680 --> 43:40.480
What? The fuck you could have had? That means I could buy the 10 chicken boots?

43:40.480 --> 43:46.480
Motherfucker, I'm made of chickens. I'm just a businessman. You don't get this many chickens

43:46.480 --> 43:52.480
given 17 chickens. We have every boot manufacturer you walk by. I like Andre. I like your style.

43:52.480 --> 43:58.560
You got a deal. I'll have lunch with you for 10 chickens. Okay. Andre, after he's done peacocking

43:58.560 --> 44:03.040
at this lunch and you come back because there's nothing substantial about the game he's running,

44:03.840 --> 44:08.880
you don't have a job. Well, that's okay because then I'm gonna use the chickens to raise more

44:08.880 --> 44:13.840
chickens and then I'm gonna buy those 17 chicken boots. Andre, what have I always told you?

44:13.840 --> 44:20.000
What have I told you? Words don't cover your feet. Okay? He's doing nothing. He's got a pile

44:20.000 --> 44:24.880
of chickens. We don't even know they're his. Go, go, go to lunch. Good luck. I swear to God,

44:24.880 --> 44:30.080
man. When you come back, you are not working at this chicken cave. I'm gonna have a chicken empire

44:30.080 --> 44:38.320
and then I'm gonna buy your entire store with my chicken empire. Later at lunch, listen Andre,

44:38.320 --> 44:46.960
okay. Here's the thing. Okay. It's not about chickens. What's it about? What it about? It's

44:46.960 --> 44:54.640
about trust. There's like three cavemen playing. Cavemen? Bach. I assume this is kind of like a

44:54.640 --> 44:58.400
caveman. I know, but we have so- You said I had so- Well, because I didn't want to

44:58.960 --> 45:05.360
deny. All right, yeah. But there's like a quartet of cavemen violinists because it's a fancy cave.

45:05.360 --> 45:11.200
It's a fancy cave where you took them to lunch. It's like Sparrow's or- Okay, Sparrow's, Sparkey's.

45:11.200 --> 45:21.280
It's Sardis. We're at Sardis. I've flown you to New York and we're off Broadway.

45:21.280 --> 45:26.080
We're at Sparrow's. Yeah, we just saw Hello Dolly with Bitt Middler and we're across the street

45:26.080 --> 45:37.520
and it's four cavemen playing violin. Listen Andre. Yes. I'm not gonna be alive much longer.

45:37.520 --> 45:44.560
Oh geez. Yes, I have a rare disease that the doctors don't think I really have much longer to

45:44.560 --> 45:50.720
live, but I have to leave these chickens to somebody and I just have the sneaking feeling

45:50.720 --> 45:59.280
that you're a business acumen. Hey guys, I give each caveman a chicken to fuck off.

46:03.040 --> 46:08.720
She just ate the chickens raw. More garlic stuffed olives. I mean, Andre, I've got,

46:09.760 --> 46:14.800
I'm up to here with chickens. I've got all the chickens, but you can't take them with you.

46:14.800 --> 46:21.520
I can't. You know, I'm saying I can't take my chickens with me. I gotta leave a legacy.

46:21.520 --> 46:27.040
I gotta leave a legacy is what I'm saying. Well, what disease do you have? It's, I have

46:27.920 --> 46:34.080
Crohn's. It's not funny. I wouldn't laugh because Crohn's is funny. There's people listening

46:34.080 --> 46:37.440
that have Crohn's. That's not why I was laughing. It's terrible. It's laughing in the tone of his

46:37.440 --> 46:42.480
voice. He decided he had Crohn's. I think your boss is the kind of person that finds my Crohn's

46:42.480 --> 46:48.560
disease hilarious and he's a bad person. Crohn's is really rough. My best friend is Crohn's.

46:48.560 --> 46:54.320
He's always in pain. It ain't no fun. They cut like feet out of his intestines. Hi, how are you

46:54.320 --> 47:01.120
guys? Hello, Amber. Hi, welcome to Spaniards. Sardis. Sardis. Would you like to hear some of

47:01.120 --> 47:07.440
our specials? Sure. Okay, we have a Fungili Piazza with extra mushrooms that's grilled over an

47:07.440 --> 47:12.480
octopus salad and braised in a simmering version A. We'll take two of those. We'll take two of those. Okay.

47:12.480 --> 47:16.320
There's more. There's also a, there's also a freeze. The Fungili sounds fantastic. Okay,

47:16.320 --> 47:20.160
all right. Two of those then and I'll, can I hook you up with any drinks or do you,

47:20.160 --> 47:23.680
you guys good with your coffees? Do you have pizza? We have a flatbread?

47:25.040 --> 47:29.840
Is that pizza? It's a Portobello flatbread. It's done with artisan flatbread, flatbread,

47:30.480 --> 47:35.600
out of flatbread, served with flat pieces of bread and Portobello. Put olives on it.

47:35.600 --> 47:43.840
We have, we have, we have suko, which is a Japanese olive substitute. It's basically the same.

47:44.480 --> 47:48.080
We'll take two of those. Okay. And then, do you want that on the side or do you want that as a

47:48.080 --> 47:53.840
top of nod on your angelica? Yes, the latter. Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll be right back.

47:53.840 --> 48:00.160
Thank you, Amber. Oh, I dropped my pen. It's getting it off the floor. I pick up the pen and I

48:00.160 --> 48:07.600
notice it has the same, it says boot cave on it. You're a, you're a fucking spy, aren't you, Amber?

48:12.240 --> 48:20.240
Boot grappling, shoelace grapple. Do this cave skylight. Chickens unite. Out from my,

48:20.240 --> 48:25.200
the valise I brought with me, 17 chickens get out and form a giant chicken Voltron

48:25.200 --> 48:35.040
and, and, and attack Amber the waitress. Well, we fight and I die. Right. But nobly.

48:35.040 --> 48:40.880
But also a lot of the chickens die. And then I wonder, you know what, at what price, boots?

48:41.760 --> 48:46.560
You could, yeah. Back at the boot cave, I'm just looking at a photo of my daughter

48:46.560 --> 48:55.360
who left me with her mother because I was too focused on my boots and I'm hearing their voices

48:55.360 --> 49:00.720
say, if you ever get your head on straight, I'll be waiting for you.

49:02.800 --> 49:06.640
Did she become a waitress at Sardis? Or is this a different person?

49:08.880 --> 49:15.360
Yes. And you can say no. You can say no. Yes or no question. Well, then I go. Yeah,

49:15.360 --> 49:21.040
no, I, I, and I, and I also, I crumbled the photo and I burst into flames because my boots,

49:22.480 --> 49:29.440
the special expensive flint boots that I made that are the sort of crowning achievement of my

49:29.440 --> 49:35.680
boot obsessed workaholic lifestyle that cost me my wife and daughter. I, while I'm fidgeting,

49:35.680 --> 49:39.680
like, because I'm thinking about packing and going to finally abandon the boot business and be with

49:39.680 --> 49:45.120
my wife and kids and the flint that my boots are made out of sparks, sets all the boot materials

49:45.120 --> 49:49.360
on fire, the whole place bursts into flames because there was no fire permit because like,

49:49.360 --> 49:56.400
you know, Andre is working on that. And I just die. I just, it just pulls back from my cave and

49:56.400 --> 50:02.320
I'm just dying and I'm dying. And then right as you die, I made the right decision. You did.

50:02.320 --> 50:09.200
And then you, right as you die, Andre comes back and sees the building on fire and he's wearing

50:09.200 --> 50:16.240
boots made of chickens, but like the nicest chicken boots of all time. And he's the master of both

50:16.240 --> 50:24.240
worlds. Well, our guest tonight on Harmontown has been waiting for a really long time. I just

50:24.240 --> 50:30.400
remembered we have a guest. Oh, I forgot. Oh, yeah. Let's bring him in. Yeah. Let's bring in,

50:31.280 --> 50:36.480
big fans of the podcast will, will, will remember this guy for sure because he directed the

50:36.480 --> 50:41.040
documentary that I produced about myself. I always have to say it in that voice.

50:42.480 --> 50:48.720
But it was his movie. He directed it. It's Neil Berkeley. Yeah. Can I move this a little bit?

50:48.720 --> 50:51.760
Yeah. Move it however you want. Oh, wow. Good to be here.

50:54.880 --> 50:57.360
I'm starting to feel like I should have worn a great t-shirt to this affair.

50:59.040 --> 51:04.880
I want to point out at the top because I'm getting self-conscious. The reason Neil's a guest

51:04.880 --> 51:09.680
isn't because he made a documentary about me. It's because that's how I know him. And I, and

51:09.680 --> 51:15.360
that's how I know he made a documentary recently about Gilbert Godfried, who also fans of the

51:15.360 --> 51:22.160
podcast will know. But fans of comedy will, will definitely know. So yeah, you just did basically,

51:22.160 --> 51:26.560
I mean, well, well, well, well, did you do the same thing with Gilbert that you did with me?

51:26.560 --> 51:30.640
Yeah, I just started showing up at his house every day. Like I moved to New York and just started

51:30.640 --> 51:34.080
living there. I'd go to his house every day at nine o'clock while he's having his coffee and I

51:34.080 --> 51:37.920
wore him down and finally got him to open up. But yeah, I just sort of like became part of his

51:37.920 --> 51:41.680
life and followed him around and went to like 15 different cities in Mexico and Toronto.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.480
How comfortable was he with you becoming part of his life?

51:44.480 --> 51:48.960
He hated it. For the first two months, he hated it. He was one of those guys that he doesn't

51:48.960 --> 51:53.280
really say no to anything. If you put something in front of him, he just does it, whatever it is.

51:53.280 --> 51:58.560
And his wife said, come over and try this. I would do it every day. And he never even dropped

51:58.560 --> 52:02.400
the character. Like he was in the voice. You met him when he's not in character. Well, I would

52:02.400 --> 52:06.720
go over there and he would talk like that in his eyes and squint. Yeah, he would do it. And then

52:06.720 --> 52:10.720
finally, I was just going over every day and he stopped doing it. Oh, really? That's really

52:10.720 --> 52:15.680
interesting. He doesn't, you know, you've met him. It'd be very awkward to be around.

52:15.680 --> 52:21.760
Yeah. I mean, that sounds a little more critical than I would say it. But you're a director,

52:21.760 --> 52:29.840
you're not an empath. But I mean, I find it fascinating. I mean, it was his, because I mean,

52:29.840 --> 52:37.280
yeah, like I grew up on Gilbert Godfried. Like, he, you know, he does that character. And, you

52:37.280 --> 52:43.440
know, but it's not quite like, it's like we're friends with Bob Goldthwaite, who would get on

52:43.440 --> 52:47.280
stage in the same era of comedy, where it was like, stand up, it's so popular, you had to have a

52:47.280 --> 52:52.640
fucking accordion or a hammer for a hat or, and there were some really funny stand-ups who,

52:53.600 --> 52:57.520
like, but it was like, look, you got to have this like character to give like, but then there's

52:57.520 --> 53:02.560
these guys, it's like, it's like, so emo Phillips, you know, is he doing a character? I've never had

53:02.560 --> 53:06.720
a conversation with him where he didn't kind of sound like the way he sounds on stage. And,

53:07.520 --> 53:13.680
and Bob Goldthwaite, there's an easy definitive line, but you only know it from talking to Bob.

53:13.680 --> 53:21.680
Bob owns that line and says, when I was doing that performance, I did that act. That's not me. I

53:21.680 --> 53:28.560
am now me as a, you know, you rely on him because otherwise you would listen to Bob and you would

53:28.560 --> 53:33.840
go, oh, you just made that sound that Bob, that screechy Bobcat Goldthwaite makes, like he makes,

53:33.840 --> 53:39.200
he does still, because how much of it is like, is, is, is, well, this is how I talk, you know,

53:39.200 --> 53:42.640
like, sometimes when I get on stage and I have to say something difficult, like I find like, I'll,

53:42.640 --> 53:51.440
like, like, like, I'll cover my eyes or like, I'll just engage in these like really arch behaviors

53:51.440 --> 53:55.760
that I know that if I step on the gas there and it's like, okay, well, then you can get through

53:55.760 --> 54:01.360
the nervousness. So I, I, you're not shocked to learn that I brought you on and then did all the

54:01.360 --> 54:05.920
talking, but this is what, this is what I imagined we would get to this eventually, but now we're

54:05.920 --> 54:12.400
like right into it. My question off of what Dan's saying is when he dropped the Gilbert character,

54:12.400 --> 54:17.920
what was he like? Like, like, what was the difference between the on character and off character?

54:17.920 --> 54:22.320
Well, most of the, he wasn't like performing, he did do for a long time, he would do like canned

54:22.320 --> 54:26.000
lines, like he would do, it was like being on a talk show with him, you know, people go on talk

54:26.000 --> 54:29.680
shows and they've got these canned lines and they know we're going to get reactions. It was a lot

54:29.680 --> 54:33.680
of that, but eventually he started talking to me about his mom, he was very close to his mom,

54:33.680 --> 54:39.440
lived with her till he was almost 40, devastated when she passed away. His sister is a photographer,

54:39.440 --> 54:45.280
she actually shot the whole process of her mother's very sad death. I talked to Gilbert about that

54:45.280 --> 54:49.120
and talked to his sister about that, talked about his father, his father died when he was 19, he had

54:49.120 --> 54:54.800
a horrible relationship with his father. What kind, I mean, first of all, what was the, let's

54:54.800 --> 54:59.360
start with the dad, what were the, why was it horrible? Horrible, horrible in that he was,

54:59.360 --> 55:03.200
he's one of those dads that was like becoming an electrician, get a job, Gilbert quit school when he

55:03.200 --> 55:07.040
was 15 and started doing comedy immediately and he would leave every night to do comedy all night

55:07.040 --> 55:11.120
and his dad just didn't get it and there were arguments and fights and then when his dad died,

55:11.120 --> 55:17.280
Gilbert, Gilbert says a lot of pain about his dad not seeing his success, which every comic

55:17.280 --> 55:22.720
I talked to. That would fucking kill me. Yeah, like I got, I don't know what I'll have, Erin,

55:22.720 --> 55:28.480
my ex-wife, a star of our documentary, she would always say to me and I know she's right,

55:28.480 --> 55:32.800
like whenever I would say like anything about my family who, like my parents didn't come to my

55:32.800 --> 55:36.640
wedding, I still don't know why, I won't ask them, like what is it? And then Erin's like,

55:36.640 --> 55:39.600
why won't you ask them why they're not coming to your wedding? I go, because that's what they want

55:39.600 --> 55:44.640
and she's like, you're fucked up, they're fucked up. And when your dad, because she lost her mom

55:44.640 --> 55:49.280
when she was 17 and she's like, and when your parents die, you're going to be super fucked up

55:49.280 --> 55:52.320
about it and you're going to make it, everyone else's problem and you need to deal with it,

55:52.320 --> 55:58.560
like I'm making her sound, I think I'm making her sound like a hero, but if you're, if that's

55:58.560 --> 56:02.480
to you making her sound like a bad person, believe me, she's not, like, like she was saying it,

56:02.480 --> 56:07.280
you know, she was like, she was telling it like it is as a person who had a, a parent pass and

56:07.280 --> 56:12.560
it's, it's sorry to derail you, but, but like, I just, I'm imagining that, like, because like,

56:12.560 --> 56:20.000
what I do have with my dad was a moment where my dad said that he was proud of me and that, and

56:20.000 --> 56:24.560
that he, and that he, he observed like, it was, it was way back in the channel 101 days, we got a

56:24.560 --> 56:30.480
VH1 pilot and that was enough, we had a, my dad said, like, we were having a celebration party

56:30.480 --> 56:34.320
because we got our show on VH1 and there was just, there was a bunch of people in a bar

56:34.320 --> 56:38.000
celebrating because we had done channel 101, we had followed our bliss, we had done it for free and

56:38.000 --> 56:44.080
now we had a television show and my dad, like, expressed to my satisfaction emotionally, like,

56:44.080 --> 56:49.040
is like, I arrived, like, my dad was like, there's a lot of people in there that are very happy

56:49.040 --> 56:52.960
because of you, and that makes me very proud of you, and I was like, okay, cool, your hotel's

56:52.960 --> 56:59.440
down the street, ran, ran, it's like, burst into a thousand tears and then, so I'm done, now I know

56:59.440 --> 57:04.720
I'm gonna be all fucked up if my dad dies, but I just wanted to interject that because the idea of

57:05.360 --> 57:13.040
being 19, which I was also like, aimlessly, by any objective, anyone that was watching me would go

57:13.040 --> 57:17.440
like, what is your fucking plan? What are you doing? You're not that funny. Why are you interested

57:17.440 --> 57:24.480
in comedy? Like, like, if my dad died at that time, I, I can't even imagine. All right, now continue.

57:24.480 --> 57:28.560
No, no, that, I talked to a lot of comics about that and every comic I talked to, they were all

57:28.560 --> 57:33.360
like, yeah, most of us are up there performing for our mothers. We're trying to impress someone

57:33.360 --> 57:36.480
that we couldn't impress in the home, and we're trying to do this thing so we can go,

57:36.480 --> 57:41.120
look what I did, look at me on TV, and like, Artie Lange's died before he became successful,

57:41.120 --> 57:45.680
and Jay Leno's mother, like, they all expressed real sadness about their parents not being able

57:45.680 --> 57:50.000
to see that. Yeah. Is this in your films? I'm sad to say I still haven't seen it. Yeah, it is. Yeah,

57:50.000 --> 57:54.960
Jay Leno, who has this real heartfelt, sincere moment where he says, to me, that's the saddest

57:54.960 --> 57:59.760
thing. Because, because Gilbert's really beloved by other comics. Oh yeah, big time. Yeah, there's a

57:59.760 --> 58:04.640
lot of pressure, like Jeff Ross and David Tell, and I think Howie Mandel, at the end of their

58:04.640 --> 58:11.840
interview, said some version of, don't screw this up. We love this guy. I asked you, I think,

58:11.840 --> 58:15.840
when you had just started making it about the, there's a story that comics tell about the greatest

58:15.840 --> 58:20.880
opener of all time, about the, the, the Jonestown massacre. Did you ever ask him if that was,

58:20.880 --> 58:25.360
like, verify that story? Yeah, the Jonestown massacre story. I forget the bit, but yeah,

58:25.360 --> 58:30.640
he has a famous Jonestown. Because I remember, like, I think Drew Carey told it to me, or,

58:30.640 --> 58:35.120
or other comics know about it, and it's like the most famous opener of all time. And it was like,

58:35.120 --> 58:39.280
one of those things where, when a horrible tragedy happens, the day or two after that,

58:39.280 --> 58:44.320
it's hard to go up on stage and do comedy, and audiences don't know if they're allowed to laugh

58:44.320 --> 58:48.880
at anything, or as a comic, you don't know if you ought to be making people laugh.

58:48.880 --> 58:52.880
That's a big part of the story, yeah. And so, but isn't, isn't the film, by the way?

58:52.880 --> 58:58.240
That joke? Yeah. No. Because I remember, can I, can I do my bad version of it? I'm sure it's,

58:58.240 --> 59:02.560
I'm sure I'm fucking it up because it's, you know, this is something that was told to me long

59:02.560 --> 59:08.240
time ago. But he was, I think at the Film War, and he's like, oh, the Film War in San Francisco,

59:08.240 --> 59:13.280
what a great place. I grew up here, which I don't think he did. And I get, I'm probably making up

59:13.280 --> 59:17.520
a lot of the details. And he said, I saw Janice Joplin here when I was a kid, and I ended up meeting

59:17.520 --> 59:21.760
her. I became friends with Janice Joplin. I was with her when she died. She died in my arms.

59:23.040 --> 59:27.520
I held her in my arms as she died. So to be here at the Film War is amazing. I saw Jimi Hendrix

59:27.520 --> 59:33.040
here, became friends with Jimi Hendrix. I was with him when he died, held him in my arms,

59:33.600 --> 59:39.120
in my arms as he died. I just got back from Johnstown, and boy are my arms tired.

59:39.120 --> 59:48.320
And it was like the day or two after the Johnstown brothers. I want to know how

59:48.320 --> 59:52.160
close am I to getting that right? That's it. That's the joke. The one Bill Burr told me,

59:52.160 --> 59:56.320
he saw him do it, and I think it was right after Jackie O'Nazis died. He said, I met Jackie O'Nazis

59:56.320 --> 59:59.360
once. First thing I said to her was, do you remember where you were when?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:11.200
When David Tells and whoever else you interviewed, you mentioned a couple names,

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:17.600
like I love these guys, and they know Gilbert better than I do. I had one encounter with him

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.240
because of your relationship with him. He came and did my show, whatever, put a pin in that.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.360
But when those guys would get up from the end of their interviews and say,

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:33.600
don't fuck this up, we love this guy, do they go into more detail than that?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:43.360
What is it about Gilbert in the eyes of all these other craftsmen that makes him a hero?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.120
I would always ask that question, what is it about this guy? And they would always just say

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.400
fearless. I don't know if he's fearless, he just doesn't have any line, doesn't have any boundaries.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.360
He just says whatever he thinks is funny, and they love him for that.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:02.160
But because he looks scared, and he looks like a weakling kind of,

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.160
he doesn't look like a tough guy, the fact that that body language is so fearless.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.640
Was it a film or a special, or did he just tell dirty jokes? He just said joke jokes?

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.240
Yeah, well the happens to act as a joke. He hasn't changed his acting in 30 years.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.600
He tells Molly Ringwald jokes.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:28.400
When I was a kid, I saw a stand-up special, who knows, in a max, I don't know what network it was.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.960
But he did this set, and I didn't know at the time, I believe now looking back on it,

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:44.000
that he must have been doing Seinfeld. But he did a set, and then he would do his set for a while,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.240
and then he would take these little pauses, and then finish a joke and go,

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.800
and that's what I want shoes for. And then the audience is laughing, and he'd stop,

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.120
and then he'd just change his tenor and go, why do you want to talk about that?

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.560
What are you doing shoe jokes for? Seinfeld impressions are amazing.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.440
That's actually in the movie. There's a clip of him, where he puts glasses on,

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.600
it's like a Jim Gaffigan aside thing. That's crazy, that's nonsense.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.280
Well, is that his Seinfeld impression, or am I just merging those things in my head?

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.000
Because at the time, I kind of hope it wasn't, because I thought it was genius,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.800
just as a lateral thing. That it was sort of like Kevin Meany's, his inner monologue about his mom,

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.240
I was just like, I love it. You're like a crazy person.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.320
Yeah, they're doing comics and just like, because I do that too, and also Dana Carvey,

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.400
when I was doing the Great Minds episode with him, where he was doing JFK,

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.920
because I had mentioned Dennis Miller's impression of him, Carvey was like,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:53.360
no matter what he did for the next six hours, then he would just follow it up with this horrible

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.760
criticism of himself in the voice of Dennis Miller. He'd just riff a take,

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.960
because it's a largely improvised show, and then they'd say, okay, cut, let's do it again,

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.600
and then if you're like, Jesus, Carvey, why don't you, and he would just lay into himself

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.960
under his breath. Anyway, there's just something really important about that, because Justin

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.960
Reiland is like, it's Rick and it's Morty. It's like, it's-

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.040
I asked him about that character. He wouldn't ever cop to it, because it wasn't interesting in the

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.640
story, because he wouldn't ever say- Maybe it's his dad.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.320
I was like, is that your mom or your dad? Is that someone in your past talking to you like that?

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.120
And he would say, no, I just thought it was funny, it's a bit, it's what I do,

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.040
but other comics have mentioned that. Like, Piscopo brought that up. Piscopo was like,

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.360
he would do this on stage, and I think it was his mom berating him or yelling at him.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.400
I think I was like, it's a very- Where's he from, Chicago?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.680
Brooklyn, Nigh. Born in Coney Island, grew up in Brooklyn.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.160
I also, like, Schrab really does that really well too. Like, Schrab's inner monologue is like-

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:56.960
And you're not sure if it's his mom or his mom slash dad slash pastor slash gym teacher, but it's like-

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.680
But he'll do it in front of you. Like, he'll talk as his inner monologue.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.400
Yeah, he- I asked him about the voice and all that, and it's- I wish there was a more satisfying

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.000
answer, and it's in the movie, and he says, look, I just went up on stage a billion times,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.040
and eventually I woke up and said, oh, I guess I act like that now. So that's just kind of-

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.080
He's just became- What is-

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.280
The Seinfeld thing is actually a lot of comics brought this up.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.800
So before Seinfeld, like, became the Seinfeld, we know, like, before The Tonight Show,

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.560
Gilbert, people say that Gilbert invented the Seinfeld impression, because he would go on stage

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.000
before Seinfeld and do his act, do Seinfeld's act as Seinfeld. And they said Seinfeld would,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.760
all the comics would come out to watch, and he would pace and just furious, like,

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.280
what is that? What's he doing? Who? Who wears sweaters? Why do you wear sweaters?

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.720
Yeah, he told that, he said that when he did it, when he comp-trolled for us when we were on some

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.520
tour show. I can't believe I missed that.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.440
Well, he was replacing you. Yeah, I know, that's a chili bummer.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.280
Yeah, but he was, I mean, now, having put a pin in this, I mean, that was my one encounter with

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.960
him, was like, I didn't know what to expect, I didn't know what Gilbert Gottfried would be,

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.320
who'd only ever seen him in performance. And when he showed up, and he was just, like, very,

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:14.960
like, God, I really don't want to use the word frail, but now that I've said I don't want to use

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.960
it, like, now it's in your head, but it's like, it was just, he was so, like, he was like, he was

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:25.200
almost in hibernation. Well, like, he was just like, sort of like, shuffling, and it wasn't,

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.480
a lot of that, it wasn't being passive aggressive, he wasn't like, why am I here? You know, he was

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:37.200
totally, like, down to do whatever was required of him. He was just, like, this person that was

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:43.680
just like, he was just shuffling in with his wife, who was very, like, sort of like, like,

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:50.560
kind of almost translating for him, and going like, where should Gilbert go? What do you want

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:57.760
from him? And what do you stuff? And he was just very, like, what do you want? I can't remember

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.600
what he sounded like, but I would go like, oh, you just go out there, and you're just sitting

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.160
in a chair, and I explain, I was like, okay, all right, okay, yeah, yeah. And I was, and I was

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.360
thinking, like, what's he gonna sound like when he goes out there? Right, yeah. And then he went

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:14.560
out there, and people, like, went crazy, and then he kind of, like, stepped on the gas of, like,

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.640
milking, how people were going crazy. And then it's just like, ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:23.600
Harmontown, and I was like, holy shit, Gilbert Godfrey's here. But that's a reaction a lot of

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.800
people have, and I remember that, I guess that's what I meant by awkward, like, when you do meet

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.120
him offstage, especially if he's about to perform and has to deliver, like, I've gotten phone calls

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.400
from people that I've set up for him to do stuff, and they'll call and go, hey, man, is he okay?

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.960
Is he, does he not want to be here? Is he upset? Like, he's, because he's very quiet, and he would

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.560
not be upset if I said this, because people that watch the movie, the way he is physically with

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.120
people, like, anyone with any sort of like, spectrum-y stuff in their family have all said,

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.360
there might be a little bit of that going on, because he's very quiet. You know, I tell you,

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.080
because, well, don't people say that about Daryl Hammond? Like, that, like, I've never met him

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:05.520
in person, but like, that that's like, and then Dan Aykroyd, who has been diagnosed and said,

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:11.840
I'm autistic, like, it's not like, I mean, people get confused, I think, with performers, because

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:19.120
performance is like, it's like, it's a natural human occurrence. So we have this delineation

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:25.360
where we go, oh, you're performing as opposed to being real. But what, but no, there's no such thing

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.800
as a human interaction that's not a performance, we are a political animal, and people who are on

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.400
the spectrum, like, the reason why it's impossible to diagnose them without seven years of pointless,

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.080
like, tail-chasing, whereas you can just look at a kid and go, boom, autistic, not autistic, next.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:50.160
Once you get to a certain age, you, it's the capacity for performance is so extreme that

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.680
that person doesn't know who they are. All they know is they don't want to get beaten up, like,

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.320
just just leave me alone, like, just let me or give me whatever, like, what do I have to do? Do

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.360
I have to talk like this? Do I have to talk like this? Do I have to talk like that? Do you talk

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.960
like this? I talk like that, like, like, like, there's, there's like, there's like, like, like,

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:14.240
functional autism, like, seems to be a big thing in, like, great impressionists, and like,

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.520
like, it's, and so that, that comes to mind because it's like, that there wouldn't be no

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.480
delineation with him, unlike with Bobcat, who doesn't have, like, a bunch of autistic traits.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.280
Bobcat is just like, yeah, I'm just this guy, and I, I kind of got into this scene, and then I

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:34.160
stepped on the gas pedal doing this character, and then, and then that started to really punish

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.120
my life. So I lifted, I got sick of it, and by Police Academy nine was like, becoming self-sabotaging

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:47.680
and like, pulled out and like, pursued my bliss, you know, he, but then you have, like, so again,

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.680
Emo Phillips, like, Gottfried, Daryl Hammond, I hope it's not rude to refer to these people as if

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.280
they're like some egg basket of people that I'm implying. I met Emo, like, I did a show with him,

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.200
and, you know, like, he's Emo, like, like, I, I, I get the feeling from my limited interaction

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.520
with him, it's like, after the show, he's like, hey, Jeff, you know, did I do a good job? And so

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.200
kind, yeah, I was like, oh, thank you so much. I didn't know what I did was funny enough.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.440
But he's talking it away. Did he try and do it without that for a while? Didn't, I thought he

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.920
did another version of his act, it was a little more. So here's the funny thing, if Emo Phillips

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.800
tries to do that, like, that's another version of a bit that he can do. Maria Bamford does the

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.640
same thing. Like, like, like, she has this bit where she goes like, well, should I talk like

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:38.080
that? Like, and then Maria Bamford will just like, like, become her impression of what I would,

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.920
what I'm going to say, a neurotypical person. I don't know what Maria, you know,

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.520
claims to have or doesn't have, but like, I'm just saying like, like, like she, when she does an

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:56.880
impression of, of a normal person, it's so funny. And then like, that's also like Gilbert Godford,

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.600
like in his act, like pausing over that guy, no, why would you do that joke? And then he like,

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.560
and it's so it's also unsettling, because it's like, it, well, I hate to hate, you know, like,

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.920
like, my fans are sick of hearing me, the pick the peekaboo thing, but that's like, that's comedy.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.240
It's like, it's like the idea that you can't tell the difference, the idea that there is no

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.240
difference. Like that's, that's what Neil was like, after how long were you around him, like in

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:30.240
close quarters? That's seven months. And what was your relationship? Like, how did it, you said

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.160
how it started, and then you got it broke through? What's it like now? Or what, what kind of steps

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.160
did you go through with him? It's fun. I think he like, came up with a routine to be around me,

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.480
like he came up with a behavior around me, like he behaves a certain way. We're friendly, we get

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.560
along. We can, it's not like awkward like it was in the beginning. Does he enjoy promoting the film?

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.800
Or he loves it. He loves doing press. He loves, he loves, he would love, he loves doing stuff like

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.360
this. He'll complain about it. But once he's in there, he lights up and has a great time. Yeah.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.480
Yeah. He's going, yeah, he's going. Did he, does he talk about like, does he feel more alive when

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.080
he's performing than, I mean, when? No, we talked about the movie. He's, he hates, he hates it.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.280
He said the worst 30 seconds of my life for the 30 seconds before I go on stage. He wishes the

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.280
manager would come out and say, Hey, there was a flood. Here's your check. Go home. Wait, but so,

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.880
well, that's, but that's not quite, that's the 30 seconds before. But then he gets on stage and

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.680
he's okay. Yeah. Then he adrenaline hits him and he lights up. Right. Okay. I mean, that's, that's,

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.160
that's the thing that I like some of the comics I know is that they're maniacs before they're on

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.360
stage and on stage that mania is their bliss. Yeah. Does he ever, did he talk about like,

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.280
because does he remember his time on stage? Does he like black out? No, he, not in the movie,

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.480
doesn't talk about it, but he did tell me that there's times where he thinks he's more thinking

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.200
about like, whether he has to do laundry that night. Like it's so wrote for him. Like he's like,

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.600
you know, like, like Jagger can probably go on stage and do his act and not even think about

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.920
what lyrics he's screaming out. Like he, he's that, he's that into it. Like,

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.840
Well, I'm bummed I haven't seen it, but where can we see it now? Is it like, where is it out?

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.800
Yeah, it's going to, and November 3rd, it's going to be at IFC Center in New York City,

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.240
where we opened up Harmontown. Has it had any like festival? Yeah, it was, it's

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.680
premiered at Tribe Backets and a few festivals and November 10th, it's going to be in LA at the

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.920
Fine Art, Lemley Fine Art in Wilshire and the Lemley Monica in Santa Monica. I mean, I, I really

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.360
want to see it in the theater. I know that we're friends and like you've offered to like, send

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.920
me the file and watch it or, or if you have, I was out of town and didn't know, but like,

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.920
I'm such a fan of Gilbert's that I'm really looking forward to just seeing,

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.120
uh, also, I like, you know, not, not to blow smoke up you, like, I like the fact that you,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:48.080
your weird fetish is finding strange lifestyles and then documenting them.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.320
Yeah, well, that's, beauty is embarrassing. It's so gorgeous. And you know,

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.360
Yeah, you've got this trilogy now of amazing people.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.600
But no, I mean, I can speak from experience because as we talk about, like, you're definitely

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.960
not, there's all these different documentary philosophies. Errol Morris might say,

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.720
no, I don't, there's no such thing as truth. I just want to tell a story. I, it's like,

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.920
I'll shoot extra footage. I don't, the, the, the, the, the measly brothers or whatever the

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.640
fuck they were. I'm not a documentary. Masal. Yeah. Right. There's, I saw a documentary about

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.320
documentary masters and it was like, I was amazed to realize like, holy shit, yeah,

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.960
documentary does not just mean roll the camera and what happens happens. You, however,

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.440
they made salesmen, right? Yeah, yeah. Like that's first Academy Award. Yeah.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.240
That's kind of like a little close to what you do. I would say like, you follow around

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.200
lonely people and it's, it's beautiful and also no, no seasoning, no lauries, no salt.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.400
Like they, they gather footage and then they piece it together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.080
That's, well, that's the, that's the thing that's tragic and like you told me that we

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.280
asked you, say, hey man, this Gilbert thing is a good idea. And you're like, I don't know.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.720
Not sure there's gonna be much of a story there. You were right. It was really hard.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.640
But there's not, there's not really a story. He was like, you thought I was hard.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.640
There's not really a story to Harmontown. Well, yeah. Like, yeah, that's probably what it was,

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.680
is we're coming off of like, I would have thought a year before, or before we did our time together,

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.360
I would have thought fucking a make a documentary out about me. Obviously, that's what I thought.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.200
Yeah. But then again, and then again, I was like, yeah.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.920
If there is any story, like, like in terms of like story structure to it, it's almost,

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.520
the story becomes more about the audience than us. Yeah. And Spencer, his old journey.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:36.400
Spencer goes on a journey and the audience is like, we learn something about what draws

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.840
Harmonians to the show. Yeah. And that like every time I watch the Harmontown movie,

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.720
it's like, I tear up at the beautiful things that our guests say.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.480
I watched a movie again recently for this thing I was doing. I'm very proud of that movie. I really,

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.760
I really, not to toot my horn, but I'm really proud of the way it came together. And I remember

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.600
when you got your job back, you said, got some news for you, give me a call or something. I

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.680
saw you and you go, you're welcome for your third act. Yeah. At least your credit bed. No,

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.920
the credit bed was putting Spencer on the show. Yeah. But yeah. And it was McGathey who said,

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.560
just, I mean, we're struggling so much. You were like editing and editing and editing and like,

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.160
and then I remember it was, yeah, it was McGathey was like, tell him to make it about Spencer,

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.640
you fucking idiots, you know, like, because it was great photo that like the first day that

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:30.720
I was with you shooting. And I fuck, who's the camera guys? Ryan Ryan. Yeah. And we were at

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:36.000
Dan's house and Dan and Aaron were kind of in a little bit of a tiff. And there's this shot.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.320
I just picked up my camera and I have a picture of you with your camera and Dan just

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.800
like glowering at his kitchen at the dining room table and Aaron, Aaron looking miserable.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.800
I'm like, oh fuck, that was day one of Harmon's. Let's all get in the bus and go around the country

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.320
together. One of the first days was actually in this booth. He brought me in here when it was full

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.800
of those taxes and there were like notary machines, the note those things that make the notary,

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:07.040
the stamps that was in the way of footage of that. And then after the tour, the day we got back,

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.680
you're standing right there. And he said, you're like talking to the camera and said,

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.120
yes, some day we'll be podcasting. We started the tour outside.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.600
Yeah, you have footage. I forgot. I didn't even connect that. I wasn't saying that for your benefit,

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:24.640
but I remember you have footage. And I said, I was in that doorway and I said, one of the douchiest,

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.960
like talk about Edgelord. But I remember saying in the doorway there, I was like,

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.880
yeah, Sony always thought they knew more about writing than me. Let's see if I can run a studio

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.800
better or something like that. I'm like, oh, great. What a douche. And day one, our driver,

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.080
Jason, we had this awesome tour bus outside. That's the tour bus in the movie. Jason's kind

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.920
of underrepresented in that film, I think. He's kind of in it, right? Yeah, he's not really in it.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.800
He kind of, he got really good at dodging the cameras. Yeah, he was hilarious and he was a maniac.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.360
And he was like a Hunter S. Thompson character. That was one of the best. That was fun, man.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.000
And we were outside. Yeah, I would love to do it again.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.160
Aaron, outside of Starburns, right here in the parking lot, had bought 100 million t-shirts

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.400
to bring on the bus. So we didn't have room for anything. Like there was no room for camera

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.480
equipment or anything. And Jason, the driver's like, fuck this, I quit. I'm going back to Arizona.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.920
Like this is a nightmare. Like the beginning of that, I had made a prediction. And I think I

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.760
even said it on camera to you. It's like, there's no way we make all these shows. There's no way

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:30.160
we get to all these shows. It's wintertime. We're going to be on the East Coast. Sick.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.000
And somehow Jason got us to every goddamn gig on time. Yeah.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.800
He was a genius. Did you hit Snowstorms? Oh, yeah. Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, going to Colorado.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.840
In Salt Lake City, we were up to our hips. Like it was, yeah. No, it was crazy. Like you, I mean,

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.960
it wouldn't have been a better movie if we didn't make it to some shows.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:53.840
There are people in other parts of the globe that would, yeah, like, but short of like,

01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:01.840
well, more so than the worst turbulence I've ever been in on a plane, but slightly less so

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.280
than like maybe the couple of times when I thought I was drowning. On that bus, I experienced like

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.560
moments where I was like, fuck, we're going to die. Because it wasn't really because it was

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.320
empirically, it was like, not as turbulent as the planes, but it was, it was the fact that there

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.120
was just no visual sense of what was happening. All we knew is that we were on this like road

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.320
and that the driver couldn't see and that it was all white outside and just like, just white.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.520
And he was supposed to have chains on his tires, but didn't do it because it's bad for the bus,

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.800
which is illegal, but he still got us through. Well, if you watch the extended cut, it's in

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.040
the extended cut of Harmontown, there's shots where he is ripping down the highway and cars

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.760
are pulled over and you can hear other truckers going, oh, this guy's going way too fast. Yeah.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.360
Here comes his bus. He was listening to that. That's what I loved about it. He was the Elon

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.120
Musk of drivers because he was listening to their chatter and they were going like,

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.600
what the hell's wrong with that guy? And he's like, because I'm not a slave to the revenue system.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.000
I think it was like day two on the road because our first stop was Arizona, right?

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.720
Phoenix first or something like that. Phoenix, yeah. And he had just gotten to know us and

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.360
didn't like us all that much. And we had stopped at like a Walmart or something to get like supplies,

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.000
like to get like, you know, drinks and fruit and food and whatnot. And I came back onto the bus

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.640
and he didn't know that I was on the bus. He was walking around muttering to himself. He was fucking

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.880
savages, savages, savages. But that was kind of his bit. I sat down and go, oh, you Hunter S.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.600
Thompson fan? Because that's a word that Hunter always uses. He goes, yeah. And we sat down and

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.960
we talked and we became friends. And gradually he loved us. Yeah. But he pretended that he hated

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.640
our guts. Also, he was armed to the fucking teeth. He had an arsenal of firepower on that thing.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:56.640
What? Oh, yeah. Like a lot of truck, a lot of bus drivers do, they have lots of weapons to like

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.680
save the day. He had guns. People see that movie and they always ask me like, was that a rough

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.880
time? Was that hard? Because they see some of the shots where we're in the room having some,

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.400
you know, dark, intense conversations. And I always say, no, man, that was a lot of fun.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.400
It was a ball. It's to eat and drink and wake up in a new town every day. Apparently when I left,

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:18.400
because I left when you guys were in Denver and somewhere else. You left, yeah. I had to go

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.640
like to paying gigs and came back and the crew looked at me and like, oh boy. I'm like Aaron

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:30.720
and Dan have been going at it. Apparently you guys had had a real bang up, like drunken row on the

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.280
bus the night before. And they were like, we're happy you're back to kind of keep order.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.160
We were too similar. I mean, I've been, I'm respectfully silent about our breakup,

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.360
because number one, it was mutual. It was amicable. And more importantly, number two,

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.600
like when Aaron and I, when I first started talking about how we got divorced, there was a

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.160
night at Meltdown where one of the interns came up to me and handed me a note from a young lady

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:09.200
in the audience. And it said, when I was a 10 years old, my parents divorced. And I had to choose

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:18.320
which of my parents to live with. And you know, I chose my father and had to listen to nothing,

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.960
but what a cunt my mother was for the next 20 years of my life. And it never, it never changed.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:33.920
And I just want to thank you for having a divorce and respecting your ex-wife. And it was exactly

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.680
what I was thinking in my head when I was like, okay, this is it. And let's, you know, Aaron and

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:45.360
I spent our courtship and our marriage, Instagramming and talking and airing dirty laundry. And we

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:50.960
made a documentary and warts and all. And the whole thing was about transparency. It was, ironically,

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.080
it was about transparency of a couple of individuals who were so into transparency,

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.880
because we were both so meta, so performance oriented. Our entire relationship was,

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:07.440
it was like a boat made of water. It was like simultaneously like the best idea in the world

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.040
and the worst. It's like, you're already sinking. It's made of water. But no, it's like fucking

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:21.440
the best boat ever. There was, it was one in the same. We, she and I both were so meta and so it

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.840
was like in part in the documentary, like the reason why that added just even more twists

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.560
and pressure was because Aaron and I would sit and watch documentaries together. And Aaron was so

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.640
savvy, so smart, was such a, you know, a mentor to me as a feminist, you know, I'd listen to what

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:48.320
she would have to say about female characters and or real people in media and how they were being,

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:56.320
you know, betrayed, supported, attacked. And, you know, she went into that documentary going,

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.920
God damn it, I'm not going to be the documentary wife. I'm not going to be the documentary mother.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:07.040
This is like, it's a very, very chiefly female role about in the documentary about exceptional

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:12.320
people. There's like a female threshold guardian that they're talking head is all about like,

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.520
well, Dan thinks he's special, but the truth is he needs to eat more

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.880
vitamins or whatever. And he's just like, want to throw your shoe at the TV and go, boo.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.880
And, and, and she was like obsessed with, I'm not going to be that person. And the irony was,

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.560
you know, and then, and then add to that, my obsession was like, Oh, I'm not going to be,

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.400
I'm not going to be all these other people like that I have in my head.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.880
Did Gilbert, like with his wife or friends and family of his with, with, with their relationships

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.120
that were like important to the Gilbert documentary?

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.000
His sister. Yeah. The sister who passed away a few weeks ago.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:48.480
Oh, geez.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:53.280
Um, yeah, that's a big, big part of the story. Not her passing away, but what her,

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.800
she has, she had cancer and-

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.600
Were they close?

01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.160
Very. He, he, that's, again, I did, I knew nothing about the guy, but every day that he

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.960
wasn't working, he would do this like three mile walk to the Lower East Side to visit one sister

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.920
over the West Village to visit the other and then back home deeply, deeply devoted to his family.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.640
That's great.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.360
Incredibly.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.680
And, and, and when they're together with the family, that does that, are they like,

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.920
cause there's people who are deeply devoted to family who are like, uh, they're just always

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.880
like yelling at each other. And then there's people who are like best friends.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.560
Now there, there, the confrontations, not his thing. He, he's would never, you know,

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.280
I think if you came out of him, he would just cower. They talk about like seltzer and, you know,

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.360
news, what, you know, they don't, it's like most classic older generations.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:43.600
Which I now understand because, uh, it, that, that's, like, it is in this tumultuous year

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.840
where my relationships with myself and everything, it's like, I, I, I just realized, oh, that's where

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:55.600
family is supposed to go. Is this spot between yourself, your friends, society, and then there's

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.680
this, it's your family, like, and it's supposed to be conversations about weather. It's, it's,

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:08.800
it's almost like, if you can just not hit each other and you just all recognize, I, I, I guess

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.840
I learned that from watching Cody and our family. Yeah. That, that.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840
Does that, does that affect like, I, I know about your relationship with your parents,

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:24.240
but as you get older and, you know, mature, do you, are you ever going to start reaching out and

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.840
communicating with them? Or is it just going to be something that just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm always,

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.720
I mean, I don't have an acrimonious relationship with my family. I, I just, there's just no,

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.000
I just don't have the, what, what Cody has with her family and what I observe with other people

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.440
where you have a, you have a, it's like the default is connection. And if there is no connection,

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:53.200
something's wrong. Which to me, that I'm looking at that as an abnormal person and saying, that's

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.720
normal. That should be normal. Is she, is she, is her family hugged? I love you. Are they,

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.840
you know, we say, yeah, my family, but, and it's like weird because I'm like a bread from the same

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.400
family, but it's like, I, I wouldn't have it any other way, but let's get, you know, it's like,

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.320
and then you're going to go like, yeah, it's like, that's why we like, I think those myths about

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.640
like the Adams family or like misfit, you know, like when you, when you lock into like a, oh,

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.800
this family, they're kind of like, they do things differently. Like they're not like that,

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.720
that white bread family that like does things by rote, but like, but it's like, we love,

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.840
we fetishize those like outlaw families and things because they, they, they, they, oh,

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.160
they're so different and they're so weird and they're so, they have such a different way of

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.520
expressing it, but the default, everybody kind of agrees, every primate agrees and they're fiber

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.440
that like, yeah, but if you don't have unconditional kind of like a connection. And so that involves

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.640
ritual and tradition and stuff. But I think that my family, like, I think when we were trying to

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:59.920
engage in tradition and ritual, we were so ulcerated about it. Like, like, like, like we, and that my

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.120
parents actually had a triumph while I was growing up of, of, of going, you know what, we don't have

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:11.040
to do things this way and that way. And for them, they had to realize that family didn't have to

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:17.040
be this thing about rules and stuff. Because if they, and then, but then the, and that was good,

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:25.680
but I'm babbling. But I was going to ask, so with our thing, it was like a big threat that, well,

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.640
we're getting to the end of the tour. This movie's obviously going to span the tour. So where's the

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.560
story? Where's the story? And that's why it was a great thing in post for Aaron to say, like,

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.680
make it about Spencer, we're like, oh, shit, you can make it about Spencer, he just goes on the

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:46.640
tour, and then you're done. You got a story. Your, your two other documentaries, you're going to the

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:53.200
person's house, you can theoretically just keep going there forever as long as you want. Yeah.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:02.000
So I guess my question to you is, like, is there, is there a, is there a point where you go, I got

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.440
it in that case? Yeah, well, in this one, yeah, there was like his sister was really like, okay,

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.200
I see there, there's no like, he's not doing, he doesn't do anything. He's not writing an act,

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.120
he's not doing one men's show. So there's no like thing to watch. He's not trying to get a star in

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.640
the Hollywood Walk of Fame. There was an Adam West documentary. It's like, you want to hook into some

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.360
kind of goal. Yeah, yeah. So he's not doing that, but there was a moment where his sister let me

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.480
capture something that he's very much a part of. And that kind of tied it all. And I felt like,

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.440
okay, that's, that's where we see him rise up. Because we hear about the Aflac thing and him

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.400
screwing that up and getting his job. And then we go through this whole talk about comedy's role

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.280
in society and too soon and all that. And then we see the result of that the way he deals with that.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.920
But yeah, there was a moment where I was like, okay, that's where I think we can, we can tie

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.760
this up. But yeah, you could, I could still be shooting right now. Like you could shoot forever.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.160
Do you, do you have something else? Like, are you the kind of person that has

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.400
three other people that you want to go document or?

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:04.560
Yeah, I'm, there's a few that I'm, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you did an interview with Piscopo,

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.600
I'm sure when he walked out, you're like, Jesus Christ, sequel.

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.400
Kind of a million questions. Interesting guy. No, I do have a, I mean,

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.320
I really do have a lot of questions for him. Cause it's like,

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.960
Dan and I talked, like I love that writer's room idea. Like that's, that fascinates me.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.480
I'm obsessed with that. But I just don't think that all, yeah, like I said, it's like,

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.800
I was just telling him like, you got to just, I mean, yeah, just, just like, when can we just,

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.240
just cover a writer's room for a season of television from that would be fantastic.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.000
When we came back, like Rick and Morty was in full swing and I met Justin and Rob was here

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.240
and Dino and I was like, Hey, Dan, um, maybe we should get cameras on this. Cause these people

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.080
are really interesting. There's also like, uh, I do a lot of shows like a theaters, you know,

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.520
the performing arts centers and theaters around the country and Canada and other places. And

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.960
uh, you talk to the stage managers there that have been there a long time and all the stories

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:03.360
they have, it's really fantastic. I just always ask like, who is just here? And they go, well,

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.880
Andrew Dice Clay was here and that was a little interesting. And they tell you the stories. It's

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:13.520
so like, like, like you, you get to know a little bit about Andrew Dice Clay, but how fucked up

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:18.640
he was before the show. Pete on the back wall was disappeared for a while. No one knew where he

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:24.720
the fuck he was and then walked out and killed. Like I was completely blacked out and then just

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.840
went out there and destroyed. Then after the show, dead, you know, just like, like, like inoperable,

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:34.960
carry him back onto the bus. So interesting. Cause if you're that person's doctor and you go like,

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.360
okay, so it looks like you're incredibly miserable. Um, right before you go on stage and do this

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.920
character that you've been doing for 40 years and then you go back to being miserable. Have you

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.200
considered? But this is, that's easy for me to say because I'm not a standup. I don't have the

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.160
discipline like, you know, like, like, which is going to be a dying craft. Thanks to assholes like

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:02.080
me in this technology where it's like, I just want a guy I can relate to. And it's like, well,

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:06.000
then how will you ever become a Gilbert Godfrey? How will you ever become? Does Gilbert have like

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.120
Patton Oswalt? Any depression? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, these get that, that classic thing that a

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.600
lot of celebrities have of this is all going to go away someday. Like this could be gone tomorrow.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.640
The phone could stop ringing. He talks about that in the movie. A lot of standups. I know

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:26.480
a lot of like really successful comedians have a certain degree of depression that like there's

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.240
there's a real, I think, I think happiness makes him depressed. Right? That's, that's a very,

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:39.440
Dino and I talk about that all the time. Like we, we consume our happiness through sadness,

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.480
which if you're a biology student, it makes a lot more sense. It doesn't sound as paradoxical

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:50.240
because that's what digestion is. You get, you take things in from the outside world and you,

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.480
you use like catalyzing enzymes to subvert them, change them and you make them into something

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:03.120
that you can then draw energy from and like Dino and I are like cynics. So if there's a reason

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:09.600
to be happy, like for instance, hey, our movies nominated for an Oscar, you know, we're not going

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.600
to just, we can't just take that form of energy and translate it into something that powers us.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.960
We have to pour booze or jokes or self-loathing or self-destruction on that so we can like suck

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:29.040
it up like Brundlefly into our system, you know, like, and I, and I do, but, but for that reason,

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.840
I do find that like people think that I'm more fucked up than I feel, but I think that people

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:42.960
perceive me as less happy than I am because if I'm happy, you'll know because I'm listening to

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:49.040
M83 and like, like, like sound like I'm about to blow my brains out. But it's like, because

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.520
that's when I'm like, I'm Tony Stark, what's there left to do but be Bruce Wayne? You know,

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.480
I'm going to like look out the window at Gotham and like drink a drink and be like, fuck this world.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:04.000
The times that I've, that I look back on our friendship, Dan, is of like the times I thought

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.840
of you as you're kind of your most open and happy weren't the times where you were totally on top

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.800
of the world. Like you are happy now because like things are going well and you are happy, but

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:22.960
when we were really struggling and confused and didn't know where like where we were going or what

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.880
was going to happen, like there was like a free fall like feeling of like joy in that.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:35.040
There was for some of that, but then when you were successful and I wasn't, you know, I remember

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.440
you saying to me, we got in a fight and an instant message and something that you said that stuck

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.560
with me because I was like, he's right. It was like, or not right, but right or wrong when I was

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.440
like, listen to this, take this in that you said like, I don't even, I'm starting to tell you

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:55.840
less about my successes because I don't want to hear you have to choke out a congratulations,

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.760
which was like, you know, I've observed that and other people, it was like,

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.080
that's important to note, you know, because I also, now that I'm in my 40s, I'm like,

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:08.880
ah man, when we were in our 20s and we were broke, we were so happy. Yeah, but then one of your 20

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.000
year old, we were happy in each other's arms spiraling down a drain of eternity.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.800
Well, we needed friendship to survive and so that felt like joy because we would hug and cry.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.360
Friendship is more intense and a lot easier when there's no money changing hands. That's

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:33.920
what it is. Friendship, family, that makes you happy and so when you're broke, like you have a

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:40.160
much easier chance of having like really strong friendships and really like-

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.320
Well, because we needed each other to make it. Like, you were paying my bills and then I was

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.360
paying your bills and then you were paying my bills. Yeah, and if we had it all to do over again,

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:51.360
we might go, maybe it's not about making it. Maybe we nailed it with the friendship.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:57.120
Anyways, but I did want to say, well, I wanted to ask one thing, which was that because,

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.160
well, that's something that really annoys me at the TCAs or whatever when people ask.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.600
As a person who's famous for putting his foot in his mouth and saying fucked up things and like,

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.040
Gilbert's got the whole too soon experience and the Affleck firing all this stuff, like,

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.400
I hate it when people ask me this, but I am curious about it with Gilbert.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:24.800
Are there any regrets? Like, would you do it different? Does he address that in the movie?

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.680
Do you ask him that in the movie? Like, would you go back and like,

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:34.720
he's famous for that moment in the roast where he does the first 9-11 joke on like 9-12?

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.800
The closest we get to addressing that is that that Affleck thing only made him more popular.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.240
You know, he said nothing, but he would say- It certainly put him on the right side of

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.200
comedic history. Yeah, yeah. Nothing he's ever done has hurt him that bad and most of the things

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.480
he's done has propelled him. Like, you know, Jeff Ross says at the end of the movie, you know,

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:57.200
he sells out. He's more popular than ever. He's gigging all the time. You know, so yeah.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.920
That's fantastic here. Yeah, because that's what I always say to those people. I'm like,

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.080
I don't know. I don't have anything to compare it to. I run my mouth. I burn my bridges.

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.720
I fucking, but here I am. I'm very happy. Like, I don't regret anything. I don't want to go back

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.800
in time and like say the perfect thing to the New York Times in that one interview. I'm sorry,

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.240
I made that one joke. I'm sorry that that offended people, but like- I think that the biggest thing

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.960
you and Wayne and Gilbert have in common and people like you is that you're going to do it,

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.040
but you don't think about the money or the success or the failure. You do this thing,

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:33.280
you put it out there, whether it works or not. Like, I think, but I think everyone wants to

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.800
be like that. Everyone wants to, everyone we love just not push people around and be a

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.040
raging maniac, but just people would like to do whatever they want to do that day.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.840
Yeah. To find out, like, that's what's great about documentaries, especially, like, I mean,

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.080
all film, or all good film, is that there's permission to be strange, permission to be odd

01:36:52.080 --> 01:37:02.720
and flawed, and there's like a liberating feeling when you watch that. Like, to know that, like,

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:10.240
yeah, you can be sad and still be funny, and you can be lonely and still be happy occasionally,

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.120
and you can, you know, you can make it and feel like a failure.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.120
Yeah. So can you, can you, we don't all get to have a moment in our lives captured in an hour

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.400
and a half movie. Can you watch that objectively and see a different person and can feel different

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.080
now, or can you- I don't know, well, I haven't watched it. I can't-

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:33.520
I mean, like, do you feel, because you had a lot going on then, like, personally and

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.600
professionally, a lot going on now, but do you feel like a happier person or a-

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:44.240
Definitely happier, yeah. Well, that's really weird, but I don't want to say, like, I saw a kid,

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:50.640
like, I call everybody kids, but like, there was a kid that made a YouTube video, I don't know how

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:55.200
I ended up here, because I can't Google myself anymore, but I wound up on some YouTube video,

01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:01.600
and it was like, I don't know, something like Dan Harmon, it didn't say Dan Harmon's a piece of

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.600
garbage, and here's why, so I bothered to click on it, but it was something like Dan Harmon

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.880
and the meta narrative or something like that, and it was, it was a guy who was talking about how

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.240
he has been following my career since the beginning, and he was using clips of all work from

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:26.240
community, and Rick and Morty, and the acceptable TV, and the movie, and he was explaining that,

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:35.360
you know, just these sort of like weird things about how, like, I don't even know how to say it.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:41.520
Watching that YouTube video, which included so much of the documentary, which it was a tool that

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:47.440
that guy used to put together a thesis that wasn't about how cool I was, but that was about how

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:56.000
cool he was allowed to be, like how he was learning from me that storytelling, that fucking up,

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:08.080
succeeding, famous, rich, self-destructive, failure, impoverished, like, death, life, like,

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.520
like, who gives a fuck, like, like, shove them all in a thing, you're not going to get to manage

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.120
your image, and, like, the guy was, like, clearly drawing some permission from that to do what he

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:26.000
wanted to do, and I was exceptionally happy in that moment that we made this movie, even though

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.440
we haven't made a goddamn dime off of it. How, like... Wait, no, nobody ever made money off of it?

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:38.080
No! We had a million t-shirts. I don't understand. I was, the reason we made that movie, to be

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:42.320
perfectly frank is because I was watching on Apple TV, there'd just be documentaries every week

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.760
and come up and go, I'd be like, I went backpacking across Iraq, and I sure made some new friends,

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.480
and I'd be like, this motherfucker's rich right now, and I'm not. It was the Craigslist movie,

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.360
you can't bring another movie like this guy. I thought I'd use Craigslist to Craig some lists,

01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.720
this documentary's called Craig Liston. You know what we should do, guys, and I'm only,

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.520
no, I'm not joking, we, let's do the European tour, and then it's the Steve Levy story, like,

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.240
like, we have to... But just so you know, I mean, but we have to agree, we're not doing it for money.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.560
No! Like, yeah, no, that's what I understand. No, you're gonna lose 100 grand on the tour bus.

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.920
Fantastic, like, a good 45th birthday present to myself. Let's do that again. I mean, would that,

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.200
and be honest, like, is there any angle that makes you as a filmmaker want to go do that?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.720
Or just to go hang out? I think it'd be fun, it'd be great. Like, some of the choices we made,

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:37.760
like, we brought every, like, remember we brought rolls of green screen, like, we, oh, we thought, we had no idea.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.960
We had those ear cameras, we had those ear cameras that we thought we were gonna wear these all the time.

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.080
We wore those twice, and... However, like, we got, you know, I mean, like, yeah.

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.200
One of you in the bathroom on the bus is really good. Yeah, you cast a wide net and I'm wearing a

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.840
fucking lipstick cam on my ear in a drunken blackout. And the entire time he's editing the thing,

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:02.880
I'm like, I got, I got that ear cam at home. Yeah. I got that thumb drive and I was like, I would,

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.720
I would be like, I still got it. It's like, I was like so torn. I'm like, God damn it,

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:13.920
your movie doesn't have this moment. And I think it's on my ear cam because I woke up with it on

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:22.400
my ear and a solo cup in my hand. Well, there also is a thing that, like, I don't do drugs,

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.000
I don't do coke anymore, but apparently the last time I did it was caught on audio,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.240
that there was audio of me. Can we tell that story? I, fuck yeah, I don't care. I don't do it

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.880
anymore, so we can talk about the past. But the last time I did it was on that tour. Yeah. And I

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.720
had a little bit left with me. There's two parts of that story, though. Okay. There's me hearing

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.560
about it and then me telling Dan, the first part is I was called in the edit bay and they go,

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560
hey, we don't know what to do with this, but there's no picture, it's just audio. Anyway,

01:41:50.560 --> 01:42:00.640
here he goes. And it was, it was, don't stop believing. It was a super, it was a power mix

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:07.360
of like five cities in a row. I was like, the formula didn't waver. He doesn't know anyone's

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:15.440
listening. It's just a small town girl. We were wearing microphones the entire time. I could

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.920
go to the bathroom. No one's listening. And there was a, there was a, come on down to Harmontown.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.480
And then I came in and told Dan, I said, yeah. And he goes, when, when was this? And I said,

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.640
Brooklyn. He goes, you go, that motherfucker. I asked him every night he had any. I had some

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.080
all the way to Brooklyn. I had some at the very beginning and then I found the rest of it at

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:43.280
the end, I think. That's why Coke's no good kids. Like go get a prescription to Adderall.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:52.160
Like Coke. I stopped doing Coke when I got my Adderall prescription. I, and I, I also stopped

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:57.120
lying to my friends, you know, like, and stopped, and stopped like putting myself in situations

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.480
where I might get pistol whipped. But the best was it was the singing between

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:04.640
No, that's the thing is like, you would fall in love with Jeff as a character and a sick guy,

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:10.720
because it was like so faithful. The bathroom door hinges and then a classic, a standard,

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:17.600
being flawlessly intoned and then a tap and then a between just between two.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.720
I admire your sensitivity because you asked me and said, Hey, we're not going to ever show this.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.640
We're not going to use it in the film. Like you want me to destroy. There's only four people

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.440
know about it. I'm like, yeah, let's, let's just leave that. But time has passed when we can talk

01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:44.960
about that. That, that trip was so fun. I want to find a reason to do that any other time again.

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.600
You do it all the time, but there is, you mentioned it once. There is that feeling,

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.000
like you do feel like a rock band walking into these clubs with your cameras. You know, it's,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.120
it is like a tour bus getting on and off those buses. Well, I tend to process everything through

01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.640
negativity and regret instead of just going, Oh, that was so fun. But it's like the most enthusiastic

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:08.400
thing I can say about the idea of doing that again is God damn it. I was wasting it on me

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.440
because I watched the documentary and I'm like, Motherfucker, CBS don't give a shit about your

01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.200
script. It ain't never going to be on CBS. You weren't writing it. Well, I was trying,

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.120
but it was like, it was like, don't like just have fun. There was that beautiful moment when

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.880
Aaron was helping you with it. When you and Aaron like, like actually were working together,

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.760
that was a really beautiful like relationship moment. There are people right now waiting

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.320
for work for me that it's like, it's like, come on, this is just part of the like, like fuck,

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:43.440
like, like my definition of when I was unacceptably over a deadline was as dumb as my decision to take

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:51.440
those jobs and as dumb as my decision to not have the time of my life in on this bus. The question

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:58.080
would be, am I the kind of person that just can't have fun? You know, can I not go, Jesus Christ,

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:04.720
I'm on a tour bus. This rules. This is so fun. Well, I think that it goes back to that, that,

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.440
that stress of happiness. You find a way to screw that up maybe. It's, it's like, well, it's like,

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.920
but I've been in therapy since then, which is something that I swore against back, you know,

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:18.240
in those days, I was somebody that was famous for my rants about how therapy's not worth it.

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:23.520
And I've been in therapy since, and one of the things I've been unpacking is the fact, is the,

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:29.120
the possibility of being addicted to stress and misery and stuff. And because it's your comfort

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.440
zone, because comfort's different from happiness. And you're just like, Oh, I know, I know what to

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.960
do. I'll be overworked. I'll have a, I'll have a deadline. I'll, I'll, I'll have shit to do. And

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:45.120
I do think what's changed because ask anybody that's waiting for work for me right now, I'm not under

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.120
that stress, much to their sugar. And they're going to get their money back. I'm like, I've now

01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:58.800
entered this like new age, I think where I'm like, fuck work, like it's the dumbest, and it will not

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.880
prove that you're a good person, and it will not make you happy. And so, but you're, you're, I mean,

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:12.480
tell me if I'm wrong, your, your work is a huge part of like your identity. Yeah, no shit. And

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:21.520
that's, and that is both like, I'm not going to say that's the problem. Because if I like, like,

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.560
that's not good. Like, like that's because that doesn't last. But if your work is your identity,

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.640
guess what? Yeah, then you stop existing. But then it's, but I mean, why do I like,

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.040
why should I believe that you're ever going to stop doing that? I think like, that's, that's,

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:42.880
that's what you love. You love you love creating things you love getting unconditional love from

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.320
strangers because you made a good thing. I think the thing that'll change is just I think the thing

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.200
that is changing now is that is that Rick and Morty, quite frankly, if I can open source my career

01:46:53.200 --> 01:47:00.000
here for a second, Rick and Morty was always a wonderful, amazing, incredible, fun thing to

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:09.360
execute. That was always about half of my overhead of living my price of freedom, the price that I

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:20.080
have to pay my masters in order to eat shit, fuck, jerk off, watch, sleep, blah, blah, blah,

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:26.080
whenever I want in whatever quantity I want, pick up the tab when I go to dinner, fly first class,

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.680
wherever I go, say yes to any time anyone says come here, fly here. There's a, there's a, there's

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:38.480
a nut on that as they say in grody boiler room language, there's an overhead. It's a little

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.880
over half a million dollars a year. Rick and Morty for the duration of my contract was like

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:51.680
generating around half of that. So I had to like number one, I couldn't just do Rick and Morty,

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.640
number two, I had to always dread Rick and Morty going the route of community,

01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.160
because Rick and Morty started as an exit strategy from community. So now everything

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:08.080
that's changed is like, Rick and Morty, it's not going to stay this like incredible like holy

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:14.320
shit, what's this show, everyone wants to talk about it to the point where variety is printing

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:20.640
headlines, sadly awkwardly trying to link us to Harvey Weinstein. That's like, I mean, that's

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.320
when you know you've really succeeded when there's like clickbait headlines that are like,

01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:29.520
what does Harvey Weinstein have to do with Beavis and Butthead? Like that's when you know

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:38.080
you're Beavis and Butthead. The answer is nothing except fucking clicks. So this is a show with

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.720
momentum. This is a show that I could, I can settle into and I can pay myself to actually do.

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.360
And that's a huge difference from when you knew me and from the last, that's the thing that's

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:55.360
changed is that I can actually go, Oh, I don't think Turner's going to go out of business. I don't

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:01.280
and so unless the world just literally like collapses, and if it does, then who cares?

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:09.360
Like, I now can see that I can have one job. And that's that's never been the case since I was 11.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.360
That's great. Well, that now get fired from it so we can make another documentary with Neil

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.280
Berkeley. No, I want to do the documentary where I'm happy. All right. Thank you, everybody.

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:23.040
It's been our Harmontown. Steve, Steve Levy. We didn't even play Dungeons and Dragons. We don't

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.560
have Spencer. There's no Spencer tonight. Neil Berkeley. Everybody. Thank you, Neil. And check

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:34.640
out his movie Gilbert. If you're not a Gilbert Gilbert Godfried fan already, you will be afterwards.

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.960
And if not, go YouTube the hell out of him. He's one of my comedic heroes of all time.

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:44.320
I was always looking at I was looking at the thing. It said 113. Isn't that

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:48.480
it? Doesn't that mean that we've done less than we've done seven minutes less than two hours?

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:53.440
Yeah, but you know, okay, there's no Spencer. Let's thank Church and Nolan and Chris and

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.360
Sarah and Brendan up there doing everything for us. I like it here in the booth. It's comfortable.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.760
Yeah. Who's that guy on Twitter that did the fuck your mama rap? Did you hear that thing?

01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:10.320
No, no. Church, who's that guy? Anybody know the guy's name on YouTube on YouTube?

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:16.240
Holy smokes. There's somebody. If you go to my tweets and my retweets, there's a cat that did

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:21.760
a giant fuck your mama rap that is so good. Can we find it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. Yeah,

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:26.560
if we can pull that. Well, don't make me jealous. No, no, it's you're going to be jealous. Should

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.320
I open for him? Can I warm up? Let me see if I can find it. Yo, yo, yeah, you open. Yo, yo,

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:40.160
yo, drop a beat. I'm a foot. I saw your mama in the mall. I fucked her like a pack of Paul

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:46.720
walls. I saw your mama. She was in the mall. I saw her pussy and I said, that's it, y'all. I climbed

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:54.080
up and I went in her womb. I saw your mama in a tomb. I went to New Orleans. It got flooded. I

01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:01.840
saw your mama and said, what did that do to me? And she said, it gave you pee. And I said,

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:07.040
it gave you pee. I need more than pee. And she said, well, I'll teach you the ABCs. And she said,

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:15.120
A stands for, ah, B stands for, fuck, I couldn't, I couldn't, I thought that was, I thought that

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:21.520
was going to go somewhere. All right, yo, Neil Berkeley's mama was born in a titty, New York

01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.120
city. Born in a titty. Came out the nipple said, it's me, my son's going to make documentaries.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:33.120
So he grabbed a camera, followed her around, and he only had picture. No sound. That's called

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:40.480
MOS, and it's from Otto Preminger, I think. No? All right. Yo, if you're a film major, what's up?

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:47.680
Where'd your degree get you? What's up? I dropped out of Arquette. And now I have more money than

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:54.000
Patricia Arquette. We don't know that. We don't know that. That's unverifiable. No one's going to

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.400
argue with it, though. It's verifiable. We can find out right now. Patricia Arquette is a wealthy

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.040
woman. I saw your mama. Okay, right. I can't rhyme that. Okay. All right. There we go. Yo.

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.320
I'm not thinking of rhymes right now. I'm just waiting for a time to like, okay.

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.920
Church or somebody out there. I can't find the link to that. Your mom was a sandwich.

01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:27.280
I should have ham and cheese, and I got to hand it to her. She'd have a side of pickles.

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.320
I fuck your mom so hard, she got fickle about it, said maybe I want it, maybe I don't. I said,

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.000
well, it needs to be consensual, so I will wait for your answer. I found it. I'm your private dancer,

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.920
so come in, and I gave her the time of her life. All right. I'm going to unplug out of my thing

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:47.360
and go into my phone. Wait, no, shit. I don't have the phone thing. Doesn't have the phone thing.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.200
What do you mean? You can unplug your iPad and... No, but I don't have the jack because I got the

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:58.240
new phone. Oh, send me the link. Send me the link. I'll do it. Okay. The guy's name is Rob Tanchum.

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:05.920
There's a fucking story I have to tell about Cody that like, it's got to wait till next week.

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.920
But that's good that we have a backlog of material.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:19.040
But can we also do, Jeff, is that if you're going to have, if you have the ability to play

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:30.080
live, can you find like a new age kind of like Starfield, like hypnotic thing? Let's do like

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:36.720
improvised hypnosis tapes for people. Are we allowed to play this on the show? Let's do it.

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.280
You want to give me the... Yeah, here's the jack. Let's just do this and get out of here because

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.120
we're going wrong. All right. We're not going... I mean, it's, you know, we're not going like looped

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.080
around. I got karaoke to do and for an uprooted drink. Yeah. I miss my girlfriend. I've been out

01:53:50.080 --> 01:54:17.840
of town. Okay. This guy... Yo, yo, yo. Yo, this one goes down to Harmontown and all my car... This is amazing. Listen closely. I'm about to offer up a comprehensive account of all the mamas I fuck. The compilation of my copulation with the mama population from atop the college tower through the bottom of the basement. It's a common conversation far as I'm concerned because I fucked every mama everywhere around the world from

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.560
Manhattan to Pakistan and then back again, except a handful of nations impacted by the travel ban.

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.760
Fuck your mama on my own private island. Took a private jet. Got a wet with my privacy.

01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.120
Fuck your mama in the middle of the ocean in the belly of the whale.

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:03.360
Scream all over both tips. I fucked your mama. Then she gave me a promotion. She's promoted from within because my dick is in the

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:09.840
out there. Yeah, I fucked your mama. Yo, I'm sleeping with her, but she didn't bring pajamas though because she sleeps in the

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:18.240
buff with the teeth from a nustin. I stopped your mama like she was an envelope. I fucked your mama on the pile of the everstand. Don't need to lick it even because your mama's

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.800
hella damn. But obviously I go down on her. Then I go to town on her. Then I fucked the rest of the town because I'm the mama champ.

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:32.640
I got a mama fucking fetish. I'll say much to me. These mamas on her better lettuce. I eat your mama's pussy because she said I had to finish that before I ate dessert.

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:39.520
You know how mamas be getting overprotected. I fucked your mama at the dentist. She took me for a clean and put my penis in her then split.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:45.520
I fucked your mama on the court after a game of tennis. But she needed an abortion. So I took your mama to the clinic and I fucked her then.

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:55.520
Your mama sucked my jacuda hole in my underwear. I said your mama because as far as names go, I'm underwear. What's your mama's name is? This is a mama dating. It's purely mama. Fuck you, Lana. Know me, mama basis.

01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:11.520
I fucked your mama. Why? Because no one told me not to now. I run a mama brotha. All for me. They always offerin' to make wafer. I fucked a billion ladies who have raised children lately.

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:31.520
I forget the feeling. I've become a soulless mama fucking villain. Huh, strange. I feel nothing. I fucked your mama then I busted on her stomach. A couple months ago this was a rush but something changed. I've adjusted now my pulse is barely budging. I fucked your mama on the dragon in the dungeon. Your mama loved it but for me it wasn't fun. It's time to dust it.

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:47.520
This is the hero's repercussion but so the ultimate boom. But lo and behold, got multiple booms. Suddenly it's joyless. It feels pointless. Nevertheless, I fucked your mama on the toilet. I fucked your mama in a pond filled with koi fish. I fucked your mama with the end of Dominic's poison.

01:56:47.520 --> 01:57:11.520
Wait, is it fading out? Yeah, it's a booth fade. Rob Tanchum, R-O-B-T-A-N-C-H-U-M. He just booth faded out because he's got nine more minutes of it. Well, because he could just keep going forever. He's like a tapioca pudding. I fucked your mama in Afghanistan, then back again, and a couple countries impacted by the travel ban.

01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:19.520
I'm very self-aware at the end there. No, at the end, that's what I thought at the end. He lost his joy. It got joyless, pointless, and I fucked your mama on the toilet. He's like, he doesn't even know.

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:25.520
Alright, that's been Harmontown. We're going to booth fade out. Thank you so much, Neil Berkeley. Let's find that guy and bring him in.

01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:29.520
Oh yeah, that's gorgeous shit, Rob. Thank you for that. We love you all.

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:45.520
That was great, it's joyless.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:58:01.520
Did you get any of that? It's a good show!
