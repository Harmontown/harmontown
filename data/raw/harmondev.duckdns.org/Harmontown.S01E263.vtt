{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.760\nFrom the cozy confines of the Starburns Industries recording booth, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:17.760 --> 00:29.840\nPut your hands together for Steve Levy, everybody, and the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:29.840 --> 00:37.600\nAll right. Thank you for waiting. Can I get a little more of my favorite person in my headphones?\n\n00:37.600 --> 00:39.840\nIs that possible to hear myself better? You want more of me?\n\n00:42.880 --> 00:49.360\nI tried to dance around it, but it's me. Thank you for waiting if you're a subscriber and you're\n\n00:49.360 --> 00:57.280\nwatching. Sorry, if it came up late, it was my fault. I got here late. And also, you know,\n\n00:57.280 --> 01:01.600\nhere's some apologies. We'll just start with the show with apologies, because this is like our\n\n01:01.600 --> 01:05.040\nsecond really official week doing this out of here. We did one week where it was like\n\n01:06.080 --> 01:09.760\nchurch was running around with a camera. This is our second week of like, all right, here we go.\n\n01:09.760 --> 01:14.640\nWe're broadcasting from this booth. So it's, you know, it's lit like a preschool, you know,\n\n01:14.640 --> 01:22.480\nand we're gonna try to make it a little prettier. We'll try to come up with a system where we're\n\n01:22.480 --> 01:27.520\nstarting right at eight so that you, the subscribers can at least be gaining things from this transitional\n\n01:27.520 --> 01:33.840\nperiod. Like, okay, at least I know it's on time now that there's no audience. Who knows if you\n\n01:33.840 --> 01:39.200\nlike the audience more or hate the audience and are so happy that we're doing this, but in any case,\n\n01:39.200 --> 01:46.800\nlike, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're in progress, like we're gonna keep on like evolving this.\n\n01:46.800 --> 01:50.560\nIs the castle going to be a thing again? Is that gonna get back online?\n\n01:50.560 --> 01:57.200\nLike, yeah, we are currently as active as as human beings possibly could be in trying to\n\n01:57.200 --> 02:05.520\nlegitimize that space. It's a bunch of city hall stuff. Burbank is a city where, you know,\n\n02:06.800 --> 02:13.200\nparrots are wild. They have wild parrots in Burbank. It's a, it's a crazy town. You can still\n\n02:13.200 --> 02:17.360\nwalk in off the street into a vacuum cleaner repair shop. Those are my favorite.\n\n02:17.360 --> 02:25.760\nIt's a, it's an old world community underneath a frozen chocolate shell of,\n\n02:26.480 --> 02:34.080\nof antiquity and provinciality. And they saw 900 millennials on a sidewalk at, you know,\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:37.840\nlate at night and they freaked out. And I'm not saying they, they, well,\n\n02:37.840 --> 02:41.120\nalso we were in violation of a thousand codes that we didn't know we were in violation.\n\n02:41.120 --> 02:47.920\nChilly John's runs unhindered. That place just, just deals in diarrhea and yet they,\n\n02:48.800 --> 02:52.240\nthey're allowed to funk in freely. So there's a whole process and maybe we can,\n\n02:52.240 --> 02:55.440\nI don't know, people with a little NPR of us, but maybe we can make it part of the,\n\n02:56.640 --> 03:00.640\nmaybe we can do like remote pieces where we have Nolan like check in with us,\n\n03:00.640 --> 03:04.400\nbasically his full-time job because he used to eat what he killed in terms of booking the room.\n\n03:04.400 --> 03:11.680\nNow, now he's just a man without a country. So we're paying him as much as we can to make his\n\n03:11.680 --> 03:17.760\njob to like get the venue legitimized. So he's like having to interact with city hall people\n\n03:17.760 --> 03:22.480\nand, and he's got to go to meetings and things. We should be documenting that. Is it possible\n\n03:22.480 --> 03:26.720\nfor us to take like a little zoom and go out there and, and like podcast from city hall\n\n03:26.720 --> 03:30.320\nwhere we're, where we're trying to clear this crap up? A zoom and Microsoft zoom?\n\n03:30.320 --> 03:37.680\nA Microsoft zoom. Now what's the little recording thing? A zoom, a zoom. I just hadn't heard the\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:42.160\nword zoom in a while. I don't know what they're called. I like that we have churches hanging\n\n03:42.160 --> 03:48.080\nout in the booth with us. Yeah, I like it too. Hello church. So yeah. Church is wearing her,\n\n03:48.720 --> 03:51.520\nwhat can only be described as matrix trash bag outfit.\n\n03:51.520 --> 04:00.640\nAnd as long as we're, we're, we're shining a spotlight on some of the, uh, like, like,\n\n04:00.640 --> 04:05.200\nNolan's out there hitting the hard, sweaty streets of Burbank, dodging wild parrots,\n\n04:05.200 --> 04:11.440\ntrying to get our permits back. And, uh, you know, let's, let's doff our cap to Kris Boruff, who,\n\n04:12.080 --> 04:16.160\nyou know, we're, we're, we're crammed into Burbank's largest,\n\n04:16.160 --> 04:20.160\nHarmon owned, uh, VO booth. When I, when we were building the studio,\n\n04:20.160 --> 04:24.800\nthe room that we're sitting in right now was, uh, was full of like boxes of, uh,\n\n04:24.800 --> 04:31.280\nsocial security numbers and inspirational posters from a failed tax, uh, company. And\n\n04:31.280 --> 04:37.360\nthere was literally a guy in the, in the corner of the room with the last phone plugged into the\n\n04:37.360 --> 04:43.440\nwall, no desk standing and basically saying, um, yeah, I got to call you back into the phone\n\n04:43.440 --> 04:48.960\nnext to a garbage bin full of everyone's taxes. I mean, if you were nefarious, if you were a dumpster\n\n04:48.960 --> 04:53.840\ndiver, you could have walked out of this place with like, it would have been like an Equifax on a\n\n04:53.840 --> 04:58.640\nvery low scale because probably a bunch of Burbank business owners, uh, social security numbers.\n\n04:58.640 --> 05:03.680\nBut anyways, this place was a pile of garbage we built. And I said, let's build a booth, uh,\n\n05:03.680 --> 05:07.680\nyou know, the partners at star burns were like, all right, and we started talking specs. And I\n\n05:07.680 --> 05:12.160\nwas like, guys, one of these days we're going to be podcasting out of this thing, make it big,\n\n05:13.200 --> 05:17.760\nstill not big enough to podcast out of comfortably. I mean, not make it look cool.\n\n05:17.760 --> 05:21.040\nAnd Chris is therefore, my point is Chris, Chris is a hero right now.\n\n05:21.040 --> 05:23.440\nThis is the same size as Howard Stern's little.\n\n05:23.440 --> 05:26.880\nWell, I think, I don't think that's true. I think, you know how it is like in TV, it's like\n\n05:26.880 --> 05:31.520\nwhenever, um, uh, and I'm sure you at home, you know how this works when they build a set for your\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:36.240\nTV show. Uh, it's like, it always looks way too big. You know, you always go like, oh,\n\n05:36.240 --> 05:39.920\nthe show about poor people, why is their house so big? And then like, then the DP always says,\n\n05:39.920 --> 05:45.440\ntrust me, it's going to look like confined. I think that the Howard Stern room is probably\n\n05:45.440 --> 05:48.960\ntwice the size of it. No, it's, it's the cameras make it look bigger because have you ever seen\n\n05:48.960 --> 05:55.520\nthe wheel of fortune, the actual physical wheel? It's tiny. It's, it's like, it's like five feet\n\n05:55.520 --> 06:03.120\nacross. It looks 20 feet across. But if you, like, like everything on TV, the Jeopardy set is\n\n06:03.120 --> 06:07.360\nlike as big as this room, but you put four cameras in there and you get some angles going\n\n06:07.360 --> 06:11.840\nand it looks giant. It's all bullshit. Well, I mean, you're kind of implying that Chris is doing\n\n06:11.840 --> 06:17.200\na bad job because it's like, if it looks cramped in here, then you're saying it's on him. I've not\n\n06:17.200 --> 06:21.120\nseen it on camera, but we don't have the same kind of, we don't have Jeopardy cameras in here.\n\n06:21.120 --> 06:26.960\nWe've got also our, uh, I think bottoming off our list of apologies. Like last week,\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:32.480\nI think, I think we were like, I was in a full on blackout, not so much from drunkenness, but\n\n06:32.480 --> 06:38.400\njust from like, uh, man shame. Um, I didn't hear the show, but you told me a little bit about it.\n\n06:38.400 --> 06:43.280\nUh, but, but, and I didn't watch it and I'm afraid to listen to it, but I, but what I do\n\n06:43.280 --> 06:46.880\nknow is that apparently our faces were behind the microphones the entire time. Like, I think\n\n06:46.880 --> 06:50.640\nthat people by and large are like, Hey, I like it. I'm a person that listens to the podcast.\n\n06:50.640 --> 06:55.760\nI, I, I wasn't getting as much, maybe they're getting something indirectly out of the 200\n\n06:55.760 --> 06:59.440\npeople in the audience, but then there's other things to be gained from our ability to focus\n\n06:59.440 --> 07:06.000\nand things. I'm sure it's a mixed bag. I'm sure it's a mixed bag, Aunt Natalie, but you're subscribers\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:14.400\nso we take you very seriously. Uh, did you solve, uh, sexism and, uh, and sexual assault last week?\n\n07:14.400 --> 07:18.400\nAnd I didn't set out to what I, I don't, I don't know what I said. I talked for two hours trying\n\n07:18.400 --> 07:22.160\nto convince people I was a good person, but my important, the important thing that I wanted\n\n07:22.160 --> 07:26.880\nto talk about that week was it's time for guys to be having those conversations with guys and\n\n07:26.880 --> 07:31.680\nwith each other, with each other and with themselves. And, and, and it's, and, and maybe, and, and the\n\n07:31.680 --> 07:37.040\nguys and, and then, and then having said that, I wanted to confine things to expressing my own\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:41.360\nself to, to set an example. And I don't want to say, well, guys are like this and girls are like\n\n07:41.360 --> 07:46.160\nthat, but I'm sure I said a bunch of that. But like what I, what I wanted to do was say like,\n\n07:46.160 --> 07:52.880\nokay, from now on, the rule is we speak for ourselves. Um, you know, and, and so I wanted to\n\n07:52.880 --> 07:59.360\njust say like, that's where I'm at. Consciousness has been upheaved. Um, that's good. You have to\n\n07:59.360 --> 08:06.000\naerate soil, you have to, uh, chisel the ice when you clean the freezer, tightly packed things that\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:12.880\nyou don't have to think about. They're flawed things. Whether your revolution is racial,\n\n08:13.440 --> 08:21.200\nclass based, gender based, whatever it is, however, one man, a million man, non binary march,\n\n08:21.200 --> 08:27.680\nany, whatever, whatever the movement is, I think it's all, as my therapist said, it can all be\n\n08:27.680 --> 08:34.960\nsummed up as consciousness, examining unconsciousness and saying you need to be examined. You can't,\n\n08:34.960 --> 08:40.800\nyou can't keep ruling from beneath. And as a, I'm sure I'm saying stuff that I already said\n\n08:40.800 --> 08:45.520\nlast week, but as a writer, I celebrate the unconscious. I was always like the, oh, I'm the\n\n08:45.520 --> 08:50.000\ngrimy monster. I'm going to teach you that the things that you don't think about are more important\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.640\nthan the things that you do think about. And you're being dishonest with yourself, but\n\n08:52.640 --> 08:59.680\nnarcissism is out. It's not fashionable anymore. Oh no. Yeah. I was just getting good at it. And\n\n08:59.680 --> 09:04.720\nlike, because it's okay to be a big baby, it's okay, but you got it. But now I think the new rule is\n\n09:05.360 --> 09:11.680\nokay, but don't like, don't just brag about it and be like, okay, I'm going to do nothing about\n\n09:11.680 --> 09:18.960\nthis. Like, otherwise, I feel like a fossil. Well, yeah, I mean, we're dinosaurs, like,\n\n09:18.960 --> 09:23.360\nlike we're not even that old, but, but our way of thinking is just not going to do it anymore.\n\n09:23.360 --> 09:31.920\nLike we, we're not allowed to skate by on the, the presumption that what we say goes, because\n\n09:31.920 --> 09:40.800\nthat was never a cool presumption in the first place. But now it's, we, we have to adjust. We,\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:48.400\nwe must adjust. We must, we must, we must adjust our bust. The bigger, the better, the tighter,\n\n09:48.400 --> 09:52.000\nthe sweater. Hey, can I, can I do a little house cleaning and talk about an issue that I don't\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:57.120\nknow the answer to? Okay. We're sitting here holding some beautiful glassware made by Jane Cook,\n\n09:57.760 --> 10:04.720\none of our solid lifelong harmonians. And yet I've, it's been brought to my attention that she\n\n10:04.720 --> 10:12.400\nhas now left the fold that she's boycotting us or what's happening? I know what you know.\n\n10:12.400 --> 10:17.680\nI don't know anything. I don't, yeah, I don't know. Was it because of last week? Because of your,\n\n10:18.480 --> 10:23.280\nI don't know. I don't know. I would find that hard to believe. I don't think so. I think it's\n\n10:23.280 --> 10:27.040\npossible. She tested me today and said that she was at the library bar in New York and wished I\n\n10:27.040 --> 10:31.280\nwas there. And so that, I mean, it's, it's not like she's mad at me. Maybe she's just mad at you\n\n10:31.280 --> 10:37.200\nor a Harmontown or. Is it definitive? Is it, is it safe to say she's mad? I don't know. I don't,\n\n10:37.200 --> 10:41.840\nI don't know if it is. What, what, what do we know? Like, I tell you what I know. I got a text\n\n10:41.840 --> 10:46.800\nfrom her saying that she was going to stop listening to the show, stop kind of following it.\n\n10:46.800 --> 10:55.440\nLike, but she didn't characterize it as, as a, like, as a complaint. But we're used to processing\n\n10:55.440 --> 11:00.560\nthe announcement that you're going to sever connection with something as punitive. But\n\n11:00.560 --> 11:05.200\nI don't, also then the question would be, well, then what would you do if you wanted to be healthy?\n\n11:05.200 --> 11:09.840\nYou know, an honorable discharge. What would you, what would you do? I, you know, she's in a\n\n11:09.840 --> 11:13.840\nunique position because most people have the luxury of, uh, they can just stop listening to\n\n11:13.840 --> 11:18.320\npodcasts. We asked, we asked her tonight to come from New York to be on the show. She declined.\n\n11:18.960 --> 11:23.360\nShe didn't have the guts to show up and defend herself. I think when you look at it from her\n\n11:23.360 --> 11:27.920\nperspective, I'm gonna, I'm gonna speak as objectively as possible without any speculation\n\n11:27.920 --> 11:33.760\nof her subjective, uh, experience. But I would say as somebody, it's pretty easily observable that\n\n11:33.760 --> 11:38.640\nshe was very entrenched with the listenership. She was, she was basically running a kind of\n\n11:38.640 --> 11:44.640\nunofficial slash official, emotionally official, uh, Facebook page, Facebook group of, of, of\n\n11:44.640 --> 11:48.240\nlisteners and all these things that like, like when you're that, when you're that, when you're\n\n11:48.240 --> 11:53.440\nlistening is that active, then you're, then you're, then something that for the rest of us can just\n\n11:53.440 --> 11:58.000\nbe, eh, forget Game of Thrones. It has to be an announcement. Yeah. I mean, but like, I've always\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:04.880\nthought it's kind of like a sign of, uh, emotional maturity and awesomeness when our, when our,\n\n12:04.880 --> 12:09.520\nour regular people stopped coming. Like NT doesn't go to the show anymore. Once in a while, maybe,\n\n12:09.520 --> 12:13.200\nbut, but a lot of people just go to the drawing room while we're doing this.\n\n12:14.240 --> 12:18.640\nThat's their Harmontown now is being at the bar. Some people, yeah, they fill up their little cup.\n\n12:19.440 --> 12:23.600\nWho was the Russian guy? What was his name? Anatoly. Yeah. Anatoly used to come. He was, you know,\n\n12:24.640 --> 12:29.040\nit's like, and then like, if you're immature, you go like, oh, so you just wanted attention and now\n\n12:29.040 --> 12:32.960\nthat you're not like a special audience member, now you're just gonna bail. But it's like, there's a\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:36.720\npositive way of saying that, which is, oh, you were like a friend of the show and like, you\n\n12:36.720 --> 12:41.760\nexperienced the show on a higher level. But also like, like, if, if I went to five Grateful Dead\n\n12:41.760 --> 12:47.280\nconcerts, I could go, I've seen enough Grateful Dead concerts. And if you were, but if the Grateful\n\n12:47.280 --> 12:52.000\nDead brought you up on stage for three of the concerts and, and you therefore had a Twitter\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:56.880\naccount where people were like asking you Grateful Dead questions, then when you decided not to go\n\n12:56.880 --> 13:03.440\nto a Grateful Dead concert, you might have to announce, I'm moving on. I'm not going to be\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:07.440\nlistening to the Grateful Dead anymore. I will not be at the next concert. And then someone might go,\n\n13:08.240 --> 13:14.400\nis he mad? But the answer might be not really. From talking to Nolan, who I guess has been around\n\n13:14.400 --> 13:19.200\nthe meltdown for so long, it seems like there were like classes, like groups of people who,\n\n13:19.200 --> 13:25.200\nwho came to Harmontown seeking out like-minded people. And they like, became really close\n\n13:25.200 --> 13:29.440\nfriends and they would go every week and then eventually like graduated from the program. And\n\n13:29.440 --> 13:34.480\nthen like every, I feel like it was like every year he said, like there would be a new group of\n\n13:34.480 --> 13:38.720\npeople that would come in and get the first row of chairs. And then they would all become friends.\n\n13:38.720 --> 13:42.480\nAnd then they would move on. And like, we, if you go back through the years, you know, you\n\n13:42.480 --> 13:47.440\ndefinitely see like- Well, Kevin Day just, just sent me some posts. There was the\n\n13:48.400 --> 13:53.600\nJane, like Giff of the Harmontown sticker being taken off the car. Right. And then\n\n13:53.600 --> 14:01.600\nthen Jane said, enough of Harmontown nonsense. Time to find some new nonsense. Hashtag\n\n14:01.600 --> 14:06.640\nHarmon frown. Hashtag moving on. Harmon frown. Okay. Well, some negative connotation.\n\n14:06.640 --> 14:09.920\nHarmon frown. All right. Well, Jane, if you're listening, first of all, busted.\n\n14:13.280 --> 14:17.920\nBut, and second of all, as we're learning from so many of our, our sisters,\n\n14:17.920 --> 14:23.680\num, step, you got to step forward, speak up and say what happened to you so that it can be addressed.\n\n14:23.680 --> 14:28.320\nWe can't, we can't, if something bad happened, um, and you want us to talk about it,\n\n14:29.440 --> 14:33.280\nthen the first step is you got to, you can't, you can't communicate with animated gifts.\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:36.800\nThe fact that she was texting me friendly like today makes me think that there's no,\n\n14:36.800 --> 14:44.720\nno harm done or like no sour, you know, apples. But, um, also leaving Harmontown isn't a bad thing.\n\n14:44.720 --> 14:48.880\nLike, like you, there's no reason why you should always listen to this. I think, I think saying\n\n14:48.880 --> 14:54.720\nHarmon frown is a bad thing. Harmon frown. Yeah. You got to turn that Harmon frown upside down.\n\n14:54.720 --> 15:00.560\nAll right. Because P is yellow and poop is brown. Uh, yeah. On the off chance that the\n\n15:00.560 --> 15:05.920\noffense was a lack of attention, um, we are now participating in an unhealthy syndrome. So let's\n\n15:05.920 --> 15:12.000\nmove on. All right. Uh, what else is going on? How's Spencer's new car? I wish he was here to\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:17.840\ntalk about it, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts about it. Uh, Spencer got a Honda CRV.\n\n15:18.960 --> 15:22.160\nAnd it's, yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't really have anything to say about it. I mean,\n\n15:22.160 --> 15:25.360\nif Spencer was here, it'd be funny to talk about it. Didn't he already have one or he'd afford\n\n15:25.360 --> 15:29.760\nsomething rather, right? He had a, what was that thing? It was, it was as iconic as the mystery\n\n15:29.760 --> 15:35.680\nmachine. It was just so Spencer. I don't even know this. I don't know. It was purple and it was,\n\n15:35.680 --> 15:41.520\nand it was, you know, it was infused with pot. When you get, when you get your, your,\n\n15:41.520 --> 15:44.880\nbecause you've been talking to Dan, sometimes you talk about how rich you are. And then lately\n\n15:44.880 --> 15:48.800\nyou've been saying that you're, you're broke or pretty broke, but then you're going to get this\n\n15:48.800 --> 15:55.120\nRick and Morty fortune that's coming. I'll be rich. I will soon be rich. I might even, like,\n\n15:55.120 --> 15:59.120\nI'll make a pitch and I might even help you out on this one because I want this to be a thing.\n\n15:59.120 --> 16:04.400\nCan we get Spencer like, like a mystery machine? Like, can we get him an airbrushed, like Ford\n\n16:04.400 --> 16:11.520\nO'Connor line van with bubble windows and vikings and dragons. Why are we, why is there, why are\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:16.000\nyou campaigning to get the guy who just got a brand new car? I'm saying we could step up his,\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.920\nwe could step up that Spencer game a little bit. What about stepping up my game? He just,\n\n16:19.920 --> 16:25.200\nLevy just got an Audi. Then now Spencer's got a CRV. Spencer drives me to work every day. I have\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:30.960\nno car. I got a bicycle. But you don't want a car. I don't, I don't need one. I do want one. You\n\n16:30.960 --> 16:36.240\ndon't, you do. I need my next car to be a Tesla, which I cannot afford. So I'm waiting.\n\n16:36.240 --> 16:40.320\nWhy don't we, didn't you meet Elon Musk or what's his name? Yeah, but I wanted to be\n\n16:41.520 --> 16:45.120\ndifferent and not ask him for a Tesla. Okay, here's my new pitch. Since you're,\n\n16:45.120 --> 16:53.680\nsince your buddy is with the scientific famous people, have him make you a hybrid van or an\n\n16:53.680 --> 17:02.320\nelectronic like e-van? I mean, somebody suggested that I ask Elon, my friend, first name basis,\n\n17:04.080 --> 17:09.040\nto make me a dedicated hyperloop from my home to work. That makes sense. What's a hyperloop?\n\n17:09.680 --> 17:16.960\nIt's a, it's a, it's an imaginary L train for rich people. That you just go zip zip. It's super\n\n17:16.960 --> 17:21.520\nfast. Just from like, it's one of his many dreams. Right. Because I always said like,\n\n17:21.520 --> 17:25.920\nI, the only reason people want to live up in the hills and the Hollywood Hills, you know,\n\n17:25.920 --> 17:29.760\nbut like, what if you forgot your wallet? You got to drive all the way back up there. It's a\n\n17:29.760 --> 17:34.320\nnightmare. But if you did live up there and you were like Drew Carey money or, you know,\n\n17:34.320 --> 17:41.120\nSam Simon money, you're up living at the top of Mulholland Drive, you get a zipline to the three\n\n17:41.120 --> 17:47.280\nplaces that you like to go. Did we talk, did we talk about this once? Or ski lifts? No, you\n\n17:47.280 --> 17:52.800\nfucking have a system of ski lifts where you just get in a chair and go to wherever your job is,\n\n17:52.800 --> 17:59.120\ngo back to like, up to your house. Little Dom's drawing room. You have a, you have a, like a\n\n17:59.120 --> 18:04.000\nfour ski lift system. Every boy you get, you get, you get a number of ziplines that are proportional\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:09.120\nto your financial bandwidth, contribution to society, whatever metric you want to promote.\n\n18:09.120 --> 18:14.640\nAnd then, and so I'm a five zipliner. So I get five. It's like having a fast travel. If I, if I,\n\n18:14.640 --> 18:20.480\nif I just had a slow ski lift from the drawing room to back to my place, that would be worth\n\n18:20.480 --> 18:23.920\nits weight in gold. Well, kind of what you're talking about. Would you die though? Huh? Because\n\n18:23.920 --> 18:30.480\nyou just be drinking all the time. I do it anyway. I'm still here. But I might die in a lift going\n\n18:30.480 --> 18:34.800\nback and forth. Also, there's like liquor in our houses. We're grown men. Yeah. Like we're not.\n\n18:34.800 --> 18:38.640\nI don't really have intervention. I almost never have actual liquor in my place. Once in a while,\n\n18:38.640 --> 18:43.680\nlike if it's a gift, I like to go out to drink. Well, yeah, I don't drink, I don't drink at home\n\n18:43.680 --> 18:47.680\nunless I'm with someone else. Right. We talked about the ziplines. It was years ago as our\n\n18:47.680 --> 18:53.440\nUCB show in New York when we were doing the Great Minds pilot. Oh. And you guys were on\n\n18:53.440 --> 19:02.480\nAbsooth and Spencer was back when Jane was our friend. Yeah. Yeah. The zip. Yeah. Yeah. I know\n\n19:02.480 --> 19:07.360\nwe talked about the zipline thing was it was it was a podcast episode. But I'm upgrading zipline\n\n19:07.360 --> 19:11.680\nto ski lift because I don't want to have to do like hold on to shit. Why don't you just get\n\n19:11.680 --> 19:18.080\nwhy don't you just be like the old lady in gremlins and take a take a fancy stair chair lift\n\n19:19.040 --> 19:25.040\nthe stair. We'll just make Los Angeles like the Winchester mansion and where those stairs go.\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:27.600\nThey don't really go anywhere. That's just when Jeff needs to get to Glendale.\n\n19:30.480 --> 19:34.640\nBut it's but I just got a bike, which is kind of like a kind of like the healthy version. You\n\n19:34.640 --> 19:39.600\nlooked really good on that. I'll tell you what, man, from where we live, if you take a if you get\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:44.000\non the bike and go down to Sunset Junction, which is what we did. And I had a then you're fucked.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.920\nYou got to go uphill. I know. But I'm saying like the zipline, you'd be fucked too. That's why\n\n19:47.920 --> 19:53.920\nski lifts ski lift one direction. Yeah. It was a great to create a wonderful experience. I was\n\n19:53.920 --> 19:58.000\nlike, I can't believe what if you had one direction, the band actually just carry you like on a\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:07.600\nlitter. You just like Schrab now. Just connecting dots. If you really had money and you could afford\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:11.920\nat some point, everyone has their price. You could get one direction to carry you like on\n\n20:11.920 --> 20:16.960\ntheir shoulders to places if you really, really had the dough. I don't know why you would do that.\n\n20:16.960 --> 20:22.720\nI worked with them once. Yeah. On iCarly. All right. Yeah, they only showed up for a shoot day.\n\n20:22.720 --> 20:28.640\nSo I was a stand in for, I believe it was Zane. And I had to learn their song and it was before\n\n20:28.640 --> 20:34.080\nthey got big, like in the United States. And so like during run throughs, I'd have to sing that\n\n20:34.080 --> 20:41.120\nsong in front of all the Nick execs. Can you give us a little piece of it? Give me a little bit.\n\n20:41.840 --> 20:44.880\nChurch, what has that song go that that's what makes you beautiful? It's like the,\n\n20:44.880 --> 20:52.240\nwhat's the hook? Nope. All right. It was like, that's what makes you beautiful. I don't remember\n\n20:52.240 --> 20:57.840\nthe, I don't remember the words. I honestly don't. I try to forget. I don't even know what anyone's\n\n20:57.840 --> 21:05.120\ntalking about because I'm just thinking about Elon Musk is beautiful, tall, worked out, masculine,\n\n21:05.120 --> 21:08.080\nintelligent frame. What was it good in those pictures? What was the circumstance that you\n\n21:08.080 --> 21:12.080\nguys met each other? I leave town for four days and you're hanging out with Elon Musk.\n\n21:12.080 --> 21:18.960\nYeah. I thought, you know, I, he's got, he's got kids and those kids are at that Rick and Morty age.\n\n21:20.320 --> 21:24.080\nGriffin and, or wait, no, wait, I don't know if his kids, I don't know. Griffin? Well, you don't\n\n21:24.080 --> 21:28.080\nname your kid Griffin. It's a fucking horrible monster. You're not fucking with my friends,\n\n21:28.080 --> 21:34.320\nchildren. Wait, the Griffin isn't that horrifying. Well, I stopped myself. I don't know. I don't\n\n21:34.320 --> 21:37.760\nknow what the rule is with Billionaires. If their kids' names aren't public or something.\n\n21:39.040 --> 21:44.160\nI'm kidding. I pretend I'm kidding. Strike his name from, I don't know. Did I dox one of his kids\n\n21:44.160 --> 21:47.040\nor something? Is that actually his name or are you just like, through a name? No, it's not.\n\n21:49.040 --> 21:53.760\nHis daughter Chimera, his son Gorgon. I don't know what the rules are with people's kids.\n\n21:53.760 --> 21:58.240\nYou know, like Adam Savage had a, I was hanging out with him and his kid at Comic-Con. I took a\n\n21:58.240 --> 22:03.680\npicture of him. I tweeted it. And then a lot of Adam Savage fans that know him better were like,\n\n22:03.680 --> 22:08.640\nhe doesn't, his kid is not, his kid is off limits. He doesn't want people tweeting pictures and\n\n22:09.680 --> 22:16.480\nhis kid is actually a myth. So I put the, so I took the picture down and Adam texted me and said,\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:19.920\nyeah, but he just turned 18. He's his own man now. He'd love, he'd love for you to,\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:26.160\nso my point is everybody's got their own rules, you know, like which, and who are we too. So then\n\n22:26.160 --> 22:32.800\nI caught myself. I'm like, I don't know if my friend Elon Musk, my new best friend. I can only\n\n22:32.800 --> 22:37.360\nspeak for myself. He's my new best friend. I can't like name his kids. How did you guys, because\n\n22:37.360 --> 22:42.720\nof Rick and Morty? Okay. Here's the story. McMahon, he tweeted at the Rick and Morty account,\n\n22:42.720 --> 22:46.560\nI believe, responding to something McMahon had written. And then they had like a fun\n\n22:46.560 --> 22:55.520\nconversation about simulations back and forth. And then his assistant reached out to us to set\n\n22:55.520 --> 22:58.960\nup. So now we're in contact with his assistant. And I think, you know, I didn't want to push,\n\n22:58.960 --> 23:05.120\nI didn't want to smother. I was thinking like, be a, be a delicate, cool dude, sit down, have some\n\n23:05.120 --> 23:11.280\nchicken with him. Talk to him about a couple of things. Justin did the voice for the kids.\n\n23:11.280 --> 23:16.880\nDid you mean just, is a new toddler daughter, Medusa? Come on.\n\n23:16.880 --> 23:21.280\nIgnoring. I'm not going to let you threaten my new friendship. You two are going to get along.\n\n23:21.280 --> 23:26.240\nI'm jealous. I want to, I met Adam Savage through you and I was very excited. And he was walking\n\n23:26.240 --> 23:33.120\naround Comic Con in New York with a Neanderthal, Neanderthal femur, which is hard to say. He had\n\n23:33.120 --> 23:37.360\na femur with him. Just a leg. And he was saying it was going to be part of his costume. But he\n\n23:37.360 --> 23:40.720\nwasn't wearing the costume. He was carrying it around like a beat stick. But he's famous for\n\n23:40.720 --> 23:44.720\nthese like incredible costumes that are so extreme that you can't tell it's Adam Savage.\n\n23:44.720 --> 23:48.800\nDoesn't our friend Ryan Nagata make some of that shit for him? Like the space outfits and stuff?\n\n23:48.800 --> 23:53.520\nI didn't know that, but I'm not. I think he does. He made like a full on NASA space outfit.\n\n23:54.960 --> 23:58.240\nI think they call them space outfits. But I'm going to give it, I'm going to give it a couple\n\n23:58.240 --> 24:05.200\nweeks. Let it cool. You know, not to play these like red pill dating rules, but you know, not seem\n\n24:05.200 --> 24:11.280\ndesperate. Then we reach out to the assistant. Would Elon like to come on Harvintown? Just have\n\n24:11.280 --> 24:16.400\na chat. Oh, okay. He seems like, I don't know, I don't know how available he is. But in the\n\n24:16.400 --> 24:22.560\nanswer, if the answer is, oh no, he does podcasts all the time. Then I'm like, all right, final,\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:29.200\nwill he do ours too? But if the answer is, he never does them. He never does them. Then I'm like,\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:34.960\nokay, cool, but maybe he'll do ours. Because then I've beaten Merit.\n\n24:34.960 --> 24:38.960\nAnd you know we do. I've beaten Merit. Because, because, because presidents are just schmucks,\n\n24:38.960 --> 24:45.680\nthe four year parasites, billionaire philanthropist effect. This guy's a historical figure. It's\n\n24:45.680 --> 24:49.680\nlike having Howard Hughes on your show. Yeah, it's like Einstein. It's like having Howard Hughes on\n\n24:49.680 --> 24:55.200\nyour show. And it's like having Howard Hughes on Howard Hughes's show. Dan is pointing at himself\n\n24:55.200 --> 25:01.280\nwith two thumbs right now. In case you didn't want to spend $5 on this. What am I if not the\n\n25:01.280 --> 25:07.200\nElon Musk of stupid people, you know? Like I like, it's like, it would be a historical event for\n\n25:07.200 --> 25:12.000\nhim to come on the show and have a chat. And from the brief little, you know, conversations I had\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.680\nwith him, I just think it would be a really fun conversation because a couple things that I'm\n\n25:15.680 --> 25:22.880\nreally stoked about. My new friend, he likes all the same video games I do. He's like so into like\n\n25:22.880 --> 25:27.120\nthe Bethesda stuff, the fallout and stuff. He even just talking to him about Fallout 4 made me\n\n25:27.120 --> 25:35.280\nwant to go play Fallout 4 again. And also, I really, without over sharing, because I want him to know\n\n25:35.280 --> 25:38.640\nwhen it gets back to him, you know, being friends with Dan Harmon isn't going to put you at risk of\n\n25:38.640 --> 25:47.280\nany over, what do you call it, leaking, over sharing, over, you know, he's not going to Chevy\n\n25:47.280 --> 25:53.040\nChase you, you know? He's a very private guy. You can have a very discreet friendship with your\n\n25:53.040 --> 25:56.640\nnew friend, Dan Harmon. How does he know that you're not going to Chevy Chase him?\n\n25:56.640 --> 26:01.280\nThat's what I'm saying. I was using the verb Chevy Chase to mean what I did to Chevy, which is\n\n26:01.280 --> 26:06.080\nlike air, like, like, like play his voicemail. I got you. Ilan can leave me a voicemail saying\n\n26:06.080 --> 26:14.560\nlike, oh, so I don't really, um, am I having trouble with this mountain, mountain digging\n\n26:14.560 --> 26:19.280\nmachine? I just need your help. And I know you play a lot of Minecraft. And I'll like call,\n\n26:19.280 --> 26:24.800\nI'm not going to tell the audience, oh, guess what's going on? Like, because that'll ruin it,\n\n26:24.800 --> 26:33.680\nyou know? He's a, but, but, uh, so what was my point? Oh, without, without over, uh, sharing,\n\n26:33.680 --> 26:40.560\nI just want to say about my new best friend, Ilan Musk, that I really liked one thing about\n\n26:40.560 --> 26:45.600\nhim in particular, from an emotional, like spiritual perspective is like, during the\n\n26:45.600 --> 26:51.280\nconversation, we briefly touched on an area of where he was like, he was, he was explaining,\n\n26:51.280 --> 26:55.920\nthere was a, there was a guy, basically he didn't like, there was a guy whose point of view he\n\n26:55.920 --> 27:00.800\ndidn't write. He thought was, uh, as he called it, very dangerous. We were talking about the AI\n\n27:00.800 --> 27:04.080\nthing. And then he was talking about the guy. And I really liked the fact that he was like,\n\n27:04.800 --> 27:12.080\nlike simultaneously, totally adamant. No, totally adamant about, uh, uh, like how this guy is like\n\n27:12.080 --> 27:17.200\nso, so his thinking is so dangerous. And he's, but also like, he never called the guy an idiot.\n\n27:17.200 --> 27:21.680\nHe didn't like dismiss him because the guy is dangerous. Like he, you know, it's like that cool\n\n27:21.680 --> 27:27.360\nkind of like, he was like a general, like observing, like, you know, this guy has got a lot of popular\n\n27:27.360 --> 27:33.760\nthoughts about this, the direction of this technology. And that guy is like, he's a dangerous\n\n27:33.760 --> 27:39.200\nthinker. And when he, when he kind of enumerated the things that were dangerous about this person,\n\n27:39.200 --> 27:43.440\nhe was all rooted in honesty. He was like, he was like, this guy's good at this, this, this,\n\n27:43.440 --> 27:47.360\nand that. And all of those things that have in common, they're all, they're all about deception.\n\n27:47.360 --> 27:53.120\nThey're all about manipulation. Like, and I really, you know, that's, that's why we're going to be\n\n27:53.120 --> 28:02.000\nlike fucking capital B, capital F, capital Fs. It's because we were like, you know, and, and,\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:06.800\nbut, but like, it'll be like you, me and, you know, big, big, big fat fuckers.\n\n28:08.400 --> 28:10.880\nYou're gonna get along with him. I'm jealous. I want to meet him.\n\n28:10.880 --> 28:15.520\nWell, you, you go like, don't fucking up again. You're, you're making, you're making it sound\n\n28:15.520 --> 28:19.600\nlike you're going to steal Elon Musk away from the world and you guys are going to go live on a\n\n28:19.600 --> 28:24.800\nlittle beach together. No, no, no, no. You would, you want to. I was reading this article, he just,\n\n28:25.360 --> 28:30.800\nso Tesla's have the automated driving systems and apparently insurance companies hike up\n\n28:30.800 --> 28:37.120\npremiums on Tesla's. So they created their own and like ensure they've done it internationally,\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:40.960\nbut are now starting to do it. They paired up with Liberty Mutual, I think, to offer\n\n28:42.320 --> 28:49.520\ncheaper insurance because self-driving cars are, I guess, statistically safer than regular cars.\n\n28:49.520 --> 28:55.920\nSo the insurance premium shouldn't be raised. They should be lowered. And as our society moves\n\n28:55.920 --> 29:00.400\ncloser and closer to having all self-driving cars, it's going to, the insurance companies are going\n\n29:00.400 --> 29:07.120\nto take a massive hit because drivers will be much safer. They'll be all automated.\n\n29:07.120 --> 29:11.520\nIs it Liberty, is it Liberty insurance that there's always some assholes sitting having a\n\n29:11.520 --> 29:15.440\ncoffee in front of the statue of Liberty? Yeah. And they say some really dumb stuff.\n\n29:15.440 --> 29:20.320\nYou just bought a car and then you drove it into a tree. But guess what? That wasn't the smartest\n\n29:20.320 --> 29:25.360\nthing you ever did. And now they want to know, it's like, fuck you. Like, I'm just trying to watch\n\n29:25.360 --> 29:30.720\nnews. Insurance has to be one of the, yeah. That's like the dorsal fin on the shark of\n\n29:32.160 --> 29:37.840\ncapitalism. Like, it's like, no, that's not a good metaphor because the dorsal fin just warns\n\n29:37.840 --> 29:46.320\nyou that it's there. It's like, it's the ridge on the Rhodesian ridgeback. It's where it hits\n\n29:46.320 --> 29:52.720\nits worst, isn't it? You go from just regular capitalism, which is arguably like, look,\n\n29:52.720 --> 29:56.800\nit's going to happen anyway. People are going to trade favors. They're going to trade boots for\n\n29:56.800 --> 30:01.200\nchickens. So when we really knuckled down and said, look, let's create poker chips and we can\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:05.760\nlike, but then you go from that to banking, which is, oh, I'll watch your money while you're gone.\n\n30:05.760 --> 30:09.680\nAnd can I give your money to other people, but only theoretically, and then when I hold it,\n\n30:09.680 --> 30:12.880\nthey hold it, and then you hold it, hold it, and then I ensure the holdings and then without\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:16.320\nlike, okay, it starts to get really sketchy. Then it goes to corporations, which are like,\n\n30:16.320 --> 30:20.160\nokay, well, this isn't really a person. This is just a company. It's a group of people and it'll\n\n30:20.160 --> 30:24.160\nactually live longer than the people that started it. And it also has an interest in\n\n30:24.160 --> 30:31.040\npolitically. But the real height of it all, the biggest evil of all is where it's indistinguishable\n\n30:31.040 --> 30:36.320\nfrom organized crime. When people are coming to your home and saying, it would be a pity for\n\n30:36.320 --> 30:41.040\nsomething to happen to this fucking house, wouldn't it? It would be really bad. You love your kids,\n\n30:41.040 --> 30:45.760\ndon't you? Sure would hate to see them die. Sure would, but they'd hate to see you die.\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:51.040\nHate to see you break your kneecaps at Liberty Mutual. Like, when you get your kneecaps broken,\n\n30:51.040 --> 30:57.040\nyour kids don't have to, you know, starve to death. Yeah, just give me $200 a month and I'll\n\n30:57.040 --> 31:02.240\nmake sure that the inevitable doesn't happen. And it really, I mean, the worst, people think I'm\n\n31:02.240 --> 31:06.960\nkidding when I tell this anecdote. This is like, this is now a decades old thing. I definitely\n\n31:06.960 --> 31:13.600\nknow I've talked about this before in the podcast, but whatever. I got, when I was living in my\n\n31:13.600 --> 31:17.920\napartment, I remember like, I was like, it was part of my, I was just like, I was like 27,\n\n31:17.920 --> 31:24.560\nand I was like, I'm out. I'm out of society. I can't do this anymore. I got an envelope\n\n31:24.560 --> 31:29.920\nfrom an insurance company in my mailbox, and there was a photo of Christopher Reeves on it,\n\n31:29.920 --> 31:37.840\nwho wasn't dead yet, who had just sustained a horrible crippling injury. And it was a photo\n\n31:37.840 --> 31:44.960\nof him all fucked up, not as Superman, all fucked up. And, and there was a quote underneath it\n\n31:46.880 --> 31:53.680\nthat said, don't let what happened to me happen to you. Make sure you're loved. Make sure you're\n\n31:53.680 --> 31:59.600\ninsured so that you're loved. I was like, what the fucking if this was a Polaroid, you'd be a\n\n31:59.600 --> 32:08.320\nmafioso. Like, what the fuck is going on? This is extortion. Anyways. And then you, you'd look\n\n32:08.320 --> 32:14.080\noutside and there's a horse. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's just like, it's insane. It's like, it's like,\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:17.280\noh, and so you're listening and then you're gonna, you're gonna get on your little keyboard and you're\n\n32:17.280 --> 32:22.480\ngonna go, oh, I got the donut crumbs on my face and the tears are mixing with it and it's making\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:28.400\nme extra briny. So I'm gonna take Dan Harmon to task with my slide rule and my, because I just\n\n32:28.400 --> 32:33.280\nlike arguing with things. And if I argue with the president, he doesn't listen. So I'm gonna argue\n\n32:33.280 --> 32:37.280\nwith Dan Harmon. So you're gonna typey type type. And here's what you're gonna say. So you're gonna,\n\n32:37.280 --> 32:42.400\nyou're gonna use logic to say something about how, oh, that extreme thing that I said isn't\n\n32:42.400 --> 32:49.360\ntechnically true. Well, that's fantastic. You win. You're right. I didn't do any research.\n\n32:49.360 --> 32:54.320\nI didn't get a degree in this. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You proved me wrong.\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:59.040\nBut I said it. You're drinking out of a glass by somebody that doesn't even listen to our show\n\n32:59.040 --> 33:04.080\nanymore. That's right. I'm an, I'm what they call an edge lord on Twitter. Someone signed me up for\n\n33:04.080 --> 33:08.320\nlike some, I don't know, they've been coming after me. I'm getting these letters in the mail,\n\n33:08.320 --> 33:18.800\nlike that I should reserve my, my plot in the ground and or my, like, like my ash canister\n\n33:18.800 --> 33:25.440\nor something. Like just take care of it now so that your loved ones don't have to. And every month\n\n33:25.440 --> 33:31.040\nI get these letters from some service in like Studio City or something. There's a picture of\n\n33:31.040 --> 33:38.640\nlike a 29 year old guy with two chicks next to him. And it's like, Dale, Dale has planned his\n\n33:38.640 --> 33:46.000\nestate early. Like that's sexy. Like that's like a, yeah. Nothing turns on the ladies,\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:54.000\nlike a reserved urn. It's never too early. If he cares that much about his own death,\n\n33:54.000 --> 34:01.280\nhe's thinking about me. He's taking the burden off of my shoulders. I'm going to give him\n\n34:01.280 --> 34:06.240\nthe best handjob of his life. And he's going to go down on me because he's thinking about the\n\n34:06.240 --> 34:13.280\nfuture. And if he dies, guess what? Everyone's a winner. Nothing, nothing. Wait, what did you say\n\n34:13.280 --> 34:20.800\nagain? Nothing turns on the ladies like a reserved urn. Yeah, you have it out there. Just have it\n\n34:20.800 --> 34:25.200\nlike, it's the first thing you see when you come into my apartment. I love the alliteration of\n\n34:25.200 --> 34:33.200\nreserved urn. Because it's like, it's also, it sounds like, like, it sounds wormy. Reserved urn.\n\n34:33.200 --> 34:38.160\nYou know, it's like, it's like, it's nothing. It's the opposite of like, okay, so, hey, can you\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:42.880\nhand me some of those sandbags? I'm trying to help these flood victims here. Just a moment,\n\n34:42.880 --> 34:54.480\nI'm, I'm reserving an urn. Ooh, la la. This is stupid, but you were talking about capitalism.\n\n34:54.480 --> 35:01.760\nWhat do you think in the boots versus chickens economy? What, what, what is worth more? Like,\n\n35:01.760 --> 35:06.640\nhow many boots per chicken or how many chickens per boot? Oh, I would say just going from everything\n\n35:06.640 --> 35:11.600\nI know about nature, I learned from Minecraft, I would say boots would require a great deal of\n\n35:11.600 --> 35:17.680\ncrafting. Right. And a chicken is just, it's just running around. Okay. Yeah. You could use a chicken\n\n35:17.680 --> 35:20.960\nto make a boot, but you're going to need a bunch of chicken. Let's say I've got a nice pair of some\n\n35:20.960 --> 35:25.040\nlabor. Let's say, no, let's say, let's say you've got a nice pair of boots that are my size. And\n\n35:25.040 --> 35:29.200\nhow many chickens do you want for those nice pair of boots that you spent a good deal of labor on?\n\n35:30.160 --> 35:34.400\nWell, then we get into how many chickens do you have? Because it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,\n\n35:34.400 --> 35:38.800\nit's a seller's market. I need these boots. How many chickens are you going to make me give you?\n\n35:38.800 --> 35:42.640\nBut our chickens, how many eggs do your chickens lay? Huh? Regular amount.\n\n35:44.720 --> 35:49.840\nAre they in an, are they in abundance? Like, you're going to fucking, I mean, what? I'm going to what?\n\n35:49.840 --> 35:56.160\nBend you over a barrel? Welcome to, welcome to ancient Greece. They lay the most eggs. Okay, well\n\n35:56.160 --> 35:59.920\ngood. Then that's going to lower your chicken number. Aren't you happy about that? I'm doing\n\n35:59.920 --> 36:03.200\nyou a favor. Look, I got to talk to my manager. Let's see if we can finance these boots. Look,\n\n36:03.200 --> 36:07.680\nI got to get these boots. I got an appointment. Let's say I talk to my manager and it's like,\n\n36:07.680 --> 36:12.480\nit's looking really good. Like your chicken rating is high because it's great because if your chickens\n\n36:12.480 --> 36:17.280\nlay eggs, then an egg is essentially a chicken. You know? An egg just got laid while you were\n\n36:17.280 --> 36:20.880\nhaving this conversation. That's great. It's a great sign. What are these boots made of? I want\n\n36:20.880 --> 36:25.600\nto put you in a pair of boots right now. Given how many chickens do you want? Well, it's just that\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:31.360\nthese boots that you're looking at right here, these are our VIP boots. Okay. Like, I don't,\n\n36:31.360 --> 36:35.200\nI want the best boots you have. I just want to look, I just want to put you, I just want to see\n\n36:35.200 --> 36:40.480\nyou walking out of here. I'm lousy with chickens. I don't have a chicken shortage, but here's the\n\n36:40.480 --> 36:45.920\nthing. These are valuable to me because I can apparently trade them for all sorts of services\n\n36:45.920 --> 36:50.800\nand goods. Yeah. Yeah. I want to see you in these boots, but here's the thing. You know,\n\n36:50.800 --> 36:54.720\nthey're going to depreciate in value. Okay. As soon as you walk off the lot. Right. And they're\n\n36:54.720 --> 36:59.200\nmade to your foot. And I don't care about the resale value of these boots. I just need boots\n\n36:59.200 --> 37:03.600\nto last me through the year. Let me just put, let me just put you in a pair of boots that's\n\n37:03.600 --> 37:07.040\nin your, within your, your, your bracket. Because you're, you're in my chicken range.\n\n37:07.040 --> 37:10.560\nYou don't have the chicken credit to like have these other boots that you are looking at.\n\n37:10.560 --> 37:14.800\nOkay. Two chickens. These boots here. I'll give you, I'll give you two chickens for these boots.\n\n37:14.800 --> 37:19.280\nOh, if you're going to give us two chickens, I can show you the two chicken boots.\n\n37:21.040 --> 37:26.080\nI'm, look, again, I have an appointment. How many chickens do you want for these boots? Because\n\n37:26.080 --> 37:31.440\nthe more I look at them, oh, I just tried one on. These are, these are lovely. Yeah, they should\n\n37:31.440 --> 37:37.440\nbe. Those are 17 chicken boots. Whoa. Okay. Well, that's, that explains the comfort.\n\n37:38.720 --> 37:44.000\nI take off that boot and I go, it's nice almost doing business with you. And I leave with my\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:50.480\n18 chickens. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I, I, I, I get on my,\n\n37:51.840 --> 37:58.320\nin this story, do we have cell phone technology yet? Or do I get on my cell phone and I say,\n\n37:58.320 --> 38:05.200\nSiri, where, where can they get a nice pair of boots for eight chickens? And, and Siri says,\n\n38:05.200 --> 38:11.040\nI'm playing Phil Collins in the air tonight. That never works. Okay. I come back and look,\n\n38:11.040 --> 38:15.360\nI am in a hurry. I'll give you 10 chickens. I'll give you 10 right now. 10 chickens,\n\n38:15.360 --> 38:21.600\n10 chickens, eight for these 17 chicken boots. Yeah. But I'll walk out with them right now. I'm\n\n38:21.600 --> 38:27.120\na size 14. These are size 14. But the odds of someone else walking in here with size 14 feet\n\n38:27.120 --> 38:30.800\nand has 17 chickens to give you? Sir, I think you got the wrong idea about the chicken cave,\n\n38:30.800 --> 38:37.280\na boot cave. Like, we're not, we're not hagglers. What you do here is we provide a service. We try\n\n38:37.280 --> 38:41.600\nto put people that don't have boots into boots and it costs a certain amount to create those boots.\n\n38:41.600 --> 38:46.720\nAnd we just, we're essentially like a co-op. All right. So you hide, you hide balled me at 17.\n\n38:46.720 --> 38:50.800\nI lobald you at 10. Let's do business here. I disagree. I mean, you're looking at it from\n\n38:50.800 --> 38:54.800\nthat perspective. I'm just looking at it from a guy that's like, if you have 10 chickens to spend,\n\n38:54.800 --> 38:58.480\nI can show you the 10 chicken boots. There's another egg. Another egg just came out. I mean,\n\n38:58.480 --> 39:03.520\nthese chickens are just, they're egg factories. Can I, can I- Do you know what eggs are?\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:08.640\nFuture chickens. Yeah, I don't. Yes, they're not. That's why they were part of your credit rating.\n\n39:08.640 --> 39:15.680\nYes, yes. I want like fecund chicken. They're fecund as fuck. Fecund AF chicken.\n\n39:17.520 --> 39:22.800\nI have, have you considered, before we go any further, like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put you in\n\n39:22.800 --> 39:27.760\na pair of 10 chicken boots. Don't want your 10 chicken boots. But I want you to-\n\n39:27.760 --> 39:32.160\nYou can't walk me back from 17 chicken boots to 10 chicken boots. So the 10 chicken boots aren't\n\n39:32.160 --> 39:35.920\ngood enough for you, but that's the amount of chickens you want to give for 17 chicken boots?\n\n39:35.920 --> 39:39.120\nI think, I think you're trying to rip me off here. Well, that's insane. That's a projection\n\n39:39.120 --> 39:44.160\nthat you came into this cave with. I'm saying, look, this is a big city. I, there's, there's\n\n39:44.160 --> 39:48.880\nether boot makers out here. And I, and some people like to do business. It's a loose knit,\n\n39:48.880 --> 39:55.120\na network of caves in a world cell phone. If you think the next thing I'm gonna say is here,\n\n39:55.120 --> 39:59.840\nhow about 14 chickens? You're out of your fucking mind. You started at 17. I went to 10. Now you\n\n39:59.840 --> 40:04.160\nmake another offer. Have you even experienced me going up or down on any of my offers? As far as\n\n40:04.160 --> 40:09.760\nyou know, I'm monolithic in my chicken boot. Well, like monoliths. I haven't hangled with you, sir.\n\n40:09.760 --> 40:14.720\nI'm not a dishonest person. Well, a monolithic business model is not a, is not a viable one.\n\n40:14.720 --> 40:19.440\nIt's, you have to be able to move. Maybe, maybe what you're interested in is tiny boots for your\n\n40:19.440 --> 40:24.160\nchickens. They're over here in the women's section. Oh, see, now you're being, now that you, I don't\n\n40:24.160 --> 40:27.440\nknow what you got from that, sir. I'm just trying to help you. Really? We have a wonderful\n\n40:27.440 --> 40:32.560\nsection over here for all the women. So women, women, women wear tiny chicken boots. No, they just\n\n40:32.560 --> 40:37.520\nlike to dress the chickens. You know, it's a more affordable hobby. It kills the time. I, now I\n\n40:37.520 --> 40:41.120\ndon't want, as you know, women, I want these boots less and less one. Now that I know your\n\n40:41.120 --> 40:49.120\npolitics. Oh, sir, I, my, my only politics are a, a bootless foot. And that women hating.\n\n40:49.120 --> 40:54.080\nIt, no, sir, no. Diminished women. Okay, okay. We love women. How about 17 chickens? Who the\n\n40:54.080 --> 41:00.480\nfuck is this guy? This is Andre. Oh, Jesus Christ. Hey, I'm Andre. Hi, Andre. Hi. Look,\n\n41:00.480 --> 41:05.440\nI'm trying to get these boots. 17 seems high. 17 seems like a lot of chickens. Then buy the 10\n\n41:05.440 --> 41:09.040\nchicken boots. I don't want the 10 chicken boots. They look like shit. Shouldn't have even put them\n\n41:09.040 --> 41:13.920\nout. Look, I wouldn't pay 10 chicken, 10 chickens for those 10 chicken boots. Right. You'd probably\n\n41:13.920 --> 41:18.000\npay four chickens for 10 chicken boots. I get your, I get your gist, sir. You're someone that\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:21.840\nthinks that they're entitled to more. Do you know what, do you, do you, have you ever raised a\n\n41:21.840 --> 41:26.240\nchicken? Do you know what it, what it takes? Do you know that the amount of, amount of care, TLC,\n\n41:27.360 --> 41:32.800\nhusbandry goes into proper chicken raising? No, sir. Another egg, another egg. You're already\n\n41:32.800 --> 41:36.000\ndown three chickens right now, by the way. If I walk out here right now, you just have three more\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:40.160\nchickens. These are all fertilized eggs popping out of my chickens right now. Oh, I see what you're\n\n41:40.160 --> 41:46.320\nsaying. Yeah. The longer we talk about this, the less chickens you're getting. Okay. I'm not giving\n\n41:46.320 --> 41:51.360\nyou these fertilized eggs and 17 chickens. How about this? What about this? 10 chickens, three eggs.\n\n41:53.440 --> 41:58.880\nBut you got to raise the eggs. You got to, you have to incubate and take care of those young\n\n41:58.880 --> 42:03.520\nbaby chicks. That's not a service you provide people that have eggs. People don't come to you\n\n42:03.520 --> 42:09.280\nwith eggs. Sir, I'm here for boots. Well, if I'm getting into the business of chicken, egg owning.\n\n42:09.280 --> 42:14.960\nHow about this? Okay, look, you give me an idea. What if you and I go into business together?\n\n42:17.120 --> 42:22.880\nIt's kind of an anarcho-syndicalist idea. You, you give me some boots. Occasionally,\n\n42:23.680 --> 42:30.000\nyou get all the chickens you want. You get eggs when you need them. Together, we corner a society\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:37.680\nthat is basically boot and chicken-based. Yes. There's like, and we stop this idea that boots\n\n42:38.640 --> 42:42.080\nand chickens are worth more or less than it should. We enter the idea that power\n\n42:42.080 --> 42:47.120\nis for sale. See, now again, we own it. Well, you're making it, this seems more fun.\n\n42:47.120 --> 42:51.760\nWait, you drew me out into it. I thought you were... No, I'm talking about, I'm talking about\n\n42:51.760 --> 42:58.480\nmutual benefits, like, you know, like, like, you know... Yeah, yeah, I like that too. You don't\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:03.680\nlike power? I'm gonna go down to another bootstrap. Look, if you have power, you can use it to create\n\n43:03.680 --> 43:08.720\ncommunism, like, don't you want power? I can do lots of things with power. How long do you open?\n\n43:08.720 --> 43:13.440\nI'm gonna go check out a couple bootchops and maybe I'll come back. 9 p.m. 9 p.m. Andre,\n\n43:14.080 --> 43:21.440\nyou're not helping. What else you got besides chickens? Andre, what are you doing this afternoon?\n\n43:21.440 --> 43:29.280\nI'm working. 10 chickens says you're my new assistant.\n\n43:29.280 --> 43:31.600\nWhat the... You're gonna give me 10 chickens to be your assistant?\n\n43:32.160 --> 43:35.680\nHow about this? I'm gonna give you 10 chickens just to have lunch with me and hear me out.\n\n43:35.680 --> 43:40.480\nWhat? The fuck you could have had? That means I could buy the 10 chicken boots?\n\n43:40.480 --> 43:46.480\nMotherfucker, I'm made of chickens. I'm just a businessman. You don't get this many chickens\n\n43:46.480 --> 43:52.480\ngiven 17 chickens. We have every boot manufacturer you walk by. I like Andre. I like your style.\n\n43:52.480 --> 43:58.560\nYou got a deal. I'll have lunch with you for 10 chickens. Okay. Andre, after he's done peacocking\n\n43:58.560 --> 44:03.040\nat this lunch and you come back because there's nothing substantial about the game he's running,\n\n44:03.840 --> 44:08.880\nyou don't have a job. Well, that's okay because then I'm gonna use the chickens to raise more\n\n44:08.880 --> 44:13.840\nchickens and then I'm gonna buy those 17 chicken boots. Andre, what have I always told you?\n\n44:13.840 --> 44:20.000\nWhat have I told you? Words don't cover your feet. Okay? He's doing nothing. He's got a pile\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:24.880\nof chickens. We don't even know they're his. Go, go, go to lunch. Good luck. I swear to God,\n\n44:24.880 --> 44:30.080\nman. When you come back, you are not working at this chicken cave. I'm gonna have a chicken empire\n\n44:30.080 --> 44:38.320\nand then I'm gonna buy your entire store with my chicken empire. Later at lunch, listen Andre,\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:46.960\nokay. Here's the thing. Okay. It's not about chickens. What's it about? What it about? It's\n\n44:46.960 --> 44:54.640\nabout trust. There's like three cavemen playing. Cavemen? Bach. I assume this is kind of like a\n\n44:54.640 --> 44:58.400\ncaveman. I know, but we have so- You said I had so- Well, because I didn't want to\n\n44:58.960 --> 45:05.360\ndeny. All right, yeah. But there's like a quartet of cavemen violinists because it's a fancy cave.\n\n45:05.360 --> 45:11.200\nIt's a fancy cave where you took them to lunch. It's like Sparrow's or- Okay, Sparrow's, Sparkey's.\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:21.280\nIt's Sardis. We're at Sardis. I've flown you to New York and we're off Broadway.\n\n45:21.280 --> 45:26.080\nWe're at Sparrow's. Yeah, we just saw Hello Dolly with Bitt Middler and we're across the street\n\n45:26.080 --> 45:37.520\nand it's four cavemen playing violin. Listen Andre. Yes. I'm not gonna be alive much longer.\n\n45:37.520 --> 45:44.560\nOh geez. Yes, I have a rare disease that the doctors don't think I really have much longer to\n\n45:44.560 --> 45:50.720\nlive, but I have to leave these chickens to somebody and I just have the sneaking feeling\n\n45:50.720 --> 45:59.280\nthat you're a business acumen. Hey guys, I give each caveman a chicken to fuck off.\n\n46:03.040 --> 46:08.720\nShe just ate the chickens raw. More garlic stuffed olives. I mean, Andre, I've got,\n\n46:09.760 --> 46:14.800\nI'm up to here with chickens. I've got all the chickens, but you can't take them with you.\n\n46:14.800 --> 46:21.520\nI can't. You know, I'm saying I can't take my chickens with me. I gotta leave a legacy.\n\n46:21.520 --> 46:27.040\nI gotta leave a legacy is what I'm saying. Well, what disease do you have? It's, I have\n\n46:27.920 --> 46:34.080\nCrohn's. It's not funny. I wouldn't laugh because Crohn's is funny. There's people listening\n\n46:34.080 --> 46:37.440\nthat have Crohn's. That's not why I was laughing. It's terrible. It's laughing in the tone of his\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:42.480\nvoice. He decided he had Crohn's. I think your boss is the kind of person that finds my Crohn's\n\n46:42.480 --> 46:48.560\ndisease hilarious and he's a bad person. Crohn's is really rough. My best friend is Crohn's.\n\n46:48.560 --> 46:54.320\nHe's always in pain. It ain't no fun. They cut like feet out of his intestines. Hi, how are you\n\n46:54.320 --> 47:01.120\nguys? Hello, Amber. Hi, welcome to Spaniards. Sardis. Sardis. Would you like to hear some of\n\n47:01.120 --> 47:07.440\nour specials? Sure. Okay, we have a Fungili Piazza with extra mushrooms that's grilled over an\n\n47:07.440 --> 47:12.480\noctopus salad and braised in a simmering version A. We'll take two of those. We'll take two of those. Okay.\n\n47:12.480 --> 47:16.320\nThere's more. There's also a, there's also a freeze. The Fungili sounds fantastic. Okay,\n\n47:16.320 --> 47:20.160\nall right. Two of those then and I'll, can I hook you up with any drinks or do you,\n\n47:20.160 --> 47:23.680\nyou guys good with your coffees? Do you have pizza? We have a flatbread?\n\n47:25.040 --> 47:29.840\nIs that pizza? It's a Portobello flatbread. It's done with artisan flatbread, flatbread,\n\n47:30.480 --> 47:35.600\nout of flatbread, served with flat pieces of bread and Portobello. Put olives on it.\n\n47:35.600 --> 47:43.840\nWe have, we have, we have suko, which is a Japanese olive substitute. It's basically the same.\n\n47:44.480 --> 47:48.080\nWe'll take two of those. Okay. And then, do you want that on the side or do you want that as a\n\n47:48.080 --> 47:53.840\ntop of nod on your angelica? Yes, the latter. Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll be right back.\n\n47:53.840 --> 48:00.160\nThank you, Amber. Oh, I dropped my pen. It's getting it off the floor. I pick up the pen and I\n\n48:00.160 --> 48:07.600\nnotice it has the same, it says boot cave on it. You're a, you're a fucking spy, aren't you, Amber?\n\n48:12.240 --> 48:20.240\nBoot grappling, shoelace grapple. Do this cave skylight. Chickens unite. Out from my,\n\n48:20.240 --> 48:25.200\nthe valise I brought with me, 17 chickens get out and form a giant chicken Voltron\n\n48:25.200 --> 48:35.040\nand, and, and attack Amber the waitress. Well, we fight and I die. Right. But nobly.\n\n48:35.040 --> 48:40.880\nBut also a lot of the chickens die. And then I wonder, you know what, at what price, boots?\n\n48:41.760 --> 48:46.560\nYou could, yeah. Back at the boot cave, I'm just looking at a photo of my daughter\n\n48:46.560 --> 48:55.360\nwho left me with her mother because I was too focused on my boots and I'm hearing their voices\n\n48:55.360 --> 49:00.720\nsay, if you ever get your head on straight, I'll be waiting for you.\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:06.640\nDid she become a waitress at Sardis? Or is this a different person?\n\n49:08.880 --> 49:15.360\nYes. And you can say no. You can say no. Yes or no question. Well, then I go. Yeah,\n\n49:15.360 --> 49:21.040\nno, I, I, and I, and I also, I crumbled the photo and I burst into flames because my boots,\n\n49:22.480 --> 49:29.440\nthe special expensive flint boots that I made that are the sort of crowning achievement of my\n\n49:29.440 --> 49:35.680\nboot obsessed workaholic lifestyle that cost me my wife and daughter. I, while I'm fidgeting,\n\n49:35.680 --> 49:39.680\nlike, because I'm thinking about packing and going to finally abandon the boot business and be with\n\n49:39.680 --> 49:45.120\nmy wife and kids and the flint that my boots are made out of sparks, sets all the boot materials\n\n49:45.120 --> 49:49.360\non fire, the whole place bursts into flames because there was no fire permit because like,\n\n49:49.360 --> 49:56.400\nyou know, Andre is working on that. And I just die. I just, it just pulls back from my cave and\n\n49:56.400 --> 50:02.320\nI'm just dying and I'm dying. And then right as you die, I made the right decision. You did.\n\n50:02.320 --> 50:09.200\nAnd then you, right as you die, Andre comes back and sees the building on fire and he's wearing\n\n50:09.200 --> 50:16.240\nboots made of chickens, but like the nicest chicken boots of all time. And he's the master of both\n\n50:16.240 --> 50:24.240\nworlds. Well, our guest tonight on Harmontown has been waiting for a really long time. I just\n\n50:24.240 --> 50:30.400\nremembered we have a guest. Oh, I forgot. Oh, yeah. Let's bring him in. Yeah. Let's bring in,\n\n50:31.280 --> 50:36.480\nbig fans of the podcast will, will, will remember this guy for sure because he directed the\n\n50:36.480 --> 50:41.040\ndocumentary that I produced about myself. I always have to say it in that voice.\n\n50:42.480 --> 50:48.720\nBut it was his movie. He directed it. It's Neil Berkeley. Yeah. Can I move this a little bit?\n\n50:48.720 --> 50:51.760\nYeah. Move it however you want. Oh, wow. Good to be here.\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:57.360\nI'm starting to feel like I should have worn a great t-shirt to this affair.\n\n50:59.040 --> 51:04.880\nI want to point out at the top because I'm getting self-conscious. The reason Neil's a guest\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:09.680\nisn't because he made a documentary about me. It's because that's how I know him. And I, and\n\n51:09.680 --> 51:15.360\nthat's how I know he made a documentary recently about Gilbert Godfried, who also fans of the\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:22.160\npodcast will know. But fans of comedy will, will definitely know. So yeah, you just did basically,\n\n51:22.160 --> 51:26.560\nI mean, well, well, well, well, did you do the same thing with Gilbert that you did with me?\n\n51:26.560 --> 51:30.640\nYeah, I just started showing up at his house every day. Like I moved to New York and just started\n\n51:30.640 --> 51:34.080\nliving there. I'd go to his house every day at nine o'clock while he's having his coffee and I\n\n51:34.080 --> 51:37.920\nwore him down and finally got him to open up. But yeah, I just sort of like became part of his\n\n51:37.920 --> 51:41.680\nlife and followed him around and went to like 15 different cities in Mexico and Toronto.\n\n51:41.680 --> 51:44.480\nHow comfortable was he with you becoming part of his life?\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:48.960\nHe hated it. For the first two months, he hated it. He was one of those guys that he doesn't\n\n51:48.960 --> 51:53.280\nreally say no to anything. If you put something in front of him, he just does it, whatever it is.\n\n51:53.280 --> 51:58.560\nAnd his wife said, come over and try this. I would do it every day. And he never even dropped\n\n51:58.560 --> 52:02.400\nthe character. Like he was in the voice. You met him when he's not in character. Well, I would\n\n52:02.400 --> 52:06.720\ngo over there and he would talk like that in his eyes and squint. Yeah, he would do it. And then\n\n52:06.720 --> 52:10.720\nfinally, I was just going over every day and he stopped doing it. Oh, really? That's really\n\n52:10.720 --> 52:15.680\ninteresting. He doesn't, you know, you've met him. It'd be very awkward to be around.\n\n52:15.680 --> 52:21.760\nYeah. I mean, that sounds a little more critical than I would say it. But you're a director,\n\n52:21.760 --> 52:29.840\nyou're not an empath. But I mean, I find it fascinating. I mean, it was his, because I mean,\n\n52:29.840 --> 52:37.280\nyeah, like I grew up on Gilbert Godfried. Like, he, you know, he does that character. And, you\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:43.440\nknow, but it's not quite like, it's like we're friends with Bob Goldthwaite, who would get on\n\n52:43.440 --> 52:47.280\nstage in the same era of comedy, where it was like, stand up, it's so popular, you had to have a\n\n52:47.280 --> 52:52.640\nfucking accordion or a hammer for a hat or, and there were some really funny stand-ups who,\n\n52:53.600 --> 52:57.520\nlike, but it was like, look, you got to have this like character to give like, but then there's\n\n52:57.520 --> 53:02.560\nthese guys, it's like, it's like, so emo Phillips, you know, is he doing a character? I've never had\n\n53:02.560 --> 53:06.720\na conversation with him where he didn't kind of sound like the way he sounds on stage. And,\n\n53:07.520 --> 53:13.680\nand Bob Goldthwaite, there's an easy definitive line, but you only know it from talking to Bob.\n\n53:13.680 --> 53:21.680\nBob owns that line and says, when I was doing that performance, I did that act. That's not me. I\n\n53:21.680 --> 53:28.560\nam now me as a, you know, you rely on him because otherwise you would listen to Bob and you would\n\n53:28.560 --> 53:33.840\ngo, oh, you just made that sound that Bob, that screechy Bobcat Goldthwaite makes, like he makes,\n\n53:33.840 --> 53:39.200\nhe does still, because how much of it is like, is, is, is, well, this is how I talk, you know,\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:42.640\nlike, sometimes when I get on stage and I have to say something difficult, like I find like, I'll,\n\n53:42.640 --> 53:51.440\nlike, like, like, I'll cover my eyes or like, I'll just engage in these like really arch behaviors\n\n53:51.440 --> 53:55.760\nthat I know that if I step on the gas there and it's like, okay, well, then you can get through\n\n53:55.760 --> 54:01.360\nthe nervousness. So I, I, you're not shocked to learn that I brought you on and then did all the\n\n54:01.360 --> 54:05.920\ntalking, but this is what, this is what I imagined we would get to this eventually, but now we're\n\n54:05.920 --> 54:12.400\nlike right into it. My question off of what Dan's saying is when he dropped the Gilbert character,\n\n54:12.400 --> 54:17.920\nwhat was he like? Like, like, what was the difference between the on character and off character?\n\n54:17.920 --> 54:22.320\nWell, most of the, he wasn't like performing, he did do for a long time, he would do like canned\n\n54:22.320 --> 54:26.000\nlines, like he would do, it was like being on a talk show with him, you know, people go on talk\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:29.680\nshows and they've got these canned lines and they know we're going to get reactions. It was a lot\n\n54:29.680 --> 54:33.680\nof that, but eventually he started talking to me about his mom, he was very close to his mom,\n\n54:33.680 --> 54:39.440\nlived with her till he was almost 40, devastated when she passed away. His sister is a photographer,\n\n54:39.440 --> 54:45.280\nshe actually shot the whole process of her mother's very sad death. I talked to Gilbert about that\n\n54:45.280 --> 54:49.120\nand talked to his sister about that, talked about his father, his father died when he was 19, he had\n\n54:49.120 --> 54:54.800\na horrible relationship with his father. What kind, I mean, first of all, what was the, let's\n\n54:54.800 --> 54:59.360\nstart with the dad, what were the, why was it horrible? Horrible, horrible in that he was,\n\n54:59.360 --> 55:03.200\nhe's one of those dads that was like becoming an electrician, get a job, Gilbert quit school when he\n\n55:03.200 --> 55:07.040\nwas 15 and started doing comedy immediately and he would leave every night to do comedy all night\n\n55:07.040 --> 55:11.120\nand his dad just didn't get it and there were arguments and fights and then when his dad died,\n\n55:11.120 --> 55:17.280\nGilbert, Gilbert says a lot of pain about his dad not seeing his success, which every comic\n\n55:17.280 --> 55:22.720\nI talked to. That would fucking kill me. Yeah, like I got, I don't know what I'll have, Erin,\n\n55:22.720 --> 55:28.480\nmy ex-wife, a star of our documentary, she would always say to me and I know she's right,\n\n55:28.480 --> 55:32.800\nlike whenever I would say like anything about my family who, like my parents didn't come to my\n\n55:32.800 --> 55:36.640\nwedding, I still don't know why, I won't ask them, like what is it? And then Erin's like,\n\n55:36.640 --> 55:39.600\nwhy won't you ask them why they're not coming to your wedding? I go, because that's what they want\n\n55:39.600 --> 55:44.640\nand she's like, you're fucked up, they're fucked up. And when your dad, because she lost her mom\n\n55:44.640 --> 55:49.280\nwhen she was 17 and she's like, and when your parents die, you're going to be super fucked up\n\n55:49.280 --> 55:52.320\nabout it and you're going to make it, everyone else's problem and you need to deal with it,\n\n55:52.320 --> 55:58.560\nlike I'm making her sound, I think I'm making her sound like a hero, but if you're, if that's\n\n55:58.560 --> 56:02.480\nto you making her sound like a bad person, believe me, she's not, like, like she was saying it,\n\n56:02.480 --> 56:07.280\nyou know, she was like, she was telling it like it is as a person who had a, a parent pass and\n\n56:07.280 --> 56:12.560\nit's, it's sorry to derail you, but, but like, I just, I'm imagining that, like, because like,\n\n56:12.560 --> 56:20.000\nwhat I do have with my dad was a moment where my dad said that he was proud of me and that, and\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:24.560\nthat he, and that he, he observed like, it was, it was way back in the channel 101 days, we got a\n\n56:24.560 --> 56:30.480\nVH1 pilot and that was enough, we had a, my dad said, like, we were having a celebration party\n\n56:30.480 --> 56:34.320\nbecause we got our show on VH1 and there was just, there was a bunch of people in a bar\n\n56:34.320 --> 56:38.000\ncelebrating because we had done channel 101, we had followed our bliss, we had done it for free and\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:44.080\nnow we had a television show and my dad, like, expressed to my satisfaction emotionally, like,\n\n56:44.080 --> 56:49.040\nis like, I arrived, like, my dad was like, there's a lot of people in there that are very happy\n\n56:49.040 --> 56:52.960\nbecause of you, and that makes me very proud of you, and I was like, okay, cool, your hotel's\n\n56:52.960 --> 56:59.440\ndown the street, ran, ran, it's like, burst into a thousand tears and then, so I'm done, now I know\n\n56:59.440 --> 57:04.720\nI'm gonna be all fucked up if my dad dies, but I just wanted to interject that because the idea of\n\n57:05.360 --> 57:13.040\nbeing 19, which I was also like, aimlessly, by any objective, anyone that was watching me would go\n\n57:13.040 --> 57:17.440\nlike, what is your fucking plan? What are you doing? You're not that funny. Why are you interested\n\n57:17.440 --> 57:24.480\nin comedy? Like, like, if my dad died at that time, I, I can't even imagine. All right, now continue.\n\n57:24.480 --> 57:28.560\nNo, no, that, I talked to a lot of comics about that and every comic I talked to, they were all\n\n57:28.560 --> 57:33.360\nlike, yeah, most of us are up there performing for our mothers. We're trying to impress someone\n\n57:33.360 --> 57:36.480\nthat we couldn't impress in the home, and we're trying to do this thing so we can go,\n\n57:36.480 --> 57:41.120\nlook what I did, look at me on TV, and like, Artie Lange's died before he became successful,\n\n57:41.120 --> 57:45.680\nand Jay Leno's mother, like, they all expressed real sadness about their parents not being able\n\n57:45.680 --> 57:50.000\nto see that. Yeah. Is this in your films? I'm sad to say I still haven't seen it. Yeah, it is. Yeah,\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:54.960\nJay Leno, who has this real heartfelt, sincere moment where he says, to me, that's the saddest\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:59.760\nthing. Because, because Gilbert's really beloved by other comics. Oh yeah, big time. Yeah, there's a\n\n57:59.760 --> 58:04.640\nlot of pressure, like Jeff Ross and David Tell, and I think Howie Mandel, at the end of their\n\n58:04.640 --> 58:11.840\ninterview, said some version of, don't screw this up. We love this guy. I asked you, I think,\n\n58:11.840 --> 58:15.840\nwhen you had just started making it about the, there's a story that comics tell about the greatest\n\n58:15.840 --> 58:20.880\nopener of all time, about the, the, the Jonestown massacre. Did you ever ask him if that was,\n\n58:20.880 --> 58:25.360\nlike, verify that story? Yeah, the Jonestown massacre story. I forget the bit, but yeah,\n\n58:25.360 --> 58:30.640\nhe has a famous Jonestown. Because I remember, like, I think Drew Carey told it to me, or,\n\n58:30.640 --> 58:35.120\nor other comics know about it, and it's like the most famous opener of all time. And it was like,\n\n58:35.120 --> 58:39.280\none of those things where, when a horrible tragedy happens, the day or two after that,\n\n58:39.280 --> 58:44.320\nit's hard to go up on stage and do comedy, and audiences don't know if they're allowed to laugh\n\n58:44.320 --> 58:48.880\nat anything, or as a comic, you don't know if you ought to be making people laugh.\n\n58:48.880 --> 58:52.880\nThat's a big part of the story, yeah. And so, but isn't, isn't the film, by the way?\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:58.240\nThat joke? Yeah. No. Because I remember, can I, can I do my bad version of it? I'm sure it's,\n\n58:58.240 --> 59:02.560\nI'm sure I'm fucking it up because it's, you know, this is something that was told to me long\n\n59:02.560 --> 59:08.240\ntime ago. But he was, I think at the Film War, and he's like, oh, the Film War in San Francisco,\n\n59:08.240 --> 59:13.280\nwhat a great place. I grew up here, which I don't think he did. And I get, I'm probably making up\n\n59:13.280 --> 59:17.520\na lot of the details. And he said, I saw Janice Joplin here when I was a kid, and I ended up meeting\n\n59:17.520 --> 59:21.760\nher. I became friends with Janice Joplin. I was with her when she died. She died in my arms.\n\n59:23.040 --> 59:27.520\nI held her in my arms as she died. So to be here at the Film War is amazing. I saw Jimi Hendrix\n\n59:27.520 --> 59:33.040\nhere, became friends with Jimi Hendrix. I was with him when he died, held him in my arms,\n\n59:33.600 --> 59:39.120\nin my arms as he died. I just got back from Johnstown, and boy are my arms tired.\n\n59:39.120 --> 59:48.320\nAnd it was like the day or two after the Johnstown brothers. I want to know how\n\n59:48.320 --> 59:52.160\nclose am I to getting that right? That's it. That's the joke. The one Bill Burr told me,\n\n59:52.160 --> 59:56.320\nhe saw him do it, and I think it was right after Jackie O'Nazis died. He said, I met Jackie O'Nazis\n\n59:56.320 --> 59:59.360\nonce. First thing I said to her was, do you remember where you were when?\n\n59:59.360 --> 01:00:11.200\nWhen David Tells and whoever else you interviewed, you mentioned a couple names,\n\n01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:17.600\nlike I love these guys, and they know Gilbert better than I do. I had one encounter with him\n\n01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.240\nbecause of your relationship with him. He came and did my show, whatever, put a pin in that.\n\n01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.360\nBut when those guys would get up from the end of their interviews and say,\n\n01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:33.600\ndon't fuck this up, we love this guy, do they go into more detail than that?\n\n01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:43.360\nWhat is it about Gilbert in the eyes of all these other craftsmen that makes him a hero?\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.120\nI would always ask that question, what is it about this guy? And they would always just say\n\n01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.400\nfearless. I don't know if he's fearless, he just doesn't have any line, doesn't have any boundaries.\n\n01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.360\nHe just says whatever he thinks is funny, and they love him for that.\n\n01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:02.160\nBut because he looks scared, and he looks like a weakling kind of,\n\n01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.160\nhe doesn't look like a tough guy, the fact that that body language is so fearless.\n\n01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.640\nWas it a film or a special, or did he just tell dirty jokes? He just said joke jokes?\n\n01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.240\nYeah, well the happens to act as a joke. He hasn't changed his acting in 30 years.\n\n01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.600\nHe tells Molly Ringwald jokes.\n\n01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:28.400\nWhen I was a kid, I saw a stand-up special, who knows, in a max, I don't know what network it was.\n\n01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.960\nBut he did this set, and I didn't know at the time, I believe now looking back on it,\n\n01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:44.000\nthat he must have been doing Seinfeld. But he did a set, and then he would do his set for a while,\n\n01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.240\nand then he would take these little pauses, and then finish a joke and go,\n\n01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.800\nand that's what I want shoes for. And then the audience is laughing, and he'd stop,\n\n01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.120\nand then he'd just change his tenor and go, why do you want to talk about that?\n\n01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.560\nWhat are you doing shoe jokes for? Seinfeld impressions are amazing.\n\n01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.440\nThat's actually in the movie. There's a clip of him, where he puts glasses on,\n\n01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.600\nit's like a Jim Gaffigan aside thing. That's crazy, that's nonsense.\n\n01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.280\nWell, is that his Seinfeld impression, or am I just merging those things in my head?\n\n01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.000\nBecause at the time, I kind of hope it wasn't, because I thought it was genius,\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.800\njust as a lateral thing. That it was sort of like Kevin Meany's, his inner monologue about his mom,\n\n01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.240\nI was just like, I love it. You're like a crazy person.\n\n01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.320\nYeah, they're doing comics and just like, because I do that too, and also Dana Carvey,\n\n01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.400\nwhen I was doing the Great Minds episode with him, where he was doing JFK,\n\n01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.920\nbecause I had mentioned Dennis Miller's impression of him, Carvey was like,\n\n01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:53.360\nno matter what he did for the next six hours, then he would just follow it up with this horrible\n\n01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.760\ncriticism of himself in the voice of Dennis Miller. He'd just riff a take,\n\n01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.960\nbecause it's a largely improvised show, and then they'd say, okay, cut, let's do it again,\n\n01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.600\nand then if you're like, Jesus, Carvey, why don't you, and he would just lay into himself\n\n01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.960\nunder his breath. Anyway, there's just something really important about that, because Justin\n\n01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.960\nReiland is like, it's Rick and it's Morty. It's like, it's-\n\n01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.040\nI asked him about that character. He wouldn't ever cop to it, because it wasn't interesting in the\n\n01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.640\nstory, because he wouldn't ever say- Maybe it's his dad.\n\n01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.320\nI was like, is that your mom or your dad? Is that someone in your past talking to you like that?\n\n01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.120\nAnd he would say, no, I just thought it was funny, it's a bit, it's what I do,\n\n01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.040\nbut other comics have mentioned that. Like, Piscopo brought that up. Piscopo was like,\n\n01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.360\nhe would do this on stage, and I think it was his mom berating him or yelling at him.\n\n01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.400\nI think I was like, it's a very- Where's he from, Chicago?\n\n01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.680\nBrooklyn, Nigh. Born in Coney Island, grew up in Brooklyn.\n\n01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.160\nI also, like, Schrab really does that really well too. Like, Schrab's inner monologue is like-\n\n01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:56.960\nAnd you're not sure if it's his mom or his mom slash dad slash pastor slash gym teacher, but it's like-\n\n01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.680\nBut he'll do it in front of you. Like, he'll talk as his inner monologue.\n\n01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.400\nYeah, he- I asked him about the voice and all that, and it's- I wish there was a more satisfying\n\n01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.000\nanswer, and it's in the movie, and he says, look, I just went up on stage a billion times,\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.040\nand eventually I woke up and said, oh, I guess I act like that now. So that's just kind of-\n\n01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.080\nHe's just became- What is-\n\n01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.280\nThe Seinfeld thing is actually a lot of comics brought this up.\n\n01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.800\nSo before Seinfeld, like, became the Seinfeld, we know, like, before The Tonight Show,\n\n01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.560\nGilbert, people say that Gilbert invented the Seinfeld impression, because he would go on stage\n\n01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.000\nbefore Seinfeld and do his act, do Seinfeld's act as Seinfeld. And they said Seinfeld would,\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.760\nall the comics would come out to watch, and he would pace and just furious, like,\n\n01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.280\nwhat is that? What's he doing? Who? Who wears sweaters? Why do you wear sweaters?\n\n01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.720\nYeah, he told that, he said that when he did it, when he comp-trolled for us when we were on some\n\n01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.520\ntour show. I can't believe I missed that.\n\n01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.440\nWell, he was replacing you. Yeah, I know, that's a chili bummer.\n\n01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:59.280\nYeah, but he was, I mean, now, having put a pin in this, I mean, that was my one encounter with\n\n01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.960\nhim, was like, I didn't know what to expect, I didn't know what Gilbert Gottfried would be,\n\n01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.320\nwho'd only ever seen him in performance. And when he showed up, and he was just, like, very,\n\n01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:14.960\nlike, God, I really don't want to use the word frail, but now that I've said I don't want to use\n\n01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.960\nit, like, now it's in your head, but it's like, it was just, he was so, like, he was like, he was\n\n01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:25.200\nalmost in hibernation. Well, like, he was just like, sort of like, shuffling, and it wasn't,\n\n01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.480\na lot of that, it wasn't being passive aggressive, he wasn't like, why am I here? You know, he was\n\n01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:37.200\ntotally, like, down to do whatever was required of him. He was just, like, this person that was\n\n01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:43.680\njust like, he was just shuffling in with his wife, who was very, like, sort of like, like,\n\n01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:50.560\nkind of almost translating for him, and going like, where should Gilbert go? What do you want\n\n01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:57.760\nfrom him? And what do you stuff? And he was just very, like, what do you want? I can't remember\n\n01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.600\nwhat he sounded like, but I would go like, oh, you just go out there, and you're just sitting\n\n01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.160\nin a chair, and I explain, I was like, okay, all right, okay, yeah, yeah. And I was, and I was\n\n01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.360\nthinking, like, what's he gonna sound like when he goes out there? Right, yeah. And then he went\n\n01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:14.560\nout there, and people, like, went crazy, and then he kind of, like, stepped on the gas of, like,\n\n01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.640\nmilking, how people were going crazy. And then it's just like, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:23.600\nHarmontown, and I was like, holy shit, Gilbert Godfrey's here. But that's a reaction a lot of\n\n01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.800\npeople have, and I remember that, I guess that's what I meant by awkward, like, when you do meet\n\n01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.120\nhim offstage, especially if he's about to perform and has to deliver, like, I've gotten phone calls\n\n01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.400\nfrom people that I've set up for him to do stuff, and they'll call and go, hey, man, is he okay?\n\n01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.960\nIs he, does he not want to be here? Is he upset? Like, he's, because he's very quiet, and he would\n\n01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.560\nnot be upset if I said this, because people that watch the movie, the way he is physically with\n\n01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:49.120\npeople, like, anyone with any sort of like, spectrum-y stuff in their family have all said,\n\n01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.360\nthere might be a little bit of that going on, because he's very quiet. You know, I tell you,\n\n01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:58.080\nbecause, well, don't people say that about Daryl Hammond? Like, that, like, I've never met him\n\n01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:05.520\nin person, but like, that that's like, and then Dan Aykroyd, who has been diagnosed and said,\n\n01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:11.840\nI'm autistic, like, it's not like, I mean, people get confused, I think, with performers, because\n\n01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:19.120\nperformance is like, it's like, it's a natural human occurrence. So we have this delineation\n\n01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:25.360\nwhere we go, oh, you're performing as opposed to being real. But what, but no, there's no such thing\n\n01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:30.800\nas a human interaction that's not a performance, we are a political animal, and people who are on\n\n01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.400\nthe spectrum, like, the reason why it's impossible to diagnose them without seven years of pointless,\n\n01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:42.080\nlike, tail-chasing, whereas you can just look at a kid and go, boom, autistic, not autistic, next.\n\n01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:50.160\nOnce you get to a certain age, you, it's the capacity for performance is so extreme that\n\n01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.680\nthat person doesn't know who they are. All they know is they don't want to get beaten up, like,\n\n01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.320\njust just leave me alone, like, just let me or give me whatever, like, what do I have to do? Do\n\n01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.360\nI have to talk like this? Do I have to talk like this? Do I have to talk like that? Do you talk\n\n01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.960\nlike this? I talk like that, like, like, like, there's, there's like, there's like, like, like,\n\n01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:14.240\nfunctional autism, like, seems to be a big thing in, like, great impressionists, and like,\n\n01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.520\nlike, it's, and so that, that comes to mind because it's like, that there wouldn't be no\n\n01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.480\ndelineation with him, unlike with Bobcat, who doesn't have, like, a bunch of autistic traits.\n\n01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.280\nBobcat is just like, yeah, I'm just this guy, and I, I kind of got into this scene, and then I\n\n01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:34.160\nstepped on the gas pedal doing this character, and then, and then that started to really punish\n\n01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.120\nmy life. So I lifted, I got sick of it, and by Police Academy nine was like, becoming self-sabotaging\n\n01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:47.680\nand like, pulled out and like, pursued my bliss, you know, he, but then you have, like, so again,\n\n01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.680\nEmo Phillips, like, Gottfried, Daryl Hammond, I hope it's not rude to refer to these people as if\n\n01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.280\nthey're like some egg basket of people that I'm implying. I met Emo, like, I did a show with him,\n\n01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.200\nand, you know, like, he's Emo, like, like, I, I, I get the feeling from my limited interaction\n\n01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.520\nwith him, it's like, after the show, he's like, hey, Jeff, you know, did I do a good job? And so\n\n01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.200\nkind, yeah, I was like, oh, thank you so much. I didn't know what I did was funny enough.\n\n01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.440\nBut he's talking it away. Did he try and do it without that for a while? Didn't, I thought he\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.920\ndid another version of his act, it was a little more. So here's the funny thing, if Emo Phillips\n\n01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.800\ntries to do that, like, that's another version of a bit that he can do. Maria Bamford does the\n\n01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.640\nsame thing. Like, like, like, she has this bit where she goes like, well, should I talk like\n\n01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:38.080\nthat? Like, and then Maria Bamford will just like, like, become her impression of what I would,\n\n01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.920\nwhat I'm going to say, a neurotypical person. I don't know what Maria, you know,\n\n01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.520\nclaims to have or doesn't have, but like, I'm just saying like, like, like she, when she does an\n\n01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:56.880\nimpression of, of a normal person, it's so funny. And then like, that's also like Gilbert Godford,\n\n01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.600\nlike in his act, like pausing over that guy, no, why would you do that joke? And then he like,\n\n01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.560\nand it's so it's also unsettling, because it's like, it, well, I hate to hate, you know, like,\n\n01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.920\nlike, my fans are sick of hearing me, the pick the peekaboo thing, but that's like, that's comedy.\n\n01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.240\nIt's like, it's like the idea that you can't tell the difference, the idea that there is no\n\n01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.240\ndifference. Like that's, that's what Neil was like, after how long were you around him, like in\n\n01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:30.240\nclose quarters? That's seven months. And what was your relationship? Like, how did it, you said\n\n01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.160\nhow it started, and then you got it broke through? What's it like now? Or what, what kind of steps\n\n01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.160\ndid you go through with him? It's fun. I think he like, came up with a routine to be around me,\n\n01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.480\nlike he came up with a behavior around me, like he behaves a certain way. We're friendly, we get\n\n01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.560\nalong. We can, it's not like awkward like it was in the beginning. Does he enjoy promoting the film?\n\n01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:52.800\nOr he loves it. He loves doing press. He loves, he loves, he would love, he loves doing stuff like\n\n01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.360\nthis. He'll complain about it. But once he's in there, he lights up and has a great time. Yeah.\n\n01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.480\nYeah. He's going, yeah, he's going. Did he, does he talk about like, does he feel more alive when\n\n01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:08.080\nhe's performing than, I mean, when? No, we talked about the movie. He's, he hates, he hates it.\n\n01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:13.280\nHe said the worst 30 seconds of my life for the 30 seconds before I go on stage. He wishes the\n\n01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.280\nmanager would come out and say, Hey, there was a flood. Here's your check. Go home. Wait, but so,\n\n01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.880\nwell, that's, but that's not quite, that's the 30 seconds before. But then he gets on stage and\n\n01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.680\nhe's okay. Yeah. Then he adrenaline hits him and he lights up. Right. Okay. I mean, that's, that's,\n\n01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.160\nthat's the thing that I like some of the comics I know is that they're maniacs before they're on\n\n01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:37.360\nstage and on stage that mania is their bliss. Yeah. Does he ever, did he talk about like,\n\n01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.280\nbecause does he remember his time on stage? Does he like black out? No, he, not in the movie,\n\n01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.480\ndoesn't talk about it, but he did tell me that there's times where he thinks he's more thinking\n\n01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.200\nabout like, whether he has to do laundry that night. Like it's so wrote for him. Like he's like,\n\n01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.600\nyou know, like, like Jagger can probably go on stage and do his act and not even think about\n\n01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.920\nwhat lyrics he's screaming out. Like he, he's that, he's that into it. Like,\n\n01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.840\nWell, I'm bummed I haven't seen it, but where can we see it now? Is it like, where is it out?\n\n01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.800\nYeah, it's going to, and November 3rd, it's going to be at IFC Center in New York City,\n\n01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.240\nwhere we opened up Harmontown. Has it had any like festival? Yeah, it was, it's\n\n01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.680\npremiered at Tribe Backets and a few festivals and November 10th, it's going to be in LA at the\n\n01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.920\nFine Art, Lemley Fine Art in Wilshire and the Lemley Monica in Santa Monica. I mean, I, I really\n\n01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.360\nwant to see it in the theater. I know that we're friends and like you've offered to like, send\n\n01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.920\nme the file and watch it or, or if you have, I was out of town and didn't know, but like,\n\n01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.920\nI'm such a fan of Gilbert's that I'm really looking forward to just seeing,\n\n01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.120\nuh, also, I like, you know, not, not to blow smoke up you, like, I like the fact that you,\n\n01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:48.080\nyour weird fetish is finding strange lifestyles and then documenting them.\n\n01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.320\nYeah, well, that's, beauty is embarrassing. It's so gorgeous. And you know,\n\n01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.360\nYeah, you've got this trilogy now of amazing people.\n\n01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.600\nBut no, I mean, I can speak from experience because as we talk about, like, you're definitely\n\n01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.960\nnot, there's all these different documentary philosophies. Errol Morris might say,\n\n01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.720\nno, I don't, there's no such thing as truth. I just want to tell a story. I, it's like,\n\n01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.920\nI'll shoot extra footage. I don't, the, the, the, the, the measly brothers or whatever the\n\n01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.640\nfuck they were. I'm not a documentary. Masal. Yeah. Right. There's, I saw a documentary about\n\n01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.320\ndocumentary masters and it was like, I was amazed to realize like, holy shit, yeah,\n\n01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.960\ndocumentary does not just mean roll the camera and what happens happens. You, however,\n\n01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.440\nthey made salesmen, right? Yeah, yeah. Like that's first Academy Award. Yeah.\n\n01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.240\nThat's kind of like a little close to what you do. I would say like, you follow around\n\n01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.200\nlonely people and it's, it's beautiful and also no, no seasoning, no lauries, no salt.\n\n01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.400\nLike they, they gather footage and then they piece it together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.080\nThat's, well, that's the, that's the thing that's tragic and like you told me that we\n\n01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.280\nasked you, say, hey man, this Gilbert thing is a good idea. And you're like, I don't know.\n\n01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.720\nNot sure there's gonna be much of a story there. You were right. It was really hard.\n\n01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.640\nBut there's not, there's not really a story. He was like, you thought I was hard.\n\n01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.640\nThere's not really a story to Harmontown. Well, yeah. Like, yeah, that's probably what it was,\n\n01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.680\nis we're coming off of like, I would have thought a year before, or before we did our time together,\n\n01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:17.360\nI would have thought fucking a make a documentary out about me. Obviously, that's what I thought.\n\n01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.200\nYeah. But then again, and then again, I was like, yeah.\n\n01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.920\nIf there is any story, like, like in terms of like story structure to it, it's almost,\n\n01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:29.520\nthe story becomes more about the audience than us. Yeah. And Spencer, his old journey.\n\n01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:36.400\nSpencer goes on a journey and the audience is like, we learn something about what draws\n\n01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.840\nHarmonians to the show. Yeah. And that like every time I watch the Harmontown movie,\n\n01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.720\nit's like, I tear up at the beautiful things that our guests say.\n\n01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.480\nI watched a movie again recently for this thing I was doing. I'm very proud of that movie. I really,\n\n01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.760\nI really, not to toot my horn, but I'm really proud of the way it came together. And I remember\n\n01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.600\nwhen you got your job back, you said, got some news for you, give me a call or something. I\n\n01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.680\nsaw you and you go, you're welcome for your third act. Yeah. At least your credit bed. No,\n\n01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.920\nthe credit bed was putting Spencer on the show. Yeah. But yeah. And it was McGathey who said,\n\n01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.560\njust, I mean, we're struggling so much. You were like editing and editing and editing and like,\n\n01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.160\nand then I remember it was, yeah, it was McGathey was like, tell him to make it about Spencer,\n\n01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.640\nyou fucking idiots, you know, like, because it was great photo that like the first day that\n\n01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:30.720\nI was with you shooting. And I fuck, who's the camera guys? Ryan Ryan. Yeah. And we were at\n\n01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:36.000\nDan's house and Dan and Aaron were kind of in a little bit of a tiff. And there's this shot.\n\n01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.320\nI just picked up my camera and I have a picture of you with your camera and Dan just\n\n01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:48.800\nlike glowering at his kitchen at the dining room table and Aaron, Aaron looking miserable.\n\n01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.800\nI'm like, oh fuck, that was day one of Harmon's. Let's all get in the bus and go around the country\n\n01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.320\ntogether. One of the first days was actually in this booth. He brought me in here when it was full\n\n01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.800\nof those taxes and there were like notary machines, the note those things that make the notary,\n\n01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:07.040\nthe stamps that was in the way of footage of that. And then after the tour, the day we got back,\n\n01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.680\nyou're standing right there. And he said, you're like talking to the camera and said,\n\n01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.120\nyes, some day we'll be podcasting. We started the tour outside.\n\n01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.600\nYeah, you have footage. I forgot. I didn't even connect that. I wasn't saying that for your benefit,\n\n01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:24.640\nbut I remember you have footage. And I said, I was in that doorway and I said, one of the douchiest,\n\n01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.960\nlike talk about Edgelord. But I remember saying in the doorway there, I was like,\n\n01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.880\nyeah, Sony always thought they knew more about writing than me. Let's see if I can run a studio\n\n01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.800\nbetter or something like that. I'm like, oh, great. What a douche. And day one, our driver,\n\n01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.080\nJason, we had this awesome tour bus outside. That's the tour bus in the movie. Jason's kind\n\n01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.920\nof underrepresented in that film, I think. He's kind of in it, right? Yeah, he's not really in it.\n\n01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.800\nHe kind of, he got really good at dodging the cameras. Yeah, he was hilarious and he was a maniac.\n\n01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:59.360\nAnd he was like a Hunter S. Thompson character. That was one of the best. That was fun, man.\n\n01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.000\nAnd we were outside. Yeah, I would love to do it again.\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.160\nAaron, outside of Starburns, right here in the parking lot, had bought 100 million t-shirts\n\n01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.400\nto bring on the bus. So we didn't have room for anything. Like there was no room for camera\n\n01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.480\nequipment or anything. And Jason, the driver's like, fuck this, I quit. I'm going back to Arizona.\n\n01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.920\nLike this is a nightmare. Like the beginning of that, I had made a prediction. And I think I\n\n01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.760\neven said it on camera to you. It's like, there's no way we make all these shows. There's no way\n\n01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:30.160\nwe get to all these shows. It's wintertime. We're going to be on the East Coast. Sick.\n\n01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.000\nAnd somehow Jason got us to every goddamn gig on time. Yeah.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.800\nHe was a genius. Did you hit Snowstorms? Oh, yeah. Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah, going to Colorado.\n\n01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.840\nIn Salt Lake City, we were up to our hips. Like it was, yeah. No, it was crazy. Like you, I mean,\n\n01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.960\nit wouldn't have been a better movie if we didn't make it to some shows.\n\n01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:53.840\nThere are people in other parts of the globe that would, yeah, like, but short of like,\n\n01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:01.840\nwell, more so than the worst turbulence I've ever been in on a plane, but slightly less so\n\n01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.280\nthan like maybe the couple of times when I thought I was drowning. On that bus, I experienced like\n\n01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.560\nmoments where I was like, fuck, we're going to die. Because it wasn't really because it was\n\n01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.320\nempirically, it was like, not as turbulent as the planes, but it was, it was the fact that there\n\n01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.120\nwas just no visual sense of what was happening. All we knew is that we were on this like road\n\n01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.320\nand that the driver couldn't see and that it was all white outside and just like, just white.\n\n01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.520\nAnd he was supposed to have chains on his tires, but didn't do it because it's bad for the bus,\n\n01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.800\nwhich is illegal, but he still got us through. Well, if you watch the extended cut, it's in\n\n01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:41.040\nthe extended cut of Harmontown, there's shots where he is ripping down the highway and cars\n\n01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.760\nare pulled over and you can hear other truckers going, oh, this guy's going way too fast. Yeah.\n\n01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.360\nHere comes his bus. He was listening to that. That's what I loved about it. He was the Elon\n\n01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.120\nMusk of drivers because he was listening to their chatter and they were going like,\n\n01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.600\nwhat the hell's wrong with that guy? And he's like, because I'm not a slave to the revenue system.\n\n01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.000\nI think it was like day two on the road because our first stop was Arizona, right?\n\n01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:10.720\nPhoenix first or something like that. Phoenix, yeah. And he had just gotten to know us and\n\n01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:17.360\ndidn't like us all that much. And we had stopped at like a Walmart or something to get like supplies,\n\n01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.000\nlike to get like, you know, drinks and fruit and food and whatnot. And I came back onto the bus\n\n01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.640\nand he didn't know that I was on the bus. He was walking around muttering to himself. He was fucking\n\n01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:34.880\nsavages, savages, savages. But that was kind of his bit. I sat down and go, oh, you Hunter S.\n\n01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.600\nThompson fan? Because that's a word that Hunter always uses. He goes, yeah. And we sat down and\n\n01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.960\nwe talked and we became friends. And gradually he loved us. Yeah. But he pretended that he hated\n\n01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.640\nour guts. Also, he was armed to the fucking teeth. He had an arsenal of firepower on that thing.\n\n01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:56.640\nWhat? Oh, yeah. Like a lot of truck, a lot of bus drivers do, they have lots of weapons to like\n\n01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.680\nsave the day. He had guns. People see that movie and they always ask me like, was that a rough\n\n01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:04.880\ntime? Was that hard? Because they see some of the shots where we're in the room having some,\n\n01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.400\nyou know, dark, intense conversations. And I always say, no, man, that was a lot of fun.\n\n01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.400\nIt was a ball. It's to eat and drink and wake up in a new town every day. Apparently when I left,\n\n01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:18.400\nbecause I left when you guys were in Denver and somewhere else. You left, yeah. I had to go\n\n01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.640\nlike to paying gigs and came back and the crew looked at me and like, oh boy. I'm like Aaron\n\n01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:30.720\nand Dan have been going at it. Apparently you guys had had a real bang up, like drunken row on the\n\n01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.280\nbus the night before. And they were like, we're happy you're back to kind of keep order.\n\n01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.160\nWe were too similar. I mean, I've been, I'm respectfully silent about our breakup,\n\n01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:47.360\nbecause number one, it was mutual. It was amicable. And more importantly, number two,\n\n01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.600\nlike when Aaron and I, when I first started talking about how we got divorced, there was a\n\n01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.160\nnight at Meltdown where one of the interns came up to me and handed me a note from a young lady\n\n01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:09.200\nin the audience. And it said, when I was a 10 years old, my parents divorced. And I had to choose\n\n01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:18.320\nwhich of my parents to live with. And you know, I chose my father and had to listen to nothing,\n\n01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.960\nbut what a cunt my mother was for the next 20 years of my life. And it never, it never changed.\n\n01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:33.920\nAnd I just want to thank you for having a divorce and respecting your ex-wife. And it was exactly\n\n01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.680\nwhat I was thinking in my head when I was like, okay, this is it. And let's, you know, Aaron and\n\n01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:45.360\nI spent our courtship and our marriage, Instagramming and talking and airing dirty laundry. And we\n\n01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:50.960\nmade a documentary and warts and all. And the whole thing was about transparency. It was, ironically,\n\n01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.080\nit was about transparency of a couple of individuals who were so into transparency,\n\n01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.880\nbecause we were both so meta, so performance oriented. Our entire relationship was,\n\n01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:07.440\nit was like a boat made of water. It was like simultaneously like the best idea in the world\n\n01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:13.040\nand the worst. It's like, you're already sinking. It's made of water. But no, it's like fucking\n\n01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:21.440\nthe best boat ever. There was, it was one in the same. We, she and I both were so meta and so it\n\n01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.840\nwas like in part in the documentary, like the reason why that added just even more twists\n\n01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.560\nand pressure was because Aaron and I would sit and watch documentaries together. And Aaron was so\n\n01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.640\nsavvy, so smart, was such a, you know, a mentor to me as a feminist, you know, I'd listen to what\n\n01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:48.320\nshe would have to say about female characters and or real people in media and how they were being,\n\n01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:56.320\nyou know, betrayed, supported, attacked. And, you know, she went into that documentary going,\n\n01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.920\nGod damn it, I'm not going to be the documentary wife. I'm not going to be the documentary mother.\n\n01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:07.040\nThis is like, it's a very, very chiefly female role about in the documentary about exceptional\n\n01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:12.320\npeople. There's like a female threshold guardian that they're talking head is all about like,\n\n01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.520\nwell, Dan thinks he's special, but the truth is he needs to eat more\n\n01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:20.880\nvitamins or whatever. And he's just like, want to throw your shoe at the TV and go, boo.\n\n01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.880\nAnd, and, and she was like obsessed with, I'm not going to be that person. And the irony was,\n\n01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.560\nyou know, and then, and then add to that, my obsession was like, Oh, I'm not going to be,\n\n01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.400\nI'm not going to be all these other people like that I have in my head.\n\n01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.880\nDid Gilbert, like with his wife or friends and family of his with, with, with their relationships\n\n01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.120\nthat were like important to the Gilbert documentary?\n\n01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.000\nHis sister. Yeah. The sister who passed away a few weeks ago.\n\n01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:48.480\nOh, geez.\n\n01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:53.280\nUm, yeah, that's a big, big part of the story. Not her passing away, but what her,\n\n01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.800\nshe has, she had cancer and-\n\n01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.600\nWere they close?\n\n01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:00.160\nVery. He, he, that's, again, I did, I knew nothing about the guy, but every day that he\n\n01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.960\nwasn't working, he would do this like three mile walk to the Lower East Side to visit one sister\n\n01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.920\nover the West Village to visit the other and then back home deeply, deeply devoted to his family.\n\n01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.640\nThat's great.\n\n01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.360\nIncredibly.\n\n01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.680\nAnd, and, and when they're together with the family, that does that, are they like,\n\n01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.920\ncause there's people who are deeply devoted to family who are like, uh, they're just always\n\n01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.880\nlike yelling at each other. And then there's people who are like best friends.\n\n01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.560\nNow there, there, the confrontations, not his thing. He, he's would never, you know,\n\n01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.280\nI think if you came out of him, he would just cower. They talk about like seltzer and, you know,\n\n01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.360\nnews, what, you know, they don't, it's like most classic older generations.\n\n01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:43.600\nWhich I now understand because, uh, it, that, that's, like, it is in this tumultuous year\n\n01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.840\nwhere my relationships with myself and everything, it's like, I, I, I just realized, oh, that's where\n\n01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:55.600\nfamily is supposed to go. Is this spot between yourself, your friends, society, and then there's\n\n01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.680\nthis, it's your family, like, and it's supposed to be conversations about weather. It's, it's,\n\n01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:08.800\nit's almost like, if you can just not hit each other and you just all recognize, I, I, I guess\n\n01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.840\nI learned that from watching Cody and our family. Yeah. That, that.\n\n01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840\nDoes that, does that affect like, I, I know about your relationship with your parents,\n\n01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:24.240\nbut as you get older and, you know, mature, do you, are you ever going to start reaching out and\n\n01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.840\ncommunicating with them? Or is it just going to be something that just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm always,\n\n01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.720\nI mean, I don't have an acrimonious relationship with my family. I, I just, there's just no,\n\n01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.000\nI just don't have the, what, what Cody has with her family and what I observe with other people\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.440\nwhere you have a, you have a, it's like the default is connection. And if there is no connection,\n\n01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:53.200\nsomething's wrong. Which to me, that I'm looking at that as an abnormal person and saying, that's\n\n01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.720\nnormal. That should be normal. Is she, is she, is her family hugged? I love you. Are they,\n\n01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.840\nyou know, we say, yeah, my family, but, and it's like weird because I'm like a bread from the same\n\n01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.400\nfamily, but it's like, I, I wouldn't have it any other way, but let's get, you know, it's like,\n\n01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.320\nand then you're going to go like, yeah, it's like, that's why we like, I think those myths about\n\n01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.640\nlike the Adams family or like misfit, you know, like when you, when you lock into like a, oh,\n\n01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.800\nthis family, they're kind of like, they do things differently. Like they're not like that,\n\n01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.720\nthat white bread family that like does things by rote, but like, but it's like, we love,\n\n01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.840\nwe fetishize those like outlaw families and things because they, they, they, they, oh,\n\n01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.160\nthey're so different and they're so weird and they're so, they have such a different way of\n\n01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.520\nexpressing it, but the default, everybody kind of agrees, every primate agrees and they're fiber\n\n01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.440\nthat like, yeah, but if you don't have unconditional kind of like a connection. And so that involves\n\n01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.640\nritual and tradition and stuff. But I think that my family, like, I think when we were trying to\n\n01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:59.920\nengage in tradition and ritual, we were so ulcerated about it. Like, like, like, like we, and that my\n\n01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.120\nparents actually had a triumph while I was growing up of, of, of going, you know what, we don't have\n\n01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:11.040\nto do things this way and that way. And for them, they had to realize that family didn't have to\n\n01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:17.040\nbe this thing about rules and stuff. Because if they, and then, but then the, and that was good,\n\n01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:25.680\nbut I'm babbling. But I was going to ask, so with our thing, it was like a big threat that, well,\n\n01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.640\nwe're getting to the end of the tour. This movie's obviously going to span the tour. So where's the\n\n01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.560\nstory? Where's the story? And that's why it was a great thing in post for Aaron to say, like,\n\n01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.680\nmake it about Spencer, we're like, oh, shit, you can make it about Spencer, he just goes on the\n\n01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:46.640\ntour, and then you're done. You got a story. Your, your two other documentaries, you're going to the\n\n01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:53.200\nperson's house, you can theoretically just keep going there forever as long as you want. Yeah.\n\n01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:02.000\nSo I guess my question to you is, like, is there, is there a, is there a point where you go, I got\n\n01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.440\nit in that case? Yeah, well, in this one, yeah, there was like his sister was really like, okay,\n\n01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.200\nI see there, there's no like, he's not doing, he doesn't do anything. He's not writing an act,\n\n01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.120\nhe's not doing one men's show. So there's no like thing to watch. He's not trying to get a star in\n\n01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.640\nthe Hollywood Walk of Fame. There was an Adam West documentary. It's like, you want to hook into some\n\n01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.360\nkind of goal. Yeah, yeah. So he's not doing that, but there was a moment where his sister let me\n\n01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.480\ncapture something that he's very much a part of. And that kind of tied it all. And I felt like,\n\n01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:33.440\nokay, that's, that's where we see him rise up. Because we hear about the Aflac thing and him\n\n01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.400\nscrewing that up and getting his job. And then we go through this whole talk about comedy's role\n\n01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.280\nin society and too soon and all that. And then we see the result of that the way he deals with that.\n\n01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.920\nBut yeah, there was a moment where I was like, okay, that's where I think we can, we can tie\n\n01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.760\nthis up. But yeah, you could, I could still be shooting right now. Like you could shoot forever.\n\n01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.160\nDo you, do you have something else? Like, are you the kind of person that has\n\n01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.400\nthree other people that you want to go document or?\n\n01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:04.560\nYeah, I'm, there's a few that I'm, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you did an interview with Piscopo,\n\n01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.600\nI'm sure when he walked out, you're like, Jesus Christ, sequel.\n\n01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.400\nKind of a million questions. Interesting guy. No, I do have a, I mean,\n\n01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.320\nI really do have a lot of questions for him. Cause it's like,\n\n01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.960\nDan and I talked, like I love that writer's room idea. Like that's, that fascinates me.\n\n01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.480\nI'm obsessed with that. But I just don't think that all, yeah, like I said, it's like,\n\n01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.800\nI was just telling him like, you got to just, I mean, yeah, just, just like, when can we just,\n\n01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.240\njust cover a writer's room for a season of television from that would be fantastic.\n\n01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.000\nWhen we came back, like Rick and Morty was in full swing and I met Justin and Rob was here\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.240\nand Dino and I was like, Hey, Dan, um, maybe we should get cameras on this. Cause these people\n\n01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.080\nare really interesting. There's also like, uh, I do a lot of shows like a theaters, you know,\n\n01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.520\nthe performing arts centers and theaters around the country and Canada and other places. And\n\n01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.960\nuh, you talk to the stage managers there that have been there a long time and all the stories\n\n01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:03.360\nthey have, it's really fantastic. I just always ask like, who is just here? And they go, well,\n\n01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.880\nAndrew Dice Clay was here and that was a little interesting. And they tell you the stories. It's\n\n01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:13.520\nso like, like, like you, you get to know a little bit about Andrew Dice Clay, but how fucked up\n\n01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:18.640\nhe was before the show. Pete on the back wall was disappeared for a while. No one knew where he\n\n01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:24.720\nthe fuck he was and then walked out and killed. Like I was completely blacked out and then just\n\n01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.840\nwent out there and destroyed. Then after the show, dead, you know, just like, like, like inoperable,\n\n01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:34.960\ncarry him back onto the bus. So interesting. Cause if you're that person's doctor and you go like,\n\n01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.360\nokay, so it looks like you're incredibly miserable. Um, right before you go on stage and do this\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.920\ncharacter that you've been doing for 40 years and then you go back to being miserable. Have you\n\n01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.200\nconsidered? But this is, that's easy for me to say because I'm not a standup. I don't have the\n\n01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.160\ndiscipline like, you know, like, like, which is going to be a dying craft. Thanks to assholes like\n\n01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:02.080\nme in this technology where it's like, I just want a guy I can relate to. And it's like, well,\n\n01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:06.000\nthen how will you ever become a Gilbert Godfrey? How will you ever become? Does Gilbert have like\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.120\nPatton Oswalt? Any depression? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, these get that, that classic thing that a\n\n01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.600\nlot of celebrities have of this is all going to go away someday. Like this could be gone tomorrow.\n\n01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:18.640\nThe phone could stop ringing. He talks about that in the movie. A lot of standups. I know\n\n01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:26.480\na lot of like really successful comedians have a certain degree of depression that like there's\n\n01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:32.240\nthere's a real, I think, I think happiness makes him depressed. Right? That's, that's a very,\n\n01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:39.440\nDino and I talk about that all the time. Like we, we consume our happiness through sadness,\n\n01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.480\nwhich if you're a biology student, it makes a lot more sense. It doesn't sound as paradoxical\n\n01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:50.240\nbecause that's what digestion is. You get, you take things in from the outside world and you,\n\n01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.480\nyou use like catalyzing enzymes to subvert them, change them and you make them into something\n\n01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:03.120\nthat you can then draw energy from and like Dino and I are like cynics. So if there's a reason\n\n01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:09.600\nto be happy, like for instance, hey, our movies nominated for an Oscar, you know, we're not going\n\n01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.600\nto just, we can't just take that form of energy and translate it into something that powers us.\n\n01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.960\nWe have to pour booze or jokes or self-loathing or self-destruction on that so we can like suck\n\n01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:29.040\nit up like Brundlefly into our system, you know, like, and I, and I do, but, but for that reason,\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.840\nI do find that like people think that I'm more fucked up than I feel, but I think that people\n\n01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:42.960\nperceive me as less happy than I am because if I'm happy, you'll know because I'm listening to\n\n01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:49.040\nM83 and like, like, like sound like I'm about to blow my brains out. But it's like, because\n\n01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.520\nthat's when I'm like, I'm Tony Stark, what's there left to do but be Bruce Wayne? You know,\n\n01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.480\nI'm going to like look out the window at Gotham and like drink a drink and be like, fuck this world.\n\n01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:04.000\nThe times that I've, that I look back on our friendship, Dan, is of like the times I thought\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.840\nof you as you're kind of your most open and happy weren't the times where you were totally on top\n\n01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.800\nof the world. Like you are happy now because like things are going well and you are happy, but\n\n01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:22.960\nwhen we were really struggling and confused and didn't know where like where we were going or what\n\n01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:28.880\nwas going to happen, like there was like a free fall like feeling of like joy in that.\n\n01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:35.040\nThere was for some of that, but then when you were successful and I wasn't, you know, I remember\n\n01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.440\nyou saying to me, we got in a fight and an instant message and something that you said that stuck\n\n01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.560\nwith me because I was like, he's right. It was like, or not right, but right or wrong when I was\n\n01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.440\nlike, listen to this, take this in that you said like, I don't even, I'm starting to tell you\n\n01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:55.840\nless about my successes because I don't want to hear you have to choke out a congratulations,\n\n01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.760\nwhich was like, you know, I've observed that and other people, it was like,\n\n01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.080\nthat's important to note, you know, because I also, now that I'm in my 40s, I'm like,\n\n01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:08.880\nah man, when we were in our 20s and we were broke, we were so happy. Yeah, but then one of your 20\n\n01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.000\nyear old, we were happy in each other's arms spiraling down a drain of eternity.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.800\nWell, we needed friendship to survive and so that felt like joy because we would hug and cry.\n\n01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.360\nFriendship is more intense and a lot easier when there's no money changing hands. That's\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:33.920\nwhat it is. Friendship, family, that makes you happy and so when you're broke, like you have a\n\n01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:40.160\nmuch easier chance of having like really strong friendships and really like-\n\n01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.320\nWell, because we needed each other to make it. Like, you were paying my bills and then I was\n\n01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:47.360\npaying your bills and then you were paying my bills. Yeah, and if we had it all to do over again,\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:51.360\nwe might go, maybe it's not about making it. Maybe we nailed it with the friendship.\n\n01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:57.120\nAnyways, but I did want to say, well, I wanted to ask one thing, which was that because,\n\n01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.160\nwell, that's something that really annoys me at the TCAs or whatever when people ask.\n\n01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.600\nAs a person who's famous for putting his foot in his mouth and saying fucked up things and like,\n\n01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.040\nGilbert's got the whole too soon experience and the Affleck firing all this stuff, like,\n\n01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.400\nI hate it when people ask me this, but I am curious about it with Gilbert.\n\n01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:24.800\nAre there any regrets? Like, would you do it different? Does he address that in the movie?\n\n01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:29.680\nDo you ask him that in the movie? Like, would you go back and like,\n\n01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:34.720\nhe's famous for that moment in the roast where he does the first 9-11 joke on like 9-12?\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.800\nThe closest we get to addressing that is that that Affleck thing only made him more popular.\n\n01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.240\nYou know, he said nothing, but he would say- It certainly put him on the right side of\n\n01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.200\ncomedic history. Yeah, yeah. Nothing he's ever done has hurt him that bad and most of the things\n\n01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.480\nhe's done has propelled him. Like, you know, Jeff Ross says at the end of the movie, you know,\n\n01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:57.200\nhe sells out. He's more popular than ever. He's gigging all the time. You know, so yeah.\n\n01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.920\nThat's fantastic here. Yeah, because that's what I always say to those people. I'm like,\n\n01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.080\nI don't know. I don't have anything to compare it to. I run my mouth. I burn my bridges.\n\n01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.720\nI fucking, but here I am. I'm very happy. Like, I don't regret anything. I don't want to go back\n\n01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.800\nin time and like say the perfect thing to the New York Times in that one interview. I'm sorry,\n\n01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.240\nI made that one joke. I'm sorry that that offended people, but like- I think that the biggest thing\n\n01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.960\nyou and Wayne and Gilbert have in common and people like you is that you're going to do it,\n\n01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.040\nbut you don't think about the money or the success or the failure. You do this thing,\n\n01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:33.280\nyou put it out there, whether it works or not. Like, I think, but I think everyone wants to\n\n01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:36.800\nbe like that. Everyone wants to, everyone we love just not push people around and be a\n\n01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.040\nraging maniac, but just people would like to do whatever they want to do that day.\n\n01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.840\nYeah. To find out, like, that's what's great about documentaries, especially, like, I mean,\n\n01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:52.080\nall film, or all good film, is that there's permission to be strange, permission to be odd\n\n01:36:52.080 --> 01:37:02.720\nand flawed, and there's like a liberating feeling when you watch that. Like, to know that, like,\n\n01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:10.240\nyeah, you can be sad and still be funny, and you can be lonely and still be happy occasionally,\n\n01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.120\nand you can, you know, you can make it and feel like a failure.\n\n01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:19.120\nYeah. So can you, can you, we don't all get to have a moment in our lives captured in an hour\n\n01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:24.400\nand a half movie. Can you watch that objectively and see a different person and can feel different\n\n01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.080\nnow, or can you- I don't know, well, I haven't watched it. I can't-\n\n01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:33.520\nI mean, like, do you feel, because you had a lot going on then, like, personally and\n\n01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.600\nprofessionally, a lot going on now, but do you feel like a happier person or a-\n\n01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:44.240\nDefinitely happier, yeah. Well, that's really weird, but I don't want to say, like, I saw a kid,\n\n01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:50.640\nlike, I call everybody kids, but like, there was a kid that made a YouTube video, I don't know how\n\n01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:55.200\nI ended up here, because I can't Google myself anymore, but I wound up on some YouTube video,\n\n01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:01.600\nand it was like, I don't know, something like Dan Harmon, it didn't say Dan Harmon's a piece of\n\n01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.600\ngarbage, and here's why, so I bothered to click on it, but it was something like Dan Harmon\n\n01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.880\nand the meta narrative or something like that, and it was, it was a guy who was talking about how\n\n01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.240\nhe has been following my career since the beginning, and he was using clips of all work from\n\n01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:26.240\ncommunity, and Rick and Morty, and the acceptable TV, and the movie, and he was explaining that,\n\n01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:35.360\nyou know, just these sort of like weird things about how, like, I don't even know how to say it.\n\n01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:41.520\nWatching that YouTube video, which included so much of the documentary, which it was a tool that\n\n01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:47.440\nthat guy used to put together a thesis that wasn't about how cool I was, but that was about how\n\n01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:56.000\ncool he was allowed to be, like how he was learning from me that storytelling, that fucking up,\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:08.080\nsucceeding, famous, rich, self-destructive, failure, impoverished, like, death, life, like,\n\n01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.520\nlike, who gives a fuck, like, like, shove them all in a thing, you're not going to get to manage\n\n01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.120\nyour image, and, like, the guy was, like, clearly drawing some permission from that to do what he\n\n01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:26.000\nwanted to do, and I was exceptionally happy in that moment that we made this movie, even though\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.440\nwe haven't made a goddamn dime off of it. How, like... Wait, no, nobody ever made money off of it?\n\n01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:38.080\nNo! We had a million t-shirts. I don't understand. I was, the reason we made that movie, to be\n\n01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:42.320\nperfectly frank is because I was watching on Apple TV, there'd just be documentaries every week\n\n01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.760\nand come up and go, I'd be like, I went backpacking across Iraq, and I sure made some new friends,\n\n01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.480\nand I'd be like, this motherfucker's rich right now, and I'm not. It was the Craigslist movie,\n\n01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:57.360\nyou can't bring another movie like this guy. I thought I'd use Craigslist to Craig some lists,\n\n01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:02.720\nthis documentary's called Craig Liston. You know what we should do, guys, and I'm only,\n\n01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.520\nno, I'm not joking, we, let's do the European tour, and then it's the Steve Levy story, like,\n\n01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.240\nlike, we have to... But just so you know, I mean, but we have to agree, we're not doing it for money.\n\n01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.560\nNo! Like, yeah, no, that's what I understand. No, you're gonna lose 100 grand on the tour bus.\n\n01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.920\nFantastic, like, a good 45th birthday present to myself. Let's do that again. I mean, would that,\n\n01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.200\nand be honest, like, is there any angle that makes you as a filmmaker want to go do that?\n\n01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.720\nOr just to go hang out? I think it'd be fun, it'd be great. Like, some of the choices we made,\n\n01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:37.760\nlike, we brought every, like, remember we brought rolls of green screen, like, we, oh, we thought, we had no idea.\n\n01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:42.960\nWe had those ear cameras, we had those ear cameras that we thought we were gonna wear these all the time.\n\n01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:48.080\nWe wore those twice, and... However, like, we got, you know, I mean, like, yeah.\n\n01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.200\nOne of you in the bathroom on the bus is really good. Yeah, you cast a wide net and I'm wearing a\n\n01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.840\nfucking lipstick cam on my ear in a drunken blackout. And the entire time he's editing the thing,\n\n01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:02.880\nI'm like, I got, I got that ear cam at home. Yeah. I got that thumb drive and I was like, I would,\n\n01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.720\nI would be like, I still got it. It's like, I was like so torn. I'm like, God damn it,\n\n01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:13.920\nyour movie doesn't have this moment. And I think it's on my ear cam because I woke up with it on\n\n01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:22.400\nmy ear and a solo cup in my hand. Well, there also is a thing that, like, I don't do drugs,\n\n01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.000\nI don't do coke anymore, but apparently the last time I did it was caught on audio,\n\n01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.240\nthat there was audio of me. Can we tell that story? I, fuck yeah, I don't care. I don't do it\n\n01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.880\nanymore, so we can talk about the past. But the last time I did it was on that tour. Yeah. And I\n\n01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.720\nhad a little bit left with me. There's two parts of that story, though. Okay. There's me hearing\n\n01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:46.560\nabout it and then me telling Dan, the first part is I was called in the edit bay and they go,\n\n01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.560\nhey, we don't know what to do with this, but there's no picture, it's just audio. Anyway,\n\n01:41:50.560 --> 01:42:00.640\nhere he goes. And it was, it was, don't stop believing. It was a super, it was a power mix\n\n01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:07.360\nof like five cities in a row. I was like, the formula didn't waver. He doesn't know anyone's\n\n01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:15.440\nlistening. It's just a small town girl. We were wearing microphones the entire time. I could\n\n01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.920\ngo to the bathroom. No one's listening. And there was a, there was a, come on down to Harmontown.\n\n01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.480\nAnd then I came in and told Dan, I said, yeah. And he goes, when, when was this? And I said,\n\n01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.640\nBrooklyn. He goes, you go, that motherfucker. I asked him every night he had any. I had some\n\n01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.080\nall the way to Brooklyn. I had some at the very beginning and then I found the rest of it at\n\n01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:43.280\nthe end, I think. That's why Coke's no good kids. Like go get a prescription to Adderall.\n\n01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:52.160\nLike Coke. I stopped doing Coke when I got my Adderall prescription. I, and I, I also stopped\n\n01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:57.120\nlying to my friends, you know, like, and stopped, and stopped like putting myself in situations\n\n01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.480\nwhere I might get pistol whipped. But the best was it was the singing between\n\n01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:04.640\nNo, that's the thing is like, you would fall in love with Jeff as a character and a sick guy,\n\n01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:10.720\nbecause it was like so faithful. The bathroom door hinges and then a classic, a standard,\n\n01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:17.600\nbeing flawlessly intoned and then a tap and then a between just between two.\n\n01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.720\nI admire your sensitivity because you asked me and said, Hey, we're not going to ever show this.\n\n01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.640\nWe're not going to use it in the film. Like you want me to destroy. There's only four people\n\n01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.440\nknow about it. I'm like, yeah, let's, let's just leave that. But time has passed when we can talk\n\n01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:44.960\nabout that. That, that trip was so fun. I want to find a reason to do that any other time again.\n\n01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.600\nYou do it all the time, but there is, you mentioned it once. There is that feeling,\n\n01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.000\nlike you do feel like a rock band walking into these clubs with your cameras. You know, it's,\n\n01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.120\nit is like a tour bus getting on and off those buses. Well, I tend to process everything through\n\n01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:02.640\nnegativity and regret instead of just going, Oh, that was so fun. But it's like the most enthusiastic\n\n01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:08.400\nthing I can say about the idea of doing that again is God damn it. I was wasting it on me\n\n01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.440\nbecause I watched the documentary and I'm like, Motherfucker, CBS don't give a shit about your\n\n01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.200\nscript. It ain't never going to be on CBS. You weren't writing it. Well, I was trying,\n\n01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.120\nbut it was like, it was like, don't like just have fun. There was that beautiful moment when\n\n01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.880\nAaron was helping you with it. When you and Aaron like, like actually were working together,\n\n01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.760\nthat was a really beautiful like relationship moment. There are people right now waiting\n\n01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.320\nfor work for me that it's like, it's like, come on, this is just part of the like, like fuck,\n\n01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:43.440\nlike, like my definition of when I was unacceptably over a deadline was as dumb as my decision to take\n\n01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:51.440\nthose jobs and as dumb as my decision to not have the time of my life in on this bus. The question\n\n01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:58.080\nwould be, am I the kind of person that just can't have fun? You know, can I not go, Jesus Christ,\n\n01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:04.720\nI'm on a tour bus. This rules. This is so fun. Well, I think that it goes back to that, that,\n\n01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:09.440\nthat stress of happiness. You find a way to screw that up maybe. It's, it's like, well, it's like,\n\n01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:13.920\nbut I've been in therapy since then, which is something that I swore against back, you know,\n\n01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:18.240\nin those days, I was somebody that was famous for my rants about how therapy's not worth it.\n\n01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:23.520\nAnd I've been in therapy since, and one of the things I've been unpacking is the fact, is the,\n\n01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:29.120\nthe possibility of being addicted to stress and misery and stuff. And because it's your comfort\n\n01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.440\nzone, because comfort's different from happiness. And you're just like, Oh, I know, I know what to\n\n01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.960\ndo. I'll be overworked. I'll have a, I'll have a deadline. I'll, I'll, I'll have shit to do. And\n\n01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:45.120\nI do think what's changed because ask anybody that's waiting for work for me right now, I'm not under\n\n01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:51.120\nthat stress, much to their sugar. And they're going to get their money back. I'm like, I've now\n\n01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:58.800\nentered this like new age, I think where I'm like, fuck work, like it's the dumbest, and it will not\n\n01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.880\nprove that you're a good person, and it will not make you happy. And so, but you're, you're, I mean,\n\n01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:12.480\ntell me if I'm wrong, your, your work is a huge part of like your identity. Yeah, no shit. And\n\n01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:21.520\nthat's, and that is both like, I'm not going to say that's the problem. Because if I like, like,\n\n01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.560\nthat's not good. Like, like that's because that doesn't last. But if your work is your identity,\n\n01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.640\nguess what? Yeah, then you stop existing. But then it's, but I mean, why do I like,\n\n01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.040\nwhy should I believe that you're ever going to stop doing that? I think like, that's, that's,\n\n01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:42.880\nthat's what you love. You love you love creating things you love getting unconditional love from\n\n01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.320\nstrangers because you made a good thing. I think the thing that'll change is just I think the thing\n\n01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.200\nthat is changing now is that is that Rick and Morty, quite frankly, if I can open source my career\n\n01:46:53.200 --> 01:47:00.000\nhere for a second, Rick and Morty was always a wonderful, amazing, incredible, fun thing to\n\n01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:09.360\nexecute. That was always about half of my overhead of living my price of freedom, the price that I\n\n01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:20.080\nhave to pay my masters in order to eat shit, fuck, jerk off, watch, sleep, blah, blah, blah,\n\n01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:26.080\nwhenever I want in whatever quantity I want, pick up the tab when I go to dinner, fly first class,\n\n01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.680\nwherever I go, say yes to any time anyone says come here, fly here. There's a, there's a, there's\n\n01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:38.480\na nut on that as they say in grody boiler room language, there's an overhead. It's a little\n\n01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.880\nover half a million dollars a year. Rick and Morty for the duration of my contract was like\n\n01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:51.680\ngenerating around half of that. So I had to like number one, I couldn't just do Rick and Morty,\n\n01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.640\nnumber two, I had to always dread Rick and Morty going the route of community,\n\n01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.160\nbecause Rick and Morty started as an exit strategy from community. So now everything\n\n01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:08.080\nthat's changed is like, Rick and Morty, it's not going to stay this like incredible like holy\n\n01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:14.320\nshit, what's this show, everyone wants to talk about it to the point where variety is printing\n\n01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:20.640\nheadlines, sadly awkwardly trying to link us to Harvey Weinstein. That's like, I mean, that's\n\n01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.320\nwhen you know you've really succeeded when there's like clickbait headlines that are like,\n\n01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:29.520\nwhat does Harvey Weinstein have to do with Beavis and Butthead? Like that's when you know\n\n01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:38.080\nyou're Beavis and Butthead. The answer is nothing except fucking clicks. So this is a show with\n\n01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:44.720\nmomentum. This is a show that I could, I can settle into and I can pay myself to actually do.\n\n01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.360\nAnd that's a huge difference from when you knew me and from the last, that's the thing that's\n\n01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:55.360\nchanged is that I can actually go, Oh, I don't think Turner's going to go out of business. I don't\n\n01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:01.280\nand so unless the world just literally like collapses, and if it does, then who cares?\n\n01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:09.360\nLike, I now can see that I can have one job. And that's that's never been the case since I was 11.\n\n01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.360\nThat's great. Well, that now get fired from it so we can make another documentary with Neil\n\n01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.280\nBerkeley. No, I want to do the documentary where I'm happy. All right. Thank you, everybody.\n\n01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:23.040\nIt's been our Harmontown. Steve, Steve Levy. We didn't even play Dungeons and Dragons. We don't\n\n01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.560\nhave Spencer. There's no Spencer tonight. Neil Berkeley. Everybody. Thank you, Neil. And check\n\n01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:34.640\nout his movie Gilbert. If you're not a Gilbert Gilbert Godfried fan already, you will be afterwards.\n\n01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.960\nAnd if not, go YouTube the hell out of him. He's one of my comedic heroes of all time.\n\n01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:44.320\nI was always looking at I was looking at the thing. It said 113. Isn't that\n\n01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:48.480\nit? Doesn't that mean that we've done less than we've done seven minutes less than two hours?\n\n01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:53.440\nYeah, but you know, okay, there's no Spencer. Let's thank Church and Nolan and Chris and\n\n01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.360\nSarah and Brendan up there doing everything for us. I like it here in the booth. It's comfortable.\n\n01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.760\nYeah. Who's that guy on Twitter that did the fuck your mama rap? Did you hear that thing?\n\n01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:10.320\nNo, no. Church, who's that guy? Anybody know the guy's name on YouTube on YouTube?\n\n01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:16.240\nHoly smokes. There's somebody.

I fucked her like a pack of Paul\n\n01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:46.720\nwalls. I saw your mama. She was in the mall. I saw her pussy and I said, that's it, y'all. I climbed\n\n01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:54.080\nup and I went in her womb. I saw your mama in a tomb. I went to New Orleans. It got flooded. I\n\n01:50:54.080 --> 01:51:01.840\nsaw your mama and said, what did that do to me? And she said, it gave you pee. And I said,\n\n01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:07.040\nit gave you pee. I need more than pee. And she said, well, I'll teach you the ABCs. And she said,\n\n01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:15.120\nA stands for, ah, B stands for, fuck, I couldn't, I couldn't, I thought that was, I thought that\n\n01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:21.520\nwas going to go somewhere. All right, yo, Neil Berkeley's mama was born in a titty, New York\n\n01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.120\ncity. Born in a titty. Came out the nipple said, it's me, my son's going to make documentaries.\n\n01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:33.120\nSo he grabbed a camera, followed her around, and he only had picture. No sound. That's called\n\n01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:40.480\nMOS, and it's from Otto Preminger, I think. No? All right. Yo, if you're a film major, what's up?\n\n01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:47.680\nWhere'd your degree get you? What's up? I dropped out of Arquette. And now I have more money than\n\n01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:54.000\nPatricia Arquette. We don't know that. We don't know that. That's unverifiable. No one's going to\n\n01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.400\nargue with it, though. It's verifiable. We can find out right now. Patricia Arquette is a wealthy\n\n01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.040\nwoman. I saw your mama. Okay, right. I can't rhyme that. Okay. All right. There we go. Yo.\n\n01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.320\nI'm not thinking of rhymes right now.

Your mom was a sandwich.\n\n01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:27.280\nI should have ham and cheese, and I got to hand it to her. She'd have a side of pickles.\n\n01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.320\nI fuck your mom so hard, she got fickle about it, said maybe I want it, maybe I don't. I said,\n\n01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.000\nwell, it needs to be consensual, so I will wait for your answer. I found it. I'm your private dancer,\n\n01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.920\nso come in, and I gave her the time of her life. All right.

The guy's name is Rob Tanchum.\n\n01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:05.920\nThere's a fucking story I have to tell about Cody that like, it's got to wait till next week.\n\n01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.920\nBut that's good that we have a backlog of material.\n\n01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:19.040\nBut can we also do, Jeff, is that if you're going to have, if you have the ability to play\n\n01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:30.080\nlive, can you find like a new age kind of like Starfield, like hypnotic thing? Let's do like\n\n01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:36.720\nimprovised hypnosis tapes for people. Are we allowed to play this on the show? Let's do it.\n\n01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:41.280\nYou want to give me the... Yeah, here's the jack. Let's just do this and get out of here because\n\n01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.120\nwe're going wrong. All right. We're not going... I mean, it's, you know, we're not going like looped\n\n01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:50.080\naround. I got karaoke to do and for an uprooted drink. Yeah. I miss my girlfriend. I've been out\n\n01:53:50.080 --> 01:54:17.840\nof town. Okay. This guy... Yo, yo, yo. Yo, this one goes down to Harmontown and all my car... This is amazing. Listen closely. I'm about to offer up a comprehensive account of all the mamas I fuck. The compilation of my copulation with the mama population from atop the college tower through the bottom of the basement. It's a common conversation far as I'm concerned because I fucked every mama everywhere around the world from\n\n01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:22.560\nManhattan to Pakistan and then back again, except a handful of nations impacted by the travel ban.\n\n01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.760\nFuck your mama on my own private island. Took a private jet. Got a wet with my privacy.\n\n01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.120\nFuck your mama in the middle of the ocean in the belly of the whale.\n\n01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:03.360\nScream all over both tips. I fucked your mama. Then she gave me a promotion. She's promoted from within because my dick is in the\n\n01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:09.840\nout there. Yeah, I fucked your mama. Yo, I'm sleeping with her, but she didn't bring pajamas though because she sleeps in the\n\n01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:18.240\nbuff with the teeth from a nustin. I stopped your mama like she was an envelope. I fucked your mama on the pile of the everstand. Don't need to lick it even because your mama's\n\n01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.800\nhella damn. But obviously I go down on her. Then I go to town on her. Then I fucked the rest of the town because I'm the mama champ.\n\n01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:32.640\nI got a mama fucking fetish. I'll say much to me. These mamas on her better lettuce. I eat your mama's pussy because she said I had to finish that before I ate dessert.\n\n01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:39.520\nYou know how mamas be getting overprotected. I fucked your mama at the dentist. She took me for a clean and put my penis in her then split.\n\n01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:45.520\nI fucked your mama on the court after a game of tennis. But she needed an abortion. So I took your mama to the clinic and I fucked her then.\n\n01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:55.520\nYour mama sucked my jacuda hole in my underwear. I said your mama because as far as names go, I'm underwear. What's your mama's name is? This is a mama dating. It's purely mama. Fuck you, Lana. Know me, mama basis.\n\n01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:11.520\nI fucked your mama. Why? Because no one told me not to now. I run a mama brotha. All for me. They always offerin' to make wafer. I fucked a billion ladies who have raised children lately.\n\n01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:31.520\nI forget the feeling. I've become a soulless mama fucking villain. Huh, strange. I feel nothing. I fucked your mama then I busted on her stomach. A couple months ago this was a rush but something changed. I've adjusted now my pulse is barely budging. I fucked your mama on the dragon in the dungeon. Your mama loved it but for me it wasn't fun. It's time to dust it.\n\n01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:47.520\nThis is the hero's repercussion but so the ultimate boom. But lo and behold, got multiple booms. Suddenly it's joyless. It feels pointless. Nevertheless, I fucked your mama on the toilet. I fucked your mama in a pond filled with koi fish. I fucked your mama with the end of Dominic's poison.\n\n01:56:47.520 --> 01:57:11.520\nWait, is it fading out? Yeah, it's a booth fade. Rob Tanchum, R-O-B-T-A-N-C-H-U-M. He just booth faded out because he's got nine more minutes of it. Well, because he could just keep going forever. He's like a tapioca pudding. I fucked your mama in Afghanistan, then back again, and a couple countries impacted by the travel ban.\n\n01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:19.520\nI'm very self-aware at the end there. No, at the end, that's what I thought at the end. He lost his joy. It got joyless, pointless, and I fucked your mama on the toilet. He's like, he doesn't even know.\n\n01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:25.520\nAlright, that's been Harmontown. We're going to booth fade out. Thank you so much, Neil Berkeley. Let's find that guy and bring him in.\n\n01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:29.520\nOh yeah, that's gorgeous shit, Rob. Thank you for that. We love you all.\n\n01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:45.520\nThat was great, it's joyless.\n\n01:57:45.520 --> 01:58:01.520\nDid you get any of that? It's a good show!\n","cpu_time":["0.002s"],"str_size":[159976]}
