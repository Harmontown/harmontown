WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
Gerald, audio.

00:03.500 --> 00:29.620
here I am

02:03.500 --> 02:09.500
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

02:20.500 --> 02:22.500
Stars in my window

02:24.500 --> 02:26.500
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
What's true

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
My eyes are closed

02:34.500 --> 02:36.500
You said you'd tell me

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
I understood

02:44.500 --> 02:48.500
I'm supposed to say something about

02:48.500 --> 02:56.500
a Harmon is now in session or

03:09.500 --> 03:12.500
I wrote that line this morning

03:12.500 --> 03:15.500
I'm so thrilled with it

03:15.500 --> 03:19.500
So I guess Harmon's in session

03:19.500 --> 03:21.500
Oh, Dan Harmon

03:32.500 --> 03:34.500
You're over there

03:34.500 --> 03:50.500
Yes, Crouch or Gillard Godfrey, everybody

03:50.500 --> 03:55.500
Hello, New York, hello, thank you

03:55.500 --> 03:58.500
It's good to be back

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
Thank you

04:00.500 --> 04:09.500
It was a 90% heartfelt, 10% awkward standing ovation

04:09.500 --> 04:13.500
I don't know who I dated in this area

04:13.500 --> 04:16.500
But they held out

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
But I appreciate that

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
I think a lot of that might have been for

04:21.500 --> 04:35.500
the Master of Entertainment, Comptroller, Gilbert Godfrey

04:35.500 --> 04:37.500
This is really a dream come true

04:37.500 --> 04:40.500
I have no connection to Mr. Godfrey

04:40.500 --> 04:45.500
I've met you 10 minutes ago

04:45.500 --> 04:51.500
But as Neil, the director of the documentary, has affiliations

04:51.500 --> 04:54.500
and somehow your name came up as a possibility

04:54.500 --> 04:56.500
for a guest Comptroller, I leapt on it

04:56.500 --> 04:59.500
I don't know how young they are

04:59.500 --> 05:02.500
or what they know of who's done what

05:04.500 --> 05:07.500
So it was basically a choice

05:07.500 --> 05:17.500
between me or the guy that played Mr. Belding

05:17.500 --> 05:25.500
Gilbert Godfrey, what the fuck, man?

05:25.500 --> 05:31.500
When I was in Milwaukee, I think I was 13 years old

05:31.500 --> 05:34.500
maybe the first time I saw you on TV

05:34.500 --> 05:37.500
I did your stand-up special

05:37.500 --> 05:40.500
I don't know

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
There's nothing funny about kissing people's asses

05:42.500 --> 05:45.500
but I'm just very, very, very, very honored

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
to have you out here

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
and thank you so much for doing this

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
I really appreciate it

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
There's probably ways you can dig up

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
Gilbert's Comedy Central, or not Comedy Central

05:56.500 --> 05:59.500
Cinemax, remember when Cinemax would do comedy experiments?

05:59.500 --> 06:02.500
Oh my God, yes!

06:02.500 --> 06:05.500
Gilbert Godfrey, Chris Elliott did a comedy experiment

06:05.500 --> 06:09.500
for Cinemax that was totally inspirational to me

06:09.500 --> 06:11.500
Stuart Pankin did one

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
and you did one

06:13.500 --> 06:17.500
that was basically a pilot about you as a news vendor

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
Oh God!

06:19.500 --> 06:23.500
Yeah! Oh shit!

06:23.500 --> 06:26.500
That was Norman's Corner

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
Norman's Corner

06:28.500 --> 06:31.500
and that was written by Larry David

06:31.500 --> 06:32.500
Oh shit!

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
Yes! Yes!

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
I didn't know that

06:35.500 --> 06:37.500
And considering all those names

06:37.500 --> 06:40.500
you think it would have been funny

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
Well, it was very much so

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
I don't know, I loved it a lot

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
It was one of the, as I said to him backstage

06:48.500 --> 06:51.500
it was one of the eight things that got me off the couch

06:51.500 --> 06:53.500
in Milwaukee and out to LA

06:53.500 --> 06:56.500
so thank you so much Gilbert for coming out here

06:56.500 --> 07:03.500
Also, Gilbert has his own podcast

07:03.500 --> 07:06.500
you just started your podcast

07:06.500 --> 07:12.500
Gilbert Godfrey's amazing colossal podcast

07:12.500 --> 07:17.500
and you can hear it on GilbertGodfrey.com

07:17.500 --> 07:20.500
and subscribe to it on iTunes

07:20.500 --> 07:23.500
and SciShow Network.tv

07:23.500 --> 07:27.500
It's such a sincere actual address

07:27.500 --> 07:29.500
and you're on your 18th episode

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
you've had Weird Alan, you've had, I think...

07:32.500 --> 07:36.500
Adam West, the original Batman

07:36.500 --> 07:40.500
Larry Storch from F-Droop

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
Yes! Yeah, I just...

07:44.500 --> 07:48.500
See, out now, man, I like to get a crowd-pleaser

07:48.500 --> 07:51.500
like Larry Storch on

07:51.500 --> 07:54.500
See, I like to get the kids in

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
with a Larry Storch

07:56.500 --> 07:59.500
and I had Marty Allen

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
Also, you try to be young in it

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
It's not like there's not things you would do

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
if it was just for your own pleasure

08:06.500 --> 08:10.500
but you do, you whore yourself out for an audience

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
with Larry Storch, you know

08:13.500 --> 08:15.500
Well, let's face it, there's certain sacrifices

08:15.500 --> 08:21.500
you have to make for the numbers

08:21.500 --> 08:24.500
I feel the same way you do

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
when I'm talking to these guys

08:26.500 --> 08:29.500
I'll do like a Gremlins 2 reference

08:29.500 --> 08:32.500
and they'll be like, what does that have to do

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
with the transgender community?

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
I had John Glover

08:36.500 --> 08:40.500
He was the evil head of the department store

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
John Glover

08:42.500 --> 08:45.500
And what was that guy's name?

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
I don't remember

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
Gallagin?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
Jack Gallagin?

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
Jack Gallag...Fanakis?

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
No, no, no, no, no

08:53.500 --> 08:54.500
Close enough

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
and Phoebe Cates

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
Thank you

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
Remember how Gremlins 2 was a strange

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
comedic departure from Gremlins 1?

09:07.500 --> 09:09.500
Isn't that weird that Gremlins 2

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
decided to be a comedy?

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
And Phoebe Cates in the first one

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
shared her backstory

09:15.500 --> 09:17.500
like, oh, I hate Christmas because my dad

09:17.500 --> 09:19.500
died in the chimney

09:19.500 --> 09:22.500
Oh, and then she does a variation of it

09:22.500 --> 09:23.500
And then it gets ridiculous

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
She goes, I hate President's Day

09:25.500 --> 09:27.500
because a man named dressed as Abraham Lincoln

09:27.500 --> 09:30.500
exposed himself to me during a white sale

09:30.500 --> 09:31.500
And it's like, wait a minute

09:31.500 --> 09:34.500
Are you making fun of me for liking Gremlins?

09:34.500 --> 09:38.500
Because I already felt kind of bad about it

09:38.500 --> 09:41.500
You're pushing it, Gremlins 2

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
Halfway through Gremlins 2

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
the movie stops

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
and it cuts to a theater

09:47.500 --> 09:49.500
and Hulk Hogan stands up and goes

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
Hey, you Gremlins, get out of the projection booth

09:52.500 --> 09:53.500
It's fucking insane

09:53.500 --> 09:55.500
You gotta watch Gremlins 2

09:55.500 --> 09:57.500
That was like similar

09:57.500 --> 10:00.500
All of you watch The Tingler

10:01.500 --> 10:04.500
Everyone here's seen The Tingler, right?

10:04.500 --> 10:09.500
And everyone here pronounces it The Tingler

10:09.500 --> 10:13.500
Well, that's the Yiddish version

10:13.500 --> 10:16.500
It's The Tingler

10:16.500 --> 10:20.500
Did you see The Tingler?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.500
Do you need a schmackle to go see The Tingler

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
down at the Nickelodeon?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
I want to wish each and every one of you

10:26.500 --> 10:31.500
a happy Tingler

10:31.500 --> 10:34.500
But in The Tingler

10:37.500 --> 10:40.500
The Tingler got loose in the theater

10:40.500 --> 10:43.500
He was a weird rubber creature

10:43.500 --> 10:46.500
And Vincent Price

10:46.500 --> 10:49.500
And at that point, they shut the lights off

10:49.500 --> 10:51.500
Thank you

10:51.500 --> 10:54.500
They shut the lights off onscreen

10:54.500 --> 10:57.500
and the theaters would shut everything off

10:57.500 --> 11:01.500
and Vincent Price's voice would go

11:01.500 --> 11:04.500
Scream, scream for your life

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
The Tingler

11:10.500 --> 11:13.500
The Tingler is loose in the theater

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
Yeah, because the way to make The Tingler

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
conveniently enough

11:20.500 --> 11:23.500
the way to make The Tingler not attack you

11:23.500 --> 11:25.500
is to scream

11:25.500 --> 11:28.500
and probably to throw money in the air

11:28.500 --> 11:32.500
Yeah, and the idea of telling people

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
Yeah, that they have to scream

11:34.500 --> 11:40.500
Well, I thought you scared us and we screamed

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
But no, it's not like that

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
Yeah, now it's mandatory

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
You have to be instructed to scream

11:46.500 --> 11:49.500
This is the part where you scream

11:49.500 --> 11:53.500
Yeah, and he said

11:53.500 --> 11:56.500
Scream, scream for your life

12:02.500 --> 12:04.500
Wait, Gilbert

12:04.500 --> 12:07.500
See, much like John Glover

12:07.500 --> 12:11.500
who was in Gremlins 2

12:11.500 --> 12:14.500
Both of them, both him and Vincent Price

12:14.500 --> 12:17.500
and a lot of them had where

12:17.500 --> 12:21.500
if someone was effeminate, it was evil

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
Sometimes it was eccentric

12:24.500 --> 12:28.500
like Paul Lynn and Charles Nelson Riley

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
But with Vincent Price, it was

12:31.500 --> 12:34.500
Oh, well, you didn't think in terms of gay

12:34.500 --> 12:37.500
So you thought, oh, he's sinister

12:41.500 --> 12:44.500
In the 70s, there were rock groups

12:44.500 --> 12:47.500
called Queen

12:47.500 --> 12:50.500
and no one thought that means gay

12:50.500 --> 12:53.500
So I was like, well, I guess the leather

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
and I guess they're tough guys

12:55.500 --> 12:59.500
or like Prince and Boy George

12:59.500 --> 13:03.500
But you really had to push mainstream America

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
hard against the wall of capitalism

13:05.500 --> 13:09.500
before they'd go, oh, you're gay?

13:09.500 --> 13:13.500
Well, it was like the village people

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Yeah, the village people

13:15.500 --> 13:18.500
Well, hey, one's a construction worker

13:18.500 --> 13:22.500
one's a cop, these are macho, they are macho guys

13:22.500 --> 13:27.500
They're so macho, they're singing about being macho

13:27.500 --> 13:32.500
They hang out at a place renowned for its masculinity

13:32.500 --> 13:35.500
Yeah, they're wearing tight leather pants

13:35.500 --> 13:39.500
and a leather jacket, that's what a real man is

13:39.500 --> 13:43.500
When they're not in the Navy, they're showering over

13:43.500 --> 13:47.500
at the Young Men's Association of Christian Boyhood

13:47.500 --> 13:52.500
And it was a major news story that Elton John was gay

13:52.500 --> 13:53.500
Yeah

13:53.500 --> 13:54.500
This one

13:54.500 --> 13:55.500
Yeah

13:55.500 --> 13:59.500
We didn't want to deal with it, we didn't want to

13:59.500 --> 14:04.500
Oh, and George Michael, who would go up in hot pants

14:04.500 --> 14:08.500
He used to dance in these tight ass-grabbing hot pants

14:08.500 --> 14:11.500
doing these, and we got him?

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
Yeah

14:14.500 --> 14:17.500
I mean, it's almost adorable how we would go

14:17.500 --> 14:21.500
The lead singer, a Judas Priest, remember that?

14:21.500 --> 14:24.500
I don't know, it's kind of adorable, actually

14:24.500 --> 14:29.500
Are the homophobia erupting into just plain sight

14:29.500 --> 14:32.500
sort of like, well, you're not, no, I mean

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
before I will say gay, I will say sinister

14:35.500 --> 14:39.500
I will say heavy metal, I will say new wave

14:39.500 --> 14:43.500
I will say punk, I will say anything but gay

14:43.500 --> 14:48.500
It's almost like a strange kind of psychic opera

14:48.500 --> 14:52.500
where the gay people of America had to actually stamp their feet

14:52.500 --> 14:56.500
and scream out loud, louder than Paul Lynn

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
in Charlotte's web, you know

15:00.500 --> 15:05.500
It sounds crunchy

15:05.500 --> 15:09.500
Louder than Charles Nelson Riley, louder than anything

15:09.500 --> 15:13.500
They had to say, no, okay, I'm sorry

15:13.500 --> 15:18.500
we've been trying to be classy about this

15:18.500 --> 15:23.500
And on Hollywood Squares, the questions

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
they ask them and they always say, now they say

15:25.500 --> 15:29.500
ooh, how Paul Lynn twisted it in his mind

15:29.500 --> 15:31.500
but the questions were always like

15:31.500 --> 15:36.500
where is fairy town located?

15:37.500 --> 15:42.500
And it's like, oh, yeah, no, that was a perfectly innocent question

15:44.500 --> 15:47.500
Yeah, what a weird twisted, yeah

15:47.500 --> 15:51.500
When did, yeah, I remember it's like

15:55.500 --> 15:58.500
On Hollywood Squares they'd have questions like

15:58.500 --> 16:02.500
so have you ever had a dick in your ass?

16:04.500 --> 16:08.500
And somehow Paul Lynn would make it sound gay

16:12.500 --> 16:15.500
And then we would, but we would still not say

16:15.500 --> 16:18.500
No one would put Paul Lynn on the cover of Time Magazine

16:18.500 --> 16:21.500
and go, gay is cool

16:21.500 --> 16:24.500
We would just go Paul Lynn's funny

16:24.500 --> 16:26.500
That funny crazy guy

16:26.500 --> 16:30.500
Paul Lynn is quite sinister

16:30.500 --> 16:31.500
He's sinister

16:31.500 --> 16:34.500
A spider's delight on my

16:37.500 --> 16:41.500
A tingler's in the theater

16:41.500 --> 16:44.500
Oh my goodness

16:45.500 --> 16:49.500
What do you really think when you, like, what, obviously

16:49.500 --> 16:52.500
is it American culture, is it modern America

16:52.500 --> 16:56.500
or does it predate America? Because we had presidents

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
in the early stages of America

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
What was his name? Buchanan

17:00.500 --> 17:03.500
Like, he was pretty openly gay

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
Wasn't Buchanan? Buchanan was like

17:05.500 --> 17:08.500
And the only reason why we don't celebrate him more as that

17:08.500 --> 17:11.500
is because I don't think he was that great a president

17:11.500 --> 17:14.500
Seriously, because I think that's why gay people

17:14.500 --> 17:16.500
don't run down the street and go

17:16.500 --> 17:19.500
Buchanan because he kind of like, he wasn't that great

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
He was like, he didn't do much

17:22.500 --> 17:24.500
But the guy was like

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
I really apologize

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
I know we have historians and redditors and stuff

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
if I'm butchering this

17:30.500 --> 17:33.500
I really apologize because I dropped out of college

17:33.500 --> 17:36.500
but as I remember it

17:36.500 --> 17:38.500
I think we had a president, Buchanan

17:38.500 --> 17:41.500
who was basically like, yeah

17:41.500 --> 17:44.500
I don't feel like getting married that much

17:44.500 --> 17:47.500
But I have this fella

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
and he's just sort of my assistant

17:49.500 --> 17:51.500
And if you remember

17:51.500 --> 17:54.500
in Buchanan's presidential speech

17:54.500 --> 17:58.500
he said, the tingling news in the theater

17:58.500 --> 18:02.500
democracy's loose among the people

18:02.500 --> 18:05.500
scream, scream for democracy

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
But I'm sad, like back then

18:11.500 --> 18:14.500
so it's like you look like

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
there was a kind of open faced sandwich

18:17.500 --> 18:19.500
of attitude of

18:19.500 --> 18:22.500
it was sort of like

18:22.500 --> 18:26.500
I usually pay extra to get the open faced sandwich

18:26.500 --> 18:29.500
When did we become a homophobic culture

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
when did we start compartmentalizing

18:31.500 --> 18:33.500
when did we go because then

18:33.500 --> 18:35.500
the other thing that we all know is that

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500
ancient Greece and ancient Rome

18:37.500 --> 18:40.500
it was sort of like, hey, whatever

18:40.500 --> 18:43.500
or was it, was it still

18:43.500 --> 18:46.500
what is the history of

18:46.500 --> 18:49.500
homosexuality?

18:49.500 --> 18:52.500
If only I could ever look this up

18:52.500 --> 18:55.500
or inform myself in any way

18:55.500 --> 18:57.500
why don't I just come out on stage

18:57.500 --> 19:00.500
and just ask questions and then walk away

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
What's the history of Gaines?

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
But I do

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
See, in ancient Rome

19:06.500 --> 19:08.500
they had a bunch of

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
they had a big structure

19:10.500 --> 19:14.500
and one guy was always the center square

19:18.500 --> 19:20.500
It was Nero, Nero was like

19:20.500 --> 19:23.500
Let him go, look at me, I'm Roman

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
I kind of want to

19:31.500 --> 19:34.500
I think I tempt fate by doing this

19:34.500 --> 19:41.500
Your Vincent Price is really good

19:41.500 --> 19:43.500
One of the things that

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
That's my crowd pleaser

19:45.500 --> 19:48.500
I used the Vincent Price imitation

19:48.500 --> 19:53.500
to get pussy

19:53.500 --> 19:55.500
Do you remember Thriller?

19:55.500 --> 19:58.500
You know, Vincent Price did the bridge

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
So a lot of the New York people

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
have been asking me on this trip

20:02.500 --> 20:04.500
because they watched the movie

20:04.500 --> 20:07.500
Gilbert, I know you've been a fan of mine for a while

20:07.500 --> 20:09.500
You know what they mean when they say

20:09.500 --> 20:11.500
why was there no rapping in the movie

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
because I'm an accomplished rapper

20:20.500 --> 20:23.500
I want to knock out all these birds with one stone

20:23.500 --> 20:26.500
and do a rap and have you do the Vincent Price bridge

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
for the rap

20:28.500 --> 20:33.500
I think if we can pull it off

20:33.500 --> 20:37.500
it can be a very, we have to do so little to pull it off

20:37.500 --> 20:39.500
You know the end of the aviator

20:39.500 --> 20:42.500
when Leonardo DiCaprio just has to get the spruce goose

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
off the water three inches

20:44.500 --> 20:46.500
If we could just go

20:46.500 --> 20:48.500
If we could just not crash

20:48.500 --> 20:50.500
It might be amazing

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
Do we have a beat?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
That's the tough part

20:54.500 --> 20:59.500
We don't really have a master music person

20:59.500 --> 21:01.500
I just want to do like a little

21:02.500 --> 21:06.500
Alright, well do we have a master beatboxer in the audience?

21:07.500 --> 21:10.500
In New York, someone knows how to beatbox?

21:11.500 --> 21:14.500
Alright, who's this emphatic hand waving over here?

21:14.500 --> 21:25.500
Yeah, come on up

21:26.500 --> 21:29.500
Oh, another stereotypical beatboxer

21:33.500 --> 21:35.500
What's your name, sir?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.500
David

21:36.500 --> 21:37.500
Okay, you're a human beatbox?

21:37.500 --> 21:38.500
Yeah

21:38.500 --> 21:40.500
You got the Morris the Cat shirt?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
I'll just stand over here or something

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
I didn't know he was black

21:48.500 --> 21:49.500
Morris?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.500
Alright, so, alright

21:54.500 --> 21:56.500
New York, what's on your mind lately?

21:56.500 --> 21:58.500
I know 9-11, but

22:00.500 --> 22:02.500
Paul Lind?

22:02.500 --> 22:04.500
What?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.500
I can't hear anything, I don't know how to

22:07.500 --> 22:11.500
I heard alliteration, but that's a concept

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
That's not really

22:12.500 --> 22:13.500
What?

22:14.500 --> 22:15.500
I can't hear anything

22:15.500 --> 22:17.500
I don't do improv, I don't do improv

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
Ebola, Ebola

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
Alright

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
Ebola

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
Ebola, that makes sense, it's topical

22:28.500 --> 22:30.500
Ebola and David your company, okay

22:30.500 --> 22:33.500
I know

22:34.500 --> 22:37.500
Let's see if we can weave those highway cones

22:39.500 --> 22:42.500
And you know, I don't think it's fun

22:42.500 --> 22:45.500
to joke about the fact that David Tukovny

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
has the Ebola virus

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
I think that's insensitive

22:51.500 --> 22:53.500
that this wonderful man

22:53.500 --> 22:57.500
from X-Files is dying of the Ebola virus

22:57.500 --> 23:00.500
You say X-Files, like it's his hometown

23:02.500 --> 23:05.500
This wonderful man from X-Files

23:06.500 --> 23:09.500
From the beautiful town of X-Files

23:09.500 --> 23:11.500
He sits over there and

23:11.500 --> 23:14.500
X-Files, Indiana, where he was born

23:14.500 --> 23:18.500
and is now dying of the Ebola virus

23:18.500 --> 23:22.500
and you people make a mockery of it

23:23.500 --> 23:25.500
Alright, so

23:25.500 --> 23:27.500
I'm gonna try to riff a couple lyrics

23:27.500 --> 23:30.500
about Ebola and or David Tukovny

23:30.500 --> 23:32.500
At a certain point it'll be clear

23:32.500 --> 23:35.500
that it's time for Vincent Price to do the

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
just the spoken word bridge, right?

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
Okay

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
Alright

23:41.500 --> 23:44.500
Dan, do you want me to lay like some creepy noises

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
like humming down for that?

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
Cause in the thriller video in that moment

23:48.500 --> 23:49.500
it was like

23:49.500 --> 23:54.500
This guy makes me ashamed to be a Jew

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
I didn't know you were Jewish

24:09.500 --> 24:11.500
I mean, I feel like if you

24:11.500 --> 24:13.500
you mean when he's doing his thing

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
like your beat should probably keep going, right?

24:15.500 --> 24:19.500
There are those moments in my life where I go

24:19.500 --> 24:22.500
maybe the third Reich was right after all

24:30.500 --> 24:32.500
You're talking a TMZ right now

24:38.500 --> 24:41.500
No, I think when Vincent Price is doing his thing

24:41.500 --> 24:43.500
in thriller, the beat is going

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
I think it's percussive and

24:49.500 --> 24:50.500
and he's like

24:50.500 --> 24:52.500
A horrid of ghosts come out at night

24:52.500 --> 24:54.500
I'll figure it out, I'll do something with my nose

24:56.500 --> 24:58.500
Jews are good with their noses

24:59.500 --> 25:01.500
The only one that can fuck this up is me

25:03.500 --> 25:05.500
Clear your head, clear your head, Harmon

25:05.500 --> 25:11.500
Take this off, would that be...

25:35.500 --> 25:38.500
It's going to drain this all over you

25:38.500 --> 25:41.500
and it's going to give you a fatal flu

25:42.500 --> 25:49.500
I'm so sad that David Duchovny is dying of the Ebola virus

25:52.500 --> 25:57.500
Why is this wonderful man from the X-Files, Kansas

25:58.500 --> 26:01.500
dying of the Ebola virus?

26:01.500 --> 26:05.500
It almost says if I feel at times in my life

26:05.500 --> 26:08.500
that I have a tingler up my ass

26:17.500 --> 26:19.500
What was your name, sir?

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
What?

26:20.500 --> 26:21.500
What was your name?

26:21.500 --> 26:22.500
David

26:22.500 --> 26:23.500
Cato?

26:23.500 --> 26:24.500
What?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
David

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
Cato

26:26.500 --> 26:27.500
My name's up here

26:27.500 --> 26:29.500
My name's on the theater up there

26:29.500 --> 26:32.500
Cato, David, thank you for David

26:32.500 --> 26:35.500
Can I get half a pound of pastrami?

26:47.500 --> 26:49.500
Thank you, David, thank you

26:49.500 --> 26:51.500
That's New York for you

26:51.500 --> 26:53.500
New York for you

26:57.500 --> 26:58.500
Alright

26:58.500 --> 27:00.500
David kissed me

27:00.500 --> 27:04.500
Now I have to do the rest of the show with an erection

27:09.500 --> 27:12.500
Let's get more intimately acquainted with the audience

27:16.500 --> 27:18.500
Actually, you know what we should do before that?

27:18.500 --> 27:21.500
We should bring out somebody that we tend to wait too long before we bring out

27:21.500 --> 27:23.500
I'm sure a lot of you people came here to see him

27:23.500 --> 27:25.500
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden

27:43.500 --> 27:45.500
Holy shit

27:45.500 --> 27:48.500
Holy shit, am I audible?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
Holy shit

27:49.500 --> 27:51.500
Okay, now I can hear me

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
It's kind of actually hard to...

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
Aaron Hillis, everybody!

27:55.500 --> 27:57.500
Aaron Hillis!

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
Aaron Hillis

28:02.500 --> 28:05.500
This is definitely the classiest joint we've ever done a show

28:05.500 --> 28:06.500
Yeah, yeah

28:06.500 --> 28:09.500
It felt when the curtain came up, but was there a curtain?

28:09.500 --> 28:11.500
Yeah, a curtain came up

28:11.500 --> 28:13.500
It felt like there was going to be a cheers reunion

28:13.500 --> 28:15.500
Yeah

28:15.500 --> 28:17.500
And the audience was like, yay!

28:17.500 --> 28:19.500
And then we were like, I don't know what to do

28:19.500 --> 28:22.500
I was like, okay, Gilbert, if you want to go out

28:22.500 --> 28:26.500
And you're like, yeah, absolutely, sure, sorry, okay, yeah

28:26.500 --> 28:29.500
See, that's the way I plan out my whole career

28:29.500 --> 28:32.500
And it shows

28:32.500 --> 28:36.500
I got to say, man, I'm so glad this is contrived

28:36.500 --> 28:38.500
I'm so glad to be in New York City

28:40.500 --> 28:42.500
See, he knows what he's doing

28:42.500 --> 28:46.500
I'm not just saying that, I'm building to something here

28:46.500 --> 28:49.500
I'm so glad to be in New York City because

28:49.500 --> 28:51.500
I can talk shit about Canada now

28:53.500 --> 28:57.500
Dan knows we were just in Canada not too long ago

28:57.500 --> 29:00.500
And you can't talk shit about Canada to Canadians

29:00.500 --> 29:02.500
I don't know if you guys know that

29:02.500 --> 29:03.500
But you can't

29:03.500 --> 29:04.500
Wow

29:04.500 --> 29:07.500
They get bummed out about it, it's sad

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
And not even in a funny way

29:09.500 --> 29:12.500
But, you know, like, okay, so we were flying to Canada

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
And we had to declare customs forms

29:14.500 --> 29:16.500
Have anyone dealt with this?

29:16.500 --> 29:17.500
Yeah, no, just me

29:17.500 --> 29:20.500
Okay, yeah, they make you fill out this form

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
They make you fill it out

29:21.500 --> 29:23.500
They don't tell you beforehand you're going to fill it out

29:23.500 --> 29:24.500
They make you fill it out

29:24.500 --> 29:27.500
But then they don't have any pens on the plane

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
That is fucked up

29:29.500 --> 29:30.500
Yeah, what the fuck?

29:30.500 --> 29:31.500
Yeah, that's fucked up

29:33.500 --> 29:36.500
I definitely agree that that's fucked up

29:36.500 --> 29:39.500
That thing with the pens in Canada

29:39.500 --> 29:42.500
And the fact that David Duke company

29:43.500 --> 29:45.500
A beloved television star

29:45.500 --> 29:48.500
Is dying of the Ebola virus

29:48.500 --> 29:50.500
Well, I feel like you're being just ingenuous

29:50.500 --> 29:54.500
I mean, you're an international traveler, aren't you?

29:57.500 --> 30:00.500
See, a lot of times gay people years ago

30:00.500 --> 30:06.500
Were called international travelers

30:06.500 --> 30:07.500
Continentals

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
We've only done, like, an eighth of the show

30:14.500 --> 30:19.500
We can't just do callbacks for the next seven-eighths of the show

30:21.500 --> 30:24.500
You obviously aren't familiar with me

30:24.500 --> 30:29.500
I could do a series out of it

30:29.500 --> 30:33.500
But this customs thing, like, for real

30:33.500 --> 30:34.500
I'm not kidding

30:34.500 --> 30:36.500
It's the Ebola of the North

30:38.500 --> 30:41.500
See, see, it still worked

30:42.500 --> 30:44.500
They bring the fucking cards

30:44.500 --> 30:47.500
And they don't bring a goddamn lump of coal

30:47.500 --> 30:50.500
But the guy who gives you forms

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
You ask him for pens

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
He's like, yeah, I got pens

30:53.500 --> 30:54.500
But they're loaned out

30:54.500 --> 30:55.500
I'll come back

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
And then he never comes back

30:56.500 --> 30:58.500
You never see that guy again

30:58.500 --> 30:59.500
And then you land

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
And there's still no pens

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
And you can't get past the border

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
Without filling this thing out

31:05.500 --> 31:06.500
Or not the border

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
You get the idea

31:07.500 --> 31:09.500
But then you can't ask for pens

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
Dustin, he went to the, you know

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
Presumably the lady with pens

31:13.500 --> 31:16.500
And asked if he could have a pen

31:16.500 --> 31:19.500
Presumably because he saw she had extra pens

31:19.500 --> 31:21.500
And she said, no, I'm sorry

31:21.500 --> 31:22.500
That's it

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
Upon being pressed

31:23.500 --> 31:26.500
She's like, no, I'm not allowed to give out pens

31:26.500 --> 31:28.500
You're not allowed to give out the pens

31:28.500 --> 31:30.500
Required for the form

31:30.500 --> 31:33.500
You have to fill out to enter the country

31:33.500 --> 31:36.500
But also, why, like, everything else aside

31:36.500 --> 31:37.500
Why can't you give out pens?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.500
What's that gonna harm?

31:38.500 --> 31:40.500
They cost two cents, like

31:40.500 --> 31:41.500
It's an entire country

31:41.500 --> 31:44.500
You can't buy 300 pens

31:46.500 --> 31:48.500
I mean, they're not at war with everybody

31:48.500 --> 31:50.500
They have money lying around, right?

31:50.500 --> 31:54.500
They're certainly saving money on, like

31:54.500 --> 31:55.500
Missiles and stuff

31:55.500 --> 31:56.500
Yeah

31:56.500 --> 31:59.500
And pens are cheaper than missiles

31:59.500 --> 32:03.500
I have a, if I could tell an airline story

32:03.500 --> 32:06.500
Then I'm afraid it's gonna turn some of our listeners off

32:06.500 --> 32:08.500
I thought that was gonna happen to this situation

32:08.500 --> 32:10.500
It's all uppercrust problems

32:10.500 --> 32:12.500
But they're engaging problems

32:15.500 --> 32:17.500
Who's that character?

32:17.500 --> 32:18.500
That character

32:20.500 --> 32:22.500
They're engaging problems

32:22.500 --> 32:24.500
Sometimes I have war

32:24.500 --> 32:28.500
I have an unengaging, alienating, horrible problem

32:28.500 --> 32:30.500
See, that was very sinister

32:30.500 --> 32:32.500
The way he said engaging

32:32.500 --> 32:33.500
Yeah, he was spooky

32:33.500 --> 32:35.500
He's like a master of horror over here

32:35.500 --> 32:37.500
If you know what I mean

32:41.500 --> 32:43.500
Do you remember

32:43.500 --> 32:46.500
What's the goddamn

32:46.500 --> 32:47.500
Shit

32:48.500 --> 32:49.500
I am legend

32:49.500 --> 32:51.500
Is that the origin of the Vincent Price?

32:51.500 --> 32:52.500
Oh, yes, yes

32:52.500 --> 32:54.500
It's just like driven by voiceover

32:54.500 --> 32:56.500
And the first hour of the movie is just him going

32:58.500 --> 33:00.500
I need more orange juice

33:01.500 --> 33:04.500
And he's like, by the way, there's vampires

33:05.500 --> 33:07.500
And then they do a remake where

33:07.500 --> 33:10.500
Vincent Price becomes Will Smith

33:10.500 --> 33:11.500
Yeah, perfect

33:11.500 --> 33:14.500
Cause two are so close

33:14.500 --> 33:17.500
Well, I think they were trying to isolate the problems

33:17.500 --> 33:20.500
They're like, it wasn't the vampires

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
It wasn't the idea that he was the best man on Earth

33:22.500 --> 33:25.500
I am surrounded by zombies

33:25.500 --> 33:30.500
The first plot point of the original Vincent Price

33:30.500 --> 33:31.500
I am legend

33:31.500 --> 33:34.500
Is having established that he's the last man on Earth

33:34.500 --> 33:37.500
In a world where everyone else is vampires

33:37.500 --> 33:39.500
Having established that he has adapted

33:39.500 --> 33:43.500
By living in a garlic-laden home

33:43.500 --> 33:46.500
He's explaining through voiceover

33:46.500 --> 33:48.500
He's sort of like George Clooney in Up in the Air

33:48.500 --> 33:53.500
Except instead of working as a traveling sales consultant

33:53.500 --> 33:55.500
He knows how to handle vampires

33:55.500 --> 33:58.500
So his voiceover is like, yes, garlic on the door

33:58.500 --> 33:59.500
I'm out of orange juice

33:59.500 --> 34:05.500
And the plot point of that movie

34:05.500 --> 34:08.500
That throws everything into disarray

34:08.500 --> 34:12.500
Is that he goes to visit his wife's grave

34:12.500 --> 34:15.500
And he falls asleep

34:15.500 --> 34:19.500
How many times does he do this a week?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.500
Like what?

34:21.500 --> 34:24.500
You fell asleep in your wife's mausoleum

34:24.500 --> 34:27.500
And he wakes up and is like, oh shit, sundown

34:27.500 --> 34:29.500
Oh god, damn it

34:29.500 --> 34:32.500
Oh shit, this is going to be hard getting home

34:32.500 --> 34:34.500
What are you doing?

34:34.500 --> 34:35.500
She's dead

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
I mean, I understand nostalgia

34:37.500 --> 34:41.500
But there's no police

34:41.500 --> 34:44.500
You could move her bones to your house

34:44.500 --> 34:48.500
Like you can make up new rules

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
About how to treat dead people

34:50.500 --> 34:53.500
You could hang her like Santa Claus

34:53.500 --> 34:55.500
From your chimney

34:55.500 --> 34:58.500
And just be like, every day is Christmas

34:58.500 --> 35:01.500
I love my dead wife and I'm safe

35:01.500 --> 35:03.500
Because she's made of garlic

35:03.500 --> 35:06.500
But he know he drives every day to the cemetery

35:06.500 --> 35:09.500
And see me valley and falls asleep

35:09.500 --> 35:13.500
I was like, oh shit, god damn it, did I do it again?

35:13.500 --> 35:16.500
Oh, there's going to be vampires everywhere

35:16.500 --> 35:19.500
And I forgot the orange juice

35:19.500 --> 35:21.500
It's like a bug's life

35:21.500 --> 35:24.500
Like the hero is the fuck up

35:24.500 --> 35:27.500
He's the reason the problem exists

35:27.500 --> 35:30.500
And I remember too

35:30.500 --> 35:32.500
If I'm not mistaken

35:32.500 --> 35:36.500
His name is Harry in the picture

35:36.500 --> 35:39.500
And they've got these zombies

35:39.500 --> 35:42.500
The futuristic vampire's going

35:42.500 --> 35:45.500
Harry

35:45.500 --> 35:48.500
And I thought, even as a kid

35:48.500 --> 35:51.500
It's not scary having monster gel Harry

35:51.500 --> 35:54.500
Melvin

35:54.500 --> 35:57.500
Schmoole

35:57.500 --> 36:01.500
Schleimey

36:01.500 --> 36:03.500
Maybe Clint

36:03.500 --> 36:07.500
What would be the scariest name to moan?

36:07.500 --> 36:11.500
Lloyd

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
Lloyd is good

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Lloyd is good

36:15.500 --> 36:17.500
When the shining came out

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
I was really freaked out

36:19.500 --> 36:22.500
Because my dad was kind of a Nicholson figure

36:22.500 --> 36:25.500
And I was Danny's age

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
And my name was Danny

36:27.500 --> 36:30.500
And my very Nicholson-like dad

36:30.500 --> 36:34.500
Was very embodied by Nicholson

36:34.500 --> 36:36.500
Who was saying to...

36:36.500 --> 36:38.500
Shelly Duvall was very much like my mom

36:38.500 --> 36:41.500
She was kind of like flighty and nervous

36:41.500 --> 36:43.500
My parents, for some reason

36:43.500 --> 36:45.500
I guess because Kubrick directed it

36:45.500 --> 36:48.500
I was allowed to watch The Shining at 10

36:48.500 --> 36:51.500
Like, yeah, I guess it's either this

36:51.500 --> 36:54.500
Or tit fraternity

36:54.500 --> 36:57.500
Which I was also allowed to watch

36:57.500 --> 37:00.500
But my mom would cover my eyes

37:00.500 --> 37:03.500
From behind when there were tits on the screen

37:03.500 --> 37:07.500
Because there's nothing fucked up about that

37:07.500 --> 37:10.500
Oh, I'm starting to see tits

37:10.500 --> 37:14.500
Now gently caressing from behind

37:14.500 --> 37:18.500
The alabaster hands of the woman

37:18.500 --> 37:21.500
Who gave me life

37:21.500 --> 37:25.500
Playing reverse peek-a-boo with me

37:25.500 --> 37:27.500
That didn't...

37:27.500 --> 37:30.500
That certainly didn't mess things up for my marriage

37:30.500 --> 37:33.500
But it's Nicholson the whole movie going

37:33.500 --> 37:36.500
Do you want to talk about Danny?

37:36.500 --> 37:38.500
Where's Danny?

37:38.500 --> 37:41.500
And I was Danny, it was fucked up

37:41.500 --> 37:45.500
And Nicholson was nuts to begin with

37:45.500 --> 37:46.500
In that movie

37:46.500 --> 37:48.500
That's what got me

37:48.500 --> 37:50.500
He was crazy at the beginning

37:50.500 --> 37:52.500
And then the big thing is that

37:52.500 --> 37:56.500
He goes crazy

37:56.500 --> 38:00.500
Yeah, what if Nicholson goes crazy?

38:00.500 --> 38:04.500
It's like if Herbie the Lovebug

38:04.500 --> 38:08.500
Was a Formula One car in the beginning

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
Totally different story

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
Pretty effective movie

38:12.500 --> 38:15.500
Did you see that documentary, The Shining Documentary

38:15.500 --> 38:18.500
Where all the people's theories

38:18.500 --> 38:20.500
Thank you, how many of you have seen

38:20.500 --> 38:22.500
The Shining Documentary?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.500
Five

38:24.500 --> 38:27.500
See, it's too easy and applause get her

38:27.500 --> 38:30.500
It's like yelling, hey, how many of you

38:30.500 --> 38:33.500
Are from Brooklyn?

38:33.500 --> 38:36.500
And in Brooklyn, you would watch

38:36.500 --> 38:39.500
The Shining Documentary

38:39.500 --> 38:42.500
Woo!

38:42.500 --> 38:45.500
It's that kind of crowd

38:45.500 --> 38:48.500
The Shining Documentary is as popular as Brooklyn

38:48.500 --> 38:51.500
It is

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
What the hell are we talking about?

38:53.500 --> 38:56.500
I don't want to go off on air

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
Oh, okay, so I took this huge gross shit

38:58.500 --> 39:00.500
On the airplane

39:00.500 --> 39:04.500
Can we just talk about

39:04.500 --> 39:07.500
The airplane bathroom

39:07.500 --> 39:09.500
And the toilets?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.500
That's why I came here

39:11.500 --> 39:16.500
I think it's amazing that airplane toilets

39:16.500 --> 39:20.500
Are designed with the apparent presupposition

39:20.500 --> 39:25.500
That turds are like cartoon turds

39:25.500 --> 39:28.500
That they're like candy bars that come out of your butt

39:28.500 --> 39:33.500
And fall with heavy dry weight

39:33.500 --> 39:36.500
Down into the bottom of this hopper

39:36.500 --> 39:38.500
That's basically dry

39:38.500 --> 39:40.500
And you push a button and a suction pulls it through

39:40.500 --> 39:42.500
And there's a little bit of water that's just sort of like

39:42.500 --> 39:47.500
You know, it's like vermouth for a martini

39:47.500 --> 39:52.500
Sometimes you just wave the bottle around the glass

39:52.500 --> 39:56.500
It's symbolic, but by and large you're dependent on just air

39:56.500 --> 39:58.500
Like, oh, I'm in an airplane

39:58.500 --> 40:03.500
So guess what, sometimes a red eye from L.A. to New York

40:03.500 --> 40:09.500
I'm not serving up baby roots

40:09.500 --> 40:11.500
You're serving up Indian food

40:11.500 --> 40:15.500
And so you press the button and the thing goes

40:15.500 --> 40:19.500
And then you look down and you go, Jesus Christ

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
Nothing happened

40:21.500 --> 40:25.500
It just evened it out

40:25.500 --> 40:28.500
It just looks like

40:28.500 --> 40:32.500
It just looks like a college prank now

40:32.500 --> 40:36.500
It just looks like I did something on purpose

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
Some woman's going to come in here next

40:38.500 --> 40:41.500
Because there's no men's and women's rooms on the airplane

40:41.500 --> 40:43.500
That's the other fucked up thing

40:43.500 --> 40:46.500
It's like, Jesus Christ, I'm in a metal tube

40:46.500 --> 40:48.500
I'm already stinking the joint up

40:48.500 --> 40:51.500
I just, look what I've done

40:51.500 --> 40:57.500
Today on the red eye from L.A. to New York

40:57.500 --> 41:01.500
I did something I've never had to do in my life on an airplane

41:01.500 --> 41:03.500
Because I was in that situation

41:03.500 --> 41:09.500
And I had a choice between walking out and leaving this situation

41:09.500 --> 41:12.500
I don't want to, I did this scene

41:12.500 --> 41:18.500
This, this, this, this, this

41:18.500 --> 41:22.500
I'm trying to find the, I don't want to

41:22.500 --> 41:26.500
There was just so much

41:26.500 --> 41:29.500
That it was like anyone that came in no matter what they were going to do

41:29.500 --> 41:32.500
They were going to feel like

41:32.500 --> 41:37.500
This is business class

41:37.500 --> 41:41.500
And then they were going to come out of the bathroom

41:41.500 --> 41:45.500
And look around at the six other people

41:45.500 --> 41:48.500
And land their eyes on me playing Minecraft

41:48.500 --> 41:52.500
And I'd be like, yeah

41:52.500 --> 41:56.500
So I just, I really, it was beyond embarrassment

41:56.500 --> 41:59.500
It was more like, honestly, I was empathy

41:59.500 --> 42:02.500
I was like, what would I want to encounter when I came back into a bathroom

42:02.500 --> 42:04.500
When I came into a bathroom

42:04.500 --> 42:07.500
It was to the point where it was kind of like, it was fucked up

42:07.500 --> 42:10.500
It was like a scene in the bowl

42:10.500 --> 42:13.500
And I, please appreciate my candor

42:13.500 --> 42:16.500
And I'm sorry if you listen to this podcast with your family while you eat

42:16.500 --> 42:20.500
And I, it's too far gone now

42:20.500 --> 42:23.500
But I just want to confess to you

42:23.500 --> 42:25.500
I just want to explain this to you

42:25.500 --> 42:27.500
For the best possible reasons in the world

42:27.500 --> 42:30.500
So the dry paper towels from the hand dispenser

42:30.500 --> 42:33.500
And I like went down in there

42:33.500 --> 42:37.500
And I was like, I just kind of like shoved

42:37.500 --> 42:42.500
And kind of like, I was just like, just something needs to touch this

42:42.500 --> 42:47.500
No water is touching it, so mankind needs to step in

42:47.500 --> 42:52.500
And I just like kind of, and then I created like

42:52.500 --> 42:57.500
Sort of like a, like a, like I don't know what it, a musket

42:57.500 --> 43:04.500
Like what the, you know, like a, like a, like a, like a, you know, like a package

43:04.500 --> 43:08.500
Kind of just like, a tingler, yeah

43:08.500 --> 43:10.500
And then I pressed the flush button again

43:10.500 --> 43:13.500
And there's always that pause and you're like, does it, does the button do anything?

43:13.500 --> 43:18.500
And I go, you know, and it was like, it still didn't do anything

43:18.500 --> 43:21.500
It just sucked the paper towels through and there was just more

43:21.500 --> 43:25.500
It just, it just, it still looked like something had happened

43:25.500 --> 43:28.500
And I, so I did it again and I did it more

43:28.500 --> 43:33.500
And I, I just kept flushing and I, I gradually, and I also like

43:33.500 --> 43:36.500
I was washing my hands and I took this hot soapy water

43:36.500 --> 43:41.500
And I was like, okay, and I took a, I was like, and I, and I, I

43:41.500 --> 43:45.500
Took it over from the sink and dropped it into the toilet

43:45.500 --> 43:49.500
Like this, this just needs like a dose of what a normal toilet has

43:49.500 --> 43:52.500
This happens every day, nothing changed about my ass

43:52.500 --> 43:55.500
Like, like, like this toilet needs to be like a normal toilet

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
It just needs water in it

43:57.500 --> 44:00.500
And, and, and, and so like, like, like nine flushes

44:00.500 --> 44:03.500
And I brush my hand and I have to do the thing and I, and I

44:03.500 --> 44:06.500
At a certain point, there's always that point in the bathroom

44:06.500 --> 44:09.500
If you're in there too long, the light comes out and says

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
Please return to your seat

44:11.500 --> 44:13.500
And you always take it personally

44:13.500 --> 44:16.500
Like you're like, they know

44:16.500 --> 44:19.500
They're talking to me, like, like, they're like, you, you

44:19.500 --> 44:21.500
Return to your seat

44:21.500 --> 44:24.500
And I, and I came out and then the flight attendant like

44:24.500 --> 44:27.500
Met me face to face as I came out

44:27.500 --> 44:31.500
And she looked at me helpfully

44:31.500 --> 44:34.500
And said, and I, I wrote it down

44:38.500 --> 44:42.500
When I got back to my seat, including the apostrophe

44:42.500 --> 44:46.500
She said, you doing okay?

44:49.500 --> 44:55.500
And I, and I must have looked like, like, like James Woods

44:55.500 --> 44:59.500
Like a, like a, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah

44:59.500 --> 45:03.500
Like, I was like, I was like a weird smuggler character

45:03.500 --> 45:06.500
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I, I think she was asking

45:06.500 --> 45:09.500
Why did you have to flush nine times?

45:09.500 --> 45:14.500
And I wanted to say, because your toilet isn't made for poop

45:14.500 --> 45:16.500
Because I care

45:16.500 --> 45:19.500
Because I'm a better toilet than your toilet

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
It's not because there's anything wrong with me

45:21.500 --> 45:24.500
It's because I know how society works

45:24.500 --> 45:26.500
And your plane doesn't

45:26.500 --> 45:28.500
So land it

45:28.500 --> 45:31.500
And, and let me, let me go do a show

45:31.500 --> 45:34.500
And, and yeah, that's, that's what I

45:34.500 --> 45:37.500
See, I flew back from LA

45:37.500 --> 45:41.500
And I didn't even take a shit on the plane

45:41.500 --> 45:44.500
I went into the bedroom, oh, bathroom

45:44.500 --> 45:47.500
And the restroom, whatever they call it on a plane

45:47.500 --> 45:51.500
And, and there was shit

45:51.500 --> 45:53.500
Filled in the toilet

45:53.500 --> 45:56.500
And I said, I got to get out of here

45:56.500 --> 45:59.500
Because they're all going to blame me

45:59.500 --> 46:01.500
There's that too

46:01.500 --> 46:06.500
And sure enough, when I walk out like the prettiest girl

46:06.500 --> 46:09.500
On the plane walks in there

46:09.500 --> 46:13.500
And I felt like, you know, should I go over to her

46:13.500 --> 46:16.500
And say, no, that wasn't me who took a shit

46:16.500 --> 46:18.500
That was someone else

46:18.500 --> 46:20.500
I, I looked at the shit

46:20.500 --> 46:22.500
Yeah, yeah, I, I saw it

46:22.500 --> 46:24.500
I'm on the same page as you

46:24.500 --> 46:28.500
But I want to know, I was against it

46:28.500 --> 46:31.500
Yeah

46:31.500 --> 46:35.500
Yeah, it's, it's funny how we all have these butts

46:35.500 --> 46:39.500
With poop coming out of them all the time

46:39.500 --> 46:42.500
Like, like up to three times a day

46:42.500 --> 46:45.500
And then around that we've built this society

46:45.500 --> 46:49.500
In which there's so much room for so much nuance

46:49.500 --> 46:52.500
But, but there's like an umbilical point

46:52.500 --> 46:55.500
Which is their fucking shitty assholes

46:55.500 --> 46:57.500
You can really be reduced

46:57.500 --> 47:00.500
Now, how do you feel about those toilets?

47:00.500 --> 47:02.500
Like, I remember when I was a kid

47:02.500 --> 47:05.500
You could drop a concrete block in a toilet

47:05.500 --> 47:07.500
And it would flush it

47:07.500 --> 47:10.500
And now it does, it's silent

47:10.500 --> 47:12.500
There are these toilets like poop

47:12.500 --> 47:13.500
Kind of simmers and

47:13.500 --> 47:15.500
And yeah, you don't even see the water moving

47:15.500 --> 47:17.500
You don't hear anything

47:17.500 --> 47:19.500
Yeah, because it's good for the environment

47:19.500 --> 47:20.500
Oh yes

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
Because, because, because that's where

47:22.500 --> 47:24.500
What's killing the planet

47:24.500 --> 47:26.500
Was us flushing

47:26.500 --> 47:29.500
It wasn't, it wasn't anything to do with

47:29.500 --> 47:32.500
The behavior of giant manufacturers

47:32.500 --> 47:34.500
And transglomerates

47:34.500 --> 47:37.500
Like, like, like, like, it, yeah

47:37.500 --> 47:39.500
It's definitely, isn't that amazing

47:39.500 --> 47:41.500
How every time the fuck, there's a giant

47:41.500 --> 47:43.500
Like impending disaster

47:43.500 --> 47:46.500
Like, it always just trickles down to us

47:46.500 --> 47:49.500
And people go like, floss twice

47:49.500 --> 47:51.500
Floss twice

47:51.500 --> 47:54.500
Floss twice and never use the same string

47:54.500 --> 47:57.500
Or wait, use the same string three times

47:57.500 --> 48:00.500
And then, and then wear that as a hat

48:00.500 --> 48:03.500
If everyone does that

48:03.500 --> 48:07.500
It'll affect the stringy thing

48:07.500 --> 48:10.500
And we're like, okay, I'm a human being

48:10.500 --> 48:12.500
So I certainly don't want to kill the planet

48:12.500 --> 48:15.500
And then it's like, it had nothing to do with that

48:15.500 --> 48:18.500
It doesn't have anything to do with your fucking garbage

48:18.500 --> 48:19.500
Like, like, like

48:19.500 --> 48:22.500
I remember the news was reporting when

48:22.500 --> 48:26.500
When Ronald Reagan, when he was president

48:26.500 --> 48:27.500
And he got shot

48:27.500 --> 48:30.500
And a newscaster actually said

48:30.500 --> 48:33.500
If the president is shot at

48:33.500 --> 48:35.500
How safe are we?

48:45.500 --> 48:49.500
Yeah, that's a good, it's a good, good, good, good

48:49.500 --> 48:51.500
Opportunity, that, yeah

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
More guns out there

48:53.500 --> 48:56.500
Oh, Reagan

48:58.500 --> 49:01.500
Alright, so Gilbert, we're friends now

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
Oh, yes, we're inseparable

49:03.500 --> 49:06.500
So, you and me

49:06.500 --> 49:09.500
We're gonna be partners, you and me

49:12.500 --> 49:16.500
You and me, when all our friendships file

49:16.500 --> 49:18.500
We'll travel

49:18.500 --> 49:22.500
See, I knew all of you came here

49:22.500 --> 49:25.500
To see a Martin and Louis invitation

49:29.500 --> 49:31.500
It's New York, baby

49:31.500 --> 49:34.500
I just, I don't know how to do this

49:34.500 --> 49:37.500
Because if I were, like, my big thing is like

49:37.500 --> 49:40.500
If somebody solicits something

49:40.500 --> 49:42.500
Then it's hard for me to do

49:42.500 --> 49:45.500
I just, I just, I just

49:45.500 --> 49:49.500
Your Seinfeld impression is kind of legendary

49:49.500 --> 49:51.500
Like, like, like you

49:51.500 --> 49:55.500
Yeah, I used to, I started imitating Seinfeld

49:55.500 --> 49:58.500
Before anyone knew who he was

49:58.500 --> 50:01.500
When he was just another comic in the clubs

50:01.500 --> 50:05.500
And I was just, I would go on stage and imitate Seinfeld

50:05.500 --> 50:08.500
And the other comics and the waitresses

50:08.500 --> 50:12.500
Would be laughing and applauding and they'd come in

50:12.500 --> 50:15.500
And the one person who wouldn't come in the room

50:15.500 --> 50:18.500
When I was doing that was Seinfeld

50:18.500 --> 50:21.500
Who then was named Jerry

50:21.500 --> 50:23.500
Yeah, he was just playing Jerry

50:23.500 --> 50:26.500
And he would, he'd be walking angrily

50:26.500 --> 50:29.500
Back and forth in the bar going

50:29.500 --> 50:32.500
That doesn't sound anything like me

50:32.500 --> 50:37.500
I don't have a high-pitched, annoying voice

50:41.500 --> 50:45.500
I don't have a high-pitched, annoying voice

50:52.500 --> 50:55.500
You see, sometimes I wonder if

50:55.500 --> 50:58.500
Seinfeld has any opinions about

50:58.500 --> 51:02.500
Uh, patio furniture

51:04.500 --> 51:08.500
Why do people want patio furniture?

51:08.500 --> 51:11.500
Is it because they need furniture

51:11.500 --> 51:14.500
For their patio?

51:18.500 --> 51:21.500
You could basically say anything

51:21.500 --> 51:26.500
It's like, why do people put cream in their coffee?

51:26.500 --> 51:30.500
Is it because they want coffee with cream?

51:40.500 --> 51:44.500
Dan, Dan, don't you have a Jerry McSeinfeld?

51:48.500 --> 51:52.500
I think, yeah, we have a podcast character, Jerry McSeinfeld

51:52.500 --> 51:55.500
I'm usually pretty drunk when I...

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
And I'm drunk now

51:57.500 --> 52:00.500
I can't, I'm assuming that Jerry McSeinfeld

52:00.500 --> 52:03.500
Sounds like, oh, why?

52:03.500 --> 52:07.500
Have you ever noticed that

52:07.500 --> 52:10.500
Clovers have...

52:10.500 --> 52:13.500
Why do they have to have four leaves?

52:15.500 --> 52:18.500
Why can't they have three?

52:18.500 --> 52:21.500
But, I mean, that's, I don't think that

52:21.500 --> 52:23.500
We should take that up right now

52:23.500 --> 52:27.500
I'm known, I'm known for my Irish...

52:27.500 --> 52:31.500
My Irish Vincent Price

52:35.500 --> 52:39.500
That tingler is loose in the theatre

52:39.500 --> 52:42.500
Oh, be careful now

52:42.500 --> 52:45.500
Oh, the tingler's coming for ya

52:45.500 --> 52:47.500
Oh, the lights are out

52:47.500 --> 52:52.500
You're gonna have to scream and tell your friends about this movie

52:52.500 --> 52:56.500
Scream, scream for your lives

53:00.500 --> 53:03.500
I'm glad that happens

53:08.500 --> 53:10.500
I wanna, can I complain about subways for a second?

53:10.500 --> 53:12.500
Your subways are amazing, they're so good

53:12.500 --> 53:14.500
Everybody, you have great subways

53:14.500 --> 53:18.500
But there's this sense of impending doom you feel on the subway

53:18.500 --> 53:21.500
Because underground you don't have your phone, obviously

53:21.500 --> 53:23.500
I mean, you have it, but it doesn't work

53:23.500 --> 53:25.500
But like, and then you could go above ground

53:25.500 --> 53:28.500
So you always actually have your phone service

53:28.500 --> 53:30.500
But you feel trapped, it's probably the iron bars

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
I'm not gonna lie

53:32.500 --> 53:36.500
But what really traps you is the fact that to go outside

53:36.500 --> 53:40.500
And then come back in just to check a text message costs two dollars

53:40.500 --> 53:44.500
And that two dollars is slavery

53:44.500 --> 53:46.500
It traps everyone underground

53:46.500 --> 53:48.500
And makes them all stressed out

53:48.500 --> 53:51.500
Because they don't wanna pay two dollars

53:51.500 --> 53:53.500
That's not going anywhere, I don't know

53:53.500 --> 53:57.500
They can't just put cell phones, like, repeaters down there?

53:57.500 --> 54:00.500
Well, I don't know, they don't do that, right? Yeah

54:00.500 --> 54:02.500
You're trapped underground

54:02.500 --> 54:06.500
But you're never trapped, you can always just walk up a stairwell

54:06.500 --> 54:10.500
You just have to pay another two dollars to get back under

54:10.500 --> 54:16.500
One of the trains I'm being told, I'm just being informed

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
One of the trains has cell service

54:18.500 --> 54:21.500
You know, when I was a kid, I think everything's changed now

54:21.500 --> 54:26.500
Because I know, like, you know, there's that concept of the graffiti-laden subway trains

54:26.500 --> 54:27.500
They're really nice

54:27.500 --> 54:29.500
Yeah, they're kind of nice now

54:29.500 --> 54:32.500
And I remember riding on them in the early aughts

54:32.500 --> 54:34.500
But...

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
That's the year 2000

54:36.500 --> 54:40.500
Growing up, when you're watching movies, it's just like the subways are like these things

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
They rumble and they're like movie sets, you know?

54:42.500 --> 54:46.500
These gang members come out and they're like

54:46.500 --> 54:48.500
Attention, people!

54:48.500 --> 54:52.500
And everyone reads their newspaper with their umbrellas

54:52.500 --> 54:54.500
And goes like, oh, I won't pay attention

54:54.500 --> 54:56.500
And that's the tyranny of the city

54:56.500 --> 55:01.500
And they're like, I am warlord...

55:01.500 --> 55:04.500
Leon Saxon

55:04.500 --> 55:08.500
And you are my subsidiaries

55:08.500 --> 55:12.500
And then the whole point of the story is that some guy stands up and goes

55:12.500 --> 55:18.500
I've had it with you!

55:18.500 --> 55:21.500
And I don't know how much of that is based on truth

55:21.500 --> 55:25.500
I've ridden the subway a couple of times and none of that happened

55:25.500 --> 55:28.500
But I assume that doesn't happen every time

55:28.500 --> 55:34.500
But I mean, I've seen enough of The Last Dragon to know...

55:34.500 --> 55:38.500
To know that Converse are kissed and...

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
Alright, anyways

55:40.500 --> 55:43.500
I feel like we should meet people from New York

55:43.500 --> 55:49.500
I don't know if this is indicative of our runtime

55:49.500 --> 55:52.500
But Erin texted me, Erin's sick, she's back in LA

55:52.500 --> 55:55.500
She texted me a minute ago and said, how did it go?

55:55.500 --> 55:58.500
That's 10.33pm

55:58.500 --> 56:00.500
And I'm like, well, it went...

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
Erin, that's her name

56:01.500 --> 56:03.500
It's going

56:03.500 --> 56:06.500
Yeah, we should get someone from the balcony, though, if that's okay

56:06.500 --> 56:09.500
At least one person

56:09.500 --> 56:12.500
No one on the bottom floor is applauding that idea

56:12.500 --> 56:15.500
What are we really basing on?

56:15.500 --> 56:18.500
I don't know, we've had a couple balcony shows

56:18.500 --> 56:24.500
Gilbert, is there any kind of person you've ever wanted to talk to?

56:24.500 --> 56:30.500
No, so let's skip this whole segment of the show

56:30.500 --> 56:34.500
If someone in the balcony would like to leap

56:41.500 --> 56:44.500
I mean, what's that?

56:44.500 --> 56:49.500
You're in pain

56:49.500 --> 56:53.500
There's that, she's in pain

56:53.500 --> 56:56.500
We've got that as a fallback

56:56.500 --> 56:58.500
She is in pain

56:58.500 --> 57:00.500
I asked that sometimes, I go, who's in pain?

57:00.500 --> 57:03.500
Because it's like the opposite of comedy in my shtick as Irene

57:03.500 --> 57:06.500
And we meet interesting people

57:06.500 --> 57:09.500
But rarely are they actually in pain, I've noticed

57:09.500 --> 57:13.500
Well, sometimes the pain that throbs the hardest with them

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
is the lack of being on stage

57:15.500 --> 57:18.500
I just...

57:18.500 --> 57:20.500
Like a lot of times, they're like...

57:20.500 --> 57:22.500
Ow!

57:22.500 --> 57:26.500
My spotlight bone is killing me

57:26.500 --> 57:29.500
One of these days, I just want someone who's actually

57:29.500 --> 57:31.500
just has a back problem or something

57:31.500 --> 57:34.500
He's loving life, he's having a great time

57:34.500 --> 57:37.500
She's saying she's really in pain

57:37.500 --> 57:43.500
I think God's telling us that we should indulge this young lady

57:43.500 --> 57:47.500
down in front of her

57:47.500 --> 57:50.500
I say we roll the dice

57:50.500 --> 57:53.500
Because the alternative is that we kind of like, I don't know

57:53.500 --> 57:57.500
It seems out I'm in pain and we ignore her and it's a joke

57:57.500 --> 58:00.500
I don't like what that says about the society

58:00.500 --> 58:02.500
You've got a back problem

58:02.500 --> 58:04.500
What's your name, young lady?

58:04.500 --> 58:08.500
Lana, let's thank Lana for coming up

58:08.500 --> 58:11.500
Let's see

58:11.500 --> 58:16.500
Sit down and let's get to know your pain a little bit

58:16.500 --> 58:19.500
Yeah, it's tough

58:19.500 --> 58:22.500
Have a seat

58:22.500 --> 58:26.500
You're trying to endear them with an apparent stage fright

58:26.500 --> 58:28.500
after going, I'm in pain!

58:28.500 --> 58:30.500
I want to be up there

58:30.500 --> 58:32.500
I am an actual fan

58:32.500 --> 58:35.500
But you're also not like, holy fuck, there's a bunch of people

58:35.500 --> 58:38.500
No, I am, it's wonderful

58:38.500 --> 58:40.500
Also, hello

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
Hello

58:42.500 --> 58:44.500
What's...

58:44.500 --> 58:48.500
Did you meet Gilbert Gottfried?

58:48.500 --> 58:51.500
Holy motherfucking shit, it's Gilbert Gottfried

58:51.500 --> 58:53.500
Yeah, also...

58:53.500 --> 58:55.500
I'm here too, hey, hey, hey

58:55.500 --> 58:58.500
Hi, hey, hi, hey

59:01.500 --> 59:04.500
Hi, I'm sorry

59:04.500 --> 59:07.500
Holy motherfucking shit

59:07.500 --> 59:10.500
It's not that hard, is it? I mean, come on, he did it

59:10.500 --> 59:13.500
What's going on with your back?

59:13.500 --> 59:17.500
My back has this weird thing

59:17.500 --> 59:21.500
It's... because I'm an Ashkenazi Jew

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
So...

59:23.500 --> 59:26.500
So I'm inbred as balls

59:26.500 --> 59:28.500
So...

59:28.500 --> 59:30.500
Fill me in on the Ashkenazi thing, Gilbert Gottfried

59:30.500 --> 59:32.500
Yeah, see, those are two things

59:32.500 --> 59:34.500
That's another applause getter

59:34.500 --> 59:37.500
Ashkenazi Jews!

59:40.500 --> 59:43.500
How many Ashkenazi Jews

59:43.500 --> 59:49.500
In the audience have watched the documentary on the Chinese

59:49.500 --> 59:53.500
While living in Brooklyn

59:53.500 --> 59:57.500
I'm from Wisconsin, we have Ashkosh

59:57.500 --> 59:59.500
What's that?

59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.500
What's that? What is an Ashkenazi Jew?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500
What does that mean?

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.500
It means...

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.500
These are Jews who watch Ozzy and Harriet

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.500
It means you're like Woody Allen Jew

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.500
But like way cooler

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.500
These aren't clear answers

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.500
Eastern European Jews

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
White Jews

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Wait, are Jews non-white?

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.500
So Eastern European as opposed to...

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Middle Eastern

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.500
Oh, okay, got it, got it

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.500
Caucasian Jews

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.500
Okay, I get it, I get it

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.500
So your back is... you have a bad back?

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500
Yep, yep, yep, yep

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.500
But it's cool because every time that I don't have like an allergy

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.500
Or like a stomach problem, I'm just like, hey

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:03.500
Are Ashkenazi Jews known for not having allergies or stomach problems?

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.500
I don't know, this is my first time

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500
Alright, New York's a big city

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500
I say we keep looking for people

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.500
Let's thank Lana, everybody

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.500
Thank you, thank you

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.500
There's nothing wrong with her, nothing wrong with her

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.500
I mean, there's something wrong with her, she has back problems

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500
I mean, there's nothing wrong with her as a human being

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.500
I was right, physical pain isn't the way to go here

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
You asked for it

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500
She did nothing wrong, she's a good person

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
No, it's my fault

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500
I say we keep going, though

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500
Let's plumb the depths

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.500
I say we get someone with a dread disease

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.500
Someone who's got three days to live

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500
Yeah, to company

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
What are you guys calling out?

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500
I want to talk about fathers

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
You want to talk about fathers?

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500
Yours is dead, okay

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.500
Let's put a pin in that, I got a dead father over here

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500
You know what, let's go

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.500
Why am I, let's go out there

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500
Is this wireless?

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500
Because I can't hear you guys that well

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500
Oh, I just realized how loud I am when I'm up there

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
I keep shouting into the mic

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500
Who was raising their hand over here?

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500
Wait, over, over

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
What did you have?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.500
He's black, he's half black

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.500
Wait, wait, this guy's got a rebuttal

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500
I'm kind of black

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
He's kind of black

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500
Is that more or less than half black?

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
He doesn't remember

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500
That's, that's severe

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500
Like, that's serious

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Like, as hard as it is to be fully black or half black

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500
I'm going to take a wild guess

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500
I'm going to take a wild guess

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.500
That there's no 100% black person

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500
In this audience

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500
Let's beat, let's beat Gilbert's challenge

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500
You're, I'm sorry, black

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500
100% black

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500
And gay

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500
Come on, come on, come on

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500
Come on

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500
New York

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500
We got New York

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.500
100% black and gay

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500
In your face

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.500
Uh, are you, are you with any pain?

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500
Aside from the obvious

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.500
No physical pain, just deep spiritual pain

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500
Deep spiritual pain

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500
Now you're 100% black

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.500
You're not a security guard here, are you?

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500
All you enough know is weird

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500
I tried and it turned me down

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.500
He's a, he's a fan of mine, Gilbert

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500
Eat it, eat it

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.500
I have 100% black gay fans

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
Right here

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.500
But what do we, 100% black

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500
How do we even know?

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.500
I mean, would you in like basic

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
Rounding up probably, but as far as I know

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.500
Well rounding up is how though, I mean that's a terrible

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.500
I'm sure it's a drop, I'm sure I've got drops of something somewhere

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500
But as far as I know it's 100% black

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.500
I'm sure Thomas Jefferson somewhere in there was like

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.500
He was like, you're a great, great, great, great, great, great

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
Great grandma that's real good

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Yeah, I think we all are kind of like

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.500
A little less pure than anyone would

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.500
I don't think anyone of us want to be, right?

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.500
White people want to be a quarter Cherokee

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.500
Anyways, but 100% black as far as you can tell

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.500
You've traced it back

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.500
Where does the gayness come in?

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:10.500
I think we all know where the gayness comes in

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
Gilbert!

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.500
I would rather not picture it in my head right now

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.500
No, come on, it's 2014

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500
We all want to picture it in our heads

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500
I'm kind of curious about like

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:34.500
Are you New York raised in the reared?

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500
No

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500
Are you a New York native?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500
I'm not a New York native, I'm a DC native

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
DC?

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.500
Isn't that the murder capital of the world?

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.500
No, no, no, AIDS infestation

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.500
Infestation?

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500
AIDS capital?

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.500
AIDS capital world, yes

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Murder capital world is like Jersey I think

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
Or Baltimore

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
Camden

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.500
Then not Jersey then, but somewhere else, not DC

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:11.500
Is it true that when gay guys have anal sex

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.500
They scream out, the tingler is losing it?

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.500
The tingler, the tingler is losing it

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500
I'm wondering how you know all this

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:27.500
Okay, let's ask some standard gay questions

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500
If you'll indulge them

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.500
Go

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.500
And you're not an ambassador of gayness

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.500
So I want to get subjective

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.500
This is a question I'm always curious about

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.500
Is there a moment in your life when you knew

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.500
Did you think like, uh oh, there's a division

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.500
Like I think differently, I feel differently

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.500
And I think it's more than just like me being

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500
An individual, I think I'm on the other side

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500
Of a line that's being drawn somehow

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.500
Was there a crucial moment in your life?

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.500
No, I never had that like, uh

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500
Oh wow, gay moment, I just sort of had like

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500
Oh, you like dudes, you like chicks

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
I like dudes too, but you don't kind of thing

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.500
It's really easy back while I was going up

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.500
Is it just really easy in DC?

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
It's easy

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
Actually no, it's not, I don't know how I got that

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500
Maybe it's easy for you, maybe

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500
Maybe it's a new generation

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500
For me I had it easy, but I never had like a

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500
Against each other moment, or like a

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500
Here is the division line, so Jordan always knew

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500
I think that might be a Gen X thing

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
Like every gay character in every movie

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500
Has to have a monologue where they're like

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500
And then Toby got out of the swimming pool

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.500
And he said, do you want to have a sleepover?

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500
And I was like, yeah

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500
And he's like, cause we both like girls, right?

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500
And I said, yeah

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500
And I was lying

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.500
Uh, but maybe

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500
Maybe you're part of a new

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500
Generation of Star Children that was like

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500
Saw those movies and you're like

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500
I'm one of the, I'm gay

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500
I'm not going to make the mistake that guy made

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500
Oh no, I mean

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500
I didn't have a Vincent Price moment so I wanted it

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500
Yeah

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.500
Spiders delight

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500
Your birthday cake covered in demons

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.500
My name is Harry

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
All the vampires

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500
Call me Harry

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.500
What's the

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500
Okay, now let's talk about something really

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500
Really sensitive

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500
But probably not in New York

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500
Because New York is the most

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500
Progressive, incredible city on the planet

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500
But everywhere else

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500
Like, inquiring minds want to know

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.500
Where does the black and the gay

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.500
Intersect? Like what is the

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500
Conflict on that guys' trip?

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500
Because

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500
White, straight, fat Jim

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
Belushi's like me

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500
We worship gay people

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500
And black people

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500
And if you want to know the gods on his truth

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
And I can confess this to you and no one else

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
At a certain point where like

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
Black people are yesterday's news

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500
They can take care of themselves now

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Gay people are the new black

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500
But in any case

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.500
I'm sorry to break that to you

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500
But

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.500
But also

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500
There's like this unspoken thing

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500
It's like to the extent

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.500
That you can circumscribe black culture

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.500
Like

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500
Black culture shouldn't have

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500
Like

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500
There's a homophobia that's allowed

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500
Right? Like, right?

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.500
I mean

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500
Yes?

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500
Yes, is the answer to your question

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
It's not as called out because what are we supposed to do

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500
We're going to kick down every door and go like

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500
Everybody except gay people

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.500
And then we're like

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
Black people

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500
We'll put a pin in it

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500
We're already trying to

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.500
We'll come back to you

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500
We want to be hypocrites

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.500
Come into your living room

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500
And go like, you black people are not tolerant enough

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500
It's too meta for us

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500
Okay, you could be homophobic

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500
For a little while longer

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500
We'll figure that out when the time comes

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500
We'll get a pass and do it later

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.500
It's like suburban white kids

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500
In the 90s listening to gangster rap

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500
It's like there's heavy overtones

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500
Of, you know, if you were gay listening to that stuff

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500
And you were black

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500
I would think that you would be

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500
You would be like, shit

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500
It's

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500
Oh, fuck

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
It's a little bit like that, it's like

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
Well fuck, what am I listening to now

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500
But at the same time

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.500
Garth Brooks is really good sometimes

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.500
I hear

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500
Yeah

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
He's not going to help you

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500
No, it's weird

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500
Because you have these two minorities

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.500
And they both have their own sort of

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
Psychologies about them

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500
You're black, you're gay, you're this

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500
It's not really intersecting

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500
A lot for people's

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500
But I mean, you sort of work it out

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500
You figure it out

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
Everybody works everything out

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500
Why is every cultural movement

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500
In our country

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500
Why do I get the feeling that the unspoken

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500
Foundation of it is the idea that

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.500
White people are going to end everything

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500
Including racism

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500
If racism is a problem

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500
It can be solved, white people will take care of it

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500
I think your missing point is more

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500
White people are going to end in 40 years

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500
I think that's what we're working against

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500
I think white people are like

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500
What do we do about racism

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500
Let's have a meeting about racism

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500
I think

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500
We'll just make more of us

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.500
And I'll populate you

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500
I'll populate you

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500
So

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.500
When you have

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.500
A friend

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500
And they're black

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.500
Do you mean friend or do you mean friend?

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.500
Not like in a gay way

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.500
Is that what you mean?

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.500
Like

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.500
I feel like my six black friends

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500
Six?

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500
Well one of them is probably going

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Like

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.500
Me?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500
One of them

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
Jerry Miner is listening right now

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
What do you dare?

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500
Is it a little brown back there?

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500
That's like wait

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.500
As a black man

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500
When you see black people coming at you

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
Do you get scared?

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.500
Oh man, I mean, dare across the street so fast

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.500
No

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.500
Actually, you know what? I'll answer that question

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500
That's a good question

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.500
I do

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500
People get scared of people

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.500
If somebody is white

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500
I'll go across the street

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.500
And somebody like

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500
Can't leave

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500
It's just like when you see people who aren't you

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.500
You don't know them, I don't know who you are

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.500
Well I cross the street when I see strangers coming

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500
Yeah, exactly

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.500
But like if it's a black stranger I gotta stay on this slide

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.500
Like any other stranger I gotta cross the street

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500
Black stranger, damn it, can't do it

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.500
It's that whole thing

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500
I have to

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.500
You gotta stay on the same slide

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500
I give him a fist bump as you walk by us

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500
I'm always wondering

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500
With race in the 21st century

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.500
Is now that we've accomplished

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500
The fact that we go like, you know what

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.500
This is an artificial construct

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500
It absolutely is, physically

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500
Because two random

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500
White people

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500
Would be physically as different

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500
From each other as

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
Like a black person from a white person

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500
In a technical kind of like sense

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.500
It is an artificial construct that's being perpetuated

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500
Like the idea that there is such a thing

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.500
As race, and I get that

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.500
But at the same time, like we are

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500
Like we have all this momentum, so it's like

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500
When a black person walks in the room

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500
Like I don't

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Like my 41 year old white brain

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.500
Never goes, never, never

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
It never is unaware of race

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500
Like I go, a black guy can just walk to the room

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500
Now I can

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.500
Well if that's true, then why don't you bring me

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.500
All the states where I came in first

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500
Well I didn't, listen

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500
You can come by anytime

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500
When you're happy

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500
Or excited, do you ever yell

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500
Die no more

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.500
For those of you

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
For those of you listening and not seeing

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500
Our guest bears a resemblance

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500
It's possible if you're just listening

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.500
I could have sounded incredibly racist

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500
But the truth is there is a resemblance

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500
But that doesn't mean I'm not

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.500
Incredibly racist

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.500
No, no, no, that's still an option

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500
It can be both

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500
What I always want to know

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500
And I only want to know just recreationally

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500
Now because I'm 41 and I'm just like

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500
I'm dying, I'm just like

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
I can't change my brain

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500
But I'm always curious

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500
I think 85% of everybody

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500
Is always full of shit

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500
And 85% of people

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500
In a certain age

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500
Were like, oh

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
Race matters a lot

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
And so we should be really mean to people

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500
That look like this

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500
Instead of like that

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.500
And then we entered a new era

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500
Where we're like, okay because of the work of heroes

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.500
And brave people that risked shit

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.500
And cool things

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500
Then we entered an era where we're like

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500
Okay, race is not supposed to matter

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
But we also just entered an era

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500
Where 85% of people, i.e. idiots

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Just started going, I'm going to start enforcing that

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Like a fucking idiot

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500
You're still talking to a bunch of dumb people

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.500
Who are like now lynching racists

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500
Instead of

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500
They're just writing letters to TV Guide

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.500
And going, I couldn't help but notice

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.500
I'm being a responsible thing

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.500
You're still an idiot

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
Like you're, we just went from

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500
A different, from one form of coward

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500
To another form of coward

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500
And I always wonder

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500
When you cancel all that out

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500
And just go, everything cowardly is cowardly

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500
And everything brave is everything brave

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500
In the grand scheme of things

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.500
Like what is the actual definition

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500
Of

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500
Not racist

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500
Is it actual

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.500
Because the modern definition is

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500
What's that?

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.500
The pornography industry

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500
Has like achieved it, right?

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500
Is that what you mean?

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500
Because it's like, we don't

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500
They have every license to be grody

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
But it's just sort of like

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500
This is absolutely true

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500
Because you know, I love porn

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500
Titles where they

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500
Twist around

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
The real movie titles

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500
Like Ram Bone

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500
Like that

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500
I saw one

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500
A porn film

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500
That was a black guy and a white girl

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500
And it was called

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500
Amos and Candy

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.500
That's 100% true

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.500
That's 100% true that you want

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
That?

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500
It was the greatest time

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500
Check it out

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500
It would make me feel a little bad watching it

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500
Just

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500
Out of alliteration

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
I just always wonder like

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500
Is consciousness of racism

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500
Or is like

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500
Because now that that's become

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.500
The new definition of racism

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500
Now it's like

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500
You could go into a room full of people

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
And the first person that acknowledges

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.500
Race

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.500
That's a weakness, that's a human weakness

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500
And it's the actual

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.500
It's the

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.500
Less brave

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500
It's the easier thing to do

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500
It's the more socially acceptable thing

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.500
To point out

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500
Racism is whoever smelt it dealt it

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.500
Whoever smelt it dealt it

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.500
That's the new rule of racism

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.500
It's like

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.500
It is true that someone

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.500
That would be cognizant of race

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500
And might reflect that

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.500
That might be a symptom of latent racism

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500
But at the same time

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500
If we're rooting that out

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.500
What's left?

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.500
Aren't we actually creating some weird garden

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500
Where we

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500
You're always obsessed with race

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.500
I have so many friends who come to me

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.500
Hey man, no we're friends

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500
But ask like you're black, right?

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.500
Yeah, like

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.500
Just ask a question

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500
You have a question, just ask it

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500
I think people are also

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
Pre-obsessed with race

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500
As the first thing

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500
I'm always stressed out

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500
Like oh there's a black guy

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.500
Okay whatever

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500
But if your friend was a redhead

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.500
Or a blonde or a brunette

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.500
A friend is a redhead

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.500
That's pretty hot

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500
There's the same

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500
Emphasis on

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.500
Consciousness of it

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.500
I think that's the goal

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500
My friend is tall

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500
My friend has freckles

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500
My friend is blonde

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.500
There's redhead stereotypes

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.500
And there's all this stuff

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500
And these are phenotypical characteristics

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.500
That you can be conscious of

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.500
And you can be entertained by

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.500
You can be amused by

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500
But the big difference is

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500
Race, which is an artificial construct

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500
Has this wall where it's representative

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.500
It's like if you took redheads

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.500
And you said some weird shit about them

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500
And then there was like this crazy wall

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.500
And everyone was like walking on eggshells

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.500
And there was all this weird energy

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.500
I've never had friends who were scared to

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
Just sort of say

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.500
For lack of a better term

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500
Just racist shit, like they make jokes about race

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.500
They make jokes about like you know black guy

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.500
Joke, white guy joke, whatever kind of joke

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.500
And just sort of do it

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500
You're one of the people now

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500
In comedy you address race

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.500
Like oh, it's a factor of our life

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.500
It's going to be a joke, but I mean

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.500
You don't have to dance around it

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500
You don't have to be on eggshells

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500
There are people who know like

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500
Okay, whatever, and there's race

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.500
Oh, there's race, kind of thing

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500
So like for me

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500
It's always been like people I know are just like

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.500
Oh, yeah, we're black, we're going to keep on moving

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500
Is there another question?

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500
Yeah, I can't figure it out

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500
I'm just so glad you came up here

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500
And made me feel like a better person

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500
Which is the new racism

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500
You're welcome

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500
What was your name again?

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.500
I forgot

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.500
What's that?

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500
That's a weird name

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.500
You're like a Game of Thrones character

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500
I could be, I very well could be

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500
Will you stay up here and play Dungeons & Dragons with us?

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500
I'm going to sign, yes, I've never played

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500
Well, yeah, it's okay

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.500
Either has Gilbert Gottfried and he's going to be like

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500
Crucial to the

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500
I think it's very important

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500
For me to mention

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
He's wearing a Batman t-shirt

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500
And on my podcast

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
Gilbert Gottfried's amazing

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.500
Colossal Podcast

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.500
We interviewed Adam West

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.500
Yeah, yeah

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.500
See, it was just, it came in

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.500
In conversation

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.500
People should listen to Gilbert Gottfried's podcast

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.500
There's no question about that

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.500
You can hear it on

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.500

And subscribe to it on iTunes

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.500

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.500
Now, it's

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.500
SciShowNetwork.tv

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500
Can you go right to the mic

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500
And go, hey, hey, hey

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.500
I think what you're asking for is

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.500
Hey, hey, hey

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.500
What you're asking for

01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:59.500
Well, that's re-run, isn't it?

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.500
Yes, you go

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500
Watch you talking about it

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.500
Now, okay, this is racism

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.500
Because the only thing

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500
He looks a little bit

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.500
He looks like Jimmy Walker

01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.500
So the dynamite thing was not racist

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500
Hey, hey, hey, and what you're talking about

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.500
Is racist

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.500
Because you're saying

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500
Do things that other black people do

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.500
How do they live in color?

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.500
Chenene

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.500
Oh, alright. Thanks, front row guy

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.500
No, no, no

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.500
What was re-run's catchphrase?

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500
What was re-run's catchphrase?

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500
He didn't just say what's happening

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500
What was the title of the show?

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.500
He used to dance, re-run

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
Somebody said hey, hey, hey

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
It wasn't Chenene

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.500
No, no, yes

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:47.500
Fat Albert said hey, hey, hey

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500
The guy who was spring

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500
Someone else said hey, hey, hey

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500
His name

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.500
His name was Dwayne

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500
I think Dwayne used to go

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
Hey, hey, hey

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:03.500
Yeah, no

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500
And Fat Albert was

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.500
Hey, hey, hey

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.500
See, it was a subtle difference

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.500
Yeah

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.500
I think we've learned a lot

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.500
About African Americans today

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
And I want you all to remember

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
That Dwayne said hi, hi, hi

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.500
And Fat Albert was

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500
Hey, hey, hey

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500
We're gonna find

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
We're gonna find a female

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.500
Or at least a somewhat feminine friend

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500
I'm sorry, balcony

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500
We have someone who called out I'm also gay

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500
And offered we could have an all gay stage

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500
Those words don't make sense

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500
Now we have people yelling out bye, bye

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500
What, what?

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.500
Oh, blind?

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500
Oh, fuck this, yeah

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.500
Holy shit

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500
This is insane, I actually

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.500
I completely forgot this

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.500
I was going to

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.500
I was thinking about this, what's your name sir?

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.500
Rory

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.500
Are you totally blind?

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.500
Can't see anything

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.500
I'm sorry, I'm defining it for you

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500
I think some people are going like

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.500
I don't know

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500
How do we get you up there?

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
I don't, okay

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.500
Okay, Rory

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.500
Rory's sister's gonna bring him up

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.500
I'm sorry gay lady

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:49.500
But if you're upset

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:51.500
Then you're a terrible person

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.500
Okay

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.500
I'm assuming

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500
Rory's sister has been through worse than this

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.500
Like she's, this is some precarious

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.500
Shit even for the sighted

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.500
Are we cool?

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.500
Can I take over from here?

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.500
Okay

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.500
This is like unreal that this is happening right now

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.500
Okay

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:13.500
Wait, wait, wait, sorry, sorry

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.500
Hold on, stay still for a second

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:17.500
I want to move some stuff for you

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.500
Okay

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.500
I want to sit you in the chair that I was sitting in

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:23.500
I'm really flustered

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:25.500
Because I

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500
Because I feel very nervous that

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.500
I'm gonna put this mic in this stand

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.500
And I'm gonna sit you in this chair

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.500
Okay, so the chair is

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.500
Right here

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.500
I'm sorry if I'm being politically incorrect by like

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.500
I always say fuck political

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.500
Correctness

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.500
And

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.500
I always

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.500
I thought you were gonna say

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.500
I always say fuck political correctness

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.500
I can't fucking see

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.500
Who is this fucking guy?

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.500
Aaron Hillis everybody

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.500
Aaron Hillis

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.500
He loves ice

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.500
Are you a drinker?

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.500
Yeah, oh yeah

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.500
Okay, let's help

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.500
Oh my yes

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500
Can we get a cup from back there

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.500
And if I have a story

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.500
I can share that I thought was actually very relevant

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.500
To the conversation

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.500
Not

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.500
You know not to say that like the black

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500
Culture is necessarily like homophobic

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500
But like the idea of certain black

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.500
People who want equal rights but are still

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500
Homophobic I just had

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.500
I had an experience that

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.500
That was very like

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
Exemplified that

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.500
Because I have I sort of have this problem

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.500
Where whenever I'm drunk in public

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.500
I forget that it's not okay

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.500
To make racist jokes

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.500
So

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500
So like it was

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.500
So

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.500
I know you can't see but I want you to know

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.500
You're killing right now

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.500
And also here is a drink

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.500
I

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.500
I feel terrible about this

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
But you realize there's not a

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.500
Podcast going on right now

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500
Just a really good surround

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500
Sound laugh track

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500
Now can I ask you a question

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500
Yeah, yeah

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500
If God came down and said

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500
We can give you perfect sight

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.500
But you'd have to be black

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.500
Black

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.500
That's

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.500
That's a toughie

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.500
That's control

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.500
Wow I just it just hit me

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.500
That Gilbert Godfrey just said

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
Something to me

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.500
Holy fuck this is not

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.500
Okay

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.500
So the story so yeah like I said

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.500
I get drunk and forget

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.500
That I can't just shout like racist jokes

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500
So anyway there's this like

01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.500
I was just standing outside

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500
And like there's just a bunch of people standing around

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500
In my college and like one kid said

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.500
Something about like being white

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.500
Like he was just like oh he said something about how white

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.500
He was so naturally I was just like oh white power

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500
And

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.500
And like

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.500
And then like some

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.500
And then there was like

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.500
There was some black kid standing around

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500
And he kind of like felt like he was like pissed at me

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500
So I was just like oh shit

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.500
So I just went up to him and was like hey man

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.500
Like I don't really mean it I'm just drunk

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.500
I'm just joking around obviously like I don't mean it

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500
And he was like alright whatever we like you know exchange

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.500
You know tell each other names and stuff

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500
And then like a minute later he was

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.500
I think he was in a frat and I think maybe he was talking to

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.500
One of his pledgers or something

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.500
But he called some kid a faggot

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.500
And I was like dude

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500
You can't get mad when I make a racist joke

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.500
And then call someone a faggot

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.500
And he was just like oh really

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500
And he got all defensive and I was like yes

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500
You know like blacks are like you know

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500
They get shit and then like so do gay people

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.500
And like he got all defensive and he was like

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.500
Oh really you know got all like oh really

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.500
Gays have gone through the same shit that blacks have

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.500
And I don't know

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.500
I mean you know they're not shooting

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.500
Gay people to death in Ferguson

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.500
There's a I mean

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.500
Well that is true but they still

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.500
Can't even beat them

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500
Yeah yeah no so I'm like

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.500
Either make jokes about everyone

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.500
Or jokes about no one

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.500
You can't like say like

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500
You know

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500
Like I'm not gonna say

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.500
Oh you can make jokes about black people

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.500
But as soon as you make a blind joke

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.500
Fuck you

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.500
And I don't think

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500
I think individuals are geniuses

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500
And populations are idiots

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.500
I mean I think

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.500
There's some individuals

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.500
Many individuals are idiots too

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500
But I do think

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500
If you cornered an individual

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500
Person from the quote unquote

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500
Black community

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500
And deposed them about that

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500
They would go

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.500
Oh you're absolutely right but I also think

01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.500
That you get swept up in the idea that

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500
And I don't say this for applause

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500
Because I'm a white person

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.500
Please don't applaud after I say this

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500
But this is the thing that I always remind myself of

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.500
Now

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.500
I just asked you specifically

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.500
Not to do something

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500
Oh you applied it before I said it

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.500
Okay

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.500
It really

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500
Is profound when you realize like

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500
Okay

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.500
There's a huge amount

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Of analogies you can draw

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500
For marginalized populations

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.500
Of any kind

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.500
Whether you're talking about nerds

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.500
The physically challenged

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500
Of

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.500
Sexuality

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.500
But

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.500
Race has this really distinct

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.500
Thing which is you cannot

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.500
You just

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500
Don't have an option

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500
You wake up and you

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500
And I think that there's

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.500
Even if that's not accurate

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.500
I think that there's a feeling underneath there

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500
It's like I woke up black this morning

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500
You know

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500
And it's not like I

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.500
Shows to be gay

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.500
No no no god damn it

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.500
That's not what I mean

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.500
That's not what I mean at all

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.500
I just mean that gay people

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.500
Can look like straight people in line at the bank

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.500
You mean that there's this overpowering

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.500
Presence of race all the time

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.500
I mean that racism is really

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.500
Really really easy

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.500
To accomplish

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.500
You can accomplish it through closed windows of cars

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500
You can accomplish it across countries

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.500
You can accomplish it through binoculars

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500
Like it's

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500
Really unfairly easy

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.500
To knock out

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.500
We've had so much time

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.500
To be racist or alarming racist

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.500
It's like we've had race

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.500
In those countries where you had this country

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.500
And we've always focused about it

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.500
And all these other social issues that come up

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.500
People don't give them much time

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.500
They haven't had 150 years to say

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500
Oh yeah maybe I'm wrong about that

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.500
But please please everybody

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500
That's gay that's listening to me

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500
Saying that anything is harder than anything else

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.500
I understand also

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500
I'm going to say that being black is harder than being gay

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500
I'm sorry

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.500
I will argue with you

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.500
Because also it's like

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.500
For the very same I think

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.500
It's apples and oranges

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.500
Where black people and gay people

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500
But apples are way better than oranges

01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500
It's come to that point in the conversation

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.500
Where it's just a bunch of straight white people

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.500
Explaining things to black gay people

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500
It's like whatever

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500
It won't do any good from here

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.500
There's apples and oranges, do I get cherries?

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500
And I don't want to pronounce anything

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.500
I just want to say out loud

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.500
As a big fat straight white guy

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
Like what fascinates me

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.500
And what I think about when I'm laying in bed at night

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.500
Staring at the ceiling going what do blind people think

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.500
What do gay people think

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.500
By the way god damn it

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.500
I'm a huge fan of blindness

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.500
Oh yeah it's good

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.500
I can give you the advice

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.500
It's like it's a lot cooler

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500
You know from the outside

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500
You know

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.500
You know it's

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Really it's not

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500
It's not fun to be deprived

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.500
Of 90% of your primate

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500
I mean yeah it's

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500
Have you heard me on the podcast

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500
Talk about your

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
You know I'm actually like I think I'm like

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500
My sister was telling me

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500
Like she was saying like oh an episode

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500
Like 109 or something

01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500
You were talking about blind people

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.500
But I have not gotten there yet

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.500
I said you're full of shit

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500
I said you're the reason Ralph Nader got somebody

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.500
Votes

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500
I'm damn proud of it

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500
Now has any

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.500
Blind person

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500
In real life

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500
Ever said to another person

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500
I want to see what you look

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500
Like and then start touching

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500
Their face

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500
I don't know all

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500
Blind people so I can't

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500
That's very

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500
Gilbert Godfrey

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500
I want to know what you look like

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500
Can I touch your face

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500
Touch his face

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500
Touch his face

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500
Gilbert get your face over to this guy

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.500
He's coming

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.500
That's a real

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.500
That's a real nice face he got

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.500
Anyway

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.500
The answer to that question is yes

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.500
Yes it just happened

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.500
That may have been the first time

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500
Do you know what his face looks like now?

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.500
Yeah

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.500
I mean I think I already

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500
I think I already knew

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.500
Now was the movie

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.500
Sent of a woman totally full of shit

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.500
I

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.500
I'm not familiar with that

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500
Are you saying you didn't see it?

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.500
I did not

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.500
Well played

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500
No I did not

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500
Old school blind jokes

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.500
No you would not be surprised

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500
Like how many of my friends just like

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.500
Something will happen that I didn't expect

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.500
Did you not see it coming

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.500
Alright that was

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500
Moderately clever the first

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500
Seven times

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.500
No it's like I don't

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500
So I just want to get some background

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.500
Because I mean being blind could

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.500
What's the back story born

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.500
No I was born blind in my right eye

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500
And I always had

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.500
Problems with my left eye

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.500
Like I could never like really read

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.500
Like I could never really read

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.500
Like I could kind of read a large print

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.500
But not really like that well

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.500
So I always red brailed but like I could

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.500
See well enough to like get around and stuff like that

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500
But um

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500
It's I mean there's like a lot of detail to go into

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500
And I honestly at this point I can't tell

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500
Because I've like told this story so many times

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500
That I can't tell if it's boring or I'm just

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500
Bored of telling it but um

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500
It's probably somewhere in between

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500
Alright then I'll give like I'll give

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.500
A somewhat compact view

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.500
Very few people have made content I was just

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500
This is gonna be boring it's me explaining

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500
Like how why I thought it would be interesting

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500
To have a blind person up but it was just

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500
It seems like such kismet I was just

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500
Thinking about this yesterday

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500
I was thinking about this coming

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500
To New York going we've met we have a

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500
Podcast it's a new society

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.500
I bet we have a lot of blind

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.500
Listeners I wonder if anybody

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500
Out there like

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.500
We've never brought a blind person up

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500
At stage I just want to point out that it's

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500
Like magical but but

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500
For me

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500
You're so blessed you're so blessed

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.500
You're like a magical blind person

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500
We're all secretly

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500
Magical we just don't tell it

01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500
I feel like you could help me golf

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500
Better

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500
You're like

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500
You're like the hitch

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.500
Of not seeing

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.500
Yeah

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500
More or less I guess

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.500
But I yeah

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500
I mean this is

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500
A dumb digression

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500
I think it's like a pre-internet

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.500
Like kind of thing but I remember

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.500
Being fascinated to read

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.500
That

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.500
Deafness compared to blindness

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Even though it technically

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500
Quote-unquote impairs

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.500
You less

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500
Because obviously as humans

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.500
We rely on our eyes more than we rely

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.500
On our ears but

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500
That deaf people are

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500
Basically for lack of

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500
A more diplomatic or longer way

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500
Of saying it that they are more

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.500
Alienated, isolated

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.500
Yeah you can like if a deaf person

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500
Can get around better but I mean like

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500
There's a whole language people

01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500
Language thing like you know some deaf people

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.500
Can speak you know and

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500
Read lips so they can communicate fine

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500
But like yeah obviously like

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.500
Sure if you're blind you can't see anything

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.500
But like you can still just ask people

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.500
And like you're still like perfectly able

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.500
To communicate so it's

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500
I kind of wonder how much the internet changed that

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.500
Because the internet changed everybody's lives

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500
In this audience who can see and hear

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.500
But there's like before the internet

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500
There was like deaf people

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500
And it's like the internet couldn't have

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500
Polarized those communities more

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500
Because if you're

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500
If you're blind

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500
Before the internet

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500
You had the internet of

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
Talking to people

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500
And deaf people didn't

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500
They took our way our one advantage over

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500
Deaf people and then once

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500
Once the internet happened

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500
That was like that was the one thing we had

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500
Above them and now

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500
Are deaf people like vampires and werewolves

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.500
No

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500
It's like

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500
Blind people, deaf people and like people in wheelchairs

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500
And we're all at war with each other

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500
That's it

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500
See that movie

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500
It's all a big joke to me

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500
I love it

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
Yeah it's yeah

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500
Well this is great

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500
I'm very proud of myself for this

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
You know what

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
You did a good thing

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
You have definitely improved my life

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500
I hope you'd like to

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500
Play Dungeons & Dragons with us

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500
Fuck yeah just cause I love Dungeons & Dragons

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500
Spencer you better not fuck this up

01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500
I mean I hope

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.500
Is it should I give you the character sheet

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500
No I mean

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500
That is a really good question

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500
I've just been stewing over here

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500
I didn't know what to say

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.500
If I could like

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500
I'm trying to think like

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.500
I could play like Quark and I just like know most of his

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500
Attacks anyway

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.500
Attacking with his sword

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500
Plus I really want to fuck things so like

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.500
I wouldn't

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.500
I don't think I would not mention

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.500
Like no one else uses

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.500
Their character sheet anyway so I don't think I'd be

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.500
At too much of this advantage

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.500
I guarantee you that

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500
I have looked at mine as much as

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500
You would yours

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.500
I guarantee it

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500
Yeah I'm not

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.500
Worrying about it I played D&D over the summer

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.500
And yeah it was a lot of fun

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.500
Yeah

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.500
If I were Spencer I'd be shitting my pants right now

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.500
Cause I feel like a blind person playing D&D

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.500
Is like

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500
I don't know like a

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500
Spanish person taking a salsa class

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500
In what sense

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500
It's like I don't know

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.500
It's just in their blood that they're gonna smell bullshit

01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.500
Alright I got Sharpie

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.500
I don't get it

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500
So Gilbert

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500
We play this game called Dungeons & Dragons

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.500
And I don't know if you've ever played

01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.500
But basically it's like

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.500
Pretend that what I'm saying is real

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500
And pretend you're acting as a character

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.500
In the setting that I'm describing with my mouth

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.500
That doesn't make sense

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500
That makes it all clear

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:32.500
I promise it's the clearest way I could do it

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500
I hope that's the guy who tweeted that same joke

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500
And not the guy who read that

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.500
So just think of it as a jumping off point

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500
You don't actually have to make any sense

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.500
Of any of those pages

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500
Can I just say one random

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.500
Unrelated thing

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.500
But just something I've always wanted to

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.500
No sorry

01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.500
It would be amazing to find out

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500
What the limits of what you're allowed to say

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.500
Would be

01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500
Why is Building 7 still standing?

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500
Oh alright

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.500
Take it easy

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.500
No the melting point of steel

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500
Okay take it easy

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.500
Thanks for coming

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.500
Why were there no Jews

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500
In the building

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500
Jesus Christ Rory

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500
This is just

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.500
A joke that I'm pretty sure

01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.500
Is it a racist joke?

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.500
No I'm sorry

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500
I could probably think of a good one

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.500
That's not the way I asked

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.500
It's a very not racist joke

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500
It's a really lame joke that I'm sure

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.500
Everyone has already heard

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500
But I wanted to tell it to Dan

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500
For a very specific reason

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.500
Alright Dan

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.500
Why do seagulls fly over the sea?

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.500
I don't know

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.500
Because if they flew over the bay

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500
They'd be called bagels

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500
Bagels

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500
Gilbert Gottfried is like

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.500
What the fuck is going on?

01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500
Because he doesn't know how to say bagel

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.500
I pronounced bagel wrong

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500
Yeah you gotta write both

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500
That's what people keep telling me

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.500
Is just a picture of the word bay

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500
Goal

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500
Is that it? Bagel? Bagel

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.500
I think you can say it both ways though

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.500
If you actually look stuff up

01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500
A lot of these words that are contentious

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.500
Both of the pronunciations are just right

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500
And everyone just argues about it

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.500
Like it matters

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500
I would like a bagel

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
Okay

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500
I've never had somato

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
I would like a bagel

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.500
Again

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.500
I'm not going to correct that

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.500
I think it's all good

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.500
I'd like a bagel

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.500
From Ronald Reagan

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.500
Because it's vague

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500
Vag

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500
Alright

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500
Alright

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500
I gave

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:15.500
Gilbert Gottfried

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500
Chris de Burgh

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500
I'm sorry

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500
It's just Cine

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500
Just Cine

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500
I don't know why that sounds worse

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500
I gave just Cine

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500
Dignity Sarsgard

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500
After

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.500
Thinking about it for a long time

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500
And so

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.500
Rory

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500
Just because he's gay you're making him a woman

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500
God damn it

01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500
He's blind but he sees everything

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500
That's

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500
That's why I ruminated on it

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500
I was like

01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500
God damn it

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500
So Harmon

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500
Do you want to do your acapella thing

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.500
We've been without music for a while

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.500
And coping with it

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500
We're playing Dungeons & Dragons now Gilbert

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.500
Last time on Harmontown

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.500
Our heroes

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500
I gotta say this stuff

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500
Our heroes

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500
Had just defeated Father Tinder

01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500
Dealing with his corpse

01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.500
As the gang fled they were accosted by a night watchman

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500
Who seemed to be wise to their tricks

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.500
But Dignity Sarsgard

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500
Smoot things over

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500
Just when they thought they were safe

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500
They found themselves surrounded by guards

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.500
But Dignity and her mighty steed provided the gang

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.500
With a much needed egress as they escaped the town

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500
However

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500
Leaving the safety of the town

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.500
Would prove to be a dangerous move

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.500
And no sooner than our heroes had escaped

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500
Admiral Darkstar took after them

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500
With the fury of hell

01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.500
After screaming in elemental summoning

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500
Admiral Darkstar noticed the shard of power

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.500
Floating away from the city

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500
And abandoned our heroes to give chase

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500
Dignity's mount

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500
Pissed on a fire elemental

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500
Pissing off his leg

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500
And with that our heroes escaped the flaming foe

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500
Finding freedom in a foul fen

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500
People love alliteration

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500
They love it, I love it too

01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500
Approaching the first door they saw

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500
Our heroes encountered a showering woman

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500
And after terrifying slash objectifying her

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
Our heroes played it off

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500
Like it was no big thing and asked for her help

01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500
But what thing was gonna happen?

01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.500
How would the gang whatever

01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.500
And what of the blank

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:58.500
Find out next time on Placeholder

01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.500
So everybody has questions right?

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.500
Questions?

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.500
This is that point in the D&D where everyone goes

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.500
What's going on?

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.500
I usually know what's going on

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.500
I'm a bit fuzzy if I'm honest

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.500
I'm like 15 episodes behind

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.500
So I have absolutely no idea

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.500
And we also just released the last episode

01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.500
That happened today

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.500
So I didn't even get a chance to listen to it

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.500
Needless to say they left the village

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.500
And arrived at a naked woman's house

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.500
And we were looking through the window at her

01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.500
And then we came in through her door

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.500
You looked at the window

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.500
She saw you doing that

01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.500
Freaked out and then you entered her house

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.500
To keep her quiet

01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.500
Yeah

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.500
Okay so I'm...

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.500
Young lady

01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.500
Is she young?

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.500
She can't tell her age

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.500
She might be elvish

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.500
Lady

01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.500
Take it easy

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.500
We just need a place to hide out

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.500
See?

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.500
Yeah

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500
It doesn't seem like a very convincing statement

01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.500
But when you put it out there

01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.500
She's like I guess that makes sense

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.500
I mean it is

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:16.500
One of the only windows in this swamp

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.500
So

01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.500
We're within the confines

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.500
Of rose...

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.500
No you're outside a rose boat

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.500
You ran off into a swamp

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.500
Do you have any questions?

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.500
I

01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.500
Stop paying attention

01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.500
An hour

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.500
That's fine too

01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.500
I guess he has a question

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.500
Alright

01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.500
I am a newbie to this entire scene

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.500
Well then we can't help you

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:48.500
What's your question?

01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.500
Is this a contiguous game?

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.500
Yeah but I'd like to think

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:56.500
No one has to know

01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.500
Or does know

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.500
Anything that happens

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.500
Yeah

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.500
It's a terrible idea

01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.500
Just pretend some people entered a naked ladies house

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.500
You're all set

01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.500
Yeah

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.500
It's the worst idea in the history of entertainment

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.500
Yeah

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.500
And now you do

01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.500
Imagine if every week

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.500
Ugly Betty was about something different

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.500
But

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.500
She was a different kind of ugly

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.500
It was always

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.500
It was on CBS

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.500
Every other week

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.500
They kept moving it between

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.500
Friday and Wednesday

01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.500
It's just a bad idea all around

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.500
Somehow

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.500
We keep loving it

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500
Ugly Betty

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500
Gilbert

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.500
Just say anything

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.500
Just riff

01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.500
No I've given up

01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.500
Just so we can say

01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.500
That you played D&D with us

01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.500
I don't know what this whole thing's about

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.500
It's acting but instead of a stage

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.500
I say in the stage

01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.500
It's like

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.500
An improvised radio play

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.500
So where in a

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:12.500
Naked girls apartment

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.500
Yeah

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.500
In a swamp

01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.500
Didn't land

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.500
Hey great tits

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.500
We played D&D with Gilbert Godfrey

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:30.500
That's what's important

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:32.500
Rory is going

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.500
I have no idea what your tits look like

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.500
Let me feel it

01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.500
Well Rory plays a character who can see

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.500
Oh I'm sorry

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.500
I could probably

01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.500
Feel them for inspection

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.500
Yeah

01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:50.500
Has Quark fucked her yet?

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.500
No

01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:54.500
I feel like that's

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.500
Less cool when it's actually like a human

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.500
If it's like

01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.500
Some sort of animal

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.500
You can just be like oh yeah I'm gonna fuck it

01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.500
But as soon as it's an actual woman

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.500
I feel weird being like oh I'm gonna fuck her

01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.500
So maybe I won't do that

01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.500
That makes me feel weird too

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.500
Alright ma'am

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.500
Yeah yeah

01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500
I got tits I know

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.500
Please cover yourself

01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.500
Oh no I did sorry

01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.500
My platoon mates and I

01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.500
We're fleeing

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.500
A dark force that threatens

01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.500
To overtake the world

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.500
And we just came in here

01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.500
I think for maybe food

01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.500
Are you asking me?

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.500
You know what it occurs to me

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:42.500
We had no reason to come in here

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:44.500
I think it was just

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.500
There was a naked woman so

01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:48.500
We're all gonna back out

01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.500
And we're all gonna move to the next place

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.500
Where's the next place?

01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.500
We're not sure

01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.500
We're just gonna keep moving

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.500
In the same direction we were moving

01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.500
And we were sorry for the interruption

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.500
And

01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:04.500
Life

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.500
Is the thing that happens

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:08.500
Between your plans to do other things

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.500
As John Lennon once said

01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:14.500
And we're just gonna leave

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.500
And we're gonna head to the next place

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.500
And we're very sorry

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.500
And you'll notice we didn't objectify you

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.500
I mean

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.500
I hate to disagree

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.500
He just said nice tits

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.500
Oh well my friend

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.500
I mean he's not wrong

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.500
It's

01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.500
Middle

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.500
Medieval fantasy world

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.500
A lot of people are very

01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.500
Unattractive and you look great

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.500
But that's not the same as objectifying you

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.500
I don't think that

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.500
The way you look

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:54.500
Is who you are

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.500
I'm making

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.500
The assumption right off the bat

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.500
That you probably are some kind of scientist

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.500
But I don't think it's

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.500
Inaccurate for my friend to say nice tits

01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.500
But in either case I say we're leaving

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.500
We're leaving

01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.500
We're leaving

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.500
So long

01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.500
What was your name?

01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.500
Charles

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.500
Charles did you say?

01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.500
It's a family name

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.500
Charles thank you

01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.500
Bye

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.500
Let's get out of here

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.500
We leave and then we go to the next

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.500
We just keep going

01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.500
What does that mean?

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.500
We keep going in the same direction

01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:38.500
In the same line we were fleeing the city

01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.500
And then we came across this place

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.500
We keep moving

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.500
You enter a swampy land

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.500
It's become too swampy

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.500
To really walk walk easily

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500
We go back to the naked ladies house

01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.500
Knock on our door this time

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.500
This time we're not

01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.500
We're not coming in

01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.500
Okay

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.500
Hoping this can be

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.500
A reboot of

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500
An encounter that started off on the wrong foot

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.500
Well now I'm all confused

01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.500
You just said you were leaving

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:12.500
And you're already back

01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.500
Well ma'am

01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.500
We're fleeing as I said

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.500
An evil force

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500
We stopped by your place

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.500
We left

01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500
You live in a swamp

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.500
We're not sure what to do

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.500
What exactly were we trying to accomplish?

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500
I wouldn't know

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.500
That's a weird thing for you to ask a complete stranger

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.500
I was talking to Sharpie

01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.500
Ma'am I want you

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.500
The answer to his question too

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500
Ma'am we're running for our lives

01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.500
And we're cowards

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.500
And we're just running from

01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.500
Things that might hurt us

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.500
And so I ask you

01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.500
If you've ever felt weak in a moment in your life

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.500
And if you could connect

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.500
That moment in your life to this moment in our life

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.500
Which would be empathy

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.500
And like

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.500
No that would be sympathy

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.500
Empathy you wouldn't need a moment in your life

01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.500
To connect with someone else

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.500
Damn

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.500
Alright

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.500
Now it's a worry

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.500
Burn

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.500
And you're a naked woman

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.500
With great tips and a beard

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.500
Beard?

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.500
She's a beard?

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.500
I don't think she's naked anymore is she?

01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.500
She's not naked anymore

01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.500
No no she put on clothes

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.500
Alright let's leave

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.500
Ma'am

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.500
Honestly all we want to do is

01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:40.500
Get our bearings and

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.500
Figure out where to go from here

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:44.500
You're surrounded by marsh

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.500
I know

01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.500
And we

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.500
We just need a place to

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:52.500
Sit at a table and look over some maps

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.500
Did you not need this five minutes ago

01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.500
When you were inside my house?

01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.500
Ma'am I'm not going to try to convince you

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.500
That we're an organized adventuring party

01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.500
We're not

01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.500
We never advertised that

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.500
We never said hey it's us

01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.500
We know what we're doing

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.500
We are a group of people

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.500
Who are running from things

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.500
We don't want to engage them

01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:18.500
We came across you

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.500
We acted impulsively

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:22.500
Mistakenly we fucked up

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.500
We tried to correct that

01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:26.500
We wandered in the wilderness

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.500
You live in a swamp we're back

01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.500
We're asking now

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.500
Ma'am

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.500
If we could just sit at your table

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.500
And just look at some maps

01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:38.500
I don't know if you have atlases

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.500
Just figure out where we are

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.500
Get our bearings

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.500
Truth is ma'am

01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.500
A lot of times we're very drunk

01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.500
We don't know

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:50.500
We don't know what we're doing

01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:52.500
And we're very embarrassed

01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.500
And it's not

01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.500
We don't expect acknowledgement of that

01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.500
To be a pass

01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.500
But we're out in your porch

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.500
And we can make a day of it out here

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.500
Or we could come in and

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.500
I could share some holy text with you

01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.500
Read some holy text with you

01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.500
I didn't hear that I'm sorry

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.500
I could share some holy text with you

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:16.500
I love reading

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:18.500
She's got some holy text

01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.500
I really enjoy reading

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.500
It's really about just

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.500
Peeling back layers

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:26.500
Wait what?

01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:28.500
It's about peeling back layers

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.500
Reading?

01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.500
I feel like we should figure out some way to get through this swamp

01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:34.500
I don't know if the plot's going to advance

01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.500
Here

01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.500
Yeah, I mean

01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:40.500
I don't want to kill some shit so

01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.500
Alright, okay ma'am

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.500
You know what, sorry to bother you

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.500
We're going to head into the swamp

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.500
We're going to head into the swamp

01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500
Apparently we can't walk in it

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500
So we have to figure out some way of

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.500
Getting somewhere else and not just be trapped in this house

01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:00.500
I agree

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.500
Okay ma'am

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.500
Goodbye

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.500
Are you sure you're done?

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:08.500
It's just

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.500
Even in jest

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.500
If you could give us a direction

01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:16.500
Just any direction?

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.500
Just pick one

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:20.500
When you leave

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:22.500
Where do you go?

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.500
Well, I take the main road

01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.500
Back towards town

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.500
The way we came from?

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.500
It's the main road

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.500
When you want to get away from there

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.500
Can you take the main road

01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.500
Like away from town?

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.500
Yeah, it splits up, you go past the town

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.500
You could go left near the town

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.500
It's all sorts of directions

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.500
But all back toward the town

01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.500
Well initially

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:48.500
Sure, but then the roads

01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.500
They go in other directions

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.500
That's a ways

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.500
We'll head back to our town

01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.500
Wait, what?

01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.500
We need to leave to Vincent Price's house

01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:00.500
I don't know who that is

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:04.500
Or John Lennon

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.500
Alright

01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.500
Okay, well bye ma'am

01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.500
Bye

01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.500
Have a nice life

01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:14.500
I was

01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:16.500
Sorry for the interruption

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.500
Thank you

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.500
We head back down the road

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.500
Back toward town, I guess

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.500
But back towards and then past town

01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.500
To areas unknown

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.500
Hopefully, yeah

01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:30.500
So you head

01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:32.500
Towards town and you see

01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.500
You see barring your path

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.500
Hopping along on one fiery foot

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.500
A fire elemental

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:40.500
Missing a leg

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.500
You recall him from your past travels

01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:44.500
In which you made your horse pee on him

01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.500
Alright

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:48.500
Is this someone like we were fighting before?

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.500
So we should kill them

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.500
I didn't hear that

01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.500
So I should piss on the other leg

01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:56.500
Gilbert, attack

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.500
This would be a good time for you to attack

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.500
Okay, I'm attacking now

02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:10.500
I'm rushing forward

02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:12.500
With a violent attack

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.500
So while you're rushing forward

02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:16.500
With this violent attack

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:18.500
Are you wielding a dagger or a poison dagger?

02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.500
Both

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:24.500
I have a regular dagger

02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:26.500
In my left hand and the poison dagger

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:28.500
In my right

02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.500
Now you're getting that

02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.500
Wielding both of these daggers

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.500
You plunge them deep in the beast's fiery hide

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:38.500
Alright

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:42.500
Deal some amount of damage

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.500
14 damage

02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.500
Wow

02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:54.500
Gilbert Gottfried is great at dodging the dragons

02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:00.500
You feel the heat raiding off of the elemental's

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.500
Fiery body but you pull away

02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:04.500
Before it can burn you

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.500
That's just a, yeah

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:08.500
Okay

02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.500
Someone else do something

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.500
Can I fuck him?

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.500
I'm not asking, I'm just saying

02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.500
I'm gonna sneak up behind him and try to fuck him

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:22.500
And then if that doesn't count as my entire turn

02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:24.500
I want to attack him

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.500
I want to go into a barbarian rage

02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.500
Fuck him and then attack him with my flaming sword

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:30.500
Flaming sword attack

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.500
I can't wait for Jeff to come back to the pack

02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:36.500
So I can tell him this is his effect on blind youth

02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:42.500
Flying into a barbarian rage

02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.500
You sense all feelings and emotions

02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:46.500
And not those logic and stuff

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:48.500
The other one

02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.500
Leaving being replaced with rage

02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:52.500
And passion

02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:54.500
As you undo your pants

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.500
And enter the fiery fiend

02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.500
You realize

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.500
That's what you realize

02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:02.500
It's worth it

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:04.500
Well worth it

02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.500
Your dick takes 12 damage

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.500
Feeling

02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.500
That's probably all for the best

02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.500
Yeah, that's a good point

02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.500
Feeling your dick melt off

02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.500
We only have one dick left in this party

02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.500
I'm sorry Jeff Davis

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.500
Wherever you are

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:36.500
I melted your dick

02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.500
It's a really trenchant metaphor

02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:40.500
For what happened to our country during Vietnam

02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:46.500
Reeling back from this incident

02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:48.500
You lunge into attack

02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.500
For hurting your member

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:52.500
And maybe it's just the fact

02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:54.500
Your entire dick was melted off

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.500
But it goes wide

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.500
And your sword falls

02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:00.500
Blade first into the soil

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:02.500
Missing it completely

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.500
Goddamn it

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:06.500
I'm sorry

02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.500
Well

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500
Detecting evil

02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.500
I feel like

02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.500
We've misjudged this fiery demon

02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:18.500
Yeah, okay

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.500
Detecting

02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.500
Detecting evil

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:24.500
You do notice it's not an evil spirit

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.500
It seems neutral if anything

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.500
He melted my dick off

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.500
So I say we kill him

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.500
Well sew it an ordinary campfire

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.500
This is such a classic conflict

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:46.500
Between a blind guy and a gay black guy

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.500
I mean, I'm pretty sure we're on the same team

02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:52.500
I don't think we're quarreling

02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:56.500
Not yet, uh...

02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.500
I'll lay mercy on my team member's

02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.500
Burning member

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.500
Oh yeah

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:04.500
Laying hands

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:06.500
On this...

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:10.500
This is a classy move

02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.500
On this shiny, uh,

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.500
Kendall-like crotchal region

02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:16.500
You instantly feel

02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:18.500
Your pain going away

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.500
But you don't instantly feel

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.500
Your dick come back

02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.500
That doesn't happen

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.500
You're going to need some serious magic

02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.500
To pull that off

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.500
That's dicks for you

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:34.500
You can't live with them

02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:38.500
I feel like you can definitely live with them

02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.500
It's my turn

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.500
Raise the dead

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:44.500
I don't think wizards can raise the dead at 7th level

02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:46.500
Also, why raise the dead?

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.500
Raise the dead

02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:52.500
I think he just wants to end the show

02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:54.500
I think my high brother is here

02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:56.500
I know, but actually

02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:58.500
Yeah, what do I know?

02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.500
That might have been a great ending

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.500
Yeah, uh...

02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.500
Shit

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:06.500
I'm looking at my spells

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:08.500
Ray of Frost!

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.500
Yeah, Ray of Frost, come on

02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:12.500
I'm telling you guys

02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:14.500
Ray of Frost is a level zero spell

02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:16.500
Two damage

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:26.500
I mean, Ray of Frost is like

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:28.500
It's garbage

02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:30.500
I mean, if he's vulnerable for fire

02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.500
It might do up to six damage

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:36.500
Still not very good

02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:38.500
Let me look for a second

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.500
Would reduced person work on an elemental?

02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:44.500
No, they're outsiders

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:46.500
Or elementals, I don't know which

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.500
Talk to him?

02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.500
Hey, listen

02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:56.500
Verbal abuse

02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:58.500
We mean you no harm

02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:04.500
It looks like you have to say

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.500
I didn't think you were until I got raped

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:10.500
But who really got raped?

02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.500
It looks like you have to say me

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.500
But his dicks burnt off

02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.500
Yeah, I'm the real victim here

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:20.500
It looks like you have to say

02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:22.500
I'm literally made of fire

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.500
Exactly, and that's why we...

02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.500
I was born this way

02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:30.500
And we were born

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:32.500
All of the ways that we were born

02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:34.500
And we don't...

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:36.500
I'm telling you, I swear to God

02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:38.500
From the bottom of our heart

02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.500
We were just grassed

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.500
We were sorry for it

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:44.500
I'm not

02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:46.500
I'm still pissed

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:48.500
I still want to kill him

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.500
In the immortal words of

02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:52.500
Heednism bot, I apologize for nothing

02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:58.500
Well, it lobs a fireball

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:00.500
at you then

02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:02.500
You take some amount of damage

02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:06.500
Quark

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.500
I mean damage

02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:10.500
Jesus

02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.500
What the fuck did I ever do?

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:14.500
What did you do?

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:16.500
You told it you're not sorry

02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.500
You raped it

02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:20.500
No, not sorry

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:22.500
I tried to rape him

02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:24.500
Before my dick got melted off

02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:26.500
He's hacking a blind kid

02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:28.500
That's not cool

02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:30.500
I don't know, man

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.500
Wait

02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.500
Okay, this is not my turn

02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:38.500
I think it's Gilbert's turn

02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:40.500
Gilbert, think really hard

02:07:40.500 --> 02:07:42.500
about what you do

02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:44.500
He's the only one who's done anything good

02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:46.500
I can't even fake this

02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:48.500
Because I don't know what the fuck

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.500
this game is all about

02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:54.500
It's about killing this guy

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.500
Fuck it

02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:02.500
Just try to talk sense into it

02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:04.500
Just be Gilbert Gottfried

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.500
and just talk to this fire elemental

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.500
and just tell it that we didn't mean it

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.500
Okay, we didn't mean it

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:12.500
We did

02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:14.500
I'll go along

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:16.500
with anything at this point

02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.500
I think that's a problem

02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:22.500
What?

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.500
These are all great suggestions

02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.500
Gilbert, just

02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:36.500
if I could

02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:38.500
ask you to try

02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:40.500
just in the form of a monologue

02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:44.500
just like beseech this thing

02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.500
to be peaceful with us

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.500
No

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:50.500
And then

02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.500
Spencer can roll his die

02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:54.500
because you'll be attempting diplomacy

02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:56.500
with this thing

02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:58.500
But you as Gilbert Gottfried

02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:00.500
you have to try to convince this fire elemental

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:02.500
to be peaceful with us

02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:04.500
That's my suggestion

02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.500
Now, what was this again?

02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:10.500
He says you want to kill him

02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:12.500
I want to kill him

02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:14.500
and I'm diplomatic about it

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.500
I'm lost

02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.500
I'm telling you

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:20.500
I'm saying to you

02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:22.500
just say to this thing

02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:24.500
It shouldn't want to fight with us

02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:26.500
We want to be peaceful with it

02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.500
and just in the form of a monologue

02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:32.500
as only Gilbert Gottfried could accomplish

02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:34.500
a master diplomat

02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:38.500
just making peace with this thing

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:40.500
It's a fire monster

02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:42.500
Oh, he's a fire monster

02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:44.500
Okay, got that

02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:46.500
He no longer has great tits

02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:48.500
He's a fire monster

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.500
This thing does not have great tits

02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:52.500
It's a fire monster

02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.500
Oh, please fire monster

02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:00.500
Who doesn't have great tits

02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.500
But may or may not have a beard

02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:08.500
I gave up on that a while ago

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:12.500
Please don't kill us, oh fire monster

02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:16.500
Thank you

02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.500
It looks as if to say

02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:26.500
I'm really tired of this

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:30.500
And it hops away on one leg

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:32.500
We did it

02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:34.500
Gilbert Gottfried

02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:38.500
Gilbert Gottfried saved our party

02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.500
It could be

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.500
I think it is, yes

02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:48.500
Gilbert Gottfried did it

02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.500
That's been our podcast

02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.500
Best Comptroller Gilbert Gottfried

02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.500
For God's sake

02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:00.500
He's staring

02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.500
Black Gage is staring

02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.500
Black Rory

02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.500
And I am a jazz musician

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:08.500
So that's very attached to the truth

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:12.500
Super privilege Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden

02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.500
and Dutch Ambassador

02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.500
At the city of New York

02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.500
I thought that would get a big applause

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:28.500
I like this theater

02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:30.500
Where are we?

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.500
92 Y

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:34.500
Sorry

02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:38.500
Good job, 92 Y theater

02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:40.500
for having us there

02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:42.500
This is the class instructor for every minute

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:44.500
Thank you guys for being patient

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:46.500
and for hanging out with us and watching the show

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.500
Now let's all tiptoe away

02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:56.500
Let Rory sit here and see what happens

02:11:58.500 --> 02:12:00.500
We'll see you out there

02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:02.500
I don't know, we'll take a place to go

02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:04.500
hanging out afterwards and thank you for coming out

02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:24.500
God bless you
