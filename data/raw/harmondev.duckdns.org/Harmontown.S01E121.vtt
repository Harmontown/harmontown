make The Tingler\n\n11:18.500 --> 11:20.500\nconveniently enough\n\n11:20.500 --> 11:23.500\nthe way to make The Tingler not attack you\n\n11:23.500 --> 11:25.500\nis to scream\n\n11:25.500 --> 11:28.500\nand probably to throw money in the air\n\n11:28.500 --> 11:32.500\nYeah, and the idea of telling people\n\n11:32.500 --> 11:34.500\nYeah, that they have to scream\n\n11:34.500 --> 11:40.500\nWell, I thought you scared us and we screamed\n\n11:40.500 --> 11:42.500\nBut no, it's not like that\n\n11:42.500 --> 11:43.500\nYeah, now it's mandatory\n\n11:43.500 --> 11:46.500\nYou have to be instructed to scream\n\n11:46.500 --> 11:49.500\nThis is the part where you scream\n\n11:49.500 --> 11:53.500\nYeah, and he said\n\n11:53.500 --> 11:56.500\nScream, scream for your

him and Vincent Price\n\n12:14.500 --> 12:17.500\nand a lot of them had where\n\n12:17.500 --> 12:21.500\nif someone was effeminate, it was evil\n\n12:21.500 --> 12:24.500\nSometimes it was eccentric\n\n12:24.500 --> 12:28.500\nlike Paul Lynn and Charles Nelson Riley\n\n12:28.500 --> 12:31.500\nBut with Vincent Price, it was\n\n12:31.500 --> 12:34.500\nOh, well, you didn't think in terms of gay\n\n12:34.500 --> 12:37.500\nSo you thought, oh, he's sinister\n\n12:41.500 --> 12:44.500\nIn the 70s, there were rock groups\n\n12:44.500 --> 12:47.500\ncalled Queen\n\n12:47.500 --> 12:50.500\nand no one thought that means gay\n\n12:50.500 --> 12:53.500\nSo I was like, well, I guess the leather\n\n12:53.500 --> 12:55.500\nand I guess they're tough guys\n\n12:55.500 --> 12:59.500\nor like Prince and Boy George\n\n12:59.500 --> 13:03.500\nBut you really had to push mainstream America\n\n13:03.500 --> 13:05.500\nhard against the wall of capitalism\n\n13:05.500 --> 13:09.500\nbefore they'd go, oh, you're gay?\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:13.500\nWell, it was like the village people\n\n13:13.500 --> 13:15.500\nYeah, the village people\n\n13:15.500 --> 13:18.500\nWell,

Boyhood\n\n13:47.500 --> 13:52.500\nAnd it was a major news story that Elton John was gay\n\n13:52.500 --> 13:53.500\nYeah\n\n13:53.500 --> 13:54.500\nThis one\n\n13:54.500 --> 13:55.500\nYeah\n\n13:55.500 --> 13:59.500\nWe didn't want to deal with it, we didn't want to\n\n13:59.500 --> 14:04.500\nOh, and George Michael, who would go up in hot pants\n\n14:04.500 -->

--> 16:02.500\nso have you ever had a dick in your ass?\n\n16:04.500 --> 16:08.500\nAnd somehow Paul Lynn would make it sound gay\n\n16:12.500 --> 16:15.500\nAnd then we would, but we would still not say\n\n16:15.500 --> 16:18.500\nNo one would put Paul Lynn on the cover of Time Magazine\n\n16:18.500 --> 16:21.500\nand go, gay is cool\n\n16:21.500 --> 16:24.500\nWe would just go Paul Lynn's

Because we had presidents\n\n16:56.500 --> 16:58.500\nin the early stages of America\n\n16:58.500 --> 17:00.500\nWhat was his name?

Buchanan was like\n\n17:05.500 --> 17:08.500\nAnd the only reason why we don't celebrate him more as that\n\n17:08.500 --> 17:11.500\nis because I don't think he was that great a president\n\n17:11.500 --> 17:14.500\nSeriously, because I think that's why gay people\n\n17:14.500 --> 17:16.500\ndon't run down the street and go\n\n17:16.500 --> 17:19.500\nBuchanan because he kind

college\n\n17:33.500 --> 17:36.500\nbut as I remember it\n\n17:36.500 --> 17:38.500\nI think we had a president, Buchanan\n\n17:38.500 --> 17:41.500\nwho was basically like, yeah\n\n17:41.500 --> 17:44.500\nI don't feel like getting married that much\n\n17:44.500 --> 17:47.500\nBut I have this fella\n\n17:47.500 --> 17:49.500\nand he's just sort of my assistant\n\n17:49.500 --> 17:51.500\nAnd if you remember\n\n17:51.500 --> 17:54.500\nin Buchanan's presidential speech\n\n17:54.500 --> 17:58.500\nhe said, the tingling news in the theater\n\n17:58.500 --> 18:02.500\ndemocracy's loose among the people\n\n18:02.500 --> 18:05.500\nscream, scream for democracy\n\n18:09.500 --> 18:11.500\nBut I'm sad, like back then\n\n18:11.500 --> 18:14.500\nso it's like you look like\n\n18:14.500 --> 18:17.500\nthere was a kind of open faced sandwich\n\n18:17.500 --> 18:19.500\nof attitude of\n\n18:19.500 --> 18:22.500\nit was sort of like\n\n18:22.500 --> 18:26.500\nI usually pay extra to get the open faced sandwich\n\n18:26.500 --> 18:29.500\nWhen did we become a homophobic culture\n\n18:29.500 --> 18:31.500\nwhen did we start compartmentalizing\n\n18:31.500 --> 18:33.500\nwhen did we go because then\n\n18:33.500 --> 18:35.500\nthe other thing that we all know is that\n\n18:35.500 --> 18:37.500\nancient Greece and ancient Rome\n\n18:37.500 --> 18:40.500\nit was sort of like, hey,

ever look this up\n\n18:52.500 --> 18:55.500\nor inform myself in any way\n\n18:55.500 --> 18:57.500\nwhy don't I just come out on stage\n\n18:57.500 --> 19:00.500\nand just ask questions and then walk away\n\n19:00.500 --> 19:03.500\nWhat's the history of Gaines?\n\n19:03.500 --> 19:04.500\nBut I do\n\n19:04.500 --> 19:06.500\nSee, in ancient Rome\n\n19:06.500 --> 19:08.500\nthey had a bunch

is really good\n\n19:41.500 --> 19:43.500\nOne of the things that\n\n19:43.500 --> 19:45.500\nThat's my crowd pleaser\n\n19:45.500 --> 19:48.500\nI used the Vincent Price imitation\n\n19:48.500 --> 19:53.500\nto get pussy\n\n19:53.500 --> 19:55.500\nDo you remember Thriller?\n\n19:55.500 --> 19:58.500\nYou know, Vincent Price did the bridge\n\n19:58.500 --> 20:00.500\nSo a lot of the New York people\n\n20:00.500 --> 20:02.500\nhave been asking me on this trip\n\n20:02.500 --> 20:04.500\nbecause they watched the movie\n\n20:04.500 --> 20:07.500\nGilbert, I know you've been a fan of mine for

the rap\n\n20:28.500 --> 20:33.500\nI think if we can pull it off\n\n20:33.500 --> 20:37.500\nit can be a very, we have to do so little to pull it off\n\n20:37.500 --> 20:39.500\nYou know the end of the aviator\n\n20:39.500 --> 20:42.500\nwhen Leonardo DiCaprio just has to get the spruce goose\n\n20:42.500 --> 20:44.500\noff the water three inches\n\n20:44.500 --> 20:46.500\nIf we could just go\n\n20:46.500 --> 20:48.500\nIf we could just not crash\n\n20:48.500 --> 20:50.500\nIt might be amazing\n\n20:50.500 --> 20:52.500\nDo we have a beat?\n\n20:52.500 --> 20:54.500\nThat's the tough

weave those highway cones\n\n22:39.500 --> 22:42.500\nAnd you know, I don't think it's fun\n\n22:42.500 --> 22:45.500\nto joke about the fact that David Tukovny\n\n22:45.500 --> 22:47.500\nhas the Ebola virus\n\n22:48.500 --> 22:50.500\nI think that's insensitive\n\n22:51.500 --> 22:53.500\nthat this wonderful man\n\n22:53.500 --> 22:57.500\nfrom X-Files is dying of the Ebola virus\n\n22:57.500 --> 23:00.500\nYou say X-Files, like it's his hometown\n\n23:02.500 --> 23:05.500\nThis wonderful man from X-Files\n\n23:06.500 --> 23:09.500\nFrom the beautiful town of X-Files\n\n23:09.500 --> 23:11.500\nHe sits over there and\n\n23:11.500 --> 23:14.500\nX-Files, Indiana, where he was born\n\n23:14.500 --> 23:18.500\nand is now dying of the Ebola virus\n\n23:18.500 --> 23:22.500\nand you people make a mockery of it\n\n23:23.500 --> 23:25.500\nAlright, so\n\n23:25.500 --> 23:27.500\nI'm gonna try to riff a couple lyrics\n\n23:27.500 --> 23:30.500\nabout Ebola and or David Tukovny\n\n23:30.500 --> 23:32.500\nAt a certain point it'll be clear\n\n23:32.500 --> 23:35.500\nthat it's time for Vincent Price to do the\n\n23:35.500 --> 23:38.500\njust the spoken word bridge, right?\n\n23:39.500 --> 23:40.500\nOkay\n\n23:40.500 --> 23:41.500\nAlright\n\n23:41.500 --> 23:44.500\nDan, do you want me to lay like some creepy noises\n\n23:44.500 --> 23:46.500\nlike humming down for that?\n\n23:46.500 --> 23:48.500\nCause in the thriller video in that moment\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:49.500\nit was like\n\n23:49.500 --> 23:54.500\nThis guy makes me ashamed to be a Jew\n\n24:00.500 --> 24:02.500\nI didn't know you were Jewish\n\n24:09.500 --> 24:11.500\nI mean, I feel like if you\n\n24:11.500 --> 24:13.500\nyou mean when he's doing his thing\n\n24:13.500 --> 24:15.500\nlike your beat should probably keep going, right?\n\n24:15.500 --> 24:19.500\nThere are those moments in my life where I go\n\n24:19.500 --> 24:22.500\nmaybe the third Reich was right after all\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:32.500\nYou're talking a TMZ right now\n\n24:38.500 --> 24:41.500\nNo, I think when Vincent Price is doing his thing\n\n24:41.500 --> 24:43.500\nin thriller, the beat is going\n\n24:43.500 --> 24:45.500\nI think it's percussive and\n\n24:49.500 --> 24:50.500\nand he's like\n\n24:50.500 --> 24:52.500\nA horrid of ghosts come out at night\n\n24:52.500 --> 24:54.500\nI'll figure it out, I'll

you a fatal flu\n\n25:42.500 --> 25:49.500\nI'm so sad that David Duchovny is dying of the Ebola virus\n\n25:52.500 --> 25:57.500\nWhy is this wonderful man from the X-Files, Kansas\n\n25:58.500 --> 26:01.500\ndying of the Ebola virus?\n\n26:01.500 --> 26:05.500\nIt almost says if I feel at times in my life\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:08.500\nthat I have a tingler up my ass\n\n26:17.500 --> 26:19.500\nWhat was your name, sir?\n\n26:19.500 --> 26:20.500\nWhat?\n\n26:20.500 --> 26:21.500\nWhat was your name?\n\n26:21.500 --> 26:22.500\nDavid\n\n26:22.500 --> 26:23.500\nCato?\n\n26:23.500

29:04.500\nWow\n\n29:04.500 --> 29:07.500\nThey get bummed out about it, it's sad\n\n29:07.500 --> 29:09.500\nAnd not even in a funny way\n\n29:09.500 --> 29:12.500\nBut, you know, like, okay, so we were flying to Canada\n\n29:12.500 --> 29:14.500\nAnd we had to declare customs forms\n\n29:14.500 --> 29:16.500\nHave anyone dealt with this?\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:17.500\nYeah, no, just me\n\n29:17.500 --> 29:20.500\nOkay, yeah, they make you fill out this form\n\n29:20.500 --> 29:21.500\nThey make you fill it out\n\n29:21.500 --> 29:23.500\nThey don't tell you beforehand you're going to fill it out\n\n29:23.500 --> 29:24.500\nThey make you fill it out\n\n29:24.500 --> 29:27.500\nBut then they don't have any pens on the plane\n\n29:27.500 --> 29:29.500\nThat is fucked up\n\n29:29.500 --> 29:30.500\nYeah, what the fuck?\n\n29:30.500 --> 29:31.500\nYeah, that's fucked up\n\n29:33.500 --> 29:36.500\nI definitely agree that that's fucked up\n\n29:36.500 --> 29:39.500\nThat thing with the pens in Canada\n\n29:39.500 --> 29:42.500\nAnd the fact that David Duke company\n\n29:43.500 --> 29:45.500\nA beloved television star\n\n29:45.500 --> 29:48.500\nIs dying of the Ebola virus\n\n29:48.500 --> 29:50.500\nWell, I feel like you're being just ingenuous\n\n29:50.500 --> 29:54.500\nI mean, you're an international traveler, aren't you?\n\n29:57.500 --> 30:00.500\nSee, a lot of times gay people years ago\n\n30:00.500 --> 30:06.500\nWere called international travelers\n\n30:06.500 --> 30:07.500\nContinentals\n\n30:12.500 --> 30:14.500\nWe've only done, like, an eighth of the show\n\n30:14.500 --> 30:19.500\nWe can't just do callbacks for the next seven-eighths of the show\n\n30:21.500 --> 30:24.500\nYou obviously aren't familiar with me\n\n30:24.500 --> 30:29.500\nI could do a series out of it\n\n30:29.500 --> 30:33.500\nBut this customs thing, like, for real\n\n30:33.500 --> 30:34.500\nI'm not kidding\n\n30:34.500 --> 30:36.500\nIt's the Ebola of the North\n\n30:38.500 --> 30:41.500\nSee, see, it still worked\n\n30:42.500 --> 30:44.500\nThey bring the fucking cards\n\n30:44.500 --> 30:47.500\nAnd they don't bring a goddamn lump of coal\n\n30:47.500 --> 30:50.500\nBut the guy who gives you forms\n\n30:50.500 --> 30:51.500\nYou ask him for pens\n\n30:51.500 --> 30:53.500\nHe's like, yeah, I got pens\n\n30:53.500 --> 30:54.500\nBut they're loaned out\n\n30:54.500 --> 30:55.500\nI'll come back\n\n30:55.500 --> 30:56.500\nAnd then he never comes back\n\n30:56.500 --> 30:58.500\nYou never see that guy again\n\n30:58.500 --> 30:59.500\nAnd then you land\n\n30:59.500 --> 31:01.500\nAnd there's still no pens\n\n31:01.500 --> 31:03.500\nAnd you can't get past the border\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:05.500\nWithout filling this thing out\n\n31:05.500 --> 31:06.500\nOr not the border\n\n31:06.500 --> 31:07.500\nYou get the idea\n\n31:07.500 --> 31:09.500\nBut then you can't ask for pens\n\n31:09.500 --> 31:11.500\nDustin, he went to the, you know\n\n31:11.500 --> 31:13.500\nPresumably the lady with pens\n\n31:13.500 --> 31:16.500\nAnd asked if he could have a pen\n\n31:16.500 --> 31:19.500\nPresumably because he saw she had extra pens\n\n31:19.500 --> 31:21.500\nAnd she said, no, I'm sorry\n\n31:21.500 --> 31:22.500\nThat's it\n\n31:22.500 --> 31:23.500\nUpon being pressed\n\n31:23.500 --> 31:26.500\nShe's like, no, I'm not allowed to give out pens\n\n31:26.500 --> 31:28.500\nYou're not allowed to give out the pens\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:30.500\nRequired for the form\n\n31:30.500 --> 31:33.500\nYou have to fill out to enter the country\n\n31:33.500 --> 31:36.500\nBut also, why, like, everything else aside\n\n31:36.500 --> 31:37.500\nWhy can't you give out pens?\n\n31:37.500 --> 31:38.500\nWhat's that gonna harm?\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:40.500\nThey cost two cents, like\n\n31:40.500 --> 31:41.500\nIt's an entire country\n\n31:41.500 --> 31:44.500\nYou can't buy 300 pens\n\n31:46.500 --> 31:48.500\nI mean, they're not at war with everybody\n\n31:48.500 --> 31:50.500\nThey have money lying around, right?\n\n31:50.500 --> 31:54.500\nThey're certainly saving money on, like\n\n31:54.500 --> 31:55.500\nMissiles and stuff\n\n31:55.500 --> 31:56.500\nYeah\n\n31:56.500 --> 31:59.500\nAnd pens are cheaper than missiles\n\n31:59.500 --> 32:03.500\nI have a, if I could tell an airline story\n\n32:03.500 --> 32:06.500\nThen I'm afraid it's gonna turn some of our listeners off\n\n32:06.500 --> 32:08.500\nI thought that was gonna happen to this situation\n\n32:08.500 --> 32:10.500\nIt's all uppercrust problems\n\n32:10.500 --> 32:12.500\nBut they're engaging problems\n\n32:15.500 --> 32:17.500\nWho's that character?\n\n32:17.500 --> 32:18.500\nThat character\n\n32:20.500 --> 32:22.500\nThey're engaging problems\n\n32:22.500 --> 32:24.500\nSometimes I have war\n\n32:24.500 --> 32:28.500\nI have an unengaging, alienating, horrible problem\n\n32:28.500 --> 32:30.500\nSee, that was very sinister\n\n32:30.500 --> 32:32.500\nThe way he said engaging\n\n32:32.500 --> 32:33.500\nYeah, he was spooky\n\n32:33.500 --> 32:35.500\nHe's like a master of horror over here\n\n32:35.500 --> 32:37.500\nIf you know what I mean\n\n32:41.500 --> 32:43.500\nDo you remember\n\n32:43.500 --> 32:46.500\nWhat's the goddamn\n\n32:46.500 --> 32:47.500\nShit\n\n32:48.500 --> 32:49.500\nI am legend\n\n32:49.500 --> 32:51.500\nIs that the origin of the Vincent Price?\n\n32:51.500 --> 32:52.500\nOh, yes, yes\n\n32:52.500 --> 32:54.500\nIt's just like driven by voiceover\n\n32:54.500 --> 32:56.500\nAnd the first hour of the movie is just him going\n\n32:58.500 --> 33:00.500\nI need more orange juice\n\n33:01.500 --> 33:04.500\nAnd he's like, by the way, there's vampires\n\n33:05.500 --> 33:07.500\nAnd then they do a remake where\n\n33:07.500 --> 33:10.500\nVincent Price becomes Will Smith\n\n33:10.500 --> 33:11.500\nYeah, perfect\n\n33:11.500 --> 33:14.500\nCause two are so close\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:17.500\nWell, I think they were trying to isolate the problems\n\n33:17.500 --> 33:20.500\nThey're like, it wasn't the vampires\n\n33:20.500 --> 33:22.500\nIt wasn't the idea that he was the best man on Earth\n\n33:22.500 --> 33:25.500\nI am surrounded by zombies\n\n33:25.500 --> 33:30.500\nThe first plot point of the original Vincent Price\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:31.500\nI am legend\n\n33:31.500 --> 33:34.500\nIs having established that he's the last man on Earth\n\n33:34.500 --> 33:37.500\nIn a world where everyone else is vampires\n\n33:37.500 --> 33:39.500\nHaving established that he has adapted\n\n33:39.500 --> 33:43.500\nBy living in a garlic-laden home\n\n33:43.500 --> 33:46.500\nHe's explaining through voiceover\n\n33:46.500 --> 33:48.500\nHe's sort of like George Clooney in Up in the Air\n\n33:48.500 --> 33:53.500\nExcept instead of working as a traveling sales consultant\n\n33:53.500 --> 33:55.500\nHe knows how to handle vampires\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:58.500\nSo his voiceover is like, yes, garlic on the door\n\n33:58.500 --> 33:59.500\nI'm out of orange juice\n\n33:59.500 --> 34:05.500\nAnd the plot point of that movie\n\n34:05.500 --> 34:08.500\nThat throws everything into disarray\n\n34:08.500 --> 34:12.500\nIs that he goes to visit his wife's grave\n\n34:12.500 --> 34:15.500\nAnd he falls asleep\n\n34:15.500 --> 34:19.500\nHow many times does he do this a week?\n\n34:19.500 --> 34:21.500\nLike what?\n\n34:21.500 --> 34:24.500\nYou fell asleep in your wife's mausoleum\n\n34:24.500 --> 34:27.500\nAnd he wakes up and is like, oh shit, sundown\n\n34:27.500 --> 34:29.500\nOh god, damn it\n\n34:29.500 --> 34:32.500\nOh shit, this is going to be hard getting home\n\n34:32.500 --> 34:34.500\nWhat are you doing?\n\n34:34.500 --> 34:35.500\nShe's dead\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:37.500\nI mean, I understand nostalgia\n\n34:37.500 --> 34:41.500\nBut there's no police\n\n34:41.500 --> 34:44.500\nYou could move her bones to your house\n\n34:44.500 --> 34:48.500\nLike you can make up new rules\n\n34:48.500 --> 34:50.500\nAbout how to treat dead people\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:53.500\nYou could hang her like Santa Claus\n\n34:53.500 --> 34:55.500\nFrom your chimney\n\n34:55.500 --> 34:58.500\nAnd just be like, every day is Christmas\n\n34:58.500 --> 35:01.500\nI love my dead wife and I'm safe\n\n35:01.500 --> 35:03.500\nBecause she's made of garlic\n\n35:03.500 --> 35:06.500\nBut he know he drives every day to the cemetery\n\n35:06.500 --> 35:09.500\nAnd see me valley and falls asleep\n\n35:09.500 --> 35:13.500\nI was like, oh shit, god damn it, did I do it again?\n\n35:13.500 --> 35:16.500\nOh, there's going to be vampires everywhere\n\n35:16.500 --> 35:19.500\nAnd I forgot the orange juice\n\n35:19.500 --> 35:21.500\nIt's like a bug's life\n\n35:21.500 --> 35:24.500\nLike the hero is the fuck up\n\n35:24.500 --> 35:27.500\nHe's the reason the problem exists\n\n35:27.500 --> 35:30.500\nAnd I remember too\n\n35:30.500 --> 35:32.500\nIf I'm not mistaken\n\n35:32.500 --> 35:36.500\nHis name is Harry in the picture\n\n35:36.500 --> 35:39.500\nAnd they've got these zombies\n\n35:39.500 --> 35:42.500\nThe futuristic vampire's going\n\n35:42.500 --> 35:45.500\nHarry\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:48.500\nAnd I thought, even as a kid\n\n35:48.500 --> 35:51.500\nIt's not scary having monster gel Harry\n\n35:51.500 --> 35:54.500\nMelvin\n\n35:54.500 --> 35:57.500\nSchmoole\n\n35:57.500 --> 36:01.500\nSchleimey\n\n36:01.500 --> 36:03.500\nMaybe Clint\n\n36:03.500 --> 36:07.500\nWhat would be the scariest name to moan?\n\n36:07.500 --> 36:11.500\nLloyd\n\n36:11.500 --> 36:13.500\nLloyd is good\n\n36:13.500 --> 36:15.500\nLloyd is good\n\n36:15.500 --> 36:17.500\nWhen the shining came out\n\n36:17.500 --> 36:19.500\nI was really freaked out\n\n36:19.500 --> 36:22.500\nBecause my dad was kind of a Nicholson figure\n\n36:22.500 --> 36:25.500\nAnd I was Danny's age\n\n36:25.500 --> 36:27.500\nAnd my name was Danny\n\n36:27.500 --> 36:30.500\nAnd my very Nicholson-like dad\n\n36:30.500 --> 36:34.500\nWas very embodied by Nicholson\n\n36:34.500 --> 36:36.500\nWho was saying to...\n\n36:36.500 --> 36:38.500\nShelly Duvall was very much like my mom\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:41.500\nShe was kind of like flighty and nervous\n\n36:41.500 --> 36:43.500\nMy parents, for some reason\n\n36:43.500 --> 36:45.500\nI guess because Kubrick directed it\n\n36:45.500 --> 36:48.500\nI was allowed to watch The Shining at 10\n\n36:48.500 --> 36:51.500\nLike, yeah, I guess it's either this\n\n36:51.500 --> 36:54.500\nOr tit fraternity\n\n36:54.500 --> 36:57.500\nWhich I was also allowed to watch\n\n36:57.500 --> 37:00.500\nBut my mom would cover my eyes\n\n37:00.500 --> 37:03.500\nFrom behind when there were tits on the screen\n\n37:03.500 --> 37:07.500\nBecause there's nothing fucked up about that\n\n37:07.500 --> 37:10.500\nOh, I'm starting to see tits\n\n37:10.500 --> 37:14.500\nNow gently caressing from behind\n\n37:14.500 --> 37:18.500\nThe alabaster hands of the woman\n\n37:18.500 --> 37:21.500\nWho gave me life\n\n37:21.500 --> 37:25.500\nPlaying reverse peek-a-boo with me\n\n37:25.500 --> 37:27.500\nThat didn't...\n\n37:27.500 --> 37:30.500\nThat certainly didn't mess things up for my marriage\n\n37:30.500 --> 37:33.500\nBut it's Nicholson the whole movie going\n\n37:33.500 --> 37:36.500\nDo you want to talk about Danny?\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:38.500\nWhere's Danny?\n\n37:38.500 --> 37:41.500\nAnd I was Danny, it was fucked up\n\n37:41.500 --> 37:45.500\nAnd Nicholson was nuts to begin with\n\n37:45.500 --> 37:46.500\nIn that movie\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:48.500\nThat's what got me\n\n37:48.500 --> 37:50.500\nHe was crazy at the beginning\n\n37:50.500 --> 37:52.500\nAnd then the big thing is that\n\n37:52.500 --> 37:56.500\nHe goes crazy\n\n37:56.500 --> 38:00.500\nYeah, what if Nicholson goes crazy?\n\n38:00.500 --> 38:04.500\nIt's like if Herbie the Lovebug\n\n38:04.500 --> 38:08.500\nWas a Formula One car in the beginning\n\n38:08.500 --> 38:10.500\nTotally different story\n\n38:10.500 --> 38:12.500\nPretty effective movie\n\n38:12.500 --> 38:15.500\nDid you see that documentary, The Shining Documentary\n\n38:15.500 --> 38:18.500\nWhere all the people's theories\n\n38:18.500 --> 38:20.500\nThank you, how many of you have seen\n\n38:20.500 --> 38:22.500\nThe Shining Documentary?\n\n38:22.500 --> 38:24.500\nFive\n\n38:24.500 --> 38:27.500\nSee, it's too easy and applause get her\n\n38:27.500 --> 38:30.500\nIt's like yelling, hey, how many of you\n\n38:30.500 --> 38:33.500\nAre from Brooklyn?\n\n38:33.500 --> 38:36.500\nAnd in Brooklyn, you would watch\n\n38:36.500 --> 38:39.500\nThe Shining Documentary\n\n38:39.500 --> 38:42.500\nWoo!\n\n38:42.500 --> 38:45.500\nIt's that kind of crowd\n\n38:45.500 --> 38:48.500\nThe Shining Documentary is as popular as Brooklyn\n\n38:48.500 --> 38:51.500\nIt is\n\n38:51.500 --> 38:53.500\nWhat the hell are we talking about?\n\n38:53.500 --> 38:56.500\nI don't want to go off on air\n\n38:56.500 --> 38:58.500\nOh, okay, so I took this huge gross shit\n\n38:58.500 --> 39:00.500\nOn the airplane\n\n39:00.500 --> 39:04.500\nCan we just talk about\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:07.500\nThe airplane bathroom\n\n39:07.500 --> 39:09.500\nAnd the toilets?\n\n39:09.500 --> 39:11.500\nThat's why I came here\n\n39:11.500 --> 39:16.500\nI think it's amazing that airplane toilets\n\n39:16.500 --> 39:20.500\nAre designed with the apparent presupposition\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:25.500\nThat turds are like cartoon turds\n\n39:25.500 --> 39:28.500\nThat they're like candy bars that come out of your butt\n\n39:28.500 --> 39:33.500\nAnd fall with heavy dry weight\n\n39:33.500 --> 39:36.500\nDown into the bottom of this hopper\n\n39:36.500 --> 39:38.500\nThat's basically dry\n\n39:38.500 --> 39:40.500\nAnd you push a button and a suction pulls it through\n\n39:40.500 --> 39:42.500\nAnd there's a little bit of water that's just sort of like\n\n39:42.500 --> 39:47.500\nYou know, it's like vermouth for a martini\n\n39:47.500 --> 39:52.500\nSometimes you just wave the bottle around the glass\n\n39:52.500 --> 39:56.500\nIt's symbolic, but by and large you're dependent on just air\n\n39:56.500 --> 39:58.500\nLike, oh, I'm in an airplane\n\n39:58.500 --> 40:03.500\nSo guess what, sometimes a red eye from L.A. to New York\n\n40:03.500 --> 40:09.500\nI'm not serving up baby roots\n\n40:09.500 --> 40:11.500\nYou're serving up Indian food\n\n40:11.500 --> 40:15.500\nAnd so you press the button and the thing goes\n\n40:15.500 --> 40:19.500\nAnd then you look down and you go, Jesus Christ\n\n40:19.500 --> 40:21.500\nNothing happened\n\n40:21.500 --> 40:25.500\nIt just evened it out\n\n40:25.500 --> 40:28.500\nIt just looks like\n\n40:28.500 --> 40:32.500\nIt just looks like a college prank now\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:36.500\nIt just looks like I did something on purpose\n\n40:36.500 --> 40:38.500\nSome woman's going to come in here next\n\n40:38.500 --> 40:41.500\nBecause there's no men's and women's rooms on the airplane\n\n40:41.500 --> 40:43.500\nThat's the other fucked up thing\n\n40:43.500 --> 40:46.500\nIt's like, Jesus Christ, I'm in a metal tube\n\n40:46.500 --> 40:48.500\nI'm already stinking the joint up\n\n40:48.500 --> 40:51.500\nI just, look what I've done\n\n40:51.500 --> 40:57.500\nToday on the red eye from L.A. to New York\n\n40:57.500 --> 41:01.500\nI did something I've never had to do in my life on an airplane\n\n41:01.500 --> 41:03.500\nBecause I was in that situation\n\n41:03.500 --> 41:09.500\nAnd I had a choice between walking out and leaving this situation\n\n41:09.500 --> 41:12.500\nI don't want to, I did this scene\n\n41:12.500 --> 41:18.500\nThis, this, this, this, this\n\n41:18.500 --> 41:22.500\nI'm trying to find the, I don't want to\n\n41:22.500 --> 41:26.500\nThere was just so much\n\n41:26.500 --> 41:29.500\nThat it was like anyone that came in no matter what they were going to do\n\n41:29.500 --> 41:32.500\nThey were going to feel like\n\n41:32.500 --> 41:37.500\nThis is business class\n\n41:37.500 --> 41:41.500\nAnd then they were going to come out of the bathroom\n\n41:41.500 --> 41:45.500\nAnd look around at the six other people\n\n41:45.500 --> 41:48.500\nAnd land their eyes on me playing Minecraft\n\n41:48.500 --> 41:52.500\nAnd I'd be like, yeah\n\n41:52.500 --> 41:56.500\nSo I just, I really, it was beyond embarrassment\n\n41:56.500 --> 41:59.500\nIt was more like, honestly, I was empathy\n\n41:59.500 --> 42:02.500\nI was like, what would I want to encounter when I came back into a bathroom\n\n42:02.500 --> 42:04.500\nWhen I came into a bathroom\n\n42:04.500 --> 42:07.500\nIt was to the point where it was kind of like, it was fucked up\n\n42:07.500 --> 42:10.500\nIt was like a scene in the bowl\n\n42:10.500 --> 42:13.500\nAnd I, please appreciate my candor\n\n42:13.500 --> 42:16.500\nAnd I'm sorry if you listen to this podcast with your family while you eat\n\n42:16.500 --> 42:20.500\nAnd I, it's too far gone now\n\n42:20.500 --> 42:23.500\nBut I just want to confess to you\n\n42:23.500 --> 42:25.500\nI just want to explain this to you\n\n42:25.500 --> 42:27.500\nFor the best possible reasons in the world\n\n42:27.500 --> 42:30.500\nSo the dry paper towels from the hand dispenser\n\n42:30.500 --> 42:33.500\nAnd I like went down in there\n\n42:33.500 --> 42:37.500\nAnd I was like, I just kind of like shoved\n\n42:37.500 --> 42:42.500\nAnd kind of like, I was just like, just something needs to touch this\n\n42:42.500 --> 42:47.500\nNo water is touching it, so mankind needs to step in\n\n42:47.500 --> 42:52.500\nAnd I just like kind of, and then I created like\n\n42:52.500 --> 42:57.500\nSort of like a, like a, like I don't know what it, a musket\n\n42:57.500 --> 43:04.500\nLike what the, you know, like a, like a, like a, like a, you know, like a package\n\n43:04.500 --> 43:08.500\nKind of just like, a tingler, yeah\n\n43:08.500 --> 43:10.500\nAnd then I pressed the flush button again\n\n43:10.500 --> 43:13.500\nAnd there's always that pause and you're like, does it, does the button do anything?\n\n43:13.500 --> 43:18.500\nAnd I go, you know, and it was like, it still didn't do anything\n\n43:18.500 --> 43:21.500\nIt just sucked the paper towels through and there was just more\n\n43:21.500 --> 43:25.500\nIt just, it just, it still looked like something had happened\n\n43:25.500 --> 43:28.500\nAnd I, so I did it again and I did it more\n\n43:28.500 --> 43:33.500\nAnd I, I just kept flushing and I, I gradually, and I also like\n\n43:33.500 --> 43:36.500\nI was washing my hands and I took this hot soapy water\n\n43:36.500 --> 43:41.500\nAnd I was like, okay, and I took a, I was like, and I, and I, I\n\n43:41.500 --> 43:45.500\nTook it over from the sink and dropped it into the toilet\n\n43:45.500 --> 43:49.500\nLike this, this just needs like a dose of what a normal toilet has\n\n43:49.500 --> 43:52.500\nThis happens every day, nothing changed about my ass\n\n43:52.500 --> 43:55.500\nLike, like, like this toilet needs to be like a normal toilet\n\n43:55.500 --> 43:57.500\nIt just needs water in it\n\n43:57.500 --> 44:00.500\nAnd, and, and, and so like, like, like nine flushes\n\n44:00.500 --> 44:03.500\nAnd I brush my hand and I have to do the thing and I, and I\n\n44:03.500 --> 44:06.500\nAt a certain point, there's always that point in the bathroom\n\n44:06.500 --> 44:09.500\nIf you're in there too long, the light comes out and says\n\n44:09.500 --> 44:11.500\nPlease return to your seat\n\n44:11.500 --> 44:13.500\nAnd you always take it personally\n\n44:13.500 --> 44:16.500\nLike you're like, they know\n\n44:16.500 --> 44:19.500\nThey're talking to me, like, like, they're like, you, you\n\n44:19.500 --> 44:21.500\nReturn to your seat\n\n44:21.500 --> 44:24.500\nAnd I, and I came out and then the flight attendant like\n\n44:24.500 --> 44:27.500\nMet me face to face as I came out\n\n44:27.500 --> 44:31.500\nAnd she looked at me helpfully\n\n44:31.500 --> 44:34.500\nAnd said, and I, I wrote it down\n\n44:38.500 --> 44:42.500\nWhen I got back to my seat, including the apostrophe\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:46.500\nShe said, you doing okay?\n\n44:49.500 --> 44:55.500\nAnd I, and I must have looked like, like, like James Woods\n\n44:55.500 --> 44:59.500\nLike a, like a, I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n44:59.500 --> 45:03.500\nLike, I was like, I was like a weird smuggler character\n\n45:03.500 --> 45:06.500\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I, I think she was asking\n\n45:06.500 --> 45:09.500\nWhy did you have to flush nine times?\n\n45:09.500 --> 45:14.500\nAnd I wanted to say, because your toilet isn't made for poop\n\n45:14.500 --> 45:16.500\nBecause I care\n\n45:16.500 --> 45:19.500\nBecause I'm a better toilet than your toilet\n\n45:19.500 --> 45:21.500\nIt's not because there's anything wrong with me\n\n45:21.500 --> 45:24.500\nIt's because I know how society works\n\n45:24.500 --> 45:26.500\nAnd your plane doesn't\n\n45:26.500 --> 45:28.500\nSo land it\n\n45:28.500 --> 45:31.500\nAnd, and let me, let me go do a show\n\n45:31.500 --> 45:34.500\nAnd, and yeah, that's, that's what I\n\n45:34.500 --> 45:37.500\nSee, I flew back from LA\n\n45:37.500 --> 45:41.500\nAnd I didn't even take a shit on the plane\n\n45:41.500 --> 45:44.500\nI went into the bedroom, oh, bathroom\n\n45:44.500 --> 45:47.500\nAnd the restroom, whatever they call it on a plane\n\n45:47.500 --> 45:51.500\nAnd, and there was shit\n\n45:51.500 --> 45:53.500\nFilled in the toilet\n\n45:53.500 --> 45:56.500\nAnd I said, I got to get out of here\n\n45:56.500 --> 45:59.500\nBecause they're all going to blame me\n\n45:59.500 --> 46:01.500\nThere's that too\n\n46:01.500 --> 46:06.500\nAnd sure enough, when I walk out like the prettiest girl\n\n46:06.500 --> 46:09.500\nOn the plane walks in there\n\n46:09.500 --> 46:13.500\nAnd I felt like, you know, should I go over to her\n\n46:13.500 --> 46:16.500\nAnd say, no, that wasn't me who took a shit\n\n46:16.500 --> 46:18.500\nThat was someone else\n\n46:18.500 --> 46:20.500\nI, I looked at the shit\n\n46:20.500 --> 46:22.500\nYeah, yeah, I, I saw it\n\n46:22.500 --> 46:24.500\nI'm on the same page as you\n\n46:24.500 --> 46:28.500\nBut I want to know, I was against it\n\n46:28.500 --> 46:31.500\nYeah\n\n46:31.500 --> 46:35.500\nYeah, it's, it's funny how we all have these butts\n\n46:35.500 --> 46:39.500\nWith poop coming out of them all the time\n\n46:39.500 --> 46:42.500\nLike, like up to three times a day\n\n46:42.500 --> 46:45.500\nAnd then around that we've built this society\n\n46:45.500 --> 46:49.500\nIn which there's so much room for so much nuance\n\n46:49.500 --> 46:52.500\nBut, but there's like an umbilical point\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:55.500\nWhich is their fucking shitty assholes\n\n46:55.500 --> 46:57.500\nYou can really be reduced\n\n46:57.500 --> 47:00.500\nNow, how do you feel about those toilets?\n\n47:00.500 --> 47:02.500\nLike, I remember when I was a kid\n\n47:02.500 --> 47:05.500\nYou could drop a concrete block in a toilet\n\n47:05.500 --> 47:07.500\nAnd it would flush it\n\n47:07.500 --> 47:10.500\nAnd now it does, it's silent\n\n47:10.500 --> 47:12.500\nThere are these toilets like poop\n\n47:12.500 --> 47:13.500\nKind of simmers and\n\n47:13.500 --> 47:15.500\nAnd yeah, you don't even see the water moving\n\n47:15.500 --> 47:17.500\nYou don't hear anything\n\n47:17.500 --> 47:19.500\nYeah, because it's good for the environment\n\n47:19.500 --> 47:20.500\nOh yes\n\n47:20.500 --> 47:22.500\nBecause, because, because that's where\n\n47:22.500 --> 47:24.500\nWhat's killing the planet\n\n47:24.500 --> 47:26.500\nWas us flushing\n\n47:26.500 --> 47:29.500\nIt wasn't, it wasn't anything to do with\n\n47:29.500 --> 47:32.500\nThe behavior of giant manufacturers\n\n47:32.500 --> 47:34.500\nAnd transglomerates\n\n47:34.500 --> 47:37.500\nLike, like, like, like, it, yeah\n\n47:37.500 --> 47:39.500\nIt's definitely, isn't that amazing\n\n47:39.500 --> 47:41.500\nHow every time the fuck, there's a giant\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:43.500\nLike impending disaster\n\n47:43.500 --> 47:46.500\nLike, it always just trickles down to us\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:49.500\nAnd people go like, floss twice\n\n47:49.500 --> 47:51.500\nFloss twice\n\n47:51.500 --> 47:54.500\nFloss twice and never use the same string\n\n47:54.500 --> 47:57.500\nOr wait, use the same string three times\n\n47:57.500 --> 48:00.500\nAnd then, and then wear that as a hat\n\n48:00.500 --> 48:03.500\nIf everyone does that\n\n48:03.500 --> 48:07.500\nIt'll affect the stringy thing\n\n48:07.500 --> 48:10.500\nAnd we're like, okay, I'm a human being\n\n48:10.500 --> 48:12.500\nSo I certainly don't want to kill the planet\n\n48:12.500 --> 48:15.500\nAnd then it's like, it had nothing to do with that\n\n48:15.500 --> 48:18.500\nIt doesn't have anything to do with your fucking garbage\n\n48:18.500 --> 48:19.500\nLike, like, like\n\n48:19.500 --> 48:22.500\nI remember the news was reporting when\n\n48:22.500 --> 48:26.500\nWhen Ronald Reagan, when he was president\n\n48:26.500 --> 48:27.500\nAnd he got shot\n\n48:27.500 --> 48:30.500\nAnd a newscaster actually said\n\n48:30.500 --> 48:33.500\nIf the president is shot at\n\n48:33.500 --> 48:35.500\nHow safe are we?\n\n48:45.500 --> 48:49.500\nYeah, that's a good, it's a good, good, good, good\n\n48:49.500 --> 48:51.500\nOpportunity, that, yeah\n\n48:51.500 --> 48:53.500\nMore guns out there\n\n48:53.500 --> 48:56.500\nOh, Reagan\n\n48:58.500 --> 49:01.500\nAlright, so Gilbert, we're friends now\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:03.500\nOh, yes, we're inseparable\n\n49:03.500 --> 49:06.500\nSo, you and me\n\n49:06.500 --> 49:09.500\nWe're gonna be partners, you and me\n\n49:12.500 --> 49:16.500\nYou and me, when all our friendships file\n\n49:16.500 --> 49:18.500\nWe'll travel\n\n49:18.500 --> 49:22.500\nSee, I knew all of you came here\n\n49:22.500 --> 49:25.500\nTo see a Martin and Louis invitation\n\n49:29.500 --> 49:31.500\nIt's New York, baby\n\n49:31.500 --> 49:34.500\nI just, I don't know how to do this\n\n49:34.500 --> 49:37.500\nBecause if I were, like, my big thing is like\n\n49:37.500 --> 49:40.500\nIf somebody solicits something\n\n49:40.500 --> 49:42.500\nThen it's hard for me to do\n\n49:42.500 --> 49:45.500\nI just, I just, I just\n\n49:45.500 --> 49:49.500\nYour Seinfeld impression is kind of legendary\n\n49:49.500 --> 49:51.500\nLike, like, like you\n\n49:51.500 --> 49:55.500\nYeah, I used to, I started imitating Seinfeld\n\n49:55.500 --> 49:58.500\nBefore anyone knew who he was\n\n49:58.500 --> 50:01.500\nWhen he was just another comic in the clubs\n\n50:01.500 --> 50:05.500\nAnd I was just, I would go on stage and imitate Seinfeld\n\n50:05.500 --> 50:08.500\nAnd the other comics and the waitresses\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:12.500\nWould be laughing and applauding and they'd come in\n\n50:12.500 --> 50:15.500\nAnd the one person who wouldn't come in the room\n\n50:15.500 --> 50:18.500\nWhen I was doing that was Seinfeld\n\n50:18.500 --> 50:21.500\nWho then was named Jerry\n\n50:21.500 --> 50:23.500\nYeah, he was just playing Jerry\n\n50:23.500 --> 50:26.500\nAnd he would, he'd be walking angrily\n\n50:26.500 --> 50:29.500\nBack and forth in the bar going\n\n50:29.500 --> 50:32.500\nThat doesn't sound anything like me\n\n50:32.500 --> 50:37.500\nI don't have a high-pitched, annoying voice\n\n50:41.500 --> 50:45.500\nI don't have a high-pitched, annoying voice\n\n50:52.500 --> 50:55.500\nYou see, sometimes I wonder if\n\n50:55.500 --> 50:58.500\nSeinfeld has any opinions about\n\n50:58.500 --> 51:02.500\nUh, patio furniture\n\n51:04.500 --> 51:08.500\nWhy do people want patio furniture?\n\n51:08.500 --> 51:11.500\nIs it because they need furniture\n\n51:11.500 --> 51:14.500\nFor their patio?\n\n51:18.500 --> 51:21.500\nYou could basically say anything\n\n51:21.500 --> 51:26.500\nIt's like, why do people put cream in their coffee?\n\n51:26.500 --> 51:30.500\nIs it because they want coffee with cream?\n\n51:40.500 --> 51:44.500\nDan, Dan, don't you have a Jerry McSeinfeld?\n\n51:48.500 --> 51:52.500\nI think, yeah, we have a podcast character, Jerry McSeinfeld\n\n51:52.500 --> 51:55.500\nI'm usually pretty drunk when I...\n\n51:55.500 --> 51:57.500\nAnd I'm drunk now\n\n51:57.500 --> 52:00.500\nI can't, I'm assuming that Jerry McSeinfeld\n\n52:00.500 --> 52:03.500\nSounds like, oh, why?\n\n52:03.500 --> 52:07.500\nHave you ever noticed that\n\n52:07.500 --> 52:10.500\nClovers have...\n\n52:10.500 --> 52:13.500\nWhy do they have to have four leaves?\n\n52:15.500 --> 52:18.500\nWhy can't they have three?\n\n52:18.500 --> 52:21.500\nBut, I mean, that's, I don't think that\n\n52:21.500 --> 52:23.500\nWe should take that up right now\n\n52:23.500 --> 52:27.500\nI'm known, I'm known for my Irish...\n\n52:27.500 --> 52:31.500\nMy Irish Vincent Price\n\n52:35.500 --> 52:39.500\nThat tingler is loose in the theatre\n\n52:39.500 --> 52:42.500\nOh, be careful now\n\n52:42.500 --> 52:45.500\nOh, the tingler's coming for ya\n\n52:45.500 --> 52:47.500\nOh, the lights are out\n\n52:47.500 --> 52:52.500\nYou're gonna have to scream and tell your friends about this movie\n\n52:52.500 --> 52:56.500\nScream, scream for your lives\n\n53:00.500 --> 53:03.500\nI'm glad that happens\n\n53:08.500 --> 53:10.500\nI wanna, can I complain about subways for a second?\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:12.500\nYour subways are amazing, they're so good\n\n53:12.500 --> 53:14.500\nEverybody, you have great subways\n\n53:14.500 --> 53:18.500\nBut there's this sense of impending doom you feel on the subway\n\n53:18.500 --> 53:21.500\nBecause underground you don't have your phone, obviously\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:23.500\nI mean, you have it, but it doesn't work\n\n53:23.500 --> 53:25.500\nBut like, and then you could go above ground\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:28.500\nSo you always actually have your phone service\n\n53:28.500 --> 53:30.500\nBut you feel trapped, it's probably the iron bars\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:32.500\nI'm not gonna lie\n\n53:32.500 --> 53:36.500\nBut what really traps you is the fact that to go outside\n\n53:36.500 --> 53:40.500\nAnd then come back in just to check a text message costs two dollars\n\n53:40.500 --> 53:44.500\nAnd that two dollars is slavery\n\n53:44.500 --> 53:46.500\nIt traps everyone underground\n\n53:46.500 --> 53:48.500\nAnd makes them all stressed out\n\n53:48.500 --> 53:51.500\nBecause they don't wanna pay two dollars\n\n53:51.500 --> 53:53.500\nThat's not going anywhere, I don't know\n\n53:53.500 --> 53:57.500\nThey can't just put cell phones, like, repeaters down there?\n\n53:57.500 --> 54:00.500\nWell, I don't know, they don't do that, right? Yeah\n\n54:00.500 --> 54:02.500\nYou're trapped underground\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:06.500\nBut you're never trapped, you can always just walk up a stairwell\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:10.500\nYou just have to pay another two dollars to get back under\n\n54:10.500 --> 54:16.500\nOne of the trains I'm being told, I'm just being informed\n\n54:16.500 --> 54:18.500\nOne of the trains has cell service\n\n54:18.500 --> 54:21.500\nYou know, when I was a kid, I think everything's changed now\n\n54:21.500 --> 54:26.500\nBecause I know, like, you know, there's that concept of the graffiti-laden subway trains\n\n54:26.500 --> 54:27.500\nThey're really nice\n\n54:27.500 --> 54:29.500\nYeah, they're kind of nice now\n\n54:29.500 --> 54:32.500\nAnd I remember riding on them in the early aughts\n\n54:32.500 --> 54:34.500\nBut...\n\n54:34.500 --> 54:36.500\nThat's the year 2000\n\n54:36.500 --> 54:40.500\nGrowing up, when you're watching movies, it's just like the subways are like these things\n\n54:40.500 --> 54:42.500\nThey rumble and they're like movie sets, you know?\n\n54:42.500 --> 54:46.500\nThese gang members come out and they're like\n\n54:46.500 --> 54:48.500\nAttention, people!\n\n54:48.500 --> 54:52.500\nAnd everyone reads their newspaper with their umbrellas\n\n54:52.500 --> 54:54.500\nAnd goes like, oh, I won't pay attention\n\n54:54.500 --> 54:56.500\nAnd that's the tyranny of the city\n\n54:56.500 --> 55:01.500\nAnd they're like, I am warlord...\n\n55:01.500 --> 55:04.500\nLeon Saxon\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:08.500\nAnd you are my subsidiaries\n\n55:08.500 --> 55:12.500\nAnd then the whole point of the story is that some guy stands up and goes\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:18.500\nI've had it with you!\n\n55:18.500 --> 55:21.500\nAnd I don't know how much of that is based on truth\n\n55:21.500 --> 55:25.500\nI've ridden the subway a couple of times and none of that happened\n\n55:25.500 --> 55:28.500\nBut I assume that doesn't happen every time\n\n55:28.500 --> 55:34.500\nBut I mean, I've seen enough of The Last Dragon to know...\n\n55:34.500 --> 55:38.500\nTo know that Converse are kissed and...\n\n55:38.500 --> 55:40.500\nAlright, anyways\n\n55:40.500 --> 55:43.500\nI feel like we should meet people from New York\n\n55:43.500 --> 55:49.500\nI don't know if this is indicative of our runtime\n\n55:49.500 --> 55:52.500\nBut Erin texted me, Erin's sick, she's back in LA\n\n55:52.500 --> 55:55.500\nShe texted me a minute ago and said, how did it go?\n\n55:55.500 --> 55:58.500\nThat's 10.33pm\n\n55:58.500 --> 56:00.500\nAnd I'm like, well, it went...\n\n56:00.500 --> 56:01.500\nErin, that's her name\n\n56:01.500 --> 56:03.500\nIt's going\n\n56:03.500 --> 56:06.500\nYeah, we should get someone from the balcony, though, if that's okay\n\n56:06.500 --> 56:09.500\nAt least one person\n\n56:09.500 --> 56:12.500\nNo one on the bottom floor is applauding that idea\n\n56:12.500 --> 56:15.500\nWhat are we really basing on?\n\n56:15.500 --> 56:18.500\nI don't know, we've had a couple balcony shows\n\n56:18.500 --> 56:24.500\nGilbert, is there any kind of person you've ever wanted to talk to?\n\n56:24.500 --> 56:30.500\nNo, so let's skip this whole segment of the show\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:34.500\nIf someone in the balcony would like to leap\n\n56:41.500 --> 56:44.500\nI mean, what's that?\n\n56:44.500 --> 56:49.500\nYou're in pain\n\n56:49.500 --> 56:53.500\nThere's that, she's in pain\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:56.500\nWe've got that as a fallback\n\n56:56.500 --> 56:58.500\nShe is in pain\n\n56:58.500 --> 57:00.500\nI asked that sometimes, I go, who's in pain?\n\n57:00.500 --> 57:03.500\nBecause it's like the opposite of comedy in my shtick as Irene\n\n57:03.500 --> 57:06.500\nAnd we meet interesting people\n\n57:06.500 --> 57:09.500\nBut rarely are they actually in pain, I've noticed\n\n57:09.500 --> 57:13.500\nWell, sometimes the pain that throbs the hardest with them\n\n57:13.500 --> 57:15.500\nis the lack of being on stage\n\n57:15.500 --> 57:18.500\nI just...\n\n57:18.500 --> 57:20.500\nLike a lot of times, they're like...\n\n57:20.500 --> 57:22.500\nOw!\n\n57:22.500 --> 57:26.500\nMy spotlight bone is killing me\n\n57:26.500 --> 57:29.500\nOne of these days, I just want someone who's actually\n\n57:29.500 --> 57:31.500\njust has a back problem or something\n\n57:31.500 --> 57:34.500\nHe's loving life, he's having a great time\n\n57:34.500 --> 57:37.500\nShe's saying she's really in pain\n\n57:37.500 --> 57:43.500\nI think God's telling us that we should indulge this young lady\n\n57:43.500 --> 57:47.500\ndown in front of her\n\n57:47.500 --> 57:50.500\nI say we roll the dice\n\n57:50.500 --> 57:53.500\nBecause the alternative is that we kind of like, I don't know\n\n57:53.500 --> 57:57.500\nIt seems out I'm in pain and we ignore her and it's a joke\n\n57:57.500 --> 58:00.500\nI don't like what that says about the society\n\n58:00.500 --> 58:02.500\nYou've got a back problem\n\n58:02.500 --> 58:04.500\nWhat's your name, young lady?\n\n58:04.500 --> 58:08.500\nLana, let's thank Lana for coming up\n\n58:08.500 --> 58:11.500\nLet's see\n\n58:11.500 --> 58:16.500\nSit down and let's get to know your pain a little bit\n\n58:16.500 --> 58:19.500\nYeah, it's tough\n\n58:19.500 --> 58:22.500\nHave a seat\n\n58:22.500 --> 58:26.500\nYou're trying to endear them with an apparent stage fright\n\n58:26.500 --> 58:28.500\nafter going, I'm in pain!\n\n58:28.500 --> 58:30.500\nI want to be up there\n\n58:30.500 --> 58:32.500\nI am an actual fan\n\n58:32.500 --> 58:35.500\nBut you're also not like, holy fuck, there's a bunch of people\n\n58:35.500 --> 58:38.500\nNo, I am, it's wonderful\n\n58:38.500 --> 58:40.500\nAlso, hello\n\n58:40.500 --> 58:42.500\nHello\n\n58:42.500 --> 58:44.500\nWhat's...\n\n58:44.500 --> 58:48.500\nDid you meet Gilbert Gottfried?\n\n58:48.500 --> 58:51.500\nHoly motherfucking shit, it's Gilbert Gottfried\n\n58:51.500 --> 58:53.500\nYeah, also...\n\n58:53.500 --> 58:55.500\nI'm here too, hey, hey, hey\n\n58:55.500 --> 58:58.500\nHi, hey, hi, hey\n\n59:01.500 --> 59:04.500\nHi, I'm sorry\n\n59:04.500 --> 59:07.500\nHoly motherfucking shit\n\n59:07.500 --> 59:10.500\nIt's not that hard, is it? I mean, come on, he did it\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:13.500\nWhat's going on with your back?\n\n59:13.500 --> 59:17.500\nMy back has this weird thing\n\n59:17.500 --> 59:21.500\nIt's... because I'm an Ashkenazi Jew\n\n59:21.500 --> 59:23.500\nSo...\n\n59:23.500 --> 59:26.500\nSo I'm inbred as balls\n\n59:26.500 --> 59:28.500\nSo...\n\n59:28.500 --> 59:30.500\nFill me in on the Ashkenazi thing, Gilbert Gottfried\n\n59:30.500 --> 59:32.500\nYeah, see, those are two things\n\n59:32.500 --> 59:34.500\nThat's another applause getter\n\n59:34.500 --> 59:37.500\nAshkenazi Jews!\n\n59:40.500 --> 59:43.500\nHow many Ashkenazi Jews\n\n59:43.500 --> 59:49.500\nIn the audience have watched the documentary on the Chinese\n\n59:49.500 --> 59:53.500\nWhile living in Brooklyn\n\n59:53.500 --> 59:57.500\nI'm from Wisconsin, we have Ashkosh\n\n59:57.500 --> 59:59.500\nWhat's that?\n\n59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.500\nWhat's that? What is an Ashkenazi Jew?\n\n01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.500\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.500\nIt means...\n\n01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.500\nThese are Jews who watch Ozzy and Harriet\n\n01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.500\nIt means you're like Woody Allen Jew\n\n01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.500\nBut like way cooler\n\n01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.500\nThese aren't clear answers\n\n01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.500\nEastern European Jews\n\n01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500\nWhite Jews\n\n01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.500\nWait, are Jews non-white?\n\n01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.500\nSo Eastern European as opposed to...\n\n01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500\nMiddle Eastern\n\n01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.500\nOh, okay, got it, got it\n\n01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.500\nCaucasian Jews\n\n01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.500\nOkay, I get it, I get it\n\n01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.500\nSo your back is... you have a bad back?\n\n01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.500\nYep, yep, yep, yep\n\n01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.500\nBut it's cool because every time that I don't have like an allergy\n\n01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.500\nOr like a stomach problem, I'm just like, hey\n\n01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:03.500\nAre Ashkenazi Jews known for not having allergies or stomach problems?\n\n01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.500\nI don't know, this is my first time\n\n01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500\nAlright, New York's a big city\n\n01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500\nI say we keep looking for people\n\n01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.500\nLet's thank Lana, everybody\n\n01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.500\nThank you, thank you\n\n01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.500\nThere's nothing wrong with her, nothing wrong with her\n\n01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.500\nI mean, there's something wrong with her, she has back problems\n\n01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500\nI mean, there's nothing wrong with her as a human being\n\n01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.500\nI was right, physical pain isn't the way to go here\n\n01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500\nYou asked for it\n\n01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500\nShe did nothing wrong, she's a good person\n\n01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500\nNo, it's my fault\n\n01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500\nI say we keep going, though\n\n01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.500\nLet's plumb the depths\n\n01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.500\nI say we get someone with a dread disease\n\n01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.500\nSomeone who's got three days to live\n\n01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500\nYeah, to company\n\n01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500\nWhat are you guys calling out?\n\n01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.500\nI want to talk about fathers\n\n01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500\nYou want to talk about fathers?\n\n01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.500\nYours is dead, okay\n\n01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.500\nLet's put a pin in that, I got a dead father over here\n\n01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500\nYou know what, let's go\n\n01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.500\nWhy am I, let's go out there\n\n01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500\nIs this wireless?\n\n01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500\nBecause I can't hear you guys that well\n\n01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500\nOh, I just realized how loud I am when I'm up there\n\n01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500\nI keep shouting into the mic\n\n01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500\nWho was raising their hand over here?\n\n01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.500\nWait, over, over\n\n01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500\nWhat did you have?\n\n01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.500\nHe's black, he's half black\n\n01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.500\nWait, wait, this guy's got a rebuttal\n\n01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500\nI'm kind of black\n\n01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500\nHe's kind of black\n\n01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.500\nIs that more or less than half black?\n\n01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500\nHe doesn't remember\n\n01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500\nThat's, that's severe\n\n01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500\nLike, that's serious\n\n01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.500\nLike, as hard as it is to be fully black or half black\n\n01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.500\nI'm going to take a wild guess\n\n01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500\nI'm going to take a wild guess\n\n01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.500\nThat there's no 100% black person\n\n01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500\nIn this audience\n\n01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500\nLet's beat, let's beat Gilbert's challenge\n\n01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500\nYou're, I'm sorry, black\n\n01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500\n100% black\n\n01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500\nAnd gay\n\n01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.500\nCome on, come on, come on\n\n01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500\nCome on\n\n01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500\nNew York\n\n01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.500\nWe got New York\n\n01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.500\n100% black and gay\n\n01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.500\nIn your face\n\n01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.500\nUh, are you, are you with any pain?\n\n01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.500\nAside from the obvious\n\n01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.500\nNo physical pain, just deep spiritual pain\n\n01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.500\nDeep spiritual pain\n\n01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.500\nNow you're 100% black\n\n01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.500\nYou're not a security guard here, are you?\n\n01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.500\nAll you enough know is weird\n\n01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500\nI tried and it turned me down\n\n01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.500\nHe's a, he's a fan of mine, Gilbert\n\n01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500\nEat it, eat it\n\n01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.500\nI have 100% black gay fans\n\n01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500\nRight here\n\n01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.500\nBut what do we, 100% black\n\n01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500\nHow do we even know?\n\n01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.500\nI mean, would you in like basic\n\n01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500\nRounding up probably, but as far as I know\n\n01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.500\nWell rounding up is how though, I mean that's a terrible\n\n01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.500\nI'm sure it's a drop, I'm sure I've got drops of something somewhere\n\n01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500\nBut as far as I know it's 100% black\n\n01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.500\nI'm sure Thomas Jefferson somewhere in there was like\n\n01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.500\nHe was like, you're a great, great, great, great, great, great\n\n01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500\nGreat grandma that's real good\n\n01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:46.500\nYeah, I think we all are kind of like\n\n01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.500\nA little less pure than anyone would\n\n01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.500\nI don't think anyone of us want to be, right?\n\n01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.500\nWhite people want to be a quarter Cherokee\n\n01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.500\nAnyways, but 100% black as far as you can tell\n\n01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.500\nYou've traced it back\n\n01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.500\nWhere does the gayness come in?\n\n01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:10.500\nI think we all know where the gayness comes in\n\n01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500\nGilbert!\n\n01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.500\nI would rather not picture it in my head right now\n\n01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.500\nNo, come on, it's 2014\n\n01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500\nWe all want to picture it in our heads\n\n01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500\nI'm kind of curious about like\n\n01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:34.500\nAre you New York raised in the reared?\n\n01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.500\nNo\n\n01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500\nAre you a New York native?\n\n01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500\nI'm not a New York native, I'm a DC native\n\n01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500\nDC?\n\n01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.500\nIsn't that the murder capital of the world?\n\n01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.500\nNo, no, no, AIDS infestation\n\n01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.500\nInfestation?\n\n01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500\nAIDS capital?\n\n01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.500\nAIDS capital world, yes\n\n01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500\nMurder capital world is like Jersey I think\n\n01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500\nOr Baltimore\n\n01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500\nCamden\n\n01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.500\nThen not Jersey then, but somewhere else, not DC\n\n01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:11.500\nIs it true that when gay guys have anal sex\n\n01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.500\nThey scream out, the tingler is losing it?\n\n01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.500\nThe tingler, the tingler is losing it\n\n01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.500\nI'm wondering how you know all this\n\n01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:27.500\nOkay, let's ask some standard gay questions\n\n01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500\nIf you'll indulge them\n\n01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.500\nGo\n\n01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.500\nAnd you're not an ambassador of gayness\n\n01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.500\nSo I want to get subjective\n\n01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.500\nThis is a question I'm always curious about\n\n01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.500\nIs there a moment in your life when you knew\n\n01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.500\nDid you think like, uh oh, there's a division\n\n01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.500\nLike I think differently, I feel differently\n\n01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.500\nAnd I think it's more than just like me being\n\n01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.500\nAn individual, I think I'm on the other side\n\n01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500\nOf a line that's being drawn somehow\n\n01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.500\nWas there a crucial moment in your life?\n\n01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.500\nNo, I never had that like, uh\n\n01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.500\nOh wow, gay moment, I just sort of had like\n\n01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.500\nOh, you like dudes, you like chicks\n\n01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500\nI like dudes too, but you don't kind of thing\n\n01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.500\nIt's really easy back while I was going up\n\n01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.500\nIs it just really easy in DC?\n\n01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500\nIt's easy\n\n01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500\nActually no, it's not, I don't know how I got that\n\n01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.500\nMaybe it's easy for you, maybe\n\n01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500\nMaybe it's a new generation\n\n01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500\nFor me I had it easy, but I never had like a\n\n01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500\nAgainst each other moment, or like a\n\n01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500\nHere is the division line, so Jordan always knew\n\n01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.500\nI think that might be a Gen X thing\n\n01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500\nLike every gay character in every movie\n\n01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500\nHas to have a monologue where they're like\n\n01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500\nAnd then Toby got out of the swimming pool\n\n01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.500\nAnd he said, do you want to have a sleepover?\n\n01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.500\nAnd I was like, yeah\n\n01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500\nAnd he's like, cause we both like girls, right?\n\n01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.500\nAnd I said, yeah\n\n01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.500\nAnd I was lying\n\n01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.500\nUh, but maybe\n\n01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500\nMaybe you're part of a new\n\n01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500\nGeneration of Star Children that was like\n\n01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.500\nSaw those movies and you're like\n\n01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500\nI'm one of the, I'm gay\n\n01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500\nI'm not going to make the mistake that guy made\n\n01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.500\nOh no, I mean\n\n01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500\nI didn't have a Vincent Price moment so I wanted it\n\n01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.500\nYeah\n\n01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.500\nSpiders delight\n\n01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.500\nYour birthday cake covered in demons\n\n01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.500\nMy name is Harry\n\n01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500\nAll the vampires\n\n01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500\nCall me Harry\n\n01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.500\nWhat's the\n\n01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.500\nOkay, now let's talk about something really\n\n01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500\nReally sensitive\n\n01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500\nBut probably not in New York\n\n01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.500\nBecause New York is the most\n\n01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500\nProgressive, incredible city on the planet\n\n01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500\nBut everywhere else\n\n01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500\nLike, inquiring minds want to know\n\n01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.500\nWhere does the black and the gay\n\n01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.500\nIntersect? Like what is the\n\n01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500\nConflict on that guys' trip?\n\n01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500\nBecause\n\n01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500\nWhite, straight, fat Jim\n\n01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500\nBelushi's like me\n\n01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500\nWe worship gay people\n\n01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500\nAnd black people\n\n01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.500\nAnd if you want to know the gods on his truth\n\n01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500\nAnd I can confess this to you and no one else\n\n01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500\nAt a certain point where like\n\n01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500\nBlack people are yesterday's news\n\n01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.500\nThey can take care of themselves now\n\n01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500\nGay people are the new black\n\n01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.500\nBut in any case\n\n01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.500\nI'm sorry to break that to you\n\n01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.500\nBut\n\n01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.500\nBut also\n\n01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500\nThere's like this unspoken thing\n\n01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500\nIt's like to the extent\n\n01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.500\nThat you can circumscribe black culture\n\n01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.500\nLike\n\n01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500\nBlack culture shouldn't have\n\n01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500\nLike\n\n01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500\nThere's a homophobia that's allowed\n\n01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500\nRight? Like, right?\n\n01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.500\nI mean\n\n01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500\nYes?\n\n01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500\nYes, is the answer to your question\n\n01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500\nIt's not as called out because what are we supposed to do\n\n01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500\nWe're going to kick down every door and go like\n\n01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500\nEverybody except gay people\n\n01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.500\nAnd then we're like\n\n01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500\nBlack people\n\n01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500\nWe'll put a pin in it\n\n01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.500\nWe're already trying to\n\n01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.500\nWe'll come back to you\n\n01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500\nWe want to be hypocrites\n\n01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.500\nCome into your living room\n\n01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.500\nAnd go like, you black people are not tolerant enough\n\n01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500\nIt's too meta for us\n\n01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500\nOkay, you could be homophobic\n\n01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.500\nFor a little while longer\n\n01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.500\nWe'll figure that out when the time comes\n\n01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.500\nWe'll get a pass and do it later\n\n01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.500\nIt's like suburban white kids\n\n01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500\nIn the 90s listening to gangster rap\n\n01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500\nIt's like there's heavy overtones\n\n01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.500\nOf, you know, if you were gay listening to that stuff\n\n01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.500\nAnd you were black\n\n01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500\nI would think that you would be\n\n01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500\nYou would be like, shit\n\n01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500\nIt's\n\n01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500\nOh, fuck\n\n01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500\nIt's a little bit like that, it's like\n\n01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500\nWell fuck, what am I listening to now\n\n01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500\nBut at the same time\n\n01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.500\nGarth Brooks is really good sometimes\n\n01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.500\nI hear\n\n01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500\nYeah\n\n01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500\nHe's not going to help you\n\n01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500\nNo, it's weird\n\n01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500\nBecause you have these two minorities\n\n01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:01.500\nAnd they both have their own sort of\n\n01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500\nPsychologies about them\n\n01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500\nYou're black, you're gay, you're this\n\n01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500\nIt's not really intersecting\n\n01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500\nA lot for people's\n\n01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500\nBut I mean, you sort of work it out\n\n01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500\nYou figure it out\n\n01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500\nEverybody works everything out\n\n01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.500\nWhy is every cultural movement\n\n01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500\nIn our country\n\n01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500\nWhy do I get the feeling that the unspoken\n\n01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500\nFoundation of it is the idea that\n\n01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.500\nWhite people are going to end everything\n\n01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500\nIncluding racism\n\n01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500\nIf racism is a problem\n\n01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500\nIt can be solved, white people will take care of it\n\n01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500\nI think your missing point is more\n\n01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500\nWhite people are going to end in 40 years\n\n01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500\nI think that's what we're working against\n\n01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.500\nI think white people are like\n\n01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.500\nWhat do we do about racism\n\n01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500\nLet's have a meeting about racism\n\n01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500\nI think\n\n01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500\nWe'll just make more of us\n\n01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.500\nAnd I'll populate you\n\n01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500\nI'll populate you\n\n01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500\nSo\n\n01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.500\nWhen you have\n\n01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.500\nA friend\n\n01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500\nAnd they're black\n\n01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.500\nDo you mean friend or do you mean friend?\n\n01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.500\nNot like in a gay way\n\n01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.500\nIs that what you mean?\n\n01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.500\nLike\n\n01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.500\nI feel like my six black friends\n\n01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500\nSix?\n\n01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500\nWell one of them is probably going\n\n01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.500\nLike\n\n01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.500\nMe?\n\n01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500\nOne of them\n\n01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500\nJerry Miner is listening right now\n\n01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500\nWhat do you dare?\n\n01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500\nIs it a little brown back there?\n\n01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500\nThat's like wait\n\n01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.500\nAs a black man\n\n01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500\nWhen you see black people coming at you\n\n01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500\nDo you get scared?\n\n01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.500\nOh man, I mean, dare across the street so fast\n\n01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.500\nNo\n\n01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.500\nActually, you know what? I'll answer that question\n\n01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500\nThat's a good question\n\n01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.500\nI do\n\n01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.500\nPeople get scared of people\n\n01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.500\nIf somebody is white\n\n01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.500\nI'll go across the street\n\n01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.500\nAnd somebody like\n\n01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500\nCan't leave\n\n01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500\nIt's just like when you see people who aren't you\n\n01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.500\nYou don't know them, I don't know who you are\n\n01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.500\nWell I cross the street when I see strangers coming\n\n01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.500\nYeah, exactly\n\n01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.500\nBut like if it's a black stranger I gotta stay on this slide\n\n01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:05.500\nLike any other stranger I gotta cross the street\n\n01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500\nBlack stranger, damn it, can't do it\n\n01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.500\nIt's that whole thing\n\n01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500\nI have to\n\n01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.500\nYou gotta stay on the same slide\n\n01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500\nI give him a fist bump as you walk by us\n\n01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500\nI'm always wondering\n\n01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500\nWith race in the 21st century\n\n01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.500\nIs now that we've accomplished\n\n01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500\nThe fact that we go like, you know what\n\n01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.500\nThis is an artificial construct\n\n01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500\nIt absolutely is, physically\n\n01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500\nBecause two random\n\n01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500\nWhite people\n\n01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500\nWould be physically as different\n\n01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500\nFrom each other as\n\n01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500\nLike a black person from a white person\n\n01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500\nIn a technical kind of like sense\n\n01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.500\nIt is an artificial construct that's being perpetuated\n\n01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500\nLike the idea that there is such a thing\n\n01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.500\nAs race, and I get that\n\n01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.500\nBut at the same time, like we are\n\n01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500\nLike we have all this momentum, so it's like\n\n01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500\nWhen a black person walks in the room\n\n01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500\nLike I don't\n\n01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.500\nLike my 41 year old white brain\n\n01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.500\nNever goes, never, never\n\n01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500\nIt never is unaware of race\n\n01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500\nLike I go, a black guy can just walk to the room\n\n01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.500\nNow I can\n\n01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.500\nWell if that's true, then why don't you bring me\n\n01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.500\nAll the states where I came in first\n\n01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.500\nWell I didn't, listen\n\n01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500\nYou can come by anytime\n\n01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.500\nWhen you're happy\n\n01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.500\nOr excited, do you ever yell\n\n01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.500\nDie no more\n\n01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.500\nFor those of you\n\n01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500\nFor those of you listening and not seeing\n\n01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.500\nOur guest bears a resemblance\n\n01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.500\nIt's possible if you're just listening\n\n01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.500\nI could have sounded incredibly racist\n\n01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500\nBut the truth is there is a resemblance\n\n01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.500\nBut that doesn't mean I'm not\n\n01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.500\nIncredibly racist\n\n01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.500\nNo, no, no, that's still an option\n\n01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.500\nIt can be both\n\n01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.500\nWhat I always want to know\n\n01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.500\nAnd I only want to know just recreationally\n\n01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500\nNow because I'm 41 and I'm just like\n\n01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.500\nI'm dying, I'm just like\n\n01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500\nI can't change my brain\n\n01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.500\nBut I'm always curious\n\n01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:13.500\nI think 85% of everybody\n\n01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.500\nIs always full of shit\n\n01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500\nAnd 85% of people\n\n01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.500\nIn a certain age\n\n01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.500\nWere like, oh\n\n01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500\nRace matters a lot\n\n01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500\nAnd so we should be really mean to people\n\n01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.500\nThat look like this\n\n01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.500\nInstead of like that\n\n01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.500\nAnd then we entered a new era\n\n01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500\nWhere we're like, okay because of the work of heroes\n\n01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.500\nAnd brave people that risked shit\n\n01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.500\nAnd cool things\n\n01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.500\nThen we entered an era where we're like\n\n01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.500\nOkay, race is not supposed to matter\n\n01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500\nBut we also just entered an era\n\n01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500\nWhere 85% of people, i.e. idiots\n\n01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500\nJust started going, I'm going to start enforcing that\n\n01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500\nLike a fucking idiot\n\n01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500\nYou're still talking to a bunch of dumb people\n\n01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.500\nWho are like now lynching racists\n\n01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.500\nInstead of\n\n01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:57.500\nThey're just writing letters to TV Guide\n\n01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.500\nAnd going, I couldn't help but notice\n\n01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.500\nI'm being a responsible thing\n\n01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.500\nYou're still an idiot\n\n01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500\nLike you're, we just went from\n\n01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.500\nA different, from one form of coward\n\n01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.500\nTo another form of coward\n\n01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.500\nAnd I always wonder\n\n01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500\nWhen you cancel all that out\n\n01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500\nAnd just go, everything cowardly is cowardly\n\n01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500\nAnd everything brave is everything brave\n\n01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.500\nIn the grand scheme of things\n\n01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.500\nLike what is the actual definition\n\n01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.500\nOf\n\n01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.500\nNot racist\n\n01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.500\nIs it actual\n\n01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:31.500\nBecause the modern definition is\n\n01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.500\nWhat's that?\n\n01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.500\nThe pornography industry\n\n01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.500\nHas like achieved it, right?\n\n01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.500\nIs that what you mean?\n\n01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500\nBecause it's like, we don't\n\n01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.500\nThey have every license to be grody\n\n01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500\nBut it's just sort of like\n\n01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500\nThis is absolutely true\n\n01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.500\nBecause you know, I love porn\n\n01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.500\nTitles where they\n\n01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500\nTwist around\n\n01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500\nThe real movie titles\n\n01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500\nLike Ram Bone\n\n01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.500\nLike that\n\n01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.500\nI saw one\n\n01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.500\nA porn film\n\n01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500\nThat was a black guy and a white girl\n\n01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.500\nAnd it was called\n\n01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500\nAmos and Candy\n\n01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.500\nThat's 100% true\n\n01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.500\nThat's 100% true that you want\n\n01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500\nThat?\n\n01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500\nIt was the greatest time\n\n01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500\nCheck it out\n\n01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500\nIt would make me feel a little bad watching it\n\n01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500\nJust\n\n01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500\nOut of alliteration\n\n01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500\nI just always wonder like\n\n01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.500\nIs consciousness of racism\n\n01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.500\nOr is like\n\n01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.500\nBecause now that that's become\n\n01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.500\nThe new definition of racism\n\n01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500\nNow it's like\n\n01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.500\nYou could go into a room full of people\n\n01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500\nAnd the first person that acknowledges\n\n01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.500\nRace\n\n01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.500\nThat's a weakness, that's a human weakness\n\n01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500\nAnd it's the actual\n\n01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.500\nIt's the\n\n01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.500\nLess brave\n\n01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.500\nIt's the easier thing to do\n\n01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500\nIt's the more socially acceptable thing\n\n01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.500\nTo point out\n\n01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.500\nRacism is whoever smelt it dealt it\n\n01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.500\nWhoever smelt it dealt it\n\n01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.500\nThat's the new rule of racism\n\n01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.500\nIt's like\n\n01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.500\nIt is true that someone\n\n01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.500\nThat would be cognizant of race\n\n01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.500\nAnd might reflect that\n\n01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.500\nThat might be a symptom of latent racism\n\n01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500\nBut at the same time\n\n01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500\nIf we're rooting that out\n\n01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.500\nWhat's left?\n\n01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.500\nAren't we actually creating some weird garden\n\n01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500\nWhere we\n\n01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500\nYou're always obsessed with race\n\n01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.500\nI have so many friends who come to me\n\n01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.500\nHey man, no we're friends\n\n01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500\nBut ask like you're black, right?\n\n01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.500\nYeah, like\n\n01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.500\nJust ask a question\n\n01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500\nYou have a question, just ask it\n\n01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500\nI think people are also\n\n01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500\nPre-obsessed with race\n\n01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.500\nAs the first thing\n\n01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500\nI'm always stressed out\n\n01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500\nLike oh there's a black guy\n\n01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.500\nOkay whatever\n\n01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.500\nBut if your friend was a redhead\n\n01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.500\nOr a blonde or a brunette\n\n01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.500\nA friend is a redhead\n\n01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.500\nThat's pretty hot\n\n01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500\nThere's the same\n\n01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500\nEmphasis on\n\n01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.500\nConsciousness of it\n\n01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.500\nI think that's the goal\n\n01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.500\nMy friend is tall\n\n01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500\nMy friend has freckles\n\n01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.500\nMy friend is blonde\n\n01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.500\nThere's redhead stereotypes\n\n01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.500\nAnd there's all this stuff\n\n01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500\nAnd these are phenotypical characteristics\n\n01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.500\nThat you can be conscious of\n\n01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.500\nAnd you can be entertained by\n\n01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.500\nYou can be amused by\n\n01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500\nBut the big difference is\n\n01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500\nRace, which is an artificial construct\n\n01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500\nHas this wall where it's representative\n\n01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.500\nIt's like if you took redheads\n\n01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.500\nAnd you said some weird shit about them\n\n01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500\nAnd then there was like this crazy wall\n\n01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.500\nAnd everyone was like walking on eggshells\n\n01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.500\nAnd there was all this weird energy\n\n01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.500\nI've never had friends who were scared to\n\n01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500\nJust sort of say\n\n01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.500\nFor lack of a better term\n\n01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500\nJust racist shit, like they make jokes about race\n\n01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.500\nThey make jokes about like you know black guy\n\n01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.500\nJoke, white guy joke, whatever kind of joke\n\n01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.500\nAnd just sort of do it\n\n01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500\nYou're one of the people now\n\n01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500\nIn comedy you address race\n\n01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.500\nLike oh, it's a factor of our life\n\n01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.500\nIt's going to be a joke, but I mean\n\n01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:11.500\nYou don't have to dance around it\n\n01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:13.500\nYou don't have to be on eggshells\n\n01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500\nThere are people who know like\n\n01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500\nOkay, whatever, and there's race\n\n01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.500\nOh, there's race, kind of thing\n\n01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.500\nSo like for me\n\n01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500\nIt's always been like people I know are just like\n\n01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.500\nOh, yeah, we're black, we're going to keep on moving\n\n01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500\nIs there another question?\n\n01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.500\nYeah, I can't figure it out\n\n01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.500\nI'm just so glad you came up here\n\n01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.500\nAnd made me feel like a better person\n\n01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.500\nWhich is the new racism\n\n01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500\nYou're welcome\n\n01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500\nWhat was your name again?\n\n01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.500\nI forgot\n\n01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.500\nWhat's that?\n\n01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500\nThat's a weird name\n\n01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:53.500\nYou're like a Game of Thrones character\n\n01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500\nI could be, I very well could be\n\n01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500\nWill you stay up here and play Dungeons & Dragons with us?\n\n01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.500\nI'm going to sign, yes, I've never played\n\n01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.500\nWell, yeah, it's okay\n\n01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:07.500\nEither has Gilbert Gottfried and he's going to be like\n\n01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.500\nCrucial to the\n\n01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500\nI think it's very important\n\n01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500\nFor me to mention\n\n01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500\nHe's wearing a Batman t-shirt\n\n01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500\nAnd on

Gilbert Gottfried's podcast\n\n01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.500\nThere's no question about that\n\n01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.500\nYou can hear it on\n\n01:21:35.500 -->

re-run, isn't it?\n\n01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.500\nYes, you go\n\n01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500\nWatch you talking about it\n\n01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.500\nNow, okay, this is racism\n\n01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.500\nBecause the only thing\n\n01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500\nHe looks a little bit\n\n01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.500\nHe looks like Jimmy Walker\n\n01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.500\nSo the dynamite thing was not racist\n\n01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500\nHey, hey, hey, and what you're talking about\n\n01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.500\nIs racist\n\n01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.500\nBecause you're saying\n\n01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.500\nDo things that other black people do\n\n01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.500\nHow do they live in color?\n\n01:22:23.500 -->

catchphrase?\n\n01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500\nHe didn't just say what's happening\n\n01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500\nWhat was the title of the show?\n\n01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.500\nHe used to dance,

01:22:47.500\nFat Albert said hey, hey, hey\n\n01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500\nThe guy who was spring\n\n01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.500\nSomeone else said hey, hey, hey\n\n01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.500\nHis name\n\n01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.500\nHis name was Dwayne\n\n01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.500\nI think Dwayne used to go\n\n01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500\nHey, hey, hey\n\n01:23:01.500

hey, hey\n\n01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.500\nWe're gonna find\n\n01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500\nWe're gonna find a female\n\n01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.500\nOr at least a somewhat feminine friend\n\n01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500\nI'm sorry, balcony\n\n01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500\nWe have someone who called out I'm also gay\n\n01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.500\nAnd offered we could have an all gay stage\n\n01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500\nThose words don't make sense\n\n01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500\nNow we have people yelling out bye, bye\n\n01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500\nWhat,

black\n\n01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500\nCulture is necessarily like homophobic\n\n01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500\nBut like the idea of certain black\n\n01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.500\nPeople who want equal rights but are still\n\n01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500\nHomophobic I just had\n\n01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.500\nI had an experience that\n\n01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.500\nThat was very like\n\n01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500\nExemplified that\n\n01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.500\nBecause I have I sort of have this problem\n\n01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.500\nWhere whenever I'm drunk in public\n\n01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.500\nI forget that it's not okay\n\n01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.500\nTo make racist jokes\n\n01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.500\nSo\n\n01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500\nSo like it was\n\n01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.500\nSo\n\n01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:55.500\nI know you can't see but I want you to know\n\n01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.500\nYou're killing right now\n\n01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.500\nAnd also here is a drink\n\n01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.500\nI\n\n01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.500\nI feel terrible about this\n\n01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500\nBut you realize there's not a\n\n01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.500\nPodcast going on right now\n\n01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500\nJust a really good surround\n\n01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500\nSound laugh track\n\n01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.500\nNow can I ask you a question\n\n01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.500\nYeah, yeah\n\n01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.500\nIf God came down and said\n\n01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500\nWe can give you perfect sight\n\n01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.500\nBut you'd have to be black\n\n01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.500\nBlack\n\n01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.500\nThat's\n\n01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.500\nThat's a toughie\n\n01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.500\nThat's control\n\n01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.500\nWow I just it just hit me\n\n01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.500\nThat Gilbert Godfrey just said\n\n01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500\nSomething to me\n\n01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.500\nHoly fuck this is not\n\n01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.500\nOkay\n\n01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.500\nSo the story so yeah like I said\n\n01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.500\nI get drunk and forget\n\n01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.500\nThat I can't just shout like racist jokes\n\n01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500\nSo anyway there's this like\n\n01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.500\nI was just standing outside\n\n01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500\nAnd like there's just a bunch of people standing around\n\n01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500\nIn my college and like one kid said\n\n01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.500\nSomething about like being white\n\n01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.500\nLike he was just like oh he said something about how white\n\n01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.500\nHe was so naturally I was just like oh white power\n\n01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500\nAnd\n\n01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.500\nAnd like\n\n01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.500\nAnd then like some\n\n01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.500\nAnd then there was like\n\n01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.500\nThere was some black kid standing around\n\n01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500\nAnd he kind of like felt like he was like pissed at me\n\n01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500\nSo I was just like oh shit\n\n01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.500\nSo I just went up to him and was like hey man\n\n01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.500\nLike I don't really mean it I'm just drunk\n\n01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.500\nI'm just joking around obviously like I don't mean it\n\n01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.500\nAnd he was like alright whatever we like you know exchange\n\n01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.500\nYou know tell each other names and stuff\n\n01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500\nAnd then like a minute later he was\n\n01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.500\nI think he was in a frat and I think maybe he was talking to\n\n01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.500\nOne of his pledgers or something\n\n01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.500\nBut he called some kid a faggot\n\n01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.500\nAnd I was like dude\n\n01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500\nYou can't get mad when I make a racist joke\n\n01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.500\nAnd then call someone a faggot\n\n01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.500\nAnd he was just like oh really\n\n01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500\nAnd he got all defensive and I was like yes\n\n01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500\nYou know like blacks are like you know\n\n01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500\nThey get shit and then like so do gay people\n\n01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.500\nAnd like he got all defensive and he was like\n\n01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.500\nOh really you know got all like oh really\n\n01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.500\nGays have gone through the same shit that blacks have\n\n01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.500\nAnd I don't know\n\n01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.500\nI mean you know they're not shooting\n\n01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.500\nGay people to death in Ferguson\n\n01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.500\nThere's a I mean\n\n01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.500\nWell that is true but they still\n\n01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.500\nCan't even beat them\n\n01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.500\nYeah yeah no so I'm like\n\n01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.500\nEither make jokes about everyone\n\n01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.500\nOr jokes about no one\n\n01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.500\nYou can't like say like\n\n01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500\nYou know\n\n01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500\nLike I'm not gonna say\n\n01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:39.500\nOh you can make jokes about black people\n\n01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.500\nBut as soon as you make a blind joke\n\n01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.500\nFuck you\n\n01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.500\nAnd I don't think\n\n01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500\nI think individuals are geniuses\n\n01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500\nAnd populations are idiots\n\n01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.500\nI mean I think\n\n01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.500\nThere's some individuals\n\n01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.500\nMany individuals are idiots too\n\n01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500\nBut I do think\n\n01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500\nIf you cornered an individual\n\n01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500\nPerson from the quote unquote\n\n01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.500\nBlack community\n\n01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:05.500\nAnd deposed them about that\n\n01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.500\nThey would go\n\n01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.500\nOh you're absolutely right but I also think\n\n01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.500\nThat you get swept up in the idea that\n\n01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.500\nAnd I don't say this for applause\n\n01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500\nBecause I'm a white person\n\n01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.500\nPlease don't applaud after I say this\n\n01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.500\nBut this is the thing that I always remind myself of\n\n01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.500\nNow\n\n01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.500\nI just asked you specifically\n\n01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.500\nNot to do something\n\n01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500\nOh you applied it before I said it\n\n01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.500\nOkay\n\n01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.500\nIt really\n\n01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.500\nIs profound when you realize like\n\n01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.500\nOkay\n\n01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.500\nThere's a huge amount\n\n01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.500\nOf analogies you can draw\n\n01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.500\nFor marginalized populations\n\n01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.500\nOf any kind\n\n01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.500\nWhether you're talking about nerds\n\n01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.500\nThe physically challenged\n\n01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.500\nOf\n\n01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.500\nSexuality\n\n01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.500\nBut\n\n01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:55.500\nRace has this really distinct\n\n01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.500\nThing which is you cannot\n\n01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.500\nYou just\n\n01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:01.500\nDon't have an option\n\n01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500\nYou wake up and you\n\n01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500\nAnd I think that there's\n\n01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.500\nEven if that's not accurate\n\n01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.500\nI think that there's a feeling underneath there\n\n01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500\nIt's like I woke up black this morning\n\n01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.500\nYou know\n\n01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:15.500\nAnd it's not like I\n\n01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.500\nShows to be gay\n\n01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.500\nNo no no god damn it\n\n01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.500\nThat's not what I mean\n\n01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.500\nThat's not what I mean at all\n\n01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.500\nI just mean that gay people\n\n01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.500\nCan look like straight people in line at the bank\n\n01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.500\nYou mean that there's this overpowering\n\n01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.500\nPresence of race all the time\n\n01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.500\nI mean that racism is really\n\n01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.500\nReally really easy\n\n01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.500\nTo accomplish\n\n01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:39.500\nYou can accomplish it through closed windows of cars\n\n01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500\nYou can accomplish it across countries\n\n01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.500\nYou can accomplish it through binoculars\n\n01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500\nLike it's\n\n01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.500\nReally unfairly easy\n\n01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.500\nTo knock out\n\n01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.500\nWe've had so much time\n\n01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.500\nTo be racist or alarming racist\n\n01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.500\nIt's like we've had race\n\n01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.500\nIn those countries where you had this country\n\n01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.500\nAnd we've always focused about it\n\n01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.500\nAnd all these other social issues that come up\n\n01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.500\nPeople don't give them much time\n\n01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.500\nThey haven't had 150 years to say\n\n01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500\nOh yeah maybe I'm wrong about that\n\n01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.500\nBut please please everybody\n\n01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500\nThat's gay that's listening to me\n\n01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500\nSaying that anything is harder than anything else\n\n01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.500\nI understand also\n\n01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500\nI'm going to say that being black is harder than being gay\n\n01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500\nI'm sorry\n\n01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.500\nI will argue with you\n\n01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.500\nBecause also it's like\n\n01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.500\nFor the very same I think\n\n01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.500\nIt's apples and oranges\n\n01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.500\nWhere black people and gay people\n\n01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500\nBut apples are way better than oranges\n\n01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500\nIt's come to that point in the conversation\n\n01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.500\nWhere it's just a bunch of straight white people\n\n01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.500\nExplaining things to black gay people\n\n01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.500\nIt's like whatever\n\n01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500\nIt won't do any good from here\n\n01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.500\nThere's apples and oranges, do I get cherries?\n\n01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.500\nAnd I don't want to pronounce anything\n\n01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.500\nI just want to say out loud\n\n01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.500\nAs a big fat straight white guy\n\n01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500\nLike what fascinates me\n\n01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.500\nAnd what I think about when I'm laying in bed at night\n\n01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.500\nStaring at the ceiling going what do blind people think\n\n01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.500\nWhat do gay people think\n\n01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.500\nBy the way god damn it\n\n01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.500\nI'm a huge fan of blindness\n\n01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.500\nOh yeah it's good\n\n01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.500\nI can give you the advice\n\n01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.500\nIt's like it's a lot cooler\n\n01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.500\nYou know from the outside\n\n01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500\nYou know\n\n01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.500\nYou know it's\n\n01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.500\nReally it's not\n\n01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500\nIt's not fun to be deprived\n\n01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.500\nOf 90% of your primate\n\n01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.500\nI mean yeah it's\n\n01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.500\nHave you heard me on the podcast\n\n01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:33.500\nTalk about your\n\n01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500\nYou know I'm actually like I think I'm like\n\n01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.500\nMy sister was telling me\n\n01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.500\nLike she was saying like oh an episode\n\n01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.500\nLike 109 or something\n\n01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.500\nYou were talking about blind people\n\n01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.500\nBut I have not gotten there yet\n\n01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.500\nI said you're full of shit\n\n01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:49.500\nI said you're the reason Ralph Nader got somebody\n\n01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.500\nVotes\n\n01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500\nI'm damn proud of it\n\n01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.500\nNow has any\n\n01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:57.500\nBlind person\n\n01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.500\nIn real life\n\n01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.500\nEver said to another person\n\n01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.500\nI want to see what you look\n\n01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500\nLike and then start touching\n\n01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.500\nTheir face\n\n01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.500\nI don't know all\n\n01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.500\nBlind people so I can't\n\n01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.500\nThat's very\n\n01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.500\nGilbert Godfrey\n\n01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:25.500\nI want to know what you look like\n\n01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500\nCan I touch your face\n\n01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.500\nTouch his face\n\n01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.500\nTouch his face\n\n01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.500\nGilbert get your face over to this guy\n\n01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.500\nHe's coming\n\n01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.500\nThat's a real\n\n01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.500\nThat's a real nice face he got\n\n01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:03.500\nAnyway\n\n01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.500\nThe answer to that question is yes\n\n01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.500\nYes it just happened\n\n01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.500\nThat may have been the first time\n\n01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.500\nDo you know what his face looks like now?\n\n01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.500\nYeah\n\n01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:15.500\nI mean I think I already\n\n01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.500\nI think I already knew\n\n01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.500\nNow was the movie\n\n01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.500\nSent of a woman totally full of shit\n\n01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.500\nI\n\n01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.500\nI'm not familiar with that\n\n01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.500\nAre you saying you didn't see it?\n\n01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.500\nI did not\n\n01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.500\nWell played\n\n01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.500\nNo I did not\n\n01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500\nOld school blind jokes\n\n01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.500\nNo you would not be surprised\n\n01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500\nLike how many of my friends just like\n\n01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.500\nSomething will happen that I didn't expect\n\n01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.500\nDid you not see it coming\n\n01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.500\nAlright that was\n\n01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.500\nModerately clever the first\n\n01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:53.500\nSeven times\n\n01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.500\nNo it's like I don't\n\n01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500\nSo I just want to get some background\n\n01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.500\nBecause I mean being blind could\n\n01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.500\nWhat's the back story born\n\n01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:03.500\nNo I was born blind in my right eye\n\n01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500\nAnd I always had\n\n01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.500\nProblems with my left eye\n\n01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.500\nLike I could never like really read\n\n01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.500\nLike I could never really read\n\n01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.500\nLike I could kind of read a large print\n\n01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.500\nBut not really like that well\n\n01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.500\nSo I always red brailed but like I could\n\n01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.500\nSee well enough to like get around and stuff like that\n\n01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.500\nBut um\n\n01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.500\nIt's I mean there's like a lot of detail to go into\n\n01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.500\nAnd I honestly at this point I can't tell\n\n01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.500\nBecause I've like told this story so many times\n\n01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.500\nThat I can't tell if it's boring or I'm just\n\n01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500\nBored of telling it but um\n\n01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.500\nIt's probably somewhere in between\n\n01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.500\nAlright then I'll give like I'll give\n\n01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.500\nA somewhat compact view\n\n01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.500\nVery few people have made content I was just\n\n01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.500\nThis is gonna be boring it's me explaining\n\n01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.500\nLike how why I thought it would be interesting\n\n01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.500\nTo have a blind person up but it was just\n\n01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.500\nIt seems like such kismet I was just\n\n01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.500\nThinking about this yesterday\n\n01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.500\nI was thinking about this coming\n\n01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500\nTo New York going we've met we have a\n\n01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.500\nPodcast it's a new society\n\n01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.500\nI bet we have a lot of blind\n\n01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.500\nListeners I wonder if anybody\n\n01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.500\nOut there like\n\n01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.500\nWe've never brought a blind person up\n\n01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.500\nAt stage I just want to point out that it's\n\n01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:07.500\nLike magical but but\n\n01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.500\nFor me\n\n01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.500\nYou're so blessed you're so blessed\n\n01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.500\nYou're like a magical blind person\n\n01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.500\nWe're all secretly\n\n01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.500\nMagical we just don't tell it\n\n01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.500\nI feel like you could help me golf\n\n01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.500\nBetter\n\n01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.500\nYou're like\n\n01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500\nYou're like the hitch\n\n01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.500\nOf not seeing\n\n01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.500\nYeah\n\n01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500\nMore or less I guess\n\n01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:33.500\nBut I yeah\n\n01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.500\nI mean this is\n\n01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.500\nA dumb digression\n\n01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.500\nI think it's like a pre-internet\n\n01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.500\nLike kind of thing but I remember\n\n01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.500\nBeing fascinated to read\n\n01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.500\nThat\n\n01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.500\nDeafness compared to blindness\n\n01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.500\nEven though it technically\n\n01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500\nQuote-unquote impairs\n\n01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.500\nYou less\n\n01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.500\nBecause obviously as humans\n\n01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.500\nWe rely on our eyes more than we rely\n\n01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.500\nOn our ears but\n\n01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.500\nThat deaf people are\n\n01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500\nBasically for lack of\n\n01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500\nA more diplomatic or longer way\n\n01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500\nOf saying it that they are more\n\n01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.500\nAlienated, isolated\n\n01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.500\nYeah you can like if a deaf person\n\n01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:13.500\nCan get around better but I mean like\n\n01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500\nThere's a whole language people\n\n01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:17.500\nLanguage thing like you know some deaf people\n\n01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.500\nCan speak you know and\n\n01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.500\nRead lips so they can communicate fine\n\n01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.500\nBut like yeah obviously like\n\n01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.500\nSure if you're blind you can't see anything\n\n01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.500\nBut like you can still just ask people\n\n01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.500\nAnd like you're still like perfectly able\n\n01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:31.500\nTo communicate so it's\n\n01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.500\nI kind of wonder how much the internet changed that\n\n01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.500\nBecause the internet changed everybody's lives\n\n01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.500\nIn this audience who can see and hear\n\n01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.500\nBut there's like before the internet\n\n01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.500\nThere was like deaf people\n\n01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.500\nAnd it's like the internet couldn't have\n\n01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500\nPolarized those communities more\n\n01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.500\nBecause if you're\n\n01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:49.500\nIf you're blind\n\n01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500\nBefore the internet\n\n01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:53.500\nYou had the internet of\n\n01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500\nTalking to people\n\n01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.500\nAnd deaf people didn't\n\n01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.500\nThey took our way our one advantage over\n\n01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.500\nDeaf people and then once\n\n01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500\nOnce the internet happened\n\n01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500\nThat was like that was the one thing we had\n\n01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.500\nAbove them and now\n\n01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.500\nAre deaf people like vampires and werewolves\n\n01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.500\nNo\n\n01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500\nIt's like\n\n01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500\nBlind people, deaf people and like people in wheelchairs\n\n01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500\nAnd we're all at war with each other\n\n01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500\nThat's it\n\n01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.500\nSee that movie\n\n01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:23.500\nIt's all a big joke to me\n\n01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.500\nI love it\n\n01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500\nYeah it's yeah\n\n01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500\nWell this is great\n\n01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500\nI'm very proud of myself for this\n\n01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500\nYou know what\n\n01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500\nYou did a good thing\n\n01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500\nYou have definitely improved my life\n\n01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.500\nI hope you'd like to\n\n01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500\nPlay Dungeons & Dragons with us\n\n01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.500\nFuck yeah just cause I love Dungeons & Dragons\n\n01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.500\nSpencer you better not fuck this up\n\n01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.500\nI mean I hope\n\n01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.500\nIs it should I give you the character sheet\n\n01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:51.500\nNo I mean\n\n01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.500\nThat is a really good question\n\n01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.500\nI've just been stewing over here\n\n01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500\nI didn't know what to say\n\n01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.500\nIf I could like\n\n01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.500\nI'm trying to think like\n\n01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.500\nI could play like Quark and I just like know most of his\n\n01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.500\nAttacks anyway\n\n01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.500\nAttacking with his sword\n\n01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.500\nPlus I really want to fuck things so like\n\n01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.500\nI wouldn't\n\n01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.500\nI don't think I would not mention\n\n01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.500\nLike no one else uses\n\n01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:17.500\nTheir character sheet anyway so I don't think I'd be\n\n01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.500\nAt too much of this advantage\n\n01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.500\nI guarantee you that\n\n01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.500\nI have looked at mine as much as\n\n01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.500\nYou would yours\n\n01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.500\nI guarantee it\n\n01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.500\nYeah I'm not\n\n01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.500\nWorrying about it I played D&D over the summer\n\n01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:33.500\nAnd yeah it was a lot of fun\n\n01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.500\nYeah\n\n01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.500\nIf I were Spencer I'd be shitting my pants right now\n\n01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.500\nCause I feel like a blind person playing D&D\n\n01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.500\nIs like\n\n01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.500\nI don't know like a\n\n01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500\nSpanish person taking a salsa class\n\n01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.500\nIn what sense\n\n01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.500\nIt's like I don't know\n\n01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.500\nIt's just in their blood that they're gonna smell bullshit\n\n01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:59.500\nAlright I got Sharpie\n\n01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.500\nI don't get it\n\n01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.500\nSo Gilbert\n\n01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.500\nWe play this game called Dungeons & Dragons\n\n01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:09.500\nAnd I don't know if you've ever played\n\n01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:11.500\nBut basically it's like\n\n01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.500\nPretend that what I'm saying is real\n\n01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500\nAnd pretend you're acting as a character\n\n01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.500\nIn the setting that I'm describing with my mouth\n\n01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.500\nThat doesn't make sense\n\n01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500\nThat makes it all clear\n\n01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:32.500\nI promise it's the clearest way I could do it\n\n01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500\nI hope that's the guy who tweeted that same joke\n\n01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500\nAnd not the guy who read that\n\n01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.500\nSo just think of it as a jumping off point\n\n01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.500\nYou don't actually have to make any sense\n\n01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.500\nOf any of those pages\n\n01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.500\nCan I just say one random\n\n01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.500\nUnrelated thing\n\n01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:57.500\nBut just something I've always wanted to\n\n01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.500\nNo sorry\n\n01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.500\nIt would be amazing to find out\n\n01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500\nWhat the limits of what you're allowed to say\n\n01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.500\nWould be\n\n01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.500\nWhy is Building 7 still standing?\n\n01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500\nOh alright\n\n01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.500\nTake it easy\n\n01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.500\nNo the melting point of steel\n\n01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.500\nOkay take it easy\n\n01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.500\nThanks for coming\n\n01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.500\nWhy were there no Jews\n\n01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.500\nIn the building\n\n01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.500\nJesus Christ Rory\n\n01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500\nThis is just\n\n01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.500\nA joke that I'm pretty sure\n\n01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.500\nIs it a racist joke?\n\n01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.500\nNo I'm sorry\n\n01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.500\nI could probably think of a good one\n\n01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.500\nThat's not the way I asked\n\n01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:43.500\nIt's a very not racist joke\n\n01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.500\nIt's a really lame joke that I'm sure\n\n01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.500\nEveryone has already heard\n\n01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.500\nBut I wanted to tell it to Dan\n\n01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.500\nFor a very specific reason\n\n01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:53.500\nAlright Dan\n\n01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.500\nWhy do seagulls fly over the sea?\n\n01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:57.500\nI don't know\n\n01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.500\nBecause if they flew over the bay\n\n01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.500\nThey'd be called bagels\n\n01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.500\nBagels\n\n01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.500\nGilbert Gottfried is like\n\n01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.500\nWhat the fuck is going on?\n\n01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.500\nBecause he doesn't know how to say bagel\n\n01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:15.500\nI pronounced bagel wrong\n\n01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.500\nYeah you gotta write both\n\n01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.500\nThat's what people keep telling me\n\n01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.500\nIs just a picture of the word bay\n\n01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.500\nGoal\n\n01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.500\nIs that it? Bagel? Bagel\n\n01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.500\nI think you can say it both ways though\n\n01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.500\nIf you actually look stuff up\n\n01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500\nA lot of these words that are contentious\n\n01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.500\nBoth of the pronunciations are just right\n\n01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500\nAnd everyone just argues about it\n\n01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.500\nLike it matters\n\n01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500\nI would like a bagel\n\n01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500\nOkay\n\n01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500\nI've never had somato\n\n01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500\nI would like a bagel\n\n01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.500\nAgain\n\n01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:51.500\nI'm not going to correct that\n\n01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.500\nI think it's all good\n\n01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.500\nI'd like a bagel\n\n01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:59.500\nFrom Ronald Reagan\n\n01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.500\nBecause it's vague\n\n01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.500\nVag\n\n01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.500\nAlright\n\n01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.500\nAlright\n\n01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.500\nI gave\n\n01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:15.500\nGilbert Gottfried\n\n01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.500\nChris de Burgh\n\n01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.500\nI'm sorry\n\n01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500\nIt's just Cine\n\n01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.500\nJust Cine\n\n01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:27.500\nI don't know why that sounds worse\n\n01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.500\nI gave just Cine\n\n01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.500\nDignity Sarsgard\n\n01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.500\nAfter\n\n01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.500\nThinking about it for a long time\n\n01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.500\nAnd so\n\n01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.500\nRory\n\n01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.500\nJust because he's gay you're making him a woman\n\n01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.500\nGod damn it\n\n01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.500\nHe's blind but he sees everything\n\n01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:53.500\nThat's\n\n01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500\nThat's why I ruminated on it\n\n01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.500\nI was like\n\n01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.500\nGod damn it\n\n01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.500\nSo Harmon\n\n01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:05.500\nDo you want to do your acapella thing\n\n01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:09.500\nWe've been without music for a while\n\n01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.500\nAnd coping with it\n\n01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.500\nWe're playing Dungeons & Dragons now Gilbert\n\n01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.500\nLast time on Harmontown\n\n01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.500\nOur heroes\n\n01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.500\nI gotta say this stuff\n\n01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500\nOur heroes\n\n01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:31.500\nHad just defeated Father Tinder\n\n01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:33.500\nDealing with his corpse\n\n01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:35.500\nAs the gang fled they were accosted by a night watchman\n\n01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.500\nWho seemed to be wise to their tricks\n\n01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.500\nBut Dignity Sarsgard\n\n01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.500\nSmoot things over\n\n01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.500\nJust when they thought they were safe\n\n01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:45.500\nThey found themselves surrounded by guards\n\n01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.500\nBut Dignity and her mighty steed provided the gang\n\n01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.500\nWith a much needed egress as they escaped the town\n\n01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500\nHowever\n\n01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.500\nLeaving the safety of the town\n\n01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.500\nWould prove to be a dangerous move\n\n01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.500\nAnd no sooner than our heroes had escaped\n\n01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500\nAdmiral Darkstar took after them\n\n01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:01.500\nWith the fury of hell\n\n01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:03.500\nAfter screaming in elemental summoning\n\n01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.500\nAdmiral Darkstar noticed the shard of power\n\n01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.500\nFloating away from the city\n\n01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:09.500\nAnd abandoned our heroes to give chase\n\n01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.500\nDignity's mount\n\n01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.500\nPissed on a fire elemental\n\n01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.500\nPissing off his leg\n\n01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500\nAnd with that our heroes escaped the flaming foe\n\n01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500\nFinding freedom in a foul fen\n\n01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.500\nPeople love alliteration\n\n01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.500\nThey love it, I love it too\n\n01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:29.500\nApproaching the first door they saw\n\n01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.500\nOur heroes encountered a showering woman\n\n01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.500\nAnd after terrifying slash objectifying her\n\n01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500\nOur heroes played it off\n\n01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500\nLike it was no big thing and asked for her help\n\n01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500\nBut what thing was gonna happen?\n\n01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.500\nHow would the gang whatever\n\n01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.500\nAnd what of the blank\n\n01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:58.500\nFind out next time on Placeholder\n\n01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.500\nSo everybody has questions right?\n\n01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.500\nQuestions?\n\n01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.500\nThis is that point in the D&D where everyone goes\n\n01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.500\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.500\nI usually know what's going on\n\n01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.500\nI'm a bit fuzzy if I'm honest\n\n01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.500\nI'm like 15 episodes behind\n\n01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.500\nSo I have absolutely no idea\n\n01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.500\nAnd we also just released the last episode\n\n01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.500\nThat happened today\n\n01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.500\nSo I didn't even get a chance to listen to it\n\n01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:22.500\nNeedless to say they left the village\n\n01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:24.500\nAnd arrived at a naked woman's house\n\n01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.500\nAnd we were looking through the window at her\n\n01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.500\nAnd then we came in through her door\n\n01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.500\nYou looked at the window\n\n01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.500\nShe saw you doing that\n\n01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:36.500\nFreaked out and then you entered her house\n\n01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:42.500\nTo keep her quiet\n\n01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.500\nYeah\n\n01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.500\nOkay so I'm...\n\n01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.500\nYoung lady\n\n01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.500\nIs she young?\n\n01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.500\nShe can't tell her age\n\n01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:54.500\nShe might be elvish\n\n01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.500\nLady\n\n01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:58.500\nTake it easy\n\n01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.500\nWe just need a place to hide out\n\n01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.500\nSee?\n\n01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.500\nYeah\n\n01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500\nIt doesn't seem like a very convincing statement\n\n01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:10.500\nBut when you put it out there\n\n01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.500\nShe's like I guess that makes sense\n\n01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.500\nI mean it is\n\n01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:16.500\nOne of the only windows in this swamp\n\n01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.500\nSo\n\n01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:20.500\nWe're within the confines\n\n01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.500\nOf rose...\n\n01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.500\nNo you're outside a rose boat\n\n01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.500\nYou ran off into a swamp\n\n01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.500\nDo you have any questions?\n\n01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.500\nI\n\n01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:32.500\nStop paying attention\n\n01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.500\nAn hour\n\n01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.500\nThat's fine too\n\n01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.500\nI guess he has a question\n\n01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.500\nAlright\n\n01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.500\nI am a newbie to this entire scene\n\n01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.500\nWell then we can't help you\n\n01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:48.500\nWhat's your question?\n\n01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.500\nIs this a contiguous game?\n\n01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.500\nYeah but I'd like to think\n\n01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:56.500\nNo one has to know\n\n01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.500\nOr does know\n\n01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.500\nAnything that happens\n\n01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.500\nYeah\n\n01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.500\nIt's a terrible idea\n\n01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.500\nJust pretend some people entered a naked ladies house\n\n01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:08.500\nYou're all set\n\n01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.500\nYeah\n\n01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.500\nIt's the worst idea in the history of entertainment\n\n01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.500\nYeah\n\n01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.500\nAnd now you do\n\n01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.500\nImagine if every week\n\n01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:22.500\nUgly Betty was about something different\n\n01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.500\nBut\n\n01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.500\nShe was a different kind of ugly\n\n01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.500\nIt was always\n\n01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.500\nIt was on CBS\n\n01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.500\nEvery other week\n\n01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.500\nThey kept moving it between\n\n01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.500\nFriday and Wednesday\n\n01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.500\nIt's just a bad idea all around\n\n01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.500\nSomehow\n\n01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.500\nWe keep loving it\n\n01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500\nUgly Betty\n\n01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500\nGilbert\n\n01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.500\nJust say anything\n\n01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.500\nJust riff\n\n01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.500\nNo I've given up\n\n01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:56.500\nJust so we can say\n\n01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:58.500\nThat you played D&D with us\n\n01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:00.500\nI don't know what this whole thing's about\n\n01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.500\nIt's acting but instead of a stage\n\n01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.500\nI say in the stage\n\n01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:06.500\nIt's like\n\n01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.500\nAn improvised radio play\n\n01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.500\nSo where in a\n\n01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:12.500\nNaked girls apartment\n\n01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.500\nYeah\n\n01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.500\nIn a swamp\n\n01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.500\nDidn't land\n\n01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.500\nHey great tits\n\n01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.500\nWe played D&D with Gilbert Godfrey\n\n01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:30.500\nThat's what's important\n\n01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:32.500\nRory is going\n\n01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.500\nI have no idea what your tits look like\n\n01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.500\nLet me feel it\n\n01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.500\nWell Rory plays a character who can see\n\n01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.500\nOh I'm sorry\n\n01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.500\nI could probably\n\n01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.500\nFeel them for inspection\n\n01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.500\nYeah\n\n01:50:48.500 --> 01:50:50.500\nHas Quark fucked her yet?\n\n01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.500\nNo\n\n01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:54.500\nI feel like that's\n\n01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.500\nLess cool when it's actually like a human\n\n01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.500\nIf it's like\n\n01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.500\nSome sort of animal\n\n01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.500\nYou can just be like oh yeah I'm gonna fuck it\n\n01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:04.500\nBut as soon as it's an actual woman\n\n01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.500\nI feel weird being like oh I'm gonna fuck her\n\n01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:08.500\nSo maybe I won't do that\n\n01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.500\nThat makes me feel weird too\n\n01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.500\nAlright ma'am\n\n01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:14.500\nYeah yeah\n\n01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500\nI got tits I know\n\n01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.500\nPlease cover yourself\n\n01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.500\nOh no I did sorry\n\n01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.500\nMy platoon mates and I\n\n01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:24.500\nWe're fleeing\n\n01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.500\nA dark force that threatens\n\n01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.500\nTo overtake the world\n\n01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.500\nAnd we just came in here\n\n01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.500\nI think for maybe food\n\n01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.500\nAre you asking me?\n\n01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.500\nYou know what it occurs to me\n\n01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:42.500\nWe had no reason to come in here\n\n01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:44.500\nI think it was just\n\n01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.500\nThere was a naked woman so\n\n01:51:46.500 --> 01:51:48.500\nWe're all gonna back out\n\n01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.500\nAnd we're all gonna move to the next place\n\n01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.500\nWhere's the next place?\n\n01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.500\nWe're not sure\n\n01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.500\nWe're just gonna keep moving\n\n01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.500\nIn the same direction we were moving\n\n01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.500\nAnd we were sorry for the interruption\n\n01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.500\nAnd\n\n01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:04.500\nLife\n\n01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.500\nIs the thing that happens\n\n01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:08.500\nBetween your plans to do other things\n\n01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:10.500\nAs John Lennon once said\n\n01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:14.500\nAnd we're just gonna leave\n\n01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.500\nAnd we're gonna head to the next place\n\n01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.500\nAnd we're very sorry\n\n01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.500\nAnd you'll notice we didn't objectify you\n\n01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.500\nI mean\n\n01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.500\nI hate to disagree\n\n01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.500\nHe just said nice tits\n\n01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.500\nOh well my friend\n\n01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.500\nI mean he's not wrong\n\n01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.500\nIt's\n\n01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.500\nMiddle\n\n01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.500\nMedieval fantasy world\n\n01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.500\nA lot of people are very\n\n01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.500\nUnattractive and you look great\n\n01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.500\nBut that's not the same as objectifying you\n\n01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.500\nI don't think that\n\n01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.500\nThe way you look\n\n01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:54.500\nIs who you are\n\n01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.500\nI'm making\n\n01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.500\nThe assumption right off the bat\n\n01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.500\nThat you probably are some kind of scientist\n\n01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.500\nBut I don't think it's\n\n01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:06.500\nInaccurate for my friend to say nice tits\n\n01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:08.500\nBut in either case I say we're leaving\n\n01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:10.500\nWe're leaving\n\n01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.500\nWe're leaving\n\n01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:14.500\nSo long\n\n01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.500\nWhat was your name?\n\n01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.500\nCharles\n\n01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.500\nCharles did you say?\n\n01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.500\nIt's a family name\n\n01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.500\nCharles thank you\n\n01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.500\nBye\n\n01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.500\nLet's get out of here\n\n01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.500\nWe leave and then we go to the next\n\n01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.500\nWe just keep going\n\n01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.500\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.500\nWe keep going in the same direction\n\n01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:38.500\nIn the same line we were fleeing the city\n\n01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.500\nAnd then we came across this place\n\n01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.500\nWe keep moving\n\n01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.500\nYou enter a swampy land\n\n01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.500\nIt's become too swampy\n\n01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.500\nTo really walk walk easily\n\n01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500\nWe go back to the naked ladies house\n\n01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.500\nKnock on our door this time\n\n01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.500\nThis time we're not\n\n01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.500\nWe're not coming in\n\n01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.500\nOkay\n\n01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.500\nHoping this can be\n\n01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.500\nA reboot of\n\n01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500\nAn encounter that started off on the wrong foot\n\n01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.500\nWell now I'm all confused\n\n01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.500\nYou just said you were leaving\n\n01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:12.500\nAnd you're already back\n\n01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.500\nWell ma'am\n\n01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.500\nWe're fleeing as I said\n\n01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.500\nAn evil force\n\n01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500\nWe stopped by your place\n\n01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.500\nWe left\n\n01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500\nYou live in a swamp\n\n01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.500\nWe're not sure what to do\n\n01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.500\nWhat exactly were we trying to accomplish?\n\n01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500\nI wouldn't know\n\n01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.500\nThat's a weird thing for you to ask a complete stranger\n\n01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.500\nI was talking to Sharpie\n\n01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:40.500\nMa'am I want you\n\n01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.500\nThe answer to his question too\n\n01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500\nMa'am we're running for our lives\n\n01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.500\nAnd we're cowards\n\n01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.500\nAnd we're just running from\n\n01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.500\nThings that might hurt us\n\n01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.500\nAnd so I ask you\n\n01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.500\nIf you've ever felt weak in a moment in your life\n\n01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.500\nAnd if you could connect\n\n01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.500\nThat moment in your life to this moment in our life\n\n01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:02.500\nWhich would be empathy\n\n01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.500\nAnd like\n\n01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.500\nNo that would be sympathy\n\n01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.500\nEmpathy you wouldn't need a moment in your life\n\n01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.500\nTo connect with someone else\n\n01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.500\nDamn\n\n01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:14.500\nAlright\n\n01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:16.500\nNow it's a worry\n\n01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.500\nBurn\n\n01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.500\nAnd you're a naked woman\n\n01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.500\nWith great tips and a beard\n\n01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:24.500\nBeard?\n\n01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.500\nShe's a beard?\n\n01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.500\nI don't think she's naked anymore is she?\n\n01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.500\nShe's not naked anymore\n\n01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:32.500\nNo no she put on clothes\n\n01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.500\nAlright let's leave\n\n01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.500\nMa'am\n\n01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.500\nHonestly all we want to do is\n\n01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:40.500\nGet our bearings and\n\n01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.500\nFigure out where to go from here\n\n01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:44.500\nYou're surrounded by marsh\n\n01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.500\nI know\n\n01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.500\nAnd we\n\n01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.500\nWe just need a place to\n\n01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:52.500\nSit at a table and look over some maps\n\n01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.500\nDid you not need this five minutes ago\n\n01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.500\nWhen you were inside my house?\n\n01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.500\nMa'am I'm not going to try to convince you\n\n01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:02.500\nThat we're an organized adventuring party\n\n01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.500\nWe're not\n\n01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.500\nWe never advertised that\n\n01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:08.500\nWe never said hey it's us\n\n01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.500\nWe know what we're doing\n\n01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.500\nWe are a group of people\n\n01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.500\nWho are running from things\n\n01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.500\nWe don't want to engage them\n\n01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:18.500\nWe came across you\n\n01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.500\nWe acted impulsively\n\n01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:22.500\nMistakenly we fucked up\n\n01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.500\nWe tried to correct that\n\n01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:26.500\nWe wandered in the wilderness\n\n01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.500\nYou live in a swamp we're back\n\n01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:30.500\nWe're asking now\n\n01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.500\nMa'am\n\n01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.500\nIf we could just sit at your table\n\n01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.500\nAnd just look at some maps\n\n01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:38.500\nI don't know if you have atlases\n\n01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.500\nJust figure out where we are\n\n01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:42.500\nGet our bearings\n\n01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.500\nTruth is ma'am\n\n01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.500\nA lot of times we're very drunk\n\n01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.500\nWe don't know\n\n01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:50.500\nWe don't know what we're doing\n\n01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:52.500\nAnd we're very embarrassed\n\n01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.500\nAnd it's not\n\n01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.500\nWe don't expect acknowledgement of that\n\n01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.500\nTo be a pass\n\n01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:00.500\nBut we're out in your porch\n\n01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.500\nAnd we can make a day of it out here\n\n01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.500\nOr we could come in and\n\n01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.500\nI could share some holy text with you\n\n01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.500\nRead some holy text with you\n\n01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:12.500\nI didn't hear that I'm sorry\n\n01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.500\nI could share some holy text with you\n\n01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:16.500\nI love reading\n\n01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:18.500\nShe's got some holy text\n\n01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.500\nI really enjoy reading\n\n01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.500\nIt's really about just\n\n01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.500\nPeeling back layers\n\n01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:26.500\nWait what?\n\n01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:28.500\nIt's about peeling back layers\n\n01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:30.500\nReading?\n\n01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:32.500\nI feel like we should figure out some way to get through this swamp\n\n01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:34.500\nI don't know if the plot's going to advance\n\n01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.500\nHere\n\n01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.500\nYeah, I mean\n\n01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:40.500\nI don't want to kill some shit so\n\n01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.500\nAlright, okay ma'am\n\n01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:44.500\nYou know what, sorry to bother you\n\n01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.500\nWe're going to head into the swamp\n\n01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.500\nWe're going to head into the swamp\n\n01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.500\nApparently we can't walk in it\n\n01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500\nSo we have to figure out some way of\n\n01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:58.500\nGetting somewhere else and not just be trapped in this house\n\n01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:00.500\nI agree\n\n01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.500\nOkay ma'am\n\n01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.500\nGoodbye\n\n01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.500\nAre you sure you're done?\n\n01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:08.500\nIt's just\n\n01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.500\nEven in jest\n\n01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.500\nIf you could give us a direction\n\n01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:16.500\nJust any direction?\n\n01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.500\nJust pick one\n\n01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:20.500\nWhen you leave\n\n01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:22.500\nWhere do you go?\n\n01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.500\nWell, I take the main road\n\n01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.500\nBack towards town\n\n01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.500\nThe way we came from?\n\n01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.500\nIt's the main road\n\n01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.500\nWhen you want to get away from there\n\n01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.500\nCan you take the main road\n\n01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.500\nLike away from town?\n\n01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.500\nYeah, it splits up, you go past the town\n\n01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.500\nYou could go left near the town\n\n01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.500\nIt's all sorts of directions\n\n01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.500\nBut all back toward the town\n\n01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.500\nWell initially\n\n01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:48.500\nSure, but then the roads\n\n01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.500\nThey go in other directions\n\n01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.500\nThat's a ways\n\n01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.500\nWe'll head back to our town\n\n01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.500\nWait, what?\n\n01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.500\nWe need to leave to Vincent Price's house\n\n01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:00.500\nI don't know who that is\n\n01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:04.500\nOr John Lennon\n\n01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.500\nAlright\n\n01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.500\nOkay, well bye ma'am\n\n01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.500\nBye\n\n01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.500\nHave a nice life\n\n01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:14.500\nI was\n\n01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:16.500\nSorry for the interruption\n\n01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.500\nThank you\n\n01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.500\nWe head back down the road\n\n01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.500\nBack toward town, I guess\n\n01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.500\nBut back towards and then past town\n\n01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.500\nTo areas unknown\n\n01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.500\nHopefully, yeah\n\n01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:30.500\nSo you head\n\n01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:32.500\nTowards town and you see\n\n01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.500\nYou see barring your path\n\n01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.500\nHopping along on one fiery foot\n\n01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.500\nA fire elemental\n\n01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:40.500\nMissing a leg\n\n01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:42.500\nYou recall him from your past travels\n\n01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:44.500\nIn which you made your horse pee on him\n\n01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.500\nAlright\n\n01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:48.500\nIs this someone like we were fighting before?\n\n01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.500\nSo we should kill them\n\n01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.500\nI didn't hear that\n\n01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.500\nSo I should piss on the other leg\n\n01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:56.500\nGilbert, attack\n\n01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.500\nThis would be a good time for you to attack\n\n02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.500\nOkay, I'm attacking now\n\n02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:10.500\nI'm rushing forward\n\n02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:12.500\nWith a violent attack\n\n02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.500\nSo while you're rushing forward\n\n02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:16.500\nWith this violent attack\n\n02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:18.500\nAre you wielding a dagger or a poison dagger?\n\n02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.500\nBoth\n\n02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:24.500\nI have a regular dagger\n\n02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:26.500\nIn my left hand and the poison dagger\n\n02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:28.500\nIn my right\n\n02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.500\nNow you're getting that\n\n02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.500\nWielding both of these daggers\n\n02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.500\nYou plunge them deep in the beast's fiery hide\n\n02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:38.500\nAlright\n\n02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:42.500\nDeal some amount of damage\n\n02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:44.500\n14 damage\n\n02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:52.500\nWow\n\n02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:54.500\nGilbert Gottfried is great at dodging the dragons\n\n02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:00.500\nYou feel the heat raiding off of the elemental's\n\n02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.500\nFiery body but you pull away\n\n02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:04.500\nBefore it can burn you\n\n02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.500\nThat's just a, yeah\n\n02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:08.500\nOkay\n\n02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:10.500\nSomeone else do something\n\n02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.500\nCan I fuck him?\n\n02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.500\nI'm not asking, I'm just saying\n\n02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.500\nI'm gonna sneak up behind him and try to fuck him\n\n02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:22.500\nAnd then if that doesn't count as my entire turn\n\n02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:24.500\nI want to attack him\n\n02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.500\nI want to go into a barbarian rage\n\n02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.500\nFuck him and then attack him with my flaming sword\n\n02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:30.500\nFlaming sword attack\n\n02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:34.500\nI can't wait for Jeff to come back to the pack\n\n02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:36.500\nSo I can tell him this is his effect on blind youth\n\n02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:42.500\nFlying into a barbarian rage\n\n02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.500\nYou sense all feelings and emotions\n\n02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:46.500\nAnd not those logic and stuff\n\n02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:48.500\nThe other one\n\n02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:50.500\nLeaving being replaced with rage\n\n02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:52.500\nAnd passion\n\n02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:54.500\nAs you undo your pants\n\n02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.500\nAnd enter the fiery fiend\n\n02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.500\nYou realize\n\n02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.500\nThat's what you realize\n\n02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:02.500\nIt's worth it\n\n02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:04.500\nWell worth it\n\n02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.500\nYour dick takes 12 damage\n\n02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.500\nFeeling\n\n02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.500\nThat's probably all for the best\n\n02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.500\nYeah, that's a good point\n\n02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:24.500\nFeeling your dick melt off\n\n02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:30.500\nWe only have one dick left in this party\n\n02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.500\nI'm sorry Jeff Davis\n\n02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.500\nWherever you are\n\n02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:36.500\nI melted your dick\n\n02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:38.500\nIt's a really trenchant metaphor\n\n02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:40.500\nFor what happened to our country during Vietnam\n\n02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:46.500\nReeling back from this incident\n\n02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:48.500\nYou lunge into attack\n\n02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.500\nFor hurting your member\n\n02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:52.500\nAnd maybe it's just the fact\n\n02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:54.500\nYour entire dick was melted off\n\n02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.500\nBut it goes wide\n\n02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.500\nAnd your sword falls\n\n02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:00.500\nBlade first into the soil\n\n02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:02.500\nMissing it completely\n\n02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.500\nGoddamn it\n\n02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:06.500\nI'm sorry\n\n02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.500\nWell\n\n02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.500\nDetecting evil\n\n02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.500\nI feel like\n\n02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.500\nWe've misjudged this fiery demon\n\n02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:18.500\nYeah, okay\n\n02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:20.500\nDetecting\n\n02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.500\nDetecting evil\n\n02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:24.500\nYou do notice it's not an evil spirit\n\n02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:26.500\nIt seems neutral if anything\n\n02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.500\nHe melted my dick off\n\n02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.500\nSo I say we kill him\n\n02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.500\nWell sew it an ordinary campfire\n\n02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.500\nThis is such a classic conflict\n\n02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:46.500\nBetween a blind guy and a gay black guy\n\n02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.500\nI mean, I'm pretty sure we're on the same team\n\n02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:52.500\nI don't think we're quarreling\n\n02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:56.500\nNot yet, uh...\n\n02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.500\nI'll lay mercy on my team member's\n\n02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.500\nBurning member\n\n02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.500\nOh yeah\n\n02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:04.500\nLaying hands\n\n02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:06.500\nOn this...\n\n02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:10.500\nThis is a classy move\n\n02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.500\nOn this shiny, uh,\n\n02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:14.500\nKendall-like crotchal region\n\n02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:16.500\nYou instantly feel\n\n02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:18.500\nYour pain going away\n\n02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:20.500\nBut you don't instantly feel\n\n02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.500\nYour dick come back\n\n02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:24.500\nThat doesn't happen\n\n02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.500\nYou're going to need some serious magic\n\n02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.500\nTo pull that off\n\n02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.500\nThat's dicks for you\n\n02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:34.500\nYou can't live with them\n\n02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:38.500\nI feel like you can definitely live with them\n\n02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.500\nIt's my turn\n\n02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.500\nRaise the dead\n\n02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:44.500\nI don't think wizards can raise the dead at 7th level\n\n02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:46.500\nAlso, why raise the
