rather be out here just\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:37.600\ncommenting on everything you're saying yeah I have one thing to share that I\n\n03:37.600 --> 03:42.200\nwanted to make sure I remembered first of all I want to cut I mean you guys I\n\n03:42.200 --> 03:44.920\ndon't know if you've heard this yet and I may be spilling the beans a little bit\n\n03:44.920 --> 03:50.960\nbut chair noble got a second season I'm really excited very popular very popular\n\n03:50.960 --> 03:57.440\nshow I mean they just had they don't know what they're gonna do yet but there\n\n03:57.440 --> 04:01.480\nwas kind of a will they won't they between the fictional woman that they\n\n04:01.480 --> 04:05.200\ngave all of the yeah they're they're like by the way she didn't exist and we\n\n04:05.200 --> 04:08.080\ntwo birds because we didn't have a lot of female characters that weren't just\n\n04:08.080 --> 04:12.160\ngiving birth to deformities and so we just and arguing with each other about\n\n04:12.160 --> 04:15.400\nbut I want to touch my boyfriend you can't touch your boyfriend he's already\n\n04:15.400 --> 04:24.920\nactive but it's set in a Nantucket Airport it's kind of like wings I mean\n\n04:24.920 --> 04:28.400\nit is they're at Chernobyl and they all are that it is truly I mean I thought\n\n04:28.400 --> 04:32.000\nthis was an uplifting thing about the human like like psyche because truly\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:37.560\ndid I did definitely by the fourth episode I was I did say I'm more than\n\n04:37.560 --> 04:41.520\none occasion through the different combinations of the three characters who\n\n04:41.520 --> 04:46.360\nare the only people that are not dying rapidly I was like you guys gonna fuck\n\n04:46.360 --> 04:50.520\nor what but I thought that was like uplifting because it's like none of\n\n04:50.520 --> 04:57.640\nthose people are page three material pinups like and I thought I was like oh\n\n04:57.640 --> 05:02.760\nwe're not shallow we look we love love that's why we ship we're not like we're\n\n05:02.760 --> 05:05.680\nnot like hey you should fuck cuz you look good together you know it's like\n\n05:05.680 --> 05:10.400\njust somebody fuck

one today just because I was I was I missed it and I went back and\n\n05:22.880 --> 05:25.720\nstarted watching it but there's a love affair with the director I don't know\n\n05:25.720 --> 05:31.400\nif it was the same director all the way through I watched the half of the first\n\n05:31.400 --> 05:36.520\none but I fell asleep because I was drunk that's the way to do it yeah I\n\n05:36.520 --> 05:40.680\nguess I guess the second season they just like they had to do a little\n\n05:40.680 --> 05:43.800\nfudging but like the couple people going to remission well they've already\n\n05:43.800 --> 05:48.160\nannounced that Richard kind is on in season two Richard kind yes Richard\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:55.240\nkind and we need we need you back the cold open of season two is the cat\n\n05:55.240 --> 06:01.760\nnibbles the rope and the guy falls and he's like wake up you son of a\n\n06:01.760 --> 06:06.560\nbitch I'm one of the two characters that talks like this the good one not the one\n\n06:06.560 --> 06:10.480\nthat looks like he should be in Pink Floyd on the kind that looks kind of\n\n06:10.480 --> 06:15.480\nlike Bill Murray that's like the good cop the bad cop guy with you with them\n\n06:15.480 --> 06:20.200\nthe guy like that guy the guy with the inch worm on his hand wake up Valerie\n\n06:20.200 --> 06:24.320\nValerie I like that Chernobyl was great I can see what all the hubbub was about\n\n06:24.320 --> 06:29.600\nI was quite a compelling I thought I was very without there's no spoilers in\n\n06:29.600 --> 06:38.880\nsaying this is it struck structurally can't spoil the end of Chernobyl I just\n\n06:38.880 --> 06:42.080\nthought it was I was it's like well how would you how would you tell that\n\n06:42.080 --> 06:45.400\nnarrative where would you start would you do a ton of like flashing back or a\n\n06:45.400 --> 06:48.280\nlittle bit are you gonna start in the courtroom and all that stuff I think\n\n06:48.280 --> 06:54.240\nthey really threaded that needle like in a fun way I was like they start just\n\n06:54.240 --> 07:00.960\nsecond there's one thing I take away from Chernobyl it's the fun yeah they\n\n07:00.960 --> 07:04.040\nstart with a little prologue and then I won't spoil that but like and then it's\n\n07:04.040 --> 07:09.920\nlike but then it's mostly like they just dig into everything happening second by\n\n07:09.920 --> 07:15.200\nsecond right after the explosion which you just miss in the in the in and then\n\n07:15.200 --> 07:19.360\neventually you're gonna go back to all the moments leading up to before the\n\n07:19.360 --> 07:23.760\nexplosion and it's that's bookending like all of the and you don't really find\n\n07:23.760 --> 07:29.640\nout what exactly happened at the very end like they finally explain what the\n\n07:29.640 --> 07:36.760\ndisaster was yeah it was a Soviet communism yeah wasn't that the disaster\n\n07:36.760 --> 07:41.880\nyeah it was like the USSR was the disaster right yeah I mean you would\n\n07:41.880 --> 07:45.520\nexpect yeah it's like I guess that's the one thing communism got wrong is that\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:49.080\nthey were like they tried to save so much money I mean that's that should be\n\n07:49.080 --> 07:52.920\ncapitalism's job they were so cheap they're just like well just put graphite\n\n07:52.920 --> 07:56.160\non the tips that'll be great it'll give you a little boost when you pop those\n\n07:56.160 --> 08:03.520\nfucking rods in a little more bang for your nuclear buck should we put should\n\n08:03.520 --> 08:08.000\nwe put some walls around in case in case of what in case we want to spend more\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:12.880\nmoney get your ass back in the fucking Kremlin I fucking turn your ass into the\n\n08:12.880 --> 08:16.080\nguy with the cane were you were you strong bad just there well that's\n\n08:16.080 --> 08:19.920\neverybody in that in that thing is like everybody's like smoking cigarettes I\n\n08:19.920 --> 08:22.800\nlove that the thing blows up and then everyone's like smoking if you got them\n\n08:22.800 --> 08:25.960\nlike yeah but that's what I was gonna say the director he has a love affair\n\n08:25.960 --> 08:30.240\nwith long lingering shots of a cigarette in an ashtray and there'll be a similar\n\n08:30.240 --> 08:33.240\nto put a cigarette in an ashtray and then he just slowly I think those there\n\n08:33.240 --> 08:36.800\nwas their way of saying to you like I know I'm making a five episode mini\n\n08:36.800 --> 08:42.600\nseries about a thousand people dying of cancer in front of you but hey so like\n\n08:42.600 --> 08:46.720\nyou watch you watch diehard they're all smoking in that they're basically the\n\n08:46.720 --> 08:53.400\nsame thing just giving yourself cancer in different ways come on and also a\n\n08:53.400 --> 08:57.040\nbuilding blows up it's like it's kind of the same yeah think about it\n\n08:57.040 --> 09:02.520\nChernobyl or did I heard rip off Chernobyl yeah sit the Soviet Union is a\n\n09:02.520 --> 09:07.320\nlot like Century City you think about right the coolest shot in Chernobyl I\n\n09:07.320 --> 09:11.360\nthought was the shot of looking down at the pre-exploded reactor car and then\n\n09:11.360 --> 09:17.800\nthe there's like the matrix of control rods it was like I like when when\n\n09:17.800 --> 09:23.920\nAlan Rickman said to shoot the glass yeah yeah cuz he was barefoot yeah\n\n09:23.920 --> 09:32.160\nlisten I'm not we have to do one more season oh we're going back to Chernobyl\n\n09:32.160 --> 09:39.760\nwe're going back so they I watched your documentary where they built the big\n\n09:39.760 --> 09:43.280\nhousing that they put over it it's gonna last 100 years they think and they\n\n09:43.280 --> 09:47.000\nbuilt a big house over the top of the thing to contain it and they have\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:51.400\nrobots dismantling all the shit over the next thousand years by like remote\n\n09:51.400 --> 09:56.680\ncontrol but then they got one dude going down there holding up fireman pants\n\n09:56.680 --> 10:00.160\njust so the epilogue can have a shot of them by the way you can't touch these\n\n10:00.160 --> 10:04.400\nfuckers yeah but you know I'm down you can wear a suit you can be in there for a\n\n10:04.400 --> 10:08.520\nlittle while but you got to get the fuck out like the work exposure there is like\n\n10:08.520 --> 10:13.240\nyou get like six minutes or something aren't there like a vacations like\n\n10:13.240 --> 10:17.320\nChernobyl vacations now you can go to Chernobyl and see like the fucking\n\n10:17.320 --> 10:23.400\nmerry-go-round I bet I bet they are competitive rates yeah it's not\n\n10:23.400 --> 10:26.080\nexpensive\n\n10:26.360 --> 10:33.080\nyeah pick up those goddamn fireman pants that you say are still too radioactive\n\n10:33.080 --> 10:35.880\nto touch and put them somewhere else but it's like oh where are you gonna put\n\n10:35.880 --> 10:39.000\nthem keep them in Chernobyl like I guess it makes sense it's kind of counter\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nintuitive at first but it's like when the dog would shit and my dad would be\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.320\nlike well let it dry and we'll sweep it up\n\n10:46.320 --> 10:52.000\nwait what you know what are we gonna do grab grab the moist dog shit smear it

for several seasons and then strangely they just end it's the\n\n19:24.080 --> 19:29.680\nbest yeah we end after we end when we want to end that's yeah it's the kiss\n\n19:29.680 --> 19:33.640\nof death you're the kiss of death you're the cream Reaper yeah success I know\n\n19:33.640 --> 19:38.360\nyeah yeah you know any expression wheelhouse comes from like it's in your\n\n19:38.360 --> 19:44.880\nwheelhouse no go ahead it's like a weird thing like it's a it's a two-step\n\n19:44.880 --> 19:53.160\nidiomatic process it starts with wheel houses like as a in paddle boats or\n\n19:53.160 --> 19:56.560\npaddle wheels like I don't know if it's like stationary for power or whatever\n\n19:56.560 --> 20:02.760\nthey paddle waterwheel technology where it's like if it's if you're if something's\n\n20:02.760 --> 20:09.040\nin the wheelhouse it's gonna get the full force of the wheels like impact but\n\n20:09.040 --> 20:13.320\nthen that isn't necessarily like man that's your expertise like it doesn't\n\n20:13.320 --> 20:18.920\ntranslate to that but then baseball used that phrase so like mean that that's in\n\n20:18.920 --> 20:22.960\nyour wheelhouse it's basically your strike zone yeah like it's like you can\n\n20:22.960 --> 20:26.240\nfucking knock that out of the park that's in your wheelhouse like they're\n\n20:26.240 --> 20:32.560\nthere it'll idiomatically but then we idiomatically are borrowing from baseball\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:36.640\nbut and the whole time we're going wheelhouse I don't know I'm all looking\n\n20:36.640 --> 20:41.480\nup one day I always thought you know what I would have guessed my guess was\n\n20:41.480 --> 20:46.800\nalways just like oh a wheelhouse is just like a old-timey garage like they\n\n20:46.800 --> 20:49.960\ndidn't call them garages like they probably called a wheelhouse you thought\n\n20:49.960 --> 20:53.480\nit was a wheel like that's where you park your wheels where you're before\n\n20:53.480 --> 20:57.600\nthere were even wagons there were just it was like well what are you gonna call\n\n20:57.600 --> 21:02.080\nit you're not gonna call it a carport it's a wheelhouse like probably where\n\n21:02.080 --> 21:06.160\npeople always did more of their work you know like before that they called it\n\n21:06.160 --> 21:11.640\nthat that was in your hoof hut right that's absolutely true yeah that's in\n\n21:11.640 --> 21:17.320\nyour that's in your cows utter that's in your that's in your that's in the that's\n\n21:17.320 --> 21:22.240\nin the corner of your cave that you don't shit in yeah that was a clunky\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:27.560\nso they had to like but the word for that was just hug it was like they just\n\n21:27.560 --> 21:33.920\nhad less words meant more like caveman had like six words I love baseball\n\n21:33.920 --> 21:39.880\nmetaphors I'm not even that huge a fan of baseball but I'm a huge fan of baseball\n\n21:39.880 --> 21:47.920\nmetaphors like strike zone like here's my favorite one well you were the first\n\n21:47.920 --> 21:53.240\ncouple years of Harmontown you were swinging three bats but now you're up\n\n21:53.240 --> 21:57.560\nto the plate swinging one bat no okay what does that mean I don't know that's\n\n21:57.560 --> 22:01.680\nmy favorite one it means that it's you're just hitting fucking home runs now\n\n22:01.680 --> 22:07.240\nbecause you're done you're like you've you've not no longer okay so getting\n\n22:07.240 --> 22:11.280\nhome runs you're no longer swinging those three heavy bats right you're\n\n22:11.280 --> 22:16.800\nswinging one light it feels so much a lighter follow me you're swinging so\n\n22:16.800 --> 22:23.400\nDan you used to have three big old wooden bats and you're swinging them why\n\n22:23.400 --> 22:27.840\nwould I do that to just to make my arm just figuring out the show I eat the\n\n22:27.840 --> 22:40.680\nbats in your hand I've always said like I got this okay no go ahead Jeff go ahead\n\n22:40.680 --> 22:43.880\nyou know you say like swinging two bats in the on-deck circle yeah yeah right\n\n22:43.880 --> 22:51.440\ndid I not say that I mean like over here shit well I the human hand can't\n\n22:51.440 --> 22:57.440\nhold three bats I hold three bats man yeah I got huge hands does that mean\n\n22:57.440 --> 23:01.480\nlike over-preparing swinging multiple bats like it's it's it's just preparing\n\n23:01.480 --> 23:06.240\nthe on-deck circle is like you're swinging a heavier thing and you get\n\n23:06.240 --> 23:11.200\ninto the into the batter box this is a super clear metaphor but oh I've been\n\n23:11.200 --> 23:15.360\nusing the clunkiest metaphor ever now yeah well because what is it I need to\n\n23:15.360 --> 23:20.040\nunderstand the implication of swinging more bats I think maybe because I use it\n\n23:20.040 --> 23:25.120\nin in regards to your show which is how it's been great it do I think do baseball\n\n23:25.120 --> 23:30.960\npeople swing more than one bat because they want their arms to be more accustomed\n\n23:30.960 --> 23:34.280\nto have your weight so that when they yeah they're like this is nothing well\n\n23:34.280 --> 23:39.240\nwhen you get up okay you're childish your bat your bat speed is faster when\n\n23:39.240 --> 23:41.360\nyou get to the plate because you've been swinging a heavy because I think right now\n\n23:41.360 --> 23:45.240\nthese days what they do is that you put your arms tired they put a weight at the\n\n23:45.240 --> 23:49.360\nend of their backs don't hold they put a donut on it they put a donut on it\n\n23:49.360 --> 23:53.680\nexactly but it's like it's like putting weights on your ankles before your\n\n23:53.680 --> 23:59.040\nbasketball inning starts that's right that's exactly right you used to wear\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:03.560\nheavy shorts before you play a basketball inning if you look in warm-ups\n\n24:03.560 --> 24:08.320\nand warm-ups they all wear heavier shorts yeah but I use that metaphor a lot\n\n24:08.320 --> 24:11.800\neven though like wait you wait like oh I was playing with weights on my ankles\n\n24:11.800 --> 24:15.520\nright and then if you take them off that's the same thing right that's the\n\n24:15.520 --> 24:20.920\nsame metaphor you use that one I've used in the past because I've often felt like\n\n24:20.920 --> 24:27.280\nI was over qualified for a job at hand and was gonna go in and just dominate so\n\n24:27.280 --> 24:34.440\nand I run out of ways to express that and and it's important that I be relatable\n\n24:34.440 --> 24:39.560\noh you so regret this metaphor bring it to me\n\n24:39.560 --> 24:45.600\ngive us a more of your favorite baseball metaphor okay that's the end you want to\n\n24:45.600 --> 24:48.760\nhave a host of relatable ways of explaining your domination to people\n\n24:48.760 --> 24:55.160\nlike I got two pickles on my fucking tennis racket and I still fucking you\n\n24:55.160 --> 24:58.800\nknow what I'm saying right you know what I mean no did you see that that girl a\n\n24:58.800 --> 25:03.480\n15 year old beat Venus Williams today and Wimbledon 15 years old two pickles\n\n25:03.480 --> 25:07.680\nand she yeah she was so she was swinging she was swinging four tennis\n\n25:07.680 --> 25:16.400\nrackets before the match see no 15 15 years old she wasn't even born when\n\n25:16.400 --> 25:20.640\nVenus had already had four grand slams do they still make the lady tennis players\n\n25:20.640 --> 25:25.880\nwear the little skirts that's a great question I don't know but Wimbledon you\n\n25:25.880 --> 25:30.200\nhave to wear white to know that you have to wear your Wimbledon whites someone in\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:35.320\nthe audience whispered yes yeah and I'm do they do they make or do they choose I\n\n25:35.320 --> 25:43.640\nmean I'm sure there's no way when you go into Wimbledon like you go into like\n\n25:43.640 --> 25:47.360\nthe Westworld antechamber where they're like pick your tennis outfit and then\n\n25:47.360 --> 25:53.480\nlike Serena Williams reaches for shorts and they're like uh-huh gender foul like\n\n25:53.480 --> 25:58.280\nyou got to wear a skirt girl there's no way that's happened I think I think the\n\n25:58.280 --> 26:01.640\nskirt's probably a good move that you're running over the shop you and why don't\n\n26:01.640 --> 26:05.720\nthe guys wear the skirts that's exactly exactly there's your gender problem you\n\n26:05.720 --> 26:10.200\njust said a mouthful there pal why don't guys just wear skirts all the time\n\n26:10.200 --> 26:14.760\nthey're so comfortable but I'm saying it seems clear that there's no distinct\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:21.600\nthat it's not related to the to the any advantage on court whether you're\n\n26:21.600 --> 26:25.920\nwearing shorts or skirts otherwise one what both sexes would wear you're just\n\n26:25.920 --> 26:30.880\nsaying like maybe tennis is like I'm just curious I'm always curious about like\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:34.600\nwhen you get little outfits involved in any kind of long-standing thing that's\n\n26:34.600 --> 26:37.640\nlike very esteemed and like the people involved they're very like they\n\n26:37.640 --> 26:40.560\ndiscipline themselves I'm like it's all this stuff and then in these like\n\n26:40.560 --> 26:45.960\nturbulent times I'm like are they ever gonna is it is it is that is that I'm\n\n26:45.960 --> 26:50.360\nalways curious like is somebody like man I didn't come all this way to be the\n\n26:50.360 --> 26:54.920\ncomplain about the skirt lady in in Wimbledon like it's like you probably\n\n26:54.920 --> 26:57.840\nprobably a part of you is like I'm gonna be wearing that skirt and fucking shove\n\n26:57.840 --> 27:01.040\nthis ball down your fucking throat like you're the skirt is part of your\n\n27:01.040 --> 27:04.760\nfantasy of dominating the world which is part of your empowerment it's just\n\n27:04.760 --> 27:10.400\nwell it's fun to think I can't watch a beach volleyball because I'm always like\n\n27:10.400 --> 27:18.000\nyeah yeah what's good I know like the tiniest bikinis on the guys on the\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:23.400\nfellas right it's just on everybody's wearing the tiniest clothes ever yeah\n\n27:23.400 --> 27:30.040\nand and I'm always like looking at their eyes and I can't catch the game I'm so I\n\n27:30.040 --> 27:34.920\njust don't watch it I think that's sort of what you're talking about yeah right and\n\n27:34.920 --> 27:39.560\nI guess I'm always on guard I'm always like I'm always in warm-ups they have\n\n27:39.560 --> 27:46.960\nto wear two bikinis it just makes it better for the game for game time I'm\n\n27:46.960 --> 27:50.400\nalways I'm always like a tornado watch like I'm watching the distant horizon of\n\n27:50.400 --> 27:55.000\nsports outfit problem is to station because I'm like are they one day gonna\n\n27:55.000 --> 28:00.040\nare they gonna come for the figure skaters yeah and is it gonna be all\n\n28:00.040 --> 28:07.760\nabout talent one day first they came for the figure skaters but I yeah I mean I\n\n28:07.760 --> 28:17.160\nthink I enjoy figure skating for the wrong reasons I don't enjoy it I do and\n\n28:17.160 --> 28:21.280\nI am impressed with the prowess and the discipline but it just makes me nervous\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:25.800\nyeah the gymnastics and figure skating is too stressful because when they\n\n28:25.800 --> 28:32.040\nleap and then it's like they're either gonna yeah it seems so impossible what\n\n28:32.040 --> 28:35.000\nthey're doing I can you you're wearing knives on your feet and you're jumping\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:40.080\nin there yeah and you're on a cold hard deadly surface and the fact that they're\n\n28:40.080 --> 28:44.880\nnot the carted off on a gurney after that they should all win a medal if you\n\n28:44.880 --> 28:49.240\nfall on that surface your dead skin's gonna stick to it first of all oh if you\n\n28:49.240 --> 28:52.840\nfall tongue first you're fucking your fuck you're fucking done baby you're\n\n28:52.840 --> 28:56.440\ndone it's yeah you're

sequins if you're gonna die fucking go out with some sass I can't\n\n29:06.120 --> 29:09.160\nwatch the battle the balance beam makes me want to fucking have a heart attack\n\n29:09.160 --> 29:15.160\nyeah I can't watch it's too much man that goes oh balance beam stop it don't do\n\n29:15.160 --> 29:19.640\nit that's not that's never gonna come into play in real life you're never\n\n29:19.640 --> 29:23.920\ngonna have to fuck also the do a fucking backflip on a stick flipping from one\n\n29:23.920 --> 29:27.320\nend of the pads to the other end of the pads yeah and if you step out you're a\n\n29:27.320 --> 29:32.080\nfucking dick fuck that yeah what do you think I can't believe that shit when\n\n29:32.080 --> 29:35.840\nthey when they when they do the flip and then they land in the beam I'm like it's\n\n29:35.840 --> 29:39.560\nimpossible they're superheroes yeah yeah yeah they should all just they should\n\n29:39.560 --> 29:43.880\nall be president after they're for even sure yes they should fight crime they\n\n29:43.880 --> 29:47.240\nshouldn't be doing that shit they should be fighting crime yeah I think their\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:50.440\nbones are all splintered and they're miserable and stuff they're not gonna\n\n29:50.440 --> 29:57.720\nlive long they're like mostly gothic now I mean I saw you know I saw the\n\n29:57.720 --> 30:05.120\ndocumentary about the there's a lot of grown-up former gymnasts and it's like\n\n30:05.120 --> 30:09.360\nyou can't you can see the trauma in the in the face and like I wonder if it's\n\n30:09.360 --> 30:15.160\nit's like it's it's I was surprised I learned one thing from that documentary\n\n30:15.160 --> 30:18.400\nthat I that I was blown away by which is that there was an active like\n\n30:18.400 --> 30:23.600\nthreshold but that prior to a certain year in the Olympics like women's\n\n30:23.600 --> 30:29.040\ngymnastics meant literally women which was like 25-year-old women like jumping\n\n30:29.040 --> 30:34.680\naround doing their best like and the idea of having a child like like do do this\n\n30:34.680 --> 30:38.640\nthing was like the same as like a child doing like you know any of the other\n\n30:38.640 --> 30:44.160\nthings and then and then this this guy like pioneered the art and science of\n\n30:44.160 --> 30:48.000\nlike yeah but when you're 13 you're like blah blah blah and like like just\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:52.600\nstarted winning gold medals like a factory with like by like just children\n\n30:52.600 --> 30:56.120\njust like a children's

33:11.800\nJohnny on the spot stunt work of like doing these live broadcasts that we do\n\n33:11.800 --> 33:17.600\nthat you guys are not hearing any feedback and it's going out live to\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:21.120\npeople that pay a subscription fee and then a couple days later it's like all\n\n33:21.120 --> 33:25.000\nrubber banded and nicely mixed and dumping for free on the on the

we strive to succeed but I mean that's a lot of service for\n\n34:26.120 --> 34:29.880\nI mean this is a labor of love this little cottage industry we've got it's\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:34.120\nnot like we're we're not like exploiting people but at the same time we're\n\n34:34.120 --> 34:38.560\ndefinitely not Google wait do they exploit people yeah yeah all right\n\n34:38.560 --> 34:44.480\nwell

34:55.800\nmake you know and it but if and I'm I want that to be a billion dollars but it\n\n34:55.800 --> 34:59.960\noften isn't and and then there's like you know it's like but you get a little\n\n34:59.960 --> 35:05.760\nsalary on top of it but I like that we we have a little biodome of people\n\n35:05.760 --> 35:10.200\ngetting paid well that's really like it's kind of revolutionary that this is\n\n35:10.200 --> 35:17.320\na place where people can start climbing right at working and then start\n\n35:17.320 --> 35:21.040\nclimbing and and act that they're still getting paid it's

36:17.200\nwhat you are revolutionized news he mentioned me in an interview they said\n\n36:17.200 --> 36:20.320\nso there was in some interview with like somebody that was like a big thing of\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:24.080\nlike John Oliver is the greatest guy in the world maybe let's talk all about him\n\n36:24.080 --> 36:27.880\nbecause he's like he's the greatest he's doing the Lord's work and like and they\n\n36:27.880 --> 36:30.680\nwere like what's somebody you learned something from and he was like Dan\n\n36:30.680 --> 36:34.760\nHarmon he didn't probably didn't say it like in that accent or at that volume he\n\n36:34.760 --> 36:44.000\nprobably said it with a British accent you know it's a hit me guys like him and\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:50.680\nguys like Colbert were always like I'm getting these opportunities right but\n\n36:50.680 --> 36:56.320\nall I want to do is take go take read the news in the morning and send the\n\n36:56.320 --> 37:01.320\nnews into the joke pipe and then at night I want to do jokes about the news\n\n37:01.320 --> 37:06.040\nthat's what you want to do oh no I have no interest right right now no no those\n\n37:06.040 --> 37:10.280\nguys did yeah I mean John Oliver particularly really have to admire his\n\n37:10.280 --> 37:16.480\nlike yes he absolutely I Sam Bee I don't I don't know of Colbert or Samantha\n\n37:16.480 --> 37:21.000\nbut I definitely know because he worked on our show and we had to negotiate with\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:27.960\nhis guy I'm kind of is that he had lots and lots of carrots dangling of like\n\n37:27.960 --> 37:33.600\njust no why don't you just be the fucking guy in this Adam McKay movie or\n\n37:33.600 --> 37:37.680\nwhatever the fuck like you know like like like Colbert and he didn't want to\n\n37:37.680 --> 37:41.640\ndefinitely absolutely want to do the exact thing that he's doing yeah and\n\n37:41.640 --> 37:46.320\nthey both told me they were like I don't this is what I've been working up to and\n\n37:46.320 --> 37:50.880\nI don't want to do it I just discovered by doing the daily show that I want to\n\n37:50.880 --> 37:56.040\njust be making jokes about the news all the time that takes a lot of and I'm\n\n37:56.040 --> 38:01.040\nterrified and I always like you guys are all younger than me and I always like\n\n38:01.040 --> 38:06.320\nlook at you guys as grown-ups because I watched the daily show when I was like\n\n38:06.320 --> 38:13.480\nat the height of my like fear of having to move back to Milwaukee as if as if\n\n38:13.480 --> 38:17.080\nthat's what you do when you fail in Los Angeles like the city you leave\n\n38:17.080 --> 38:21.680\nwelcome we all have to move back to Milwaukee even if we haven't lived there\n\n38:21.680 --> 38:26.120\nbefore that's where we go that's what I was like all these guys are grown up most\n\n38:26.120 --> 38:29.520\npeople in Milwaukee aren't from Milwaukee they're all just failed they were\n\n38:29.520 --> 38:37.480\nHollywood yeah maybe like look at all these grown-ups doing news jokes like\n\n38:37.480 --> 38:44.960\nnews joke capital second tier you guys and then I'm like it always like I\n\n38:44.960 --> 38:49.880\nhate reading John Oliver's age when he read like a thing about him I'm like oh\n\n38:49.880 --> 38:55.840\ngod he was always younger than me I feel like I'm you might be I wasn't you\n\n38:55.840 --> 38:59.360\nweren't looking at me like that that's not I was like the dick joke guy on the\n\n38:59.360 --> 39:04.200\ndaily show I was never like the let's nail the news well I don't really get\n\n39:04.200 --> 39:10.760\nthese motherfuckers I was like well what about poo I'll take your word for it but\n\n39:10.760 --> 39:13.960\nI really don't know how it worked in that show I mean I don't know my\n\n39:13.960 --> 39:18.160\nperception as a viewer was that everyone was like it was like a face value thing\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:21.760\nthat everyone was a kind of like little producer of their own bits well that's\n\n39:21.760 --> 39:25.040\ntrue when you got like a one of your remote gigs and you go out and do a\n\n39:25.040 --> 39:27.800\npiece is that something that you had come up with or is that producers and\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:30.280\nwriters coming up with stuff that's a great thing about the daily show is that\n\n39:30.280 --> 39:35.240\neverybody on the show could pitch those bits could pitch those pieces and John\n\n39:35.240 --> 39:38.840\nwould be the ultimate voice of well this is gonna get done and this is gonna\n\n39:38.840 --> 39:43.040\nget done and this is gonna get done and we would basically write me and a\n\n39:43.040 --> 39:50.480\nproducer would write a what we would set out to get and then we would never get\n\n39:50.480 --> 39:54.200\nthat thing we would get something completely different and we come back\n\n39:54.200 --> 39:58.840\nand edit it and John would come back into the room and and help to craft it\n\n39:58.840 --> 40:01.840\nand it would become something totally different and always something better\n\n40:01.840 --> 40:07.240\nthat's great right but like with me they weren't like I was always the dumbest guy\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:12.920\nin the room right and I learned how to be the dumbest guy in the room and I\n\n40:12.920 --> 40:16.520\nlearned how to be that because Rob Riggle would come in and be like with his\n\n40:16.520 --> 40:21.080\npipe and his magnifying glass Rob Rob replaced me so I never had to be the\n\n40:21.080 --> 40:26.720\nsecond dumbest guy in the room Rob definitely was like hey I'll be the\n\n40:26.720 --> 40:32.400\ndumbest guy now get out of here your numbers up dummy yeah neither of us\n\n40:32.400 --> 40:37.880\ngave a shit about like we didn't understand what we were making jokes\n\n40:37.880 --> 40:43.440\nabout we were just like boo and dicks but but there was a time when I got\n\n40:43.440 --> 40:48.160\nstarted I got addicted to it and I was like at the debates right or I was in\n\n40:48.160 --> 40:53.320\nNew Hampshire and I was watching two c-spans at once because there's two of\n\n40:53.320 --> 40:57.640\nthose shits and I was watching these c-spans c-spans too is where it gets\n\n40:57.640 --> 41:03.800\nkind of dirty oh and John Stewart his credit c-span the security camera of\n\n41:03.800 --> 41:09.760\nnews because it was literally I was watching it and it was sweeping this\n\n41:09.760 --> 41:16.720\nand there's Rob Reiner talking to John McCain and then it would pass and then\n\n41:16.720 --> 41:20.640\nyou'd pass again and there's Rob Reiner talking to John McCain again and there's\n\n41:20.640 --> 41:25.120\nDennis Kucinich and there he goes and and I was obsessed with it and then I\n\n41:25.120 --> 41:30.520\nrealized like what am I doing but this is never gonna be an interesting area\n\n41:30.520 --> 41:36.280\nthis is not my felt by person but this is not who I am but I love level did you\n\n41:36.280 --> 41:40.400\nhave to become a news junkie yourself I just well like I was saying before right\n\n41:40.400 --> 41:45.800\nI realized I was the dumbest guy in the room and that's but that's a good thing\n\n41:45.800 --> 41:52.000\nin that I realized like for the first time in my life I wasn't trying to be\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:57.880\nsmarter than I was so then I realized that I wasn't that dumb as I wasn't as\n\n41:57.880 --> 42:05.000\ndumb as I thought I was but I from does that make any sense like trying to be not\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:10.160\ntrying to be the smartest guy in the room makes you smart right and and I felt\n\n42:10.160 --> 42:14.720\ncomfortable with all these like eggheads these political these walks these\n\n42:14.720 --> 42:21.920\ncomedy like fucking ninjas and and and and then I just felt comfortable and I\n\n42:21.920 --> 42:26.240\nand then I got it I got the whole thing but I then they got me and they still\n\n42:26.240 --> 42:30.760\nrealized that I was the poo and dick guy who are the people that go through and\n\n42:30.760 --> 42:36.440\nwatch everything and co-late like even like on John Oliver on last week\n\n42:36.440 --> 42:42.120\ntonight or whatever there's people that edit like and now this and it's a bunch\n\n42:42.120 --> 42:46.720\nof clips like how does somebody go through all that shit so alright there's\n\n42:46.720 --> 42:49.840\nthis guy on the Daily Show he's still there and he's been there since the\n\n42:49.840 --> 42:54.320\nbeginning is Adam John Oliver didn't get him because you know I know no there's a\n\n42:54.320 --> 42:57.880\nlot John Oliver snatched up a lot of guys Colbert snatched up a lot of guys\n\n42:57.880 --> 43:01.520\nbut there's still this dude I still think he's on the Daily Show and his\n\n43:01.520 --> 43:06.440\nname's Adam Chodokov and he knows everything about everything and he's\n\n43:06.440 --> 43:10.800\nthe one that's like he comes in every morning he's like pull a clip on fucking\n\n43:10.800 --> 43:15.720\nTrump in Korea Oliver characterized him as like superhuman he's superhuman\n\n43:15.720 --> 43:19.320\nand the set of community I was like how how does that happen when you catch a\n\n43:19.320 --> 43:22.960\npolitician and he mentioned Chodokov like yeah he's a genius there's this guy\n\n43:22.960 --> 43:26.760\nliterally genius but and like the key is that the guy is like he's retaining\n\n43:26.760 --> 43:29.760\nenough yeah because you it wouldn't you could have all the equipment all the\n\n43:29.760 --> 43:34.280\nhard drives in the world but it wouldn't matter if you didn't when you heard the\n\n43:34.280 --> 43:38.880\nDemocratic National Convention say something about taxes and you go okay\n\n43:38.880 --> 43:43.920\nthat thing that she just said she said the opposite of that I know she did I\n\n43:43.920 --> 43:47.960\nonly now have to go look for it but to have it in your head yeah well he was\n\n43:47.960 --> 43:53.560\nthe guy in the room that John Stewart was like that guy is as smart as I am you\n\n43:53.560 --> 43:58.480\nknow and he was like Adam am I right about this and I'd be like well here's\n\n43:58.480 --> 44:05.120\nthe thing and he'd launch into this like you know dissection of this economic\n\n44:05.120 --> 44:11.240\npolicy and John would be like got it here's the joke and you know so he was\n\n44:11.240 --> 44:15.240\njust this resource and still is I believe I think he's still there yeah but\n\n44:15.240 --> 44:20.960\nlately there's a recent bid on John Oliver show where they just cut to one\n\n44:20.960 --> 44:26.240\nof the Fox News twats saying the same thing a thousand times but that means\n\n44:26.240 --> 44:30.600\nsomebody had to watch that like every every episode of Fox News with the\n\n44:30.600 --> 44:33.840\nmorning show whatever it was like it just to collate all that all that\n\n44:33.840 --> 44:38.760\ninformation and to make a giant edited piece out of every iteration of that\n\n44:38.760 --> 44:42.520\nstupid thing that they do well there's always somebody on every TV show that\n\n44:42.520 --> 44:47.880\nrecycles the news and makes jokes about it that watches TV for a living right\n\n44:47.880 --> 44:53.120\nright yeah on the Howard Stern show it's a JD you know like he just his job is\n\n44:53.120 --> 44:59.360\nwatching TV and and these guys have this talent of of doing what you said just\n\n44:59.360 --> 45:03.640\njust collecting and collecting finding patterns and and then and no and then\n\n45:03.640 --> 45:09.640\nthere's a system of of who to send it to to make it into jokes that somebody\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:13.440\nthat feels like the funnest job in the world it's the watching part but then I\n\n45:13.440 --> 45:18.680\nknow I would be so stressed out because of the sense of responsibility that you\n\n45:18.680 --> 45:22.440\nlike when you read like a Sherlock Holmes story or like any of these like\n\n45:22.440 --> 45:25.440\ntakeoffs where it's like oh the whole point is that like well everyone else\n\n45:25.440 --> 45:32.200\nwas thinking about more yardies knife I was noticing that the air freshener was\n\n45:32.200 --> 45:36.400\nthis that it's comedy Sherlock Holmes same part of the brain that makes you good\n\n45:36.400 --> 45:41.400\nat chess and Stratigo and all these and crosswords and things that I if they\n\n45:41.400 --> 45:46.160\nfreak me out Stratigo is a fucking great game Stratigo is a good game sorry I\n\n45:46.160 --> 45:50.200\ndidn't mean to cut you off no it's really fun though right I don't all I know\n\n45:50.200 --> 45:55.640\nabout Stratigo is that it's like people that like risk are like yikes oh I like\n\n45:55.640 --> 46:00.680\nthe spy I think is the spy part of it yeah the bomb yeah the bomb oh the bomb\n\n46:00.680 --> 46:06.400\noh my god that game fucking rocks strategy freaks me out like I because I just\n\n46:06.400 --> 46:10.000\nalways feel like I get burnt in Stratigo that's all I know I can't play\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:14.960\ngames I'm not good at games until I know the strategy yeah and then my then I\n\n46:14.960 --> 46:21.840\nfuck with my kids I'm at my I'm at my worst when I'm thinking a move or more\n\n46:21.840 --> 46:25.600\nyeah oh it takes me a while I'm really sure I'm not at my best when I'm not\n\n46:25.600 --> 46:29.120\nthinking ahead but you're like was he giving himself credit for being a\n\n46:29.120 --> 46:34.120\ngenius in the moment because no but I'm just I'm just not the more yeah it\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:37.880\njust it panics me like I always like starts it's like I think that got\n\n46:37.880 --> 46:42.280\nconsciously thinking about what what I'm supposed to be doing like fucks me up\n\n46:42.280 --> 46:47.400\nand I'm panicked until I figure that part of it out and it's usually not that\n\n46:47.400 --> 46:52.080\ncomplicated it's usually like oh I gotta go left when these guys go right I guess\n\n46:52.080 --> 46:55.040\nyou check about the joy of like finding your bit and then you know what to go\n\n46:55.040 --> 46:59.760\nafter and then having like a well of like like I enjoy that sensation of like\n\n46:59.760 --> 47:03.760\nlooking at like fucking around and then you're like wait I know what the bit is\n\n47:03.760 --> 47:07.520\nyeah that's exactly what it is yeah it's like you're describing coming up with\n\n47:07.520 --> 47:11.600\nthe remote pieces to it's like you had to chart a course by some star right to go\n\n47:11.600 --> 47:14.400\nout there and say well here's our angle but what we're really gonna do is an\n\n47:14.400 --> 47:16.960\ninterview and we'll make sure we have one thing in the can and then you come\n\n47:16.960 --> 47:20.920\nback and in the Bay you're gonna wait a minute we've got a new angle how many\n\n47:20.920 --> 47:26.080\ntimes did you guys then like fundamentally change the opener all the time so so\n\n47:26.080 --> 47:32.440\nthat's really so we had a lot of fun zeroing in on that you know that thing\n\n47:32.440 --> 47:36.360\nand then we'd come back like I said and it'd be wrong and then we'd have a lot\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:41.480\nof fun and edit zeroing in on it again and trying to figure it out I think\n\n47:41.480 --> 47:44.080\nthat's what you're talking about yeah yeah yeah hey Dan real quick just to\n\n47:44.080 --> 47:48.480\nclarify I think you mistakenly called Kris Boruff the audio guy he's the\n\n47:48.480 --> 47:53.520\nhe's the video he's talking about audio he's the live video director of\n\n47:53.520 --> 47:59.600\nHarmontown oh I stripped out a channel or two from his yeah you're right he's\n\n47:59.600 --> 48:03.520\nthe live editing I mean he's the director he's the camera mounts and all the\n\n48:03.520 --> 48:06.760\nstuff and he's the he's the editor of the video did they say that and some kind\n\n48:06.760 --> 48:11.560\nof headset yeah that was like two hours ago did you just get like so really hey\n\n48:11.560 --> 48:18.320\nJeff you're the comptroller no he's Zach and Chris pointed that out via text just\n\n48:18.320 --> 48:22.080\nnow yeah he texted me but I didn't say anything I didn't get a text from\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:26.760\nanybody and now he's the now he's good now he's the producer at Game Grumps so\n\n48:26.760 --> 48:30.560\nwe got that all right all right well and man we're promoting Zach to head of\n\n48:30.560 --> 48:36.800\ntexting all right I would say being that that diminished by Harmontown is the\n\n48:36.800 --> 48:42.040\nequivalent of swinging three podcast bats that's a great analogy right that's a\n\n48:42.040 --> 48:45.920\ngreat analogy I mean at least Kris Boruff gets to like his back there packing\n\n48:45.920 --> 48:52.680\nhis bag I left at the right place they don't even know what I did\n\n48:52.680 --> 48:57.960\ngreat time they meant they missed like like a half of what I do I want a big\n\n48:57.960 --> 49:02.360\nhalf it's your eyeballs the biggest half I think we should also give a big shout\n\n49:02.360 --> 49:06.040\nout to Zac McKeever for craft services nobody makes peanut butter sandwich like\n\n49:06.040 --> 49:10.560\nZac McKeever our craft service backstage that's all he does is make\n\n49:10.560 --> 49:16.840\nsandwiches you're Mike you're Mike the that your your feed is just racist quotes\n\n49:16.840 --> 49:20.720\nfrom Hitler now he just swapped it out you just threw the kettle one cap on the\n\n49:20.720 --> 49:25.920\nground I dropped it because I'm drunk Google it\n\n49:25.920 --> 49:36.560\nGoogle alcohol drunk Siri what is alcoholism anybody noticing Siri getting\n\n49:36.560 --> 49:41.760\nmore aggressive or is it just that I'm festooned with i devices as I always\n\n49:41.760 --> 49:45.600\nanswers you when you're not talking I was in the writers room two days ago and I\n\n49:45.600 --> 49:49.200\nwas like stammering through some explanation of like I'm like this it's\n\n49:49.200 --> 49:51.880\nlike it's like that it's like this remember when Pete Holmes did his\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:56.200\nimpression of me like I was like trying to ask him a question and he was like\n\n49:56.200 --> 49:59.080\nwhat are you at and I'm like well what no you know what I'm asking is like well\n\n49:59.080 --> 50:04.360\nI think you might be going but he kind of like like seriously like I if I say\n\n50:04.360 --> 50:07.920\nanything close to Siri in the midst of talking in the writers room like every\n\n50:07.920 --> 50:12.880\nonce in a while like this my watch or my phone will cut me off halfway through and\n\n50:12.880 --> 50:18.560\nit's this like woman in a tin

answer to that Jan back to the what I heard was I think it's like this\n\n50:26.280 --> 50:29.840\nbut logistically it should be that but from a standpoint of internal logic it's\n\n50:29.840 --> 50:33.400\nmore like that but what we should do is break the rules before we define them\n\n50:33.400 --> 50:37.080\nbecause the in truth like maybe defining them well it's not to say this is that\n\n50:37.080 --> 50:45.240\nwhat you meant and all the writers are like she nailed you like we can get\n\n50:45.240 --> 50:50.200\nfired but that bitch got you down I'll do the thing if I'm in

post on next door app because the internet doesn't let\n\n01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.840\nanything happen anymore with like we this is we're not gonna survive it's all\n\n01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.720\ncontent baby we are all connected now there is no escape like and and the the\n\n01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.600\nbad I think outweighs the good of a purely connected society like I we're\n\n01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:55.560\non the next door app so we saw this post injured baby skunk fuck you I saw an\n\n01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:05.800\ninjured baby skunk whilst whilst all right fuck you fuck you well now this\n\n01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.960\nsounds like some Milwaukee shit right now this person's into skunks while\n\n01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:16.240\nwalking on my neighborhood at around 7 p.m. it was dragging its back legs not\n\n01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:25.720\nlimp it was like oh fuck you don't mourn this skunk possibly hit by a car you keep\n\n01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.200\nthinking that it made its way into someone's garden so I hurriedly got on\n\n01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.720\nthe internet in search of a place to help rescue it I called humane society in\n\n01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.640\nGlendale as it is supposed to be open 24-7 to get an answering machine which\n\n01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.640\nsays we do not rescue animals call the Pasadena office well it was closed at\n\n01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.360\n7 p.m. I then called around every animal rescue of friends of animals vets\n\n01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.080\netc to find them all closed it's pathetic that it is so hard to find help for a\n\n01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.760\nsick or injured animal I lived in a small town in another state where there is\n\n01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:03.400\nalways a place to find help with I realize that sometimes an animal is so\n\n01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.720\nbadly injured that it can be the only thing you can do but at least we can\n\n01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.480\ntry to save one person I am really disappointed that in a city as big as\n\n01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.800\nLA it's so hard to find some organization to help I went back with water for the\n\n01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.440\nlittle skunk and could not find it and it was getting dark I am really angry\n\n01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:33.360\nand frustrated right now send send I don't know I understand all of those\n\n01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:40.320\nfeelings I accept for the quick is not when she goes into the biography\n\n01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.280\nversion of I was born in a small town you don't picture this as a dude huh you\n\n01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.800\nsaid she I it's funny how I immediately pictured this as a guy because I but\n\n01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.600\nyou know now that I'm proud of myself for picturing as a guy but but it's\n\n01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.800\nbecause I don't like them and part of that is that I feel terrible because I'm\n\n01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.440\nlike just think they're describing the wake of a fucking horrible war machine\n\n01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:12.880\nthat yeah like I but so I want this person to be a bad person I don't it's\n\n01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.960\nnot it this person doesn't have empathy for the little skunk this person's like\n\n01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.640\nthese fucking neighbors are

I was broke and that might be\n\n01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.480\nthe sheriff coming to evict me like like so like the mailbox and the knock on\n\n01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.200\nthe door is always the enemy yeah even if I've ordered food and I know that\n\n01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.440\nsomeone's gonna come knock on the door I instinctively look for my shoes yeah\n\n01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.160\nbecause there was a time when I literally had to like think about like\n\n01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.640\ngoing out the back like the back exit and so fuck you for knocking on doors\n\n01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.680\nbut if you're gonna knock on my door have chocolate if the little kid\n\n01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.800\ncomes up with a box full of chocolate it's pretty good

I will always buy that I'll buy the whole goddamn box yeah I told\n\n01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.400\nthe story on this podcast about like the first year in my house like the\n\n01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.760\nweirdest encounter that I still think about all the time and I'm like this\n\n01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.480\nguy that looked so much like Kevin James like just picture Kevin James he had a\n\n01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.680\nbaseball hat on and just looked like Kevin James just picture that he rang\n\n01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:14.320\nmy doorbell and like he was like hey um hey I'm so-and-so I'm such a touch and\n\n01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.480\nI thought and he kind of like he ran he rattled off the stuff and I'm just like\n\n01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.680\nyou know I'm in full I'm already I'm just in like stranger on my porch mode like\n\n01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.320\nI don't like and so I'm not absorbing what he's explaining which is that he's\n\n01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.400\nrelated to one of my neighbors and that his mother-in-law's grandma's sister is\n\n01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.560\nthe one that walks the poodles from time to time and like I'm just giving him his\n\n01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.760\nblank look because I'm like what's happening and like it sets the tone for\n\n01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.840\nthe whole conversation that like he sees this blank look and he in it it seems\n\n01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.960\nlike in his mind he's done so much explaining about who he is and I've\n\n01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.960\nI've given him nothing in return that he just he just gets this look on his face\n\n01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.800\nlike never mind so anyways and then he continues with this pitch about like\n\n01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.720\nkids in a soccer league and they're like playing soccer and they're gonna go to\n\n01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.840\nItaly and play soccer and all the kids in the local school and all these

01:17:41.280\nreference to what she talked about in the therapy section which was session\n\n01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.400\nwhich also happened to allude to like explosives or something it was like and\n\n01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.120\nthey held her check up because it was like the memo which as long as I've\n\n01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.360\nlived is always where the joke goes she put a joke but

whatever you want do you have a funny name I do no I don't it's\n\n01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:51.080\nnot funny but I believe the Cordray company that David Cross is the Jew\n\n01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.880\nRun Media so every time he writes himself a check from his corporation he's\n\n01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:02.000\nbeing paid by the Jew Run Media that's really good I really blew it really

talking what do I do with my hands\n\n01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.160\noh and then the past 20 years you don't know what I'm like what do I do with my\n\n01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:30.720\nhands so that they're not in my lap so they're not on my genitals I can't fit\n\n01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:36.440\nthem in my pockets I like sit like this like I'm Jesus or something\n\n01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:42.720\nall right it's a lot of fun I think my hands are on my genitals your eyes are\n\n01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.600\nclearly on my general right let's talk about that see that would have been a\n\n01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.320\ngood comeback yeah but yeah I always save up a lot of good comebacks for what\n\n01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.160\nI'm saying yeah it's you're on the show let's breathe a scalier yeah so you\n\n01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.840\nalways got a good one after the therapy session I would doubt unless you followed\n\n01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.680\nthat up with like by the way I'm overlooking all that stuff because\n\n01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.040\nthere's something about him or whatever that I would definitely no I want to I'm\n\n01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:09.080\njust lazy yeah I haven't seen him lately 85% of therapists suck just like no I\n\n01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.000\nknow my last therapist was like I go well I got nothing to talk about and he was\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.680\nlike we don't have to talk oh I was like oh fuck he just starts washing a car\n\n01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.640\nyeah no he was just staring at me and I was like all right this is what we're\n\n01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.960\ndoing exactly yeah so it's like then my my mind is just I'm like well how long\n\n01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.680\ncan I keep this up and then it becomes about keeping it up and I'm like well\n\n01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.320\nthis is stupid I'd be here for a reason I want to want you to tell me why I'm so\n\n01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.560\nfucked up yeah exactly yeah something or admit you can't give me my money back\n\n01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:51.560\nyeah let's not let's talk you talk what do you think is what do you think is\n\n01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:57.600\nfucked up about you what what yeah oh take your pick Jesus Christ\n\n01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:05.040\ndealer's choice damn it I mean a social awkward I'm just awkward I'm I'm I'm not\n\n01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:11.880\nfucking nightmare but you don't but you you my mind is on fire is it yeah but\n\n01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:18.080\nI'm not thinking about anything good or intelligent it's just like you fuck is\n\n01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.760\nthere oh is there a theme if you could identify it within that flame is like\n\n01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.240\nlike I'll go first and say like it's just like don't kick me out don't kick me\n\n01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.360\nout like that's what I'm thinking like like I'm most preoccupied by like I'm\n\n01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.560\njust like well just like like look look don't kick me out like I just have this\n\n01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:36.880\nlike like don't kick me out of society like don't I feel like that's way deeper\n\n01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.360\nthan what my mind says to me my mind's always like oh you look like an asshole\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.600\nright now you just get a haircut you just said something really stupid and that\n\n01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.320\nperson hates you now that person like like it sounds like you're just going I\n\n01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.760\nmean I think all those things stupid I'm just yeah but then then also you know\n\n01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:58.000\nlike who what nobody's thinking about me right and what if what would be the\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.680\nworst thing that would happen if they thought all yeah exactly the first\n\n01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:04.440\nthing is theoretically that they would like they would like yeah kick you out\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.360\nwhich doesn't happen right like yeah I guess I'm sort of thinking if yeah but\n\n01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:15.200\nit's all kind of like summed up as like like oh how am I driving like like like\n\n01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.080\nlike you're trying to put energy into the interface you're going like hey I hear\n\n01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.120\nyou like like like like you know I don't know it's like like like like I want to\n\n01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.960\nsay the right thing and all this stuff and it's like and then that manifests\n\n01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.920\nitself as like things that might make you like awkward or you say the wrong\n\n01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:34.880\nthing sometime and then I'm always thinking like well so the opposite of\n\n01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.400\nthat spectrum isn't like just like a sociopath that's just like doesn't give\n\n01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.720\na fuck and it's like like yeah I got this man like what's this guy talking\n\n01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.560\nabout I'm gonna listen to everything he says and then I'm gonna like mine him\n\n01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.440\nfor weaknesses kind of jealous of sociopaths I know I totally am like\n\n01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.280\nwell I think everybody is like we're fascinated with them like we wish we\n\n01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.160\ncould take like a little sociopath supplement like a little like like\n\n01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:01.280\nstuff and feel like what that's like for a 10 minutes or just do like a little\n\n01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.640\nbit to get you take the edge off of your wanting to not get arrested so you're\n\n01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.960\njust like I'm a little I'm a little 5% sociopath I'm feeling it like enough to\n\n01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.320\nrelax because nobody wants to talk to somebody that's thinking about how\n\n01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:18.040\nthey're being received yeah it's like we're all a bunch of suction cups trying\n\n01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:36.840\nto suck on each other yeah and that's how that's how humans laugh I hate I\n\n01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:41.240\nhate that the guys like oh I've got like like oh what do I notice that your hair\n\n01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:45.160\nI know that's the thing that pisses me off it's like this isn't working you're\n\n01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.280\nnot working very hard to get these answers the most superficial thing you\n\n01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.360\ncould possibly say he was probably after he said that like oh fuck I fucked\n\n01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:00.120\nout he goes to therapy and he's like I said the worst I did it I got I got this\n\n01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:04.160\nbag of dirt coming to see me he's got a long hair I just want to get a book with\n\n01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:09.400\na beard oh what do we do we want somebody to get haircut we don't say it we try to\n\n01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.080\npoint them in the direction where they'll realize they want to get a haircut\n\n01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:21.160\nthat's right now go in the corner and piss your pants on purpose do it and\n\n01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.160\nthen that guy goes to his therapist it's like like just fucking like it's just a\n\n01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:30.600\nfucking dominatrix on his nipples fucking eat my cum you little sheep and\n\n01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.960\nhe's like I'm sorry and then she goes to a therapist and it's just like a weird\n\n01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:46.480\nlike wicker man we're all being led by a lunatic that's the thing we should be\n\n01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.160\nthinking about when you hear every therapist has a therapist oh shit well\n\n01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.680\nwhat is this there's some shrink on the moon like making us all crazy that there's\n\n01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.640\nthere a lastot therapy it's like god talk about I'd like therapy and then\n\n01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.360\nthey're all just disseminating but Rob you seem like an eye contact you kind of\n\n01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.080\nguy you always look me straight in the face or is it hard for you as a no I'm\n\n01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.840\nokay with that but now that you mention it I'm looking away from you right you\n\n01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.280\nknow I don't like talking about eye contact yeah it's a weird thing to think\n\n01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.080\nabout I don't mind looking at people's eyes that aren't looking at mine but\n\n01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.520\nhere we go a little healthy though right what just really wait wait allow\n\n01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:38.160\nourselves to do this I love you yeah I love you I respect you I love you and I\n\n01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.440\nrespect you I'm in the moment I'm mirroring you yeah I'm for real though\n\n01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.880\nwe're not deflecting with comedy I really like you get a hair cut I decided to\n\n01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.640\ncome on the show like I that you contacted me I like I have a lot of shame\n\n01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.920\nand though I'm talking about myself I like you I'm I like you and I'm not\n\n01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.280\njoke making a joke either I'm actually responding that the reason that I\n\n01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.680\ncontacted you to come on the show is because I love this show and I love you\n\n01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:09.280\nand I I really look up to you and I respect you yeah\n\n01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.520\nlisten do you want to both look at Jeff look both will look at Jeff okay here\n\n01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:21.120\nwe go hey Jeff he doesn't care what an asshole nothing that you're making me\n\n01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:27.240\nfeel like like I'm a psychopath because I'm a big eye contact person I'd love\n\n01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:31.040\nlooking at people's I think society wants you to have eye contact I think\n\n01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.040\nit's like something we've created like we've made that a thing I don't think\n\n01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.320\nlike humans naturally want to make eye contact I think it's something that\n\n01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.600\nculture has like you know I travel around doing shows and stuff and I'd like\n\n01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.960\nto go out and wander and walk and I'm very fascinated by strangers I like\n\n01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:52.040\nlike I like meeting people and if you walk up the road and certain like in\n\n01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.760\nNew York City people make eye contact people like you can be on a subway and\n\n01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:00.400\npeople look at you and you know various kinds of reactions people flirts but then\n\n01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.960\nyou go like like strangely like Seattle nobody makes eye contact there like it's\n\n01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.440\nlike I noticed like towns that there's some cultures were just just zero eye\n\n01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:20.160\ncontact Milwaukee and most people like because that felt good I guess but we\n\n01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.120\nlooked at each other and we and we were honest with each other we're the moment\n\n01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.800\nand then I think like then like worse people than us was kind of like you\n\n01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.240\nshould do that all the time bro eat broccoli and do that and they're like\n\n01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.560\njust like well that's because the if you did it all the time like the most you\n\n01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.000\ncould like you you'd feel like this much oh Jesus and if I every time I saw you\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.680\nyou'd be like oh here comes Rob Corddry again he's gonna look at me right in the\n\n01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.400\neyes and tell me how much he loves me people could handle how much I feel and\n\n01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.280\nI think more importantly I think you and I could but we'd be like I love you I\n\n01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.520\nlove you it's great I like I really respect you on all this stuff and I\n\n01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.320\nthink people I think then people around us would be like look at these two fucking\n\n01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.520\njerks yes like what are they doing I said what kind of latte do you want hey\n\n01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.000\nyou're you're like like why do you guys get a like fucking then we would make\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.480\nfun of us we'd be having that this conversation and then inappropriate we'd\n\n01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:16.300\nbe in like a Starbucks but we should have it at a show in front of a hundred\n\n01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.440\npeople ostensibly you're supposed to just constantly be looking at everybody\n\n01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.440\ninto their goddamn souls I'm like I don't really like we did that tour and\n\n01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.200\nlike I met like a thousand people a night like I'm flattering myself there's\n\n01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.200\nlike 200 people a night but like the people that stand in line a vast majority\n\n01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.760\nof my audience is like like is like gonna stare at something else at the\n\n01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:43.600\nheight of their effusiveness like like when they're really expressing themselves\n\n01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.640\nI look at that as like they're taking that part of their enterprise down so\n\n01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.960\nthat they can divert so they could tell you because it's time to be honest and\n\n01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.440\nwho wants to like look into someone's eyes while you have something really\n\n01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.680\nimportant to say like it's like like like that's so distracting like I don't\n\n01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.360\nmind if you can do it fine but like maybe some people are like like distracted\n\n01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.600\nby eye contact and then they're like they're not able to find their and then\n\n01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.600\nthey're not able to be honest yeah I think in general my experience is that\n\n01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:17.400\nmen are really really uncomfortable looking other men in the face and like\n\n01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.800\nif you like meet somebody and like you say hello nice to meet you and you look\n\n01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.400\nthem in the eye it's pretty rare to meet somebody that really just looks you\n\n01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:30.760\nright in the eye goes hey hey like I'm so-and-so and mostly instantly they\n\n01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.800\nlook at the ground or I'm gonna start doing it I'm gonna start looking at\n\n01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:40.120\neverybody yeah it's like a video game like Dale Carnegie like being so full\n\n01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.280\nwith your I looked at five people and it's like fucking insane like like what\n\n01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.880\nthey I just did it with like five just made I cut yeah I got you got yeah no\n\n01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.560\nhe he came right here can't even handle it who in the crowd right now is the\n\n01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.920\nworst at eye contact is anybody here like this terrible you've been you've\n\n01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.760\nbeen he's been making it I feel like we've had a nice relationship silence\n\n01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.160\nseduction I feel like we've no we've like I like this guy\n\n01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.400\nHarper Harper like Harper like the beer no that's not a lot of eye contact right\n\n01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:20.320\nenough well now we're talking about we fucked it up right right you don't like\n\n01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.120\ntalking about eye contact now it's why do we have to I guess yeah I'm sorry I\n\n01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.120\ntell you about the therapist I had that she was like she she he could tell that\n\n01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.280\nit was like oh she's looking at me as some kind of like sorry I just looked at\n\n01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:42.440\nI just sent lasers in the Harper go ahead Harper almost fainted by the way\n\n01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:48.080\nyeah I was like oh fuck oh this is completely off topic but there is this\n\n01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.040\nguy that DM me saying he could get me a free bird scooter and Matthew McGinnis\n\n01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.440\nif you're listening give me a free bird scooter when I your own dedicated bird\n\n01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.520\nscooter yeah yeah sorry everybody well that when you said this is gonna be off\n\n01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.120\ntopic I have a question about your free bird scooters let's say Matthew comes\n\n01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.080\nthrough on that and you have your bird scooter and you you take it down to the\n\n01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.600\nmarket and you put it outside is someone gonna go and try to get on your\n\n01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.720\nI think so it like locks you out though again I kind of say what you have you\n\n01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.040\nhave tried to interface with a special VIP bird
