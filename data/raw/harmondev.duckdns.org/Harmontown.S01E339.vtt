hiding backstage yeah get the motherfucker out here yeah I had to pee I was hoping

02:54.120 --> 02:59.440
I'd have time to go back I'll hold it yeah it's kind of like I'm always

02:59.440 --> 03:03.480
jealous when I see like Bill Maher clips and that like he always keep he

03:03.480 --> 03:06.920
interviews everybody and then but then he holds people captive for his like

03:06.920 --> 03:09.880
final thoughts bit like they've clearly been instructing like you're not a lot

03:09.880 --> 03:13.760
not allowed to feed back now the camera changes angles and then everybody if you

03:13.760 --> 03:16.920
laugh at Bill Maher they cut to you laughing but that's it that's all you

03:16.920 --> 03:23.080
get like you can't and so that's got you know like maybe for for my I mean why

03:23.080 --> 03:26.080
do we why do we think I have to have an opening and then we bring out the guy

03:26.080 --> 03:29.200
we don't have a format to the show ridiculous we're terrible people for

03:29.200 --> 03:33.000
ever thinking that the show had any form to it I'd rather be out here just

03:33.000 --> 03:37.600
commenting on everything you're saying yeah I have one thing to share that I

03:37.600 --> 03:42.200
wanted to make sure I remembered first of all I want to cut I mean you guys I

03:42.200 --> 03:44.920
don't know if you've heard this yet and I may be spilling the beans a little bit

03:44.920 --> 03:50.960
but chair noble got a second season I'm really excited very popular very popular

03:50.960 --> 03:57.440
show I mean they just had they don't know what they're gonna do yet but there

03:57.440 --> 04:01.480
was kind of a will they won't they between the fictional woman that they

04:01.480 --> 04:05.200
gave all of the yeah they're they're like by the way she didn't exist and we

04:05.200 --> 04:08.080
two birds because we didn't have a lot of female characters that weren't just

04:08.080 --> 04:12.160
giving birth to deformities and so we just and arguing with each other about

04:12.160 --> 04:15.400
but I want to touch my boyfriend you can't touch your boyfriend he's already

04:15.400 --> 04:24.920
active but it's set in a Nantucket Airport it's kind of like wings I mean

04:24.920 --> 04:28.400
it is they're at Chernobyl and they all are that it is truly I mean I thought

04:28.400 --> 04:32.000
this was an uplifting thing about the human like like psyche because truly

04:32.000 --> 04:37.560
did I did definitely by the fourth episode I was I did say I'm more than

04:37.560 --> 04:41.520
one occasion through the different combinations of the three characters who

04:41.520 --> 04:46.360
are the only people that are not dying rapidly I was like you guys gonna fuck

04:46.360 --> 04:50.520
or what but I thought that was like uplifting because it's like none of

04:50.520 --> 04:57.640
those people are page three material pinups like and I thought I was like oh

04:57.640 --> 05:02.760
we're not shallow we look we love love that's why we ship we're not like we're

05:02.760 --> 05:05.680
not like hey you should fuck cuz you look good together you know it's like

05:05.680 --> 05:10.400
just somebody fuck cuz like there's so much vulnerability going on here come

05:10.400 --> 05:17.200
on you love her but kiss him here's I love Chernobyl just I actually rewatched

05:17.200 --> 05:22.880
episode one today just because I was I was I missed it and I went back and

05:22.880 --> 05:25.720
started watching it but there's a love affair with the director I don't know

05:25.720 --> 05:31.400
if it was the same director all the way through I watched the half of the first

05:31.400 --> 05:36.520
one but I fell asleep because I was drunk that's the way to do it yeah I

05:36.520 --> 05:40.680
guess I guess the second season they just like they had to do a little

05:40.680 --> 05:43.800
fudging but like the couple people going to remission well they've already

05:43.800 --> 05:48.160
announced that Richard kind is on in season two Richard kind yes Richard

05:48.160 --> 05:55.240
kind and we need we need you back the cold open of season two is the cat

05:55.240 --> 06:01.760
nibbles the rope and the guy falls and he's like wake up you son of a

06:01.760 --> 06:06.560
bitch I'm one of the two characters that talks like this the good one not the one

06:06.560 --> 06:10.480
that looks like he should be in Pink Floyd on the kind that looks kind of

06:10.480 --> 06:15.480
like Bill Murray that's like the good cop the bad cop guy with you with them

06:15.480 --> 06:20.200
the guy like that guy the guy with the inch worm on his hand wake up Valerie

06:20.200 --> 06:24.320
Valerie I like that Chernobyl was great I can see what all the hubbub was about

06:24.320 --> 06:29.600
I was quite a compelling I thought I was very without there's no spoilers in

06:29.600 --> 06:38.880
saying this is it struck structurally can't spoil the end of Chernobyl I just

06:38.880 --> 06:42.080
thought it was I was it's like well how would you how would you tell that

06:42.080 --> 06:45.400
narrative where would you start would you do a ton of like flashing back or a

06:45.400 --> 06:48.280
little bit are you gonna start in the courtroom and all that stuff I think

06:48.280 --> 06:54.240
they really threaded that needle like in a fun way I was like they start just

06:54.240 --> 07:00.960
second there's one thing I take away from Chernobyl it's the fun yeah they

07:00.960 --> 07:04.040
start with a little prologue and then I won't spoil that but like and then it's

07:04.040 --> 07:09.920
like but then it's mostly like they just dig into everything happening second by

07:09.920 --> 07:15.200
second right after the explosion which you just miss in the in the in and then

07:15.200 --> 07:19.360
eventually you're gonna go back to all the moments leading up to before the

07:19.360 --> 07:23.760
explosion and it's that's bookending like all of the and you don't really find

07:23.760 --> 07:29.640
out what exactly happened at the very end like they finally explain what the

07:29.640 --> 07:36.760
disaster was yeah it was a Soviet communism yeah wasn't that the disaster

07:36.760 --> 07:41.880
yeah it was like the USSR was the disaster right yeah I mean you would

07:41.880 --> 07:45.520
expect yeah it's like I guess that's the one thing communism got wrong is that

07:45.520 --> 07:49.080
they were like they tried to save so much money I mean that's that should be

07:49.080 --> 07:52.920
capitalism's job they were so cheap they're just like well just put graphite

07:52.920 --> 07:56.160
on the tips that'll be great it'll give you a little boost when you pop those

07:56.160 --> 08:03.520
fucking rods in a little more bang for your nuclear buck should we put should

08:03.520 --> 08:08.000
we put some walls around in case in case of what in case we want to spend more

08:08.000 --> 08:12.880
money get your ass back in the fucking Kremlin I fucking turn your ass into the

08:12.880 --> 08:16.080
guy with the cane were you were you strong bad just there well that's

08:16.080 --> 08:19.920
everybody in that in that thing is like everybody's like smoking cigarettes I

08:19.920 --> 08:22.800
love that the thing blows up and then everyone's like smoking if you got them

08:22.800 --> 08:25.960
like yeah but that's what I was gonna say the director he has a love affair

08:25.960 --> 08:30.240
with long lingering shots of a cigarette in an ashtray and there'll be a similar

08:30.240 --> 08:33.240
to put a cigarette in an ashtray and then he just slowly I think those there

08:33.240 --> 08:36.800
was their way of saying to you like I know I'm making a five episode mini

08:36.800 --> 08:42.600
series about a thousand people dying of cancer in front of you but hey so like

08:42.600 --> 08:46.720
you watch you watch diehard they're all smoking in that they're basically the

08:46.720 --> 08:53.400
same thing just giving yourself cancer in different ways come on and also a

08:53.400 --> 08:57.040
building blows up it's like it's kind of the same yeah think about it

08:57.040 --> 09:02.520
Chernobyl or did I heard rip off Chernobyl yeah sit the Soviet Union is a

09:02.520 --> 09:07.320
lot like Century City you think about right the coolest shot in Chernobyl I

09:07.320 --> 09:11.360
thought was the shot of looking down at the pre-exploded reactor car and then

09:11.360 --> 09:17.800
the there's like the matrix of control rods it was like I like when when

09:17.800 --> 09:23.920
Alan Rickman said to shoot the glass yeah yeah cuz he was barefoot yeah

09:23.920 --> 09:32.160
listen I'm not we have to do one more season oh we're going back to Chernobyl

09:32.160 --> 09:39.760
we're going back so they I watched your documentary where they built the big

09:39.760 --> 09:43.280
housing that they put over it it's gonna last 100 years they think and they

09:43.280 --> 09:47.000
built a big house over the top of the thing to contain it and they have

09:47.000 --> 09:51.400
robots dismantling all the shit over the next thousand years by like remote

09:51.400 --> 09:56.680
control but then they got one dude going down there holding up fireman pants

09:56.680 --> 10:00.160
just so the epilogue can have a shot of them by the way you can't touch these

10:00.160 --> 10:04.400
fuckers yeah but you know I'm down you can wear a suit you can be in there for a

10:04.400 --> 10:08.520
little while but you got to get the fuck out like the work exposure there is like

10:08.520 --> 10:13.240
you get like six minutes or something aren't there like a vacations like

10:13.240 --> 10:17.320
Chernobyl vacations now you can go to Chernobyl and see like the fucking

10:17.320 --> 10:23.400
merry-go-round I bet I bet they are competitive rates yeah it's not

10:23.400 --> 10:26.080
expensive

10:26.360 --> 10:33.080
yeah pick up those goddamn fireman pants that you say are still too radioactive

10:33.080 --> 10:35.880
to touch and put them somewhere else but it's like oh where are you gonna put

10:35.880 --> 10:39.000
them keep them in Chernobyl like I guess it makes sense it's kind of counter

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
intuitive at first but it's like when the dog would shit and my dad would be

10:42.000 --> 10:45.320
like well let it dry and we'll sweep it up

10:46.320 --> 10:52.000
wait what you know what are we gonna do grab grab the moist dog shit smear it on

10:52.000 --> 10:56.480
the floor dab it around spray and things and then our house will be a museum to

10:56.480 --> 11:00.760
hygiene now I know what you're talking about it's just like if I can leave it

11:00.760 --> 11:04.720
the dog already shit we're already pigs nothing's gonna change 10 minutes from

11:04.720 --> 11:09.360
now except that shit's gonna be less gross to touch how's your how's your

11:09.360 --> 11:17.320

complimentary cranberry pill pack someone yeah I mean I don't think it's a UTI at

11:32.840 --> 11:37.320
this point I mean if you take antibiotics for all of the bottle and then

11:37.320 --> 11:40.800
it's like I'm just I got but I got doctor's appointment so let's find out I

11:40.800 --> 11:45.920

11:57.840 --> 12:04.440

just wanted to share I mean everybody does something fucked up everybody does

15:10.120 --> 15:13.880
some crazy thing and there's buttons everywhere and whatever so obviously

15:13.880 --> 15:17.520
there's gonna be a few bugs to work out but they leave they go like here you go

15:17.520 --> 15:21.000
like testing out for a couple weeks we'll and then we'll and then we'll

15:21.000 --> 15:24.880
work out the kinks the little things the things that we we maybe tend to

15:24.880 --> 15:31.800
overlook little little things so I go to bed and sleep I wake up I wake up to

15:31.800 --> 15:35.160
the sound of the dogs barking because someone's knocking on the door it's

15:35.160 --> 15:40.280
Dave Kline the trainer I'm like what I didn't even hear come to think of it I

15:40.280 --> 15:45.400
don't think I've heard a doorbell in days and I go down I open the door and I

15:45.400 --> 15:52.040
go did you try the doorbell he goes yep you and you and and I go oh did you it

15:52.040 --> 15:56.440
did the doorbell ring just go downstairs or whatever he's like I heard like a I

15:56.440 --> 16:02.160
did hear like a light tone of some kind coming from next to the door and I was

16:02.160 --> 16:08.760
like okay so you go outside I close the door and I ring the doorbell and I hear

16:08.760 --> 16:18.000

16:46.840 --> 16:53.680
sword hanging over my bed by a thread the doorbell opens the door it's kind of

16:53.680 --> 16:58.280

game it ballers end game we then we're gonna do the other the next yeah so you

19:17.640 --> 19:20.560
some people in the industry call you the kiss of death because you keep having

19:20.560 --> 19:24.080
shows that go on for several seasons and then strangely they just end it's the

19:24.080 --> 19:29.680
best yeah we end after we end when we want to end that's yeah it's the kiss

19:29.680 --> 19:33.640
of death you're the kiss of death you're the cream Reaper yeah success I know

19:33.640 --> 19:38.360
yeah yeah you know any expression wheelhouse comes from like it's in your

19:38.360 --> 19:44.880
wheelhouse no go ahead it's like a weird thing like it's a it's a two-step

19:44.880 --> 19:53.160
idiomatic process it starts with wheel houses like as a in paddle boats or

19:53.160 --> 19:56.560
paddle wheels like I don't know if it's like stationary for power or whatever

19:56.560 --> 20:02.760
they paddle waterwheel technology where it's like if it's if you're if something's

20:02.760 --> 20:09.040
in the wheelhouse it's gonna get the full force of the wheels like impact but

20:09.040 --> 20:13.320
then that isn't necessarily like man that's your expertise like it doesn't

20:13.320 --> 20:18.920
translate to that but then baseball used that phrase so like mean that that's in

20:18.920 --> 20:22.960
your wheelhouse it's basically your strike zone yeah like it's like you can

20:22.960 --> 20:26.240
fucking knock that out of the park that's in your wheelhouse like they're

20:26.240 --> 20:32.560
there it'll idiomatically but then we idiomatically are borrowing from baseball

20:32.560 --> 20:36.640
but and the whole time we're going wheelhouse I don't know I'm all looking

20:36.640 --> 20:41.480
up one day I always thought you know what I would have guessed my guess was

20:41.480 --> 20:46.800
always just like oh a wheelhouse is just like a old-timey garage like they

20:46.800 --> 20:49.960
didn't call them garages like they probably called a wheelhouse you thought

20:49.960 --> 20:53.480
it was a wheel like that's where you park your wheels where you're before

20:53.480 --> 20:57.600
there were even wagons there were just it was like well what are you gonna call

20:57.600 --> 21:02.080
it you're not gonna call it a carport it's a wheelhouse like probably where

21:02.080 --> 21:06.160
people always did more of their work you know like before that they called it

21:06.160 --> 21:11.640
that that was in your hoof hut right that's absolutely true yeah that's in

21:11.640 --> 21:17.320
your that's in your cows utter that's in your that's in your that's in the that's

21:17.320 --> 21:22.240
in the corner of your cave that you don't shit in yeah that was a clunky

21:22.240 --> 21:27.560
so they had to like but the word for that was just hug it was like they just

21:27.560 --> 21:33.920
had less words meant more like caveman had like six words I love baseball

21:33.920 --> 21:39.880
metaphors I'm not even that huge a fan of baseball but I'm a huge fan of baseball

21:39.880 --> 21:47.920
metaphors like strike zone like here's my favorite one well you were the first

21:47.920 --> 21:53.240
couple years of Harmontown you were swinging three bats but now you're up

21:53.240 --> 21:57.560
to the plate swinging one bat no okay what does that mean I don't know that's

21:57.560 --> 22:01.680
my favorite one it means that it's you're just hitting fucking home runs now

22:01.680 --> 22:07.240
because you're done you're like you've you've not no longer okay so getting

22:07.240 --> 22:11.280
home runs you're no longer swinging those three heavy bats right you're

22:11.280 --> 22:16.800
swinging one light it feels so much a lighter follow me you're swinging so

22:16.800 --> 22:23.400
Dan you used to have three big old wooden bats and you're swinging them why

22:23.400 --> 22:27.840
would I do that to just to make my arm just figuring out the show I eat the

22:27.840 --> 22:40.680
bats in your hand I've always said like I got this okay no go ahead Jeff go ahead

22:40.680 --> 22:43.880
you know you say like swinging two bats in the on-deck circle yeah yeah right

22:43.880 --> 22:51.440
did I not say that I mean like over here shit well I the human hand can't

22:51.440 --> 22:57.440
hold three bats I hold three bats man yeah I got huge hands does that mean

22:57.440 --> 23:01.480
like over-preparing swinging multiple bats like it's it's it's just preparing

23:01.480 --> 23:06.240
the on-deck circle is like you're swinging a heavier thing and you get

23:06.240 --> 23:11.200
into the into the batter box this is a super clear metaphor but oh I've been

23:11.200 --> 23:15.360
using the clunkiest metaphor ever now yeah well because what is it I need to

23:15.360 --> 23:20.040
understand the implication of swinging more bats I think maybe because I use it

23:20.040 --> 23:25.120
in in regards to your show which is how it's been great it do I think do baseball

23:25.120 --> 23:30.960
people swing more than one bat because they want their arms to be more accustomed

23:30.960 --> 23:34.280
to have your weight so that when they yeah they're like this is nothing well

23:34.280 --> 23:39.240
when you get up okay you're childish your bat your bat speed is faster when

23:39.240 --> 23:41.360
you get to the plate because you've been swinging a heavy because I think right now

23:41.360 --> 23:45.240
these days what they do is that you put your arms tired they put a weight at the

23:45.240 --> 23:49.360
end of their backs don't hold they put a donut on it they put a donut on it

23:49.360 --> 23:53.680
exactly but it's like it's like putting weights on your ankles before your

23:53.680 --> 23:59.040
basketball inning starts that's right that's exactly right you used to wear

23:59.040 --> 24:03.560
heavy shorts before you play a basketball inning if you look in warm-ups

24:03.560 --> 24:08.320
and warm-ups they all wear heavier shorts yeah but I use that metaphor a lot

24:08.320 --> 24:11.800
even though like wait you wait like oh I was playing with weights on my ankles

24:11.800 --> 24:15.520
right and then if you take them off that's the same thing right that's the

24:15.520 --> 24:20.920
same metaphor you use that one I've used in the past because I've often felt like

24:20.920 --> 24:27.280
I was over qualified for a job at hand and was gonna go in and just dominate so

24:27.280 --> 24:34.440
and I run out of ways to express that and and it's important that I be relatable

24:34.440 --> 24:39.560
oh you so regret this metaphor bring it to me

24:39.560 --> 24:45.600
give us a more of your favorite baseball metaphor okay that's the end you want to

24:45.600 --> 24:48.760
have a host of relatable ways of explaining your domination to people

24:48.760 --> 24:55.160
like I got two pickles on my fucking tennis racket and I still fucking you

24:55.160 --> 24:58.800
know what I'm saying right you know what I mean no did you see that that girl a

24:58.800 --> 25:03.480
15 year old beat Venus Williams today and Wimbledon 15 years old two pickles

25:03.480 --> 25:07.680
and she yeah she was so she was swinging she was swinging four tennis

25:07.680 --> 25:16.400
rackets before the match see no 15 15 years old she wasn't even born when

25:16.400 --> 25:20.640
Venus had already had four grand slams do they still make the lady tennis players

25:20.640 --> 25:25.880
wear the little skirts that's a great question I don't know but Wimbledon you

25:25.880 --> 25:30.200
have to wear white to know that you have to wear your Wimbledon whites someone in

25:30.200 --> 25:35.320
the audience whispered yes yeah and I'm do they do they make or do they choose I

25:35.320 --> 25:43.640
mean I'm sure there's no way when you go into Wimbledon like you go into like

25:43.640 --> 25:47.360
the Westworld antechamber where they're like pick your tennis outfit and then

25:47.360 --> 25:53.480
like Serena Williams reaches for shorts and they're like uh-huh gender foul like

25:53.480 --> 25:58.280
you got to wear a skirt girl there's no way that's happened I think I think the

25:58.280 --> 26:01.640
skirt's probably a good move that you're running over the shop you and why don't

26:01.640 --> 26:05.720
the guys wear the skirts that's exactly exactly there's your gender problem you

26:05.720 --> 26:10.200
just said a mouthful there pal why don't guys just wear skirts all the time

26:10.200 --> 26:14.760
they're so comfortable but I'm saying it seems clear that there's no distinct

26:14.760 --> 26:21.600
that it's not related to the to the any advantage on court whether you're

26:21.600 --> 26:25.920
wearing shorts or skirts otherwise one what both sexes would wear you're just

26:25.920 --> 26:30.880
saying like maybe tennis is like I'm just curious I'm always curious about like

26:30.880 --> 26:34.600
when you get little outfits involved in any kind of long-standing thing that's

26:34.600 --> 26:37.640
like very esteemed and like the people involved they're very like they

26:37.640 --> 26:40.560
discipline themselves I'm like it's all this stuff and then in these like

26:40.560 --> 26:45.960
turbulent times I'm like are they ever gonna is it is it is that is that I'm

26:45.960 --> 26:50.360
always curious like is somebody like man I didn't come all this way to be the

26:50.360 --> 26:54.920
complain about the skirt lady in in Wimbledon like it's like you probably

26:54.920 --> 26:57.840
probably a part of you is like I'm gonna be wearing that skirt and fucking shove

26:57.840 --> 27:01.040
this ball down your fucking throat like you're the skirt is part of your

27:01.040 --> 27:04.760
fantasy of dominating the world which is part of your empowerment it's just

27:04.760 --> 27:10.400
well it's fun to think I can't watch a beach volleyball because I'm always like

27:10.400 --> 27:18.000
yeah yeah what's good I know like the tiniest bikinis on the guys on the

27:18.000 --> 27:23.400
fellas right it's just on everybody's wearing the tiniest clothes ever yeah

27:23.400 --> 27:30.040
and and I'm always like looking at their eyes and I can't catch the game I'm so I

27:30.040 --> 27:34.920
just don't watch it I think that's sort of what you're talking about yeah right and

27:34.920 --> 27:39.560
I guess I'm always on guard I'm always like I'm always in warm-ups they have

27:39.560 --> 27:46.960
to wear two bikinis it just makes it better for the game for game time I'm

27:46.960 --> 27:50.400
always I'm always like a tornado watch like I'm watching the distant horizon of

27:50.400 --> 27:55.000
sports outfit problem is to station because I'm like are they one day gonna

27:55.000 --> 28:00.040
are they gonna come for the figure skaters yeah and is it gonna be all

28:00.040 --> 28:07.760
about talent one day first they came for the figure skaters but I yeah I mean I

28:07.760 --> 28:17.160
think I enjoy figure skating for the wrong reasons I don't enjoy it I do and

28:17.160 --> 28:21.280
I am impressed with the prowess and the discipline but it just makes me nervous

28:21.280 --> 28:25.800
yeah the gymnastics and figure skating is too stressful because when they

28:25.800 --> 28:32.040
leap and then it's like they're either gonna yeah it seems so impossible what

28:32.040 --> 28:35.000
they're doing I can you you're wearing knives on your feet and you're jumping

28:35.000 --> 28:40.080
in there yeah and you're on a cold hard deadly surface and the fact that they're

28:40.080 --> 28:44.880
not the carted off on a gurney after that they should all win a medal if you

28:44.880 --> 28:49.240
fall on that surface your dead skin's gonna stick to it first of all oh if you

28:49.240 --> 28:52.840
fall tongue first you're fucking your fuck you're fucking done baby you're

28:52.840 --> 28:56.440
done it's yeah you're yeah you're sunk yeah yeah but you're wearing a knife on

28:56.440 --> 29:00.960
your feet and you got to run around it's fucking crazy and you know yes you

29:00.960 --> 29:06.120
should wear sequins if you're gonna die fucking go out with some sass I can't

29:06.120 --> 29:09.160
watch the battle the balance beam makes me want to fucking have a heart attack

29:09.160 --> 29:15.160
yeah I can't watch it's too much man that goes oh balance beam stop it don't do

29:15.160 --> 29:19.640
it that's not that's never gonna come into play in real life you're never

29:19.640 --> 29:23.920
gonna have to fuck also the do a fucking backflip on a stick flipping from one

29:23.920 --> 29:27.320
end of the pads to the other end of the pads yeah and if you step out you're a

29:27.320 --> 29:32.080
fucking dick fuck that yeah what do you think I can't believe that shit when

29:32.080 --> 29:35.840
they when they when they do the flip and then they land in the beam I'm like it's

29:35.840 --> 29:39.560
impossible they're superheroes yeah yeah yeah they should all just they should

29:39.560 --> 29:43.880
all be president after they're for even sure yes they should fight crime they

29:43.880 --> 29:47.240
shouldn't be doing that shit they should be fighting crime yeah I think their

29:47.240 --> 29:50.440
bones are all splintered and they're miserable and stuff they're not gonna

29:50.440 --> 29:57.720
live long they're like mostly gothic now I mean I saw you know I saw the

29:57.720 --> 30:05.120
documentary about the there's a lot of grown-up former gymnasts and it's like

30:05.120 --> 30:09.360
you can't you can see the trauma in the in the face and like I wonder if it's

30:09.360 --> 30:15.160
it's like it's it's I was surprised I learned one thing from that documentary

30:15.160 --> 30:18.400
that I that I was blown away by which is that there was an active like

30:18.400 --> 30:23.600
threshold but that prior to a certain year in the Olympics like women's

30:23.600 --> 30:29.040
gymnastics meant literally women which was like 25-year-old women like jumping

30:29.040 --> 30:34.680
around doing their best like and the idea of having a child like like do do this

30:34.680 --> 30:38.640
thing was like the same as like a child doing like you know any of the other

30:38.640 --> 30:44.160
things and then and then this this guy like pioneered the art and science of

30:44.160 --> 30:48.000
like yeah but when you're 13 you're like blah blah blah and like like just

30:48.000 --> 30:52.600
started winning gold medals like a factory with like by like just children

30:52.600 --> 30:56.120
just like a children's crusade into and now and now women's gymnastics means

30:56.120 --> 31:00.640
kids because I was I didn't know that that was like a thing that just someone

31:00.640 --> 31:09.520
invented on top of you know I didn't either I didn't watch that documentary I

31:09.520 --> 31:13.280
think it was the Bella guy I think that was the guy that he was like the

31:13.280 --> 31:19.560
big more Franklin of child and gold medals and gold medals with the BC boys

31:19.560 --> 31:26.560
I think it was the BC boys that I'm hugging more girls and Bella Carolla it's

31:26.560 --> 31:31.240
a fucking lyric I well it's yeah but there there's words in those lyrics that

31:31.240 --> 31:36.000
made the Millennials hear the words and they had to say Jesus to it it's too

31:36.000 --> 31:40.240
soon for you to say those words that were in those lyrics yeah man he just died

31:40.240 --> 31:47.080

33:11.800 --> 33:17.600
that you guys are not hearing any feedback and it's going out live to

33:17.600 --> 33:21.120
people that pay a subscription fee and then a couple days later it's like all

33:21.120 --> 33:25.000
rubber banded and nicely mixed and dumping for free on the on the Hoy

well he got a job the offer that that's kind of fucked up of them though no I'm

33:57.640 --> 34:02.880
kidding if they had caught if they called me and said who's who's the best

34:02.880 --> 34:07.640
audio guy in the world so game grumps poached Chris off of it yeah that's good

34:07.640 --> 34:11.320
but they're giving him more he can't refuse the thing he's got he's got

34:11.320 --> 34:16.640
little Kris Boruff's in the oven to get no he doesn't I I just mean his testicles

34:16.640 --> 34:20.560
he just likes to take care of his testicles his pants are in oven that's

34:20.560 --> 34:26.120
why we stress why we strive to succeed but I mean that's a lot of service for

34:26.120 --> 34:29.880
I mean this is a labor of love this little cottage industry we've got it's

34:29.880 --> 34:34.120
not like we're we're not like exploiting people but at the same time we're

34:34.120 --> 34:38.560
definitely not Google wait do they exploit people yeah yeah all right

34:38.560 --> 34:44.480
well wait whatever the who are the non-exploiters no I'm one I'm one of

34:44.480 --> 34:49.080
those I'm one of those businesses where I'm like hey take 10% of everything we

34:49.080 --> 34:55.800
make you know and it but if and I'm I want that to be a billion dollars but it

34:55.800 --> 34:59.960
often isn't and and then there's like you know it's like but you get a little

34:59.960 --> 35:05.760
salary on top of it but I like that we we have a little biodome of people

35:05.760 --> 35:10.200
getting paid well that's really like it's kind of revolutionary that this is

35:10.200 --> 35:17.320
a place where people can start climbing right at working and then start

35:17.320 --> 35:21.040
climbing and and act that they're still getting paid it's really cool you have

35:21.040 --> 35:28.480
launched a lot of rockets oh shit you know okay you know who's your favorite

35:28.480 --> 35:35.880
rocket I didn't set out to you know I mean I would count you among them yeah

35:35.880 --> 35:44.400
like kind of found you in the streets like right the daily show you created

35:44.400 --> 35:47.680
you probably in the streets of the daily so that's what I would do is I would

35:47.680 --> 35:53.840
hang out into a please I invite you to do community on NBC yeah I just I just

35:53.840 --> 35:57.760
hung out I was like oh for a little who's this little British guy oh John

35:57.760 --> 36:01.680
Oliver why don't you come play a little little British guy over here yeah thank

36:01.680 --> 36:09.080
you sir thank you that's true food glorious food then that motherfucker was

36:09.080 --> 36:13.600
like I don't need you yeah but you know what he did do and I'm not saying this is

36:13.600 --> 36:17.200
what you are revolutionized news he mentioned me in an interview they said

36:17.200 --> 36:20.320
so there was in some interview with like somebody that was like a big thing of

36:20.320 --> 36:24.080
like John Oliver is the greatest guy in the world maybe let's talk all about him

36:24.080 --> 36:27.880
because he's like he's the greatest he's doing the Lord's work and like and they

36:27.880 --> 36:30.680
were like what's somebody you learned something from and he was like Dan

36:30.680 --> 36:34.760
Harmon he didn't probably didn't say it like in that accent or at that volume he

36:34.760 --> 36:44.000
probably said it with a British accent you know it's a hit me guys like him and

36:44.000 --> 36:50.680
guys like Colbert were always like I'm getting these opportunities right but

36:50.680 --> 36:56.320
all I want to do is take go take read the news in the morning and send the

36:56.320 --> 37:01.320
news into the joke pipe and then at night I want to do jokes about the news

37:01.320 --> 37:06.040
that's what you want to do oh no I have no interest right right now no no those

37:06.040 --> 37:10.280
guys did yeah I mean John Oliver particularly really have to admire his

37:10.280 --> 37:16.480
like yes he absolutely I Sam Bee I don't I don't know of Colbert or Samantha

37:16.480 --> 37:21.000
but I definitely know because he worked on our show and we had to negotiate with

37:21.000 --> 37:27.960
his guy I'm kind of is that he had lots and lots of carrots dangling of like

37:27.960 --> 37:33.600
just no why don't you just be the fucking guy in this Adam McKay movie or

37:33.600 --> 37:37.680
whatever the fuck like you know like like like Colbert and he didn't want to

37:37.680 --> 37:41.640
definitely absolutely want to do the exact thing that he's doing yeah and

37:41.640 --> 37:46.320
they both told me they were like I don't this is what I've been working up to and

37:46.320 --> 37:50.880
I don't want to do it I just discovered by doing the daily show that I want to

37:50.880 --> 37:56.040
just be making jokes about the news all the time that takes a lot of and I'm

37:56.040 --> 38:01.040
terrified and I always like you guys are all younger than me and I always like

38:01.040 --> 38:06.320
look at you guys as grown-ups because I watched the daily show when I was like

38:06.320 --> 38:13.480
at the height of my like fear of having to move back to Milwaukee as if as if

38:13.480 --> 38:17.080
that's what you do when you fail in Los Angeles like the city you leave

38:17.080 --> 38:21.680
welcome we all have to move back to Milwaukee even if we haven't lived there

38:21.680 --> 38:26.120
before that's where we go that's what I was like all these guys are grown up most

38:26.120 --> 38:29.520
people in Milwaukee aren't from Milwaukee they're all just failed they were

38:29.520 --> 38:37.480
Hollywood yeah maybe like look at all these grown-ups doing news jokes like

38:37.480 --> 38:44.960
news joke capital second tier you guys and then I'm like it always like I

38:44.960 --> 38:49.880
hate reading John Oliver's age when he read like a thing about him I'm like oh

38:49.880 --> 38:55.840
god he was always younger than me I feel like I'm you might be I wasn't you

38:55.840 --> 38:59.360
weren't looking at me like that that's not I was like the dick joke guy on the

38:59.360 --> 39:04.200
daily show I was never like the let's nail the news well I don't really get

39:04.200 --> 39:10.760
these motherfuckers I was like well what about poo I'll take your word for it but

39:10.760 --> 39:13.960
I really don't know how it worked in that show I mean I don't know my

39:13.960 --> 39:18.160
perception as a viewer was that everyone was like it was like a face value thing

39:18.160 --> 39:21.760
that everyone was a kind of like little producer of their own bits well that's

39:21.760 --> 39:25.040
true when you got like a one of your remote gigs and you go out and do a

39:25.040 --> 39:27.800
piece is that something that you had come up with or is that producers and

39:27.800 --> 39:30.280
writers coming up with stuff that's a great thing about the daily show is that

39:30.280 --> 39:35.240
everybody on the show could pitch those bits could pitch those pieces and John

39:35.240 --> 39:38.840
would be the ultimate voice of well this is gonna get done and this is gonna

39:38.840 --> 39:43.040
get done and this is gonna get done and we would basically write me and a

39:43.040 --> 39:50.480
producer would write a what we would set out to get and then we would never get

39:50.480 --> 39:54.200
that thing we would get something completely different and we come back

39:54.200 --> 39:58.840
and edit it and John would come back into the room and and help to craft it

39:58.840 --> 40:01.840
and it would become something totally different and always something better

40:01.840 --> 40:07.240
that's great right but like with me they weren't like I was always the dumbest guy

40:07.240 --> 40:12.920
in the room right and I learned how to be the dumbest guy in the room and I

40:12.920 --> 40:16.520
learned how to be that because Rob Riggle would come in and be like with his

40:16.520 --> 40:21.080
pipe and his magnifying glass Rob Rob replaced me so I never had to be the

40:21.080 --> 40:26.720
second dumbest guy in the room Rob definitely was like hey I'll be the

40:26.720 --> 40:32.400
dumbest guy now get out of here your numbers up dummy yeah neither of us

40:32.400 --> 40:37.880
gave a shit about like we didn't understand what we were making jokes

40:37.880 --> 40:43.440
about we were just like boo and dicks but but there was a time when I got

40:43.440 --> 40:48.160
started I got addicted to it and I was like at the debates right or I was in

40:48.160 --> 40:53.320
New Hampshire and I was watching two c-spans at once because there's two of

40:53.320 --> 40:57.640
those shits and I was watching these c-spans c-spans too is where it gets

40:57.640 --> 41:03.800
kind of dirty oh and John Stewart his credit c-span the security camera of

41:03.800 --> 41:09.760
news because it was literally I was watching it and it was sweeping this

41:09.760 --> 41:16.720
and there's Rob Reiner talking to John McCain and then it would pass and then

41:16.720 --> 41:20.640
you'd pass again and there's Rob Reiner talking to John McCain again and there's

41:20.640 --> 41:25.120
Dennis Kucinich and there he goes and and I was obsessed with it and then I

41:25.120 --> 41:30.520
realized like what am I doing but this is never gonna be an interesting area

41:30.520 --> 41:36.280
this is not my felt by person but this is not who I am but I love level did you

41:36.280 --> 41:40.400
have to become a news junkie yourself I just well like I was saying before right

41:40.400 --> 41:45.800
I realized I was the dumbest guy in the room and that's but that's a good thing

41:45.800 --> 41:52.000
in that I realized like for the first time in my life I wasn't trying to be

41:52.000 --> 41:57.880
smarter than I was so then I realized that I wasn't that dumb as I wasn't as

41:57.880 --> 42:05.000
dumb as I thought I was but I from does that make any sense like trying to be not

42:05.000 --> 42:10.160
trying to be the smartest guy in the room makes you smart right and and I felt

42:10.160 --> 42:14.720
comfortable with all these like eggheads these political these walks these

42:14.720 --> 42:21.920
comedy like fucking ninjas and and and and then I just felt comfortable and I

42:21.920 --> 42:26.240
and then I got it I got the whole thing but I then they got me and they still

42:26.240 --> 42:30.760
realized that I was the poo and dick guy who are the people that go through and

42:30.760 --> 42:36.440
watch everything and co-late like even like on John Oliver on last week

42:36.440 --> 42:42.120
tonight or whatever there's people that edit like and now this and it's a bunch

42:42.120 --> 42:46.720
of clips like how does somebody go through all that shit so alright there's

42:46.720 --> 42:49.840
this guy on the Daily Show he's still there and he's been there since the

42:49.840 --> 42:54.320
beginning is Adam John Oliver didn't get him because you know I know no there's a

42:54.320 --> 42:57.880
lot John Oliver snatched up a lot of guys Colbert snatched up a lot of guys

42:57.880 --> 43:01.520
but there's still this dude I still think he's on the Daily Show and his

43:01.520 --> 43:06.440
name's Adam Chodokov and he knows everything about everything and he's

43:06.440 --> 43:10.800
the one that's like he comes in every morning he's like pull a clip on fucking

43:10.800 --> 43:15.720
Trump in Korea Oliver characterized him as like superhuman he's superhuman

43:15.720 --> 43:19.320
and the set of community I was like how how does that happen when you catch a

43:19.320 --> 43:22.960
politician and he mentioned Chodokov like yeah he's a genius there's this guy

43:22.960 --> 43:26.760
literally genius but and like the key is that the guy is like he's retaining

43:26.760 --> 43:29.760
enough yeah because you it wouldn't you could have all the equipment all the

43:29.760 --> 43:34.280
hard drives in the world but it wouldn't matter if you didn't when you heard the

43:34.280 --> 43:38.880
Democratic National Convention say something about taxes and you go okay

43:38.880 --> 43:43.920
that thing that she just said she said the opposite of that I know she did I

43:43.920 --> 43:47.960
only now have to go look for it but to have it in your head yeah well he was

43:47.960 --> 43:53.560
the guy in the room that John Stewart was like that guy is as smart as I am you

43:53.560 --> 43:58.480
know and he was like Adam am I right about this and I'd be like well here's

43:58.480 --> 44:05.120
the thing and he'd launch into this like you know dissection of this economic

44:05.120 --> 44:11.240
policy and John would be like got it here's the joke and you know so he was

44:11.240 --> 44:15.240
just this resource and still is I believe I think he's still there yeah but

44:15.240 --> 44:20.960
lately there's a recent bid on John Oliver show where they just cut to one

44:20.960 --> 44:26.240
of the Fox News twats saying the same thing a thousand times but that means

44:26.240 --> 44:30.600
somebody had to watch that like every every episode of Fox News with the

44:30.600 --> 44:33.840
morning show whatever it was like it just to collate all that all that

44:33.840 --> 44:38.760
information and to make a giant edited piece out of every iteration of that

44:38.760 --> 44:42.520
stupid thing that they do well there's always somebody on every TV show that

44:42.520 --> 44:47.880
recycles the news and makes jokes about it that watches TV for a living right

44:47.880 --> 44:53.120
right yeah on the Howard Stern show it's a JD you know like he just his job is

44:53.120 --> 44:59.360
watching TV and and these guys have this talent of of doing what you said just

44:59.360 --> 45:03.640
just collecting and collecting finding patterns and and then and no and then

45:03.640 --> 45:09.640
there's a system of of who to send it to to make it into jokes that somebody

45:09.640 --> 45:13.440
that feels like the funnest job in the world it's the watching part but then I

45:13.440 --> 45:18.680
know I would be so stressed out because of the sense of responsibility that you

45:18.680 --> 45:22.440
like when you read like a Sherlock Holmes story or like any of these like

45:22.440 --> 45:25.440
takeoffs where it's like oh the whole point is that like well everyone else

45:25.440 --> 45:32.200
was thinking about more yardies knife I was noticing that the air freshener was

45:32.200 --> 45:36.400
this that it's comedy Sherlock Holmes same part of the brain that makes you good

45:36.400 --> 45:41.400
at chess and Stratigo and all these and crosswords and things that I if they

45:41.400 --> 45:46.160
freak me out Stratigo is a fucking great game Stratigo is a good game sorry I

45:46.160 --> 45:50.200
didn't mean to cut you off no it's really fun though right I don't all I know

45:50.200 --> 45:55.640
about Stratigo is that it's like people that like risk are like yikes oh I like

45:55.640 --> 46:00.680
the spy I think is the spy part of it yeah the bomb yeah the bomb oh the bomb

46:00.680 --> 46:06.400
oh my god that game fucking rocks strategy freaks me out like I because I just

46:06.400 --> 46:10.000
always feel like I get burnt in Stratigo that's all I know I can't play

46:10.000 --> 46:14.960
games I'm not good at games until I know the strategy yeah and then my then I

46:14.960 --> 46:21.840
fuck with my kids I'm at my I'm at my worst when I'm thinking a move or more

46:21.840 --> 46:25.600
yeah oh it takes me a while I'm really sure I'm not at my best when I'm not

46:25.600 --> 46:29.120
thinking ahead but you're like was he giving himself credit for being a

46:29.120 --> 46:34.120
genius in the moment because no but I'm just I'm just not the more yeah it

46:34.120 --> 46:37.880
just it panics me like I always like starts it's like I think that got

46:37.880 --> 46:42.280
consciously thinking about what what I'm supposed to be doing like fucks me up

46:42.280 --> 46:47.400
and I'm panicked until I figure that part of it out and it's usually not that

46:47.400 --> 46:52.080
complicated it's usually like oh I gotta go left when these guys go right I guess

46:52.080 --> 46:55.040
you check about the joy of like finding your bit and then you know what to go

46:55.040 --> 46:59.760
after and then having like a well of like like I enjoy that sensation of like

46:59.760 --> 47:03.760
looking at like fucking around and then you're like wait I know what the bit is

47:03.760 --> 47:07.520
yeah that's exactly what it is yeah it's like you're describing coming up with

47:07.520 --> 47:11.600
the remote pieces to it's like you had to chart a course by some star right to go

47:11.600 --> 47:14.400
out there and say well here's our angle but what we're really gonna do is an

47:14.400 --> 47:16.960
interview and we'll make sure we have one thing in the can and then you come

47:16.960 --> 47:20.920
back and in the Bay you're gonna wait a minute we've got a new angle how many

47:20.920 --> 47:26.080
times did you guys then like fundamentally change the opener all the time so so

47:26.080 --> 47:32.440
that's really so we had a lot of fun zeroing in on that you know that thing

47:32.440 --> 47:36.360
and then we'd come back like I said and it'd be wrong and then we'd have a lot

47:36.360 --> 47:41.480
of fun and edit zeroing in on it again and trying to figure it out I think

47:41.480 --> 47:44.080
that's what you're talking about yeah yeah yeah hey Dan real quick just to

47:44.080 --> 47:48.480
clarify I think you mistakenly called Kris Boruff the audio guy he's the

47:48.480 --> 47:53.520
he's the video he's talking about audio he's the live video director of

47:53.520 --> 47:59.600
Harmontown oh I stripped out a channel or two from his yeah you're right he's

47:59.600 --> 48:03.520
the live editing I mean he's the director he's the camera mounts and all the

48:03.520 --> 48:06.760
stuff and he's the he's the editor of the video did they say that and some kind

48:06.760 --> 48:11.560
of headset yeah that was like two hours ago did you just get like so really hey

48:11.560 --> 48:18.320
Jeff you're the comptroller no he's Zach and Chris pointed that out via text just

48:18.320 --> 48:22.080
now yeah he texted me but I didn't say anything I didn't get a text from

48:22.080 --> 48:26.760
anybody and now he's the now he's good now he's the producer at Game Grumps so

48:26.760 --> 48:30.560
we got that all right all right well and man we're promoting Zach to head of

48:30.560 --> 48:36.800
texting all right I would say being that that diminished by Harmontown is the

48:36.800 --> 48:42.040
equivalent of swinging three podcast bats that's a great analogy right that's a

48:42.040 --> 48:45.920
great analogy I mean at least Kris Boruff gets to like his back there packing

48:45.920 --> 48:52.680
his bag I left at the right place they don't even know what I did

48:52.680 --> 48:57.960
great time they meant they missed like like a half of what I do I want a big

48:57.960 --> 49:02.360
half it's your eyeballs the biggest half I think we should also give a big shout

49:02.360 --> 49:06.040
out to Zac McKeever for craft services nobody makes peanut butter sandwich like

49:06.040 --> 49:10.560
Zac McKeever our craft service backstage that's all he does is make

49:10.560 --> 49:16.840
sandwiches you're Mike you're Mike the that your your feed is just racist quotes

49:16.840 --> 49:20.720
from Hitler now he just swapped it out you just threw the kettle one cap on the

49:20.720 --> 49:25.920
ground I dropped it because I'm drunk Google it

49:25.920 --> 49:36.560
Google alcohol drunk Siri what is alcoholism anybody noticing Siri getting

49:36.560 --> 49:41.760
more aggressive or is it just that I'm festooned with i devices as I always

49:41.760 --> 49:45.600
answers you when you're not talking I was in the writers room two days ago and I

49:45.600 --> 49:49.200
was like stammering through some explanation of like I'm like this it's

49:49.200 --> 49:51.880
like it's like that it's like this remember when Pete Holmes did his

49:51.880 --> 49:56.200
impression of me like I was like trying to ask him a question and he was like

49:56.200 --> 49:59.080
what are you at and I'm like well what no you know what I'm asking is like well

49:59.080 --> 50:04.360
I think you might be going but he kind of like like seriously like I if I say

50:04.360 --> 50:07.920
anything close to Siri in the midst of talking in the writers room like every

50:07.920 --> 50:12.880
once in a while like this my watch or my phone will cut me off halfway through and

50:12.880 --> 50:18.560
it's this like woman in a tin can mocking me there's just going like I don't know

50:18.560 --> 50:22.080
what you're talking about well now it's no just like it's like she think I can't

50:22.080 --> 50:26.280
find the answer to that Jan back to the what I heard was I think it's like this

50:26.280 --> 50:29.840
but logistically it should be that but from a standpoint of internal logic it's

50:29.840 --> 50:33.400
more like that but what we should do is break the rules before we define them

50:33.400 --> 50:37.080
because the in truth like maybe defining them well it's not to say this is that

50:37.080 --> 50:45.240
what you meant and all the writers are like she nailed you like we can get

50:45.240 --> 50:50.200
fired but that bitch got you down I'll do the thing if I'm in the car and I'll

50:50.200 --> 50:55.200
go like tell Bill Davis my brother like tell Bill Davis that I'll be over at

50:55.200 --> 51:02.000
1130 and I'll cough or something tell Bill Davis fuck shit and she goes hmm

51:02.000 --> 51:10.480

51:10.480 --> 51:16.440

this fucking locked down you're in the zone okay so my dogs got in a skunk

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:21.520
battle like so after that last week we were celebrating the week anniversary of

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.320
the front porch massacre Cody thought I was coming home from the show like she

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.320
she like like she thought she was so like she thought she was timing it right

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.000
so when the dogs started barking she assumed it was me coming up the front

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.520
walk she flings open the front door it's gonna be a beautiful thing all the

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.960
dogs coming out Barbara Harvey Nigel they're gonna like run out and we love

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:55.120
being a family and a pack and Barbara Barbara's great well Barbara's she's

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.080
great won't say she's great she's great she's I mean I love Barbara she's my

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:10.160
she's my daughter like she's the little much she said the dogs go flying out the

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.920
front door but it's not me rolling up it's a it's a skunk and and and and so

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.440
it's Harvey runs out and's like what's up and the skunk is like and Harvey's

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:26.320
like and then Barbara's like even though Barbara hates Harvey and constantly

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.600
like nips at him when they're feeding and like like like like like Barbara's

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.400
like constant like it's just it's just ironic that this is now a time for

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.960
sibling support that she's like why did you spray my brother and like die like

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:43.600
runs in grabs the skunk and it's like and it's like spraying ever it's like I

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:49.800
got one move one move and Nigel's like I've been through this six times I think

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.760
I'm supposed to hang back and and Cody's like Barbara let go and Barbara

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.440
let's go and the skunk goes by her account limping away and then looks back

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:06.400
at Nigel who's just like watching it and goes because it's had enough and of

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.840
this yard and just like limps away and and Cody gets all of the pack into the

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:18.800
fucking house which still stinks and it's a nightmare and all this stuff so then

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:25.080
two days later this post on next door app because the internet doesn't let

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.840
anything happen anymore with like we this is we're not gonna survive it's all

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.720
content baby we are all connected now there is no escape like and and the the

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.600
bad I think outweighs the good of a purely connected society like I we're

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:55.560
on the next door app so we saw this post injured baby skunk fuck you I saw an

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:05.800
injured baby skunk whilst whilst all right fuck you fuck you well now this

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.960
sounds like some Milwaukee shit right now this person's into skunks while

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:16.240
walking on my neighborhood at around 7 p.m. it was dragging its back legs not

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:25.720
limp it was like oh fuck you don't mourn this skunk possibly hit by a car you keep

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:31.200
thinking that it made its way into someone's garden so I hurriedly got on

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.720
the internet in search of a place to help rescue it I called humane society in

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.640
Glendale as it is supposed to be open 24-7 to get an answering machine which

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:43.640
says we do not rescue animals call the Pasadena office well it was closed at

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.360
7 p.m. I then called around every animal rescue of friends of animals vets

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.080
etc to find them all closed it's pathetic that it is so hard to find help for a

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.760
sick or injured animal I lived in a small town in another state where there is

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:03.400
always a place to find help with I realize that sometimes an animal is so

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.720
badly injured that it can be the only thing you can do but at least we can

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.480
try to save one person I am really disappointed that in a city as big as

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.800
LA it's so hard to find some organization to help I went back with water for the

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.440
little skunk and could not find it and it was getting dark I am really angry

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:33.360
and frustrated right now send send I don't know I understand all of those

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:40.320
feelings I accept for the quick is not when she goes into the biography

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.280
version of I was born in a small town you don't picture this as a dude huh you

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.800
said she I it's funny how I immediately pictured this as a guy because I but

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.600
you know now that I'm proud of myself for picturing as a guy but but it's

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.800
because I don't like them and part of that is that I feel terrible because I'm

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.440
like just think they're describing the wake of a fucking horrible war machine

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:12.880
that yeah like I but so I want this person to be a bad person I don't it's

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.960
not it this person doesn't have empathy for the little skunk this person's like

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.640
these fucking neighbors are gonna love me after this I can't believe this girl

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:26.720
this review about like their relationship with doing nothing they've

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:32.360
they accomplished nothing and do you know do you have a ring doorbell I have

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.680
a I got a new thing it's a doorbell unlocks the front door well that's right

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.960

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:49.920
in yeah yeah well ring ring door ring whatever has this I think it's kind of

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.040
perfected and fucked up neighborhood what next door neighborhood right whatever

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.760
it is because it's basically ring does anybody know about this like ring

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.720
neighborhood so basically it's just pictures of people sneaking into their

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.320
yard or like trying to find a key on top of the doorjam and then seeing there's

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.600
a ring and like oh fuck and they run away and that gets posted to ring

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.720
neighborhood and everybody's like oh Jesus that's awesome it's a fat black and

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.120
white nighttime photo of this criminal but then also every once in a while this

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.840
just as kid it's like a black kid trying to sell candy right right and yeah

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:33.360
right and people are like ah I have never seen this fellow around the

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:41.360
neighborhood looks like he's casing what you got in that box yeah yeah it's at

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:47.840
least nobody's like talking about their fucking little skunks everybody's you

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:52.560
know it's just pictures of criminals and that's the only people being mistaken

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.720
the only like if someone knocks on my door I'm instantly upset like I think

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.720
it goes back I think they're all criminals anybody that knocks on my door

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.960
is a criminal I don't care if your UPS or whatever the fuck but if you knock on

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.920
my door I take it harkens back to the time when I was broke and that might be

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.480
the sheriff coming to evict me like like so like the mailbox and the knock on

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.200
the door is always the enemy yeah even if I've ordered food and I know that

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.440
someone's gonna come knock on the door I instinctively look for my shoes yeah

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.160
because there was a time when I literally had to like think about like

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.640
going out the back like the back exit and so fuck you for knocking on doors

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.680
but if you're gonna knock on my door have chocolate if the little kid

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.800
comes up with a box full of chocolate it's pretty good chocolate they got the

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.720
almonds in there and you or I don't care what it's for they say it's they're

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.440
gonna get it they're gonna get a trip somewhere I don't give a fuck but if

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.000
you're gonna knock on my door candy bring me some goddamn chocolate with some

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.800
almonds and I will always buy that I'll buy the whole goddamn box yeah I told

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.400
the story on this podcast about like the first year in my house like the

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.760
weirdest encounter that I still think about all the time and I'm like this

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.480
guy that looked so much like Kevin James like just picture Kevin James he had a

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.680
baseball hat on and just looked like Kevin James just picture that he rang

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:14.320
my doorbell and like he was like hey um hey I'm so-and-so I'm such a touch and

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.480
I thought and he kind of like he ran he rattled off the stuff and I'm just like

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.680
you know I'm in full I'm already I'm just in like stranger on my porch mode like

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.320
I don't like and so I'm not absorbing what he's explaining which is that he's

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.400
related to one of my neighbors and that his mother-in-law's grandma's sister is

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.560
the one that walks the poodles from time to time and like I'm just giving him his

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.760
blank look because I'm like what's happening and like it sets the tone for

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.840
the whole conversation that like he sees this blank look and he in it it seems

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.960
like in his mind he's done so much explaining about who he is and I've

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.960
I've given him nothing in return that he just he just gets this look on his face

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.800
like never mind so anyways and then he continues with this pitch about like

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.720
kids in a soccer league and they're like playing soccer and they're gonna go to

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.840
Italy and play soccer and all the kids in the local school and all these things

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.440
are gonna play plus soccer and and they need money and they're raising money and

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.840
they're fundraising and I'm like I'm just like like wow man like if you come

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:17.960
knock on my door like like if you're lucky if I'm high like I like like you're

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.760
you're unlucky if I'm like in the middle of a movie like like I don't I just like

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.880
you're at someone's house but I'm just like I'm not I was like how do I what

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.000
do I do what do you want and I'm like I reach in my pocket and I like unwad like

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.560
a $5 bill and in my head I'm thinking like Harmon you're crazy this guy's a

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.000
panhandler and he's like gonna get five bucks like if you saw him on the street

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.300
you wouldn't give a $5 bills away like you're just you're just engaging this

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:46.360
weird like suburban privilege thing because the guys looks like Kevin James

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.840
and while I'm thinking that the guy is looking at the $5 bill like I'm

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.760
producing an AIDS needle and and like offering a gem and and and and and I'm

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.360
like you know what well I'll tell you what I just this is what I got in my

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.640
pocket right now I'm kind of in the middle of probably disappointing some

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.280
studio and you're probably watching Pluto Nash and and and and he's like he

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.680
doesn't take the five job he's like okay okay no no I mean usually what we're

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.080
talking about is something more like like like like you know like in the

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.080
neighborhood of something if you have a checkbook or a thing and I don't like I

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.640
took a turn yeah and I go like oh I don't have a checkbook in the house and

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.160
like and he's like you know what I don't I don't you know what you like like

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.320
like whatever it's I find it's like I come over here you're pulling out like

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.080
five dollars out of your pocket I was like I just like whatever and he like

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:43.760
walks away I'm I'm just shell shocked and I don't like standing there in the

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.720
porch and then I'm like and then I'm like like like walk out like as he's

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.280
walking away because you've got to like walk down all these like DreamWorks

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.920
flagstone steps out of my place he can't he can't just like disappear into a

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.080
bush it's like he's just had this like weird thing with me and now he's just

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:05.000
walking a football field and I was like like are you a psychopath since

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
something like what are you a fucking psycho or something like I was like

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.720
genuinely curious like I was like I was like what was this so I can tell my

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.880
friends and and he turns around he's Kevin James he's wearing cargo shorts a

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.240
white baseball cap and but he does this move where he turns around while he's

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:27.760
storming away and and raises arms out he goes like I don't know man you know

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:34.880
everybody has a checkbook in their house sir and he just like walks away and

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:42.200

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:07.720

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.760
accountant who we just saw today he said hey hey Jeff did you did you spend

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.480
I'll get held up on Venmo or whatever it is now right like you if you put a

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.480
little memo in a Venmo payment I don't have Venmo yet so I don't know so one

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:35.440
of the writers was tell me everybody's got Venmo man she paid her therapist she

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.200
wrote something funny in the therapy section it was like I think it was a

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.280
reference to what she talked about in the therapy section which was session

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.400
which also happened to allude to like explosives or something it was like and

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.120
they held her check up because it was like the memo which as long as I've

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:57.360
lived is always where the joke goes she put a joke but now that we're in the

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.080
black and new new digital world the memo matters they like held her check

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.320
because she might have been ISIS because ISIS love this like so into like clean

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.360
bookkeeping they're like well it's for explosives just put the explosives yeah

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.280
you know like signatures this is how al-qaeda failed it's got it got them on

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.160
the fucking bookkeeping and your email you can set a signature just every email

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:27.360
you send is the same signature on Venmo my memo that I sent is just killed a

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:38.560
president and so far so good I guess they don't bring in I'm not sure if it's

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:41.640
still true but I think David Cross you know when you incorporate you can name

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.400
your corporation whatever you want do you have a funny name I do no I don't it's

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:51.080
not funny but I believe the Cordray company that David Cross is the Jew

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.880
Run Media so every time he writes himself a check from his corporation he's

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:02.000
being paid by the Jew Run Media that's really good I really blew it really yeah

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.800
yeah I regret my calling it just Cordray company okay I didn't have to be a

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:14.640
baby skunk by the way what does this guy know about skunk ages I can't believe

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:22.560
he came back with water my trainer how does it be I like that the he or she

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:30.000
surmises that it's a it's a car accident listen fuck skunks fuck sharks

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:37.680

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.960
adorable bear side on my okay all right all right skunk adorable but they will

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.200
while that we I would just come home late at night and there'd be a family of

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.840
skunks on my doorstep and it's just a standoff yeah it's like I might I'm like

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.080
I I have to go to a hotel tonight because it's like when I used to I used to smoke

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:05.040
and I would be sitting in my driveway smoking and I'd feel like a little tongue

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.000
or a nose on the back of my shin and I looked down as a fucking skunk what

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.200

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.480
guys about my therapist I've been seeing a therapist no he he thinks I should get

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.920
a haircut so this is the therapist that told me to cut my beard and now he

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:32.040
thinks I should get here wait what what what the fuck is his problem that's the

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:35.720
thing is I keep telling people should get a therapy degree yeah that's what I was

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.520
going to say I was like yeah you should start wearing a suit you should get a

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:44.280
clipboard I started asking people how they start writing things down in this

01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.840
office see you he runs you should see that I could get on board for that be

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.040
great you should start playing highlight it's just very weird and every time I

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.720
tell people about that they're like that sounds wrong and I'm like I know right

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.400
why is he weighing in on your gun your like style well he just kind of like I

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.920
go in there and he's like so what's new and I'm like oh you know I've been

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:10.400
depressed he's like well you look like shit maybe get a haircut hippie who do

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:15.040
I make the check out to right exactly it's great it's a lot of he sounds like

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:21.480
he's really nailing it it's weird get out of there yeah no I know yeah you're

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.160
allowed to see like 20 therapists before you find one you like yeah but where do

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.600
you even find one well I don't know yeah you got to keep going just keep

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:32.840
stumbling into him I want to go to a therapist to ask him about my therapist

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.000
like be like hey he tells me to get a haircut what do you think about that it

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
would be fair you know because all therapists they see therapists they

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.400
right we learned that in the sopranos and it's true like they all have

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.640
therapists and it I think it should be fair like we should all get to have one

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.200
session a month with our therapist therapist yeah where we're like what's

01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:02.160
up with Linda you don't know I'm like well she's usually asking me stuff I was

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.840
like look if you've ever heard her complain about her mom let me explain a

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.340
couple things about that and then you just sort of like like put it in

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:14.720
perspective man he also said I don't make enough eye contact oh god I'm making

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:18.880
more eye contact though it's a lot of fun it's like a video game it's like

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:26.160
stardew valley the hearts are going up I feel like when I make I can finally I'm

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.800
going to kill them like I don't want to stare into people's eyes that's the thing

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.640
is that one time I called him I was like well do you think if I went to another

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:38.680
therapist they'd tell me to get a haircut and I fucking maintained unbroken

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.720
unblinking eye contact like you're doing with me right now it's while I was

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.360
watching him answer I was like right this is why I don't like eye contact

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:51.080
because it's inherently aggressive this is what predators do to pray that they're

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.720
going to murder yeah that's why I'm super comfortable doing it in this

01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:00.040
context because I want to kill you right now it is true yeah yeah humans have

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.600
deep defenses for a reason yeah well it's just we're being assaulted

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.600
constantly assaulted with people's eyes on us yeah I don't look at people because

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.080
it's a favor to them I'm right exactly I'm like Cyclops I'm like I don't make

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.560
this I'm holding my arms in front of me like I'm like that's armor right yeah

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:23.160
that's the other when I go into the therapy I'm like this I'm like and he

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.440
asked why I did that and I was like well I don't want to close off my body

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.480
posture and have you read into me closing off my body posture yeah so this is

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.360
such a I'm exhausted well that is my therapist tissues that it's it is like

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.520
it's like I contact and and and open your body up but like I feel like I kind

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.480
of like I kind of more like I contact thing I'm like but also I don't like

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.320
looking at ugly people yeah so I don't want to make eye contact

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.040
well I hear you know like why would you want that's just not fun now it's not

01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:02.120
fun for anyone is your therapist ugly oh yeah all right I like I don't mean to

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:06.120
get it say that so that like yeah I'd look at you if you were hot when I was

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.640
when I was really young I went to a therapist with my mom what was a

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.760
psychiatrist they were giving me drugs and stuff and they were like I noticed

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.840
you have your hands on your genitals do you want to talk about that and I was

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.880
like my hands are in my lap like what are you talking what do I do with my hands

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.160
oh and then the past 20 years you don't know what I'm like what do I do with my

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:30.720
hands so that they're not in my lap so they're not on my genitals I can't fit

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:36.440
them in my pockets I like sit like this like I'm Jesus or something

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:42.720
all right it's a lot of fun I think my hands are on my genitals your eyes are

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.600
clearly on my general right let's talk about that see that would have been a

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.320
good comeback yeah but yeah I always save up a lot of good comebacks for what

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.160
I'm saying yeah it's you're on the show let's breathe a scalier yeah so you

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.840
always got a good one after the therapy session I would doubt unless you followed

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:00.680
that up with like by the way I'm overlooking all that stuff because

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.040
there's something about him or whatever that I would definitely no I want to I'm

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:09.080
just lazy yeah I haven't seen him lately 85% of therapists suck just like no I

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:14.000
know my last therapist was like I go well I got nothing to talk about and he was

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.680
like we don't have to talk oh I was like oh fuck he just starts washing a car

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.640
yeah no he was just staring at me and I was like all right this is what we're

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.960
doing exactly yeah so it's like then my my mind is just I'm like well how long

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:36.680
can I keep this up and then it becomes about keeping it up and I'm like well

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:42.320
this is stupid I'd be here for a reason I want to want you to tell me why I'm so

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.560
fucked up yeah exactly yeah something or admit you can't give me my money back

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:51.560
yeah let's not let's talk you talk what do you think is what do you think is

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:57.600
fucked up about you what what yeah oh take your pick Jesus Christ

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:05.040
dealer's choice damn it I mean a social awkward I'm just awkward I'm I'm I'm not

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:11.880
fucking nightmare but you don't but you you my mind is on fire is it yeah but

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:18.080
I'm not thinking about anything good or intelligent it's just like you fuck is

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.760
there oh is there a theme if you could identify it within that flame is like

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.240
like I'll go first and say like it's just like don't kick me out don't kick me

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.360
out like that's what I'm thinking like like I'm most preoccupied by like I'm

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.560
just like well just like like look look don't kick me out like I just have this

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:36.880
like like don't kick me out of society like don't I feel like that's way deeper

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.360
than what my mind says to me my mind's always like oh you look like an asshole

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.600
right now you just get a haircut you just said something really stupid and that

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.320
person hates you now that person like like it sounds like you're just going I

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:52.760
mean I think all those things stupid I'm just yeah but then then also you know

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:58.000
like who what nobody's thinking about me right and what if what would be the

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.680
worst thing that would happen if they thought all yeah exactly the first

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:04.440
thing is theoretically that they would like they would like yeah kick you out

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.360
which doesn't happen right like yeah I guess I'm sort of thinking if yeah but

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:15.200
it's all kind of like summed up as like like oh how am I driving like like like

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.080
like you're trying to put energy into the interface you're going like hey I hear

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.120
you like like like like you know I don't know it's like like like like I want to

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:25.960
say the right thing and all this stuff and it's like and then that manifests

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.920
itself as like things that might make you like awkward or you say the wrong

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:34.880
thing sometime and then I'm always thinking like well so the opposite of

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.400
that spectrum isn't like just like a sociopath that's just like doesn't give

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:42.720
a fuck and it's like like yeah I got this man like what's this guy talking

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.560
about I'm gonna listen to everything he says and then I'm gonna like mine him

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:49.440
for weaknesses kind of jealous of sociopaths I know I totally am like

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:52.280
well I think everybody is like we're fascinated with them like we wish we

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.160
could take like a little sociopath supplement like a little like like

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:01.280
stuff and feel like what that's like for a 10 minutes or just do like a little

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:06.640
bit to get you take the edge off of your wanting to not get arrested so you're

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.960
just like I'm a little I'm a little 5% sociopath I'm feeling it like enough to

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.320
relax because nobody wants to talk to somebody that's thinking about how

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:18.040
they're being received yeah it's like we're all a bunch of suction cups trying

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:36.840
to suck on each other yeah and that's how that's how humans laugh I hate I

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:41.240
hate that the guys like oh I've got like like oh what do I notice that your hair

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:45.160
I know that's the thing that pisses me off it's like this isn't working you're

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.280
not working very hard to get these answers the most superficial thing you

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:53.360
could possibly say he was probably after he said that like oh fuck I fucked

01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:00.120
out he goes to therapy and he's like I said the worst I did it I got I got this

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:04.160
bag of dirt coming to see me he's got a long hair I just want to get a book with

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:09.400
a beard oh what do we do we want somebody to get haircut we don't say it we try to

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.080
point them in the direction where they'll realize they want to get a haircut

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:21.160
that's right now go in the corner and piss your pants on purpose do it and

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:25.160
then that guy goes to his therapist it's like like just fucking like it's just a

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:30.600
fucking dominatrix on his nipples fucking eat my cum you little sheep and

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.960
he's like I'm sorry and then she goes to a therapist and it's just like a weird

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:46.480
like wicker man we're all being led by a lunatic that's the thing we should be

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.160
thinking about when you hear every therapist has a therapist oh shit well

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:55.680
what is this there's some shrink on the moon like making us all crazy that there's

01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.640
there a lastot therapy it's like god talk about I'd like therapy and then

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:07.360
they're all just disseminating but Rob you seem like an eye contact you kind of

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.080
guy you always look me straight in the face or is it hard for you as a no I'm

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.840
okay with that but now that you mention it I'm looking away from you right you

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.280
know I don't like talking about eye contact yeah it's a weird thing to think

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.080
about I don't mind looking at people's eyes that aren't looking at mine but

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:33.520
here we go a little healthy though right what just really wait wait allow

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:38.160
ourselves to do this I love you yeah I love you I respect you I love you and I

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.440
respect you I'm in the moment I'm mirroring you yeah I'm for real though

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.880
we're not deflecting with comedy I really like you get a hair cut I decided to

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.640
come on the show like I that you contacted me I like I have a lot of shame

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.920
and though I'm talking about myself I like you I'm I like you and I'm not

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.280
joke making a joke either I'm actually responding that the reason that I

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.680
contacted you to come on the show is because I love this show and I love you

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:09.280
and I I really look up to you and I respect you yeah

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.520
listen do you want to both look at Jeff look both will look at Jeff okay here

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:21.120
we go hey Jeff he doesn't care what an asshole nothing that you're making me

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:27.240
feel like like I'm a psychopath because I'm a big eye contact person I'd love

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:31.040
looking at people's I think society wants you to have eye contact I think

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.040
it's like something we've created like we've made that a thing I don't think

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.320
like humans naturally want to make eye contact I think it's something that

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.600
culture has like you know I travel around doing shows and stuff and I'd like

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.960
to go out and wander and walk and I'm very fascinated by strangers I like

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:52.040
like I like meeting people and if you walk up the road and certain like in

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.760
New York City people make eye contact people like you can be on a subway and

01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:00.400
people look at you and you know various kinds of reactions people flirts but then

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.960
you go like like strangely like Seattle nobody makes eye contact there like it's

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.440
like I noticed like towns that there's some cultures were just just zero eye

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:20.160
contact Milwaukee and most people like because that felt good I guess but we

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.120
looked at each other and we and we were honest with each other we're the moment

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.800
and then I think like then like worse people than us was kind of like you

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:33.240
should do that all the time bro eat broccoli and do that and they're like

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.560
just like well that's because the if you did it all the time like the most you

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.000
could like you you'd feel like this much oh Jesus and if I every time I saw you

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.680
you'd be like oh here comes Rob Corddry again he's gonna look at me right in the

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.400
eyes and tell me how much he loves me people could handle how much I feel and

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.280
I think more importantly I think you and I could but we'd be like I love you I

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.520
love you it's great I like I really respect you on all this stuff and I

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.320
think people I think then people around us would be like look at these two fucking

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.520
jerks yes like what are they doing I said what kind of latte do you want hey

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.000
you're you're like like why do you guys get a like fucking then we would make

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.480
fun of us we'd be having that this conversation and then inappropriate we'd

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:16.300
be in like a Starbucks but we should have it at a show in front of a hundred

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.440
people ostensibly you're supposed to just constantly be looking at everybody

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.440
into their goddamn souls I'm like I don't really like we did that tour and

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:30.200
like I met like a thousand people a night like I'm flattering myself there's

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.200
like 200 people a night but like the people that stand in line a vast majority

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.760
of my audience is like like is like gonna stare at something else at the

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:43.600
height of their effusiveness like like when they're really expressing themselves

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:47.640
I look at that as like they're taking that part of their enterprise down so

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.960
that they can divert so they could tell you because it's time to be honest and

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.440
who wants to like look into someone's eyes while you have something really

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.680
important to say like it's like like like that's so distracting like I don't

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.360
mind if you can do it fine but like maybe some people are like like distracted

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.600
by eye contact and then they're like they're not able to find their and then

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.600
they're not able to be honest yeah I think in general my experience is that

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:17.400
men are really really uncomfortable looking other men in the face and like

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.800
if you like meet somebody and like you say hello nice to meet you and you look

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.400
them in the eye it's pretty rare to meet somebody that really just looks you

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:30.760
right in the eye goes hey hey like I'm so-and-so and mostly instantly they

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.800
look at the ground or I'm gonna start doing it I'm gonna start looking at

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:40.120
everybody yeah it's like a video game like Dale Carnegie like being so full

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.280
with your I looked at five people and it's like fucking insane like like what

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.880
they I just did it with like five just made I cut yeah I got you got yeah no

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:54.560
he he came right here can't even handle it who in the crowd right now is the

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:57.920
worst at eye contact is anybody here like this terrible you've been you've

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.760
been he's been making it I feel like we've had a nice relationship silence

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.160
seduction I feel like we've no we've like I like this guy

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.400
Harper Harper like Harper like the beer no that's not a lot of eye contact right

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:20.320
enough well now we're talking about we fucked it up right right you don't like

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.120
talking about eye contact now it's why do we have to I guess yeah I'm sorry I

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:30.120
tell you about the therapist I had that she was like she she he could tell that

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:34.280
it was like oh she's looking at me as some kind of like sorry I just looked at

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:42.440
I just sent lasers in the Harper go ahead Harper almost fainted by the way

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:48.080
yeah I was like oh fuck oh this is completely off topic but there is this

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.040
guy that DM me saying he could get me a free bird scooter and Matthew McGinnis

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:58.440
if you're listening give me a free bird scooter when I your own dedicated bird

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.520
scooter yeah yeah sorry everybody well that when you said this is gonna be off

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.120
topic I have a question about your free bird scooters let's say Matthew comes

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.080
through on that and you have your bird scooter and you you take it down to the

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.600
market and you put it outside is someone gonna go and try to get on your

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.720
I think so it like locks you out though again I kind of say what you have you

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.040
have tried to interface with a special VIP bird scooter yeah I don't know how

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:27.280
that works because they do they're making the ones that you can like buy or rent

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.640
to own or something that are like more personal use but that's my questions how

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.560
does that how does that work in a world where everyone thinks you can just take

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.200
them and run you just got to put numbers or chevrons on them right I try to kill

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:42.480
that's a prolly scooter I try to convince my wife the other night I was

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.920
like hey let's go out and try and find some scooters and ride around on these

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.840
scooters and she was like absolutely not oh and I was like come on never I like

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:54.240
that if you I want to do the tiered scooter system because then they can

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.920
because like they have curfews like all of them shut off at 1130 but they can

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.560
have the rich people's one stay out until 2015 and that's the red hour it's

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:15.760
like the rich the rich people with their carnival like getting fucking like

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.200
surfing the pavement you look like you're walking home a great way

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:28.840
always like noblemen circling a lone milkmaid like you have to dress up all

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:34.120
super like ice-white shirt yeah everybody's wearing two colored tights

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:42.600
like in the 70s Romeo and Julia it's like I bite my thumb at you I think it's

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:47.400
like I see people on them and like when there's a dude because I wear suits and

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.720
I'm tall and I see tall guys in suits like going around town oh yeah that is a

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:57.360
bummer you look like a fucking not a lot of just like shit if you fucking see me

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:04.440
going down the road and a fucking e-scooter just shoot me like you'll be

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:10.440
fun I know I don't know I would be like that's Jeff Davis in a suit yeah just

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.440
walk walk it's slow when you're wearing a scooter you want to walk though your

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.320
shoes I want to maximize the time that I'm fucking looking good going down the

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.120
road I don't gotta be somewhere that much that I gotta look like he's

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.800
maximizing the amount of people who could see him per unit time exactly thank

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.840
you no no the guy on the scooter because he's making it you're only walking like

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.280
half a mile this guy he's gone three miles he's three miles of traffic but

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:42.160
you're only getting so much of it you're only getting a glimpse of me and the

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:46.520
scooter if oh yeah but what a glimpse he's zipping down yeah but he's flashed

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.840
he's dressed to the nines I would rather see me walking across the

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:57.600
crosswalk than zipping across the crosswalk sure fuck yeah there's a lot of people who would say I want to let me wash

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:03.280
oh all over your eyeballs but all I'm all I'm taking it was I'm like why can't

01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:13.840
you I've never heard anything more nightmarish than that I'm really worried

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:18.160
at the Rick and Morty office there's one urinal and I worry that because I'm on

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:23.400
this painkiller medication that makes your pee like dark orange I'll take that

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:30.360
like almost red like pumpkin orange like like like sci-fi like weird and and it

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.680
just like I worry about like I just don't it's like like like guys don't get

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.000
as many UT highs and like I'm in the men's room and it's like you're at a

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:42.600
urinal and there's like a straight Mrs. Robinson shot between my legs of like if

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.640
you see the boss peeing and you just like

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:55.080
does he know that it's not supposed to be that color because I had to learn like

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:59.040
they got to respect you less I don't understand I don't want to worry about

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.320
me yeah well I don't respect me less it's like oh shit harmony who examines

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:10.440
the neighbor P yeah you flush I think it might catch your eye against white

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:15.760
porcelain it's like it's the wrong color entirely if it's just like flushless no

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:22.240
it's like you're walking traffic behind me you can see between my legs and you

01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:25.600
see like it's like I think the color would catch your eye and you'd be like

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:31.600
god damn I get that dude loves Amstel why that'd be weird like like still like

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.600
that's what I just don't want them like talking to the in the in the non-brake

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.840
room and being like like dude that guy needs to like hydrate well what if you

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:48.000
close your legs so there's no gap in there you know yeah that'll make it

01:45:48.000 --> 01:46:01.560
easier to pee that's what I do do that it's so luxurious to sit while peeing

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.840
holy shit at home I'm gonna sit down here like I've been standing all day

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:12.000
motherfucker and that was really brave because I'm tall and it eliminates my

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.520
penis is too small for sit-down peeing to be enjoyable so what well Jeff I didn't

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.000
hear you come again my penis is too small for sit-down peeing to be like a

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:30.680
vacation from stand-up pain like I it's it's like it's not like I'm like oh I

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:35.360
hate sit-down peeing it's just like when you have a smaller like grower not a

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:38.720
shower and it's like it's like I'll it's like tucked between your legs and it's

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:44.600
like is it like it's kind of like it it's it doesn't it's not unless for some

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:48.920
reason you'd be like semi-toumessen it's not necessarily pointed straight down at

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.880
the water it can be like too much pointing 45 degrees right at the crack of

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.080
the between the seat and the thing so like there have been times when I've

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.200

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.760

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.000
on your podcast no one with no no no true man will understand Jeff has the

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:34.080
problem his dick like falls into the water yeah which is a big deal might be a

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:47.480
worse problem it's gross yeah I'm the one with the UTI you should you should

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.360
you should have banana peels in that shit I should I should be the safest

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:56.520
that should be my only advantage Darwinian like I do it dick wears a suit I

01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:13.800
have a fucking like my dick for right a check that your ass can't take cakes like

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:19.920
erotic cakes thank you come on man all right well there's only you know there

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.080
was a there was a there was a D&D recap but yeah well we should hold it until we

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.720
actually play cuz then it'll be like relevant you know I cut a recap in in

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:35.080
audio oh boy it'll be so fun when we use it one of these days what do you mean

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:39.440
you have an audio recap that you'll play for us so traditionally Jeff plays a

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:44.640
music and I go like last time on Harmon Time or whatever the fuck and then I

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:50.560
like explain stuff so instead I cut it out of audio so instead of me explaining

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.360
it Dan's like what are we doing and Jeff's like I think we should do the

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:58.720
thing and Steve's like I don't know you guys and I'm like goblin jumps out and

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.040
so like you know maybe it's more like a TV recap or something that's only given

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:06.840
you relevant bits rather than me just like coming up with it on fly I mean I'm

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:09.960
good at that too how do we how do we physically do that here in the space

book about when I was in Milwaukee I smoked a lot of pot I just it's the

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:09.720
time has gone I think you should do some young adult crime stuff I think you

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:13.560

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:17.600
great story we can all write these we can all write books now oh yeah and like

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:21.840
