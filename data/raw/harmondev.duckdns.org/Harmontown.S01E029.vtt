WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
All right, let's start this bitch kitty

00:13.680 --> 00:17.600
The bell house deep in the heart of beautiful Guaranis, New York

00:20.160 --> 00:23.720
Hello Brooklyn, you beautiful beautiful bunch of weirdos

00:23.720 --> 00:30.440
I have some exceedingly good news for you. Harmontown is now in session

00:30.440 --> 00:44.920
Please welcome the mayor of Harmontown to the stage mr. Dan Harmon

00:44.920 --> 00:50.920
Oh

00:55.640 --> 00:57.640
All right, okay

01:00.760 --> 01:02.760
All right

01:04.120 --> 01:06.120
Holy shit, thank you

01:06.120 --> 01:16.520
Thank you very much from the bottom of my of my heart. Holy crap. Thank you and and and really thank Jesus Christ and

01:17.080 --> 01:22.200
God above. What have I done to deserve this? There's a there's a sea of humanity out here

01:25.720 --> 01:27.720
All I can do is fuck it up. That's it

01:28.200 --> 01:31.480
That's the prayer. This is the coolest room. I'll ever be in it's uh

01:31.480 --> 01:36.360
I even before you guys filled it with your your coolness just that when this room was empty

01:36.360 --> 01:39.400
I got a little intimidated this room feels very much like

01:40.200 --> 01:42.520
Like like the pixies must have played here at some point

01:43.640 --> 01:45.640
So much heroin must have been done here

01:46.440 --> 01:49.000
Daniel Day-Lewis probably got a hand job. It was at some point

01:49.880 --> 01:52.840
I just during some Scorsese film

01:54.280 --> 01:58.600
If Harmontown had a dream venue, it would be this room for you listening

01:58.600 --> 02:06.120
For you listening at home, it's it looks like a town hall like it's it's got this wooden stage

02:06.120 --> 02:11.160
Jeff's podium was like was was was was was was sanded out of Abe Lincoln's

02:12.520 --> 02:14.520
casket

02:16.120 --> 02:18.120
There's still a top hat in the in a drawer

02:19.480 --> 02:21.480
I feel like I should stand and have a bible up here

02:21.480 --> 02:27.960
That's what Lincoln wore right a tap hat who was he was known as the fancy president. Uh, yeah, uh

02:28.680 --> 02:31.320
Boy, it's great to get yes stovetop stovetop. Thank you

02:32.120 --> 02:37.240
So somebody's bothered to yell out a correction on the type of type of a hat that Abe Lincoln wears

02:38.280 --> 02:42.200
Uh, and now the audience is cheering that person for correcting the Abe Lincoln

02:42.200 --> 02:46.120
Yeah, but for those of those of you who've listened to the podcast especially on our tour

02:46.360 --> 02:49.880
People popping off from the audience is a huge staple of our diet up here

02:49.880 --> 02:55.400
Well, let's let's let's not springer them. You know, that's a let's not wind them up

02:56.040 --> 02:59.400
Yes, it's true. Jeff that eventually people do tend to get riled up and

03:00.040 --> 03:03.800
And yell things out, but uh, we can't let's go to shut the fuck up

03:05.240 --> 03:10.840
All right, I will come out there and I will beat the fuck out of you. I'm not intimidated by this city

03:14.440 --> 03:18.040
Fuck you too can't understand you can't hear you

03:18.040 --> 03:22.280
I don't care. It's Spike Lee shot stuff here

03:23.080 --> 03:25.080
Doesn't matter to me. Yeah

03:25.480 --> 03:31.960
That was my fault. I uh, I I I rubbed the lamp too too soon. I don't want to tell anybody have a paternity test that's unresolved

03:33.000 --> 03:39.160
Just pop up here. Anybody not know who who what's going on in their life. Just just just wander up. It's brooklyn. Jeff

03:39.160 --> 03:41.160
We could get stabbed

03:41.720 --> 03:44.280
No, you carry with that. Yeah, that's the that's the hip fat

03:44.280 --> 03:49.080
That's the thing about new york versus la like you look like like when I live in la I lay in bed and I

03:49.480 --> 03:52.040
Move my arms. I don't I don't touch another person from la

03:53.560 --> 03:59.880
Like like we we live a less insectoid kind of like like like like colonial kind of existence out there

03:59.880 --> 04:06.920
It's more it's more kind of lazy and sandboxy and uh, my friend dino lived in new york for 10 years and

04:08.280 --> 04:10.280
He's not coming out

04:10.280 --> 04:14.280
Uh, but but but I think he put it best. He said like when you live in new york

04:14.360 --> 04:18.840
Like the coolest thing about it is that you live in new york and it kind of like you go to you go to bed at the end of

04:18.840 --> 04:22.680
The day and you can build a whole personality off the fact that you survived living in new york

04:23.400 --> 04:27.480
Uh, you you're not able to do that in la like no one gives a fuck about you in la no

04:27.480 --> 04:29.560
You're never in anyone's way every time I come to new york

04:29.560 --> 04:34.920
I get instantly intimidated from the moment you step out of the airport like and you forget that you don't have the right

04:34.920 --> 04:36.920
Away as a pedestrian

04:36.920 --> 04:41.720
It's just immediately everyone's all too happy to remind you they will they will fucking run your ass over

04:41.800 --> 04:46.600
It's also the only town like at least in the in the in the u. In the u.s. I think that like I walked

04:47.400 --> 04:49.640
I went into soho today as we're staying here in brooklyn

04:49.640 --> 04:53.960
But I subbed into a subway into soho and I was just wearing like jeans and like a big parka

04:53.960 --> 04:58.760
Like what I what I wore on the tour bus and I was the most underdressed dude in that town man

04:59.400 --> 05:05.800
Everybody's just got perfect hair and they got the kick-ass coat and a big-ass scarf for some reason. They're all fancy here

05:05.800 --> 05:07.080
Yeah

05:07.080 --> 05:11.400
Everyone's fancy nobody nobody says nobody says I'm weird for wearing a suit in this town is amazing

05:11.400 --> 05:16.840
You can wear you can wear a suit in new york. It is a little nice other since where I'm not throwing the south under the bus

05:16.840 --> 05:20.120
But it will be nice to not spend a night talking about the fucking civil war

05:24.280 --> 05:27.160
Holy shit, man, I am exhausted

05:28.040 --> 05:30.040
Every city I wikipedia

05:30.120 --> 05:33.320
Like I wikipedia brooklyn it was like george washington farted here and then

05:33.320 --> 05:37.400
You know, they built a bridge brooklyn bridge. Jeff. Did you know brooklyn bridge?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.920
First bridge between two who gives a shit? It's

05:41.800 --> 05:43.800
It's brooklyn. It's it's

05:43.800 --> 05:49.480
It's it's this is this is the history right now. You got you for me all I care about is it neil diamond

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah, he's coming out tonight you guys

05:53.560 --> 05:55.800
You know what let's bring him out neil diamond

05:57.320 --> 05:59.320
What if he did

05:59.560 --> 06:01.320
What if god damn it

06:01.320 --> 06:06.920
Um, uh, yeah, it's the biggest of the five boroughs. Jeff. I think you know, you know the other the boroughs. It's, uh, uh, uh,

06:07.480 --> 06:09.480
Manhattan, uh, chel- chelsea

06:10.840 --> 06:14.680
Uh, uh, um, uh, pe- pe- pe- pe- pe- pe- pe- peat rows

06:16.520 --> 06:18.520
But broadway and, uh

06:19.720 --> 06:23.480
Times Square and then but then brooklyn is the biggest of all of them

06:24.120 --> 06:25.880
Uh

06:25.880 --> 06:27.000
I

06:27.000 --> 06:28.520
Like the wrappers they tire

06:28.520 --> 06:30.920
I heard a guy rapping about how each of the burrows

06:30.920 --> 06:32.600
was like one of the fingers on his hands

06:32.600 --> 06:34.440
that he used to sling rock with.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.800
I thought that was really cool.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.960
That's why I get really jealous in New York.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.080
There's so much fucking culture.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.640
Like five burrows, oh, there's five fingers and a fist

06:42.640 --> 06:44.600
and you sling rock with that hand.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
And he's just like fucking, oh, the queens

06:47.600 --> 06:49.760
is my middle finger, fuck you motherfucker.

06:49.760 --> 06:52.160
And like, it was such a badass rap.

06:52.160 --> 06:59.200
Like, I was looking forward to seeing some black people.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.840
I'm scanning the crowd.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.280
But honestly, in Los Angeles, we don't really.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.240
You got something back there?

07:04.240 --> 07:05.600
OK.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.680
OK, we got some black people.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.160
OK, all right.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.080
And when we say some, we mean two women.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.360
That's it.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.880
There are two black women.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.600
All right, all right, let's get it.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.880
Who do we got back there?

07:16.880 --> 07:19.840
And any of our resident black people

07:19.840 --> 07:22.680
want to come up and just for a quick interview?

07:22.680 --> 07:24.360
That's it.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.760
Yeah, just as a change of pace.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.240
I just want to see you give you a hug.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.000
And like, I've been in the South.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.800
But honestly, it's like, all right, we're coming.

07:34.800 --> 07:35.280
We're coming.

07:35.280 --> 07:55.560
Do you need help up?

07:55.560 --> 07:58.880
Smooth black people are the way of the world.

07:58.880 --> 08:03.680
I've got black people, black girl coming up on the stage.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.400
It makes me feel so cool.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.200
Got a black person going to jump in the black pool.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.720
Find out what it's like to be black.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.880
I don't want to have a hunky heart attack.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.200
I want a black lady to give me some style,

08:18.200 --> 08:22.160
going to go from the West to the Egyptian Nile.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.360
That's where black people started.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.840
Egypt.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.400
Neu, neu, neu, neu.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.800
Neu, neu, neu, neu, neu, neu, neu.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.960
Funky, funky, jing-tut black people.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.960
Neu, neu, neu, neu, neu, neu, neu, neu.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.600
I don't know.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.800
I don't know.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.120
Sorry.

08:44.120 --> 08:44.600
Thank you.

08:48.080 --> 08:48.600
It was a part.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
You had all the power there.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.800
You could have just given that a thumbs down and walked away.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.040
I wanted the support.

08:53.040 --> 08:53.760
What's your name?

08:53.760 --> 08:54.280
Maya.

08:54.280 --> 08:54.840
Maya?

08:54.840 --> 08:55.600
Oh, nice.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
Black lady name.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.480
Maya.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.640
I'm telling you, I'm just going through withdrawal.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.320
Blacks again.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.280
Blacks again.

09:02.280 --> 09:02.920
Blacks again?

09:02.920 --> 09:05.920
Oh, so you're doing the whole American melting thing.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.400
You got a line up here.

09:07.400 --> 09:07.900
Yeah.

09:07.900 --> 09:08.400
Good.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.320
Yeah, this is one-stop shopping.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.160
Are you from Brooklyn, Maya?

09:13.160 --> 09:14.520
I'm from Nashville, Tennessee.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.000
Whoa!

09:18.000 --> 09:18.720
Where were you?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.720
So I'm going to talk to you about the Civil War.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.240
You didn't escape it.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.000
Who won?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.160
I can't even, I don't know.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.440
We came back from there, and I think the answer is pretty quick.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.880
We're still trying to figure that one out.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.720
It was weird down there to just like, it's more of a joke.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.480
You can make more of a joke about racism up here.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.920
I think not because we're heroes, because we weren't involved.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.040
Like, Brooklyn's role in the Civil War

09:46.040 --> 09:47.920
was that they were getting high and eating sandwiches,

09:47.920 --> 09:49.840
and they said, you know what, slavery should be illegal.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.160
And then, like, meanwhile, down there,

09:52.160 --> 09:55.280
like, everyone's dying and shit's happening.

09:55.280 --> 09:59.120
My clothes are more expensive for some reason.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.680
New York had it pretty hard with the racial rights,

10:01.680 --> 10:03.960
the draft rights, and stuff like that.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.880
Gangs in New York, that movie, Si.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.400
I like that they would just do a shot walking down

10:09.400 --> 10:11.880
the five points, and there'd be nobody on the streets.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.120
That really sparsely populated area.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.920
Well, they cleared the streets because the gangs

10:16.920 --> 10:17.720
were going to have a fight.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.480
I thought it was a, I don't know,

10:19.480 --> 10:21.480
Scorsese can't really do any wrong by me.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.400
Martin Scorsese's here.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.160
Let's have a hand for him.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.800
He's not here.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.880
Who's that there's a chair down in front that says reserved,

10:28.880 --> 10:29.720
and it's empty.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.680
Who's this asshole?

10:30.680 --> 10:31.520
That's,

10:31.520 --> 10:32.840
I don't know, Eddie Geller.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.360
Eddie Geller.

10:34.360 --> 10:38.880
Oh, here, I don't need a seat reserved for me.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.360
I'm coming.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.720
Oh, that's Eddie Better, sorry.

10:41.720 --> 10:47.160
Yeah, he got the, maybe he saw where his seat was

10:47.160 --> 10:48.000
and goes, fuck that.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.120
Save my seat.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.440
Gonna have you, have you, have you, have you.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.280
Oh, shit.

10:55.280 --> 11:03.680
Oh, boy, we fucking Beatles used him.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.320
Were you, were you just ordering a drink and back

11:05.320 --> 11:06.320
or did you just get here?

11:06.320 --> 11:08.000
I didn't realize there was a seat for me.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.720
Oh, did your friend say, wait here,

11:11.720 --> 11:15.040
let's, let's get him on mic.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.360
I'm not able to talk at the same time.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.440
I'm sorry, Maya, I'm sorry.

11:17.440 --> 11:19.400
Maya, stick around for a second.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.400
I forgot you were there.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.120
We're used to being the backdrop.

11:22.120 --> 11:26.880
It's, it's okay for her to play that card.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.040
I brought her up literally as the black lady.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.600
She gets to say whatever she, she gets to,

11:33.600 --> 11:38.560
she gets all the power, Eddie, Eddie Better,

11:38.560 --> 11:39.720
what's your name?

11:39.720 --> 11:40.560
Eddie Geller.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.360
Eddie Geller.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.240
Thanks for coming.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.080
Thank you for having me.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.200
Can I get you anything dot, dot, dot a watch?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.320
It's a standard, standard comedian thing.

11:50.320 --> 11:57.360
Yeah, Eddie, Eddie, what are you most afraid of?

11:57.360 --> 12:00.120
Being a failure.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.080
I would have said spiders.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.920
These spiders, you just, you're just a badass with spiders.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.800
I'm okay with spiders.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.960
I hate snakes though.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.160
Okay, snakes and being a failure.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.680
Maya, let's do a scene from Eddie Geller's early childhood.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.760
Let's, let's, let's, do you have any theatrical background?

12:17.760 --> 12:19.640
Do you, do you think you can hold your own?

12:19.640 --> 12:20.920
12 years old summer camp.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.600
Okay, so 12 year old, sorry.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.280
All right, so I'll be, I'll be 10 year old Eddie Geller.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.560
And we're going to do the scene where he learned to be afraid

12:27.560 --> 12:28.760
of snakes and failure.

12:37.760 --> 12:42.560
Mommy, why are you so much more ethnic than me?

12:42.560 --> 12:50.200
It was the immaculate conception again.

12:50.200 --> 12:56.880
I, I never knew my dad, but I just wanted you to know that I love you.

12:56.880 --> 13:02.800
Today's my first day of school.

13:02.800 --> 13:10.960
Do you want to give me a pencil or like any clothes?

13:10.960 --> 13:14.400
No.

13:14.400 --> 13:18.080
But wait.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.560
No.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.560
Snakes.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
Snakes.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.560
No.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.560
Well, that explains everything.

13:25.560 --> 13:37.800
I, I guess, I guess that, I guess that makes sense.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.960
I guess it's okay for you to leave a gaping seat open in the front of the

13:41.960 --> 13:45.760
totally phase me out, my first show in Brooklyn.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.880
All right, Maya, what's your biggest ambition?

13:49.880 --> 13:51.040
What's your biggest dream?

13:51.040 --> 13:54.800
Well, that puts you on the spot, doesn't it?

13:54.800 --> 13:55.800
It happened.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.240
Oh, you've, you, you're like me.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
You've lived your dreams.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
Yeah.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.400
Like I turned 40 and I got, I got to do a tour and play in this hip

14:02.400 --> 14:03.400
room in Brooklyn.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.400
I'm just making up shit to do before I get hit by a car.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.640
Like I already had a TV show.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.640
I didn't deserve that.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.640
I got fired from it.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.640
They finally caught up to it.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.640
No, I wasn't fishing for that.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.640
I wasn't fishing for that.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.640
Stop it.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.640
It's not what I.

14:14.640 --> 14:26.760
Mommy, why did NBC fire me?

14:26.760 --> 14:28.440
Because they have no sense.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.440
Thank you, mommy.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.640
Snakes.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.520
We're not so different, Eddie Geller.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.520
I'm your shadow father.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
Okay.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.080
Well, so, so, so Maya, like, well, I don't know.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.400
So you, you, you, you really mean that you feel, you feel pretty

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
self-actualized?

14:46.400 --> 14:47.400
Uh, self-actualized.

14:47.400 --> 14:52.040
I mean, I live in Brooklyn and I'm a writer.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
How self-actual.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
Yeah.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.040
Can't get better than that.

14:55.040 --> 14:59.640
I, I, I, I, if I ever thought I was truly successful, I would move to New York and try

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
to be a writer here.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.640
Because that's the real, the real writer thing.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
Yeah.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.640
I don't understand why you're not here.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.640
Shut the fuck up.

15:07.640 --> 15:14.640
Is that real enough for you?

15:14.640 --> 15:19.120
I just mind doing a bunch of heroin and jerking off on them.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.120
All in one motion?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.120
Uh, yeah.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.200
That's, that's, when, when I feel like I have that maneuvered down, I'll move to New

15:25.200 --> 15:26.200
York.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.960
Uh, I'll start with a nice little place in Queens and I'll, I'll, I'll just jerk off

15:30.960 --> 15:34.640
for a while and then I'll, and then I'll add heroin to it.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.640
Like a.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
All in one motion.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.640
So what, what kind of stuff do you write?

15:38.640 --> 15:41.640
Uh, I write a lot of lies.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.000
So fiction, but I'm working on a screenplay.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
What kind of fiction?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.640
Um, long fiction, but I'm working on a screenplay.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.640
Oh, long fiction, working on a screenplay.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.640
Who is it working on a screenplay?

15:50.640 --> 15:51.640
Anybody else?

15:51.640 --> 15:57.640
That, that, that would be everybody in LA.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.440
That's night, that's another nice thing about New York is that there's lots of creativity

16:00.440 --> 16:01.440
happening here.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.480
There are a couple of people lifting things for a living and that, like, like someone has

16:05.480 --> 16:09.840
to, like, that's, that's the nice, like it's a real city that you feel like isn't, like,

16:09.840 --> 16:13.560
like if Spielberg, uh, moves, it won't fall apart immediately.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.600
Like, I was really like, you walk down the street in Los Angeles and you're like, what's

16:16.600 --> 16:22.440
going to happen if he decides to go to Vermont like, like, uh, for, for more than a summer?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
Spielberg lives.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.440
Spielberg lives everywhere, my friends.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.440
Spielberg is here.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.440
Let's bring him out.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.440
He's not here.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.440
Sorry.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.440
Yeah, I know.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.440
I'm sorry.

16:35.440 --> 16:40.440
Well, well, you know, maybe, maybe if, uh, maybe if you pray real hard, it'll come out.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.440
I don't know.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.440
How does it, how does movies work?

16:42.440 --> 16:43.440
Like you clap your hands or something.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.440
Swirling violence.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.440
Yeah, yeah.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
And things happen.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.440
Yeah.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.440
If we get a crane in here and like make a big enough shot, like he'll come out.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.440
Um, all right.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.440
Well, so you're, you're, uh, can I, can I give you any help writing your screenplay?

16:55.440 --> 16:57.440
Are you stuck on any part?

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
Um, I'm like an expert.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.440
You're an expert.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
Thank you, baby.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.440
Monster house fans.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.440
The house is a monster.

17:06.440 --> 17:11.440
I don't know how I come up with this shit.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.440
Houses aren't supposed to be monsters.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.440
You're supposed to live in those motherfuckers.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
What if they ate you?

17:18.440 --> 17:20.440
It's Rob Schrab's idea.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.440
Oh, where can you help me?

17:23.440 --> 17:25.440
Where can you help me?

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
How should it end?

17:26.440 --> 17:27.440
All right.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.440
Good.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.440
I'm glad you asked.

17:29.440 --> 17:34.440
Can you tell me a little bit what it's about so that I can?

17:34.440 --> 17:40.440
Uh, it is about a woman who was born with the voice of a man.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.440
This sounds like a terrible idea.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
No, I'm kidding.

17:43.440 --> 17:44.440
I'm kidding.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.440
It's a stupid, cheap joke.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.440
Whatever she said.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.440
I'm going to send that.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.440
A woman with the voice of a man, like literally physically, like she, when she speaks, she

17:51.440 --> 17:52.440
sounds like a dude.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
Sounds like a metaphor for like.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.440
Oh, it's no metaphor.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.440
Okay.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.440
Is it based on a friend of yours?

17:58.440 --> 17:59.440
Yes.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.440
Oh, okay.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.440
So she just has a lower register voice.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.440
She sounds like a straight up dude.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.440
Oh, okay.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.440
Like this.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.440
And so, all right, so.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.440
The most beautiful woman you've ever seen.

18:08.440 --> 18:09.440
All right.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.440
So does she cross a threshold of starting to sound like a dude?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.440
No, there's no threshold.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.440
So it's like fade in on a woman that sounds like a guy.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.440
And then like.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.440
Fade in.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.440
Right.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.440
So then what happens?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.440
Like what separates the Peter Weller from the Robocop?

18:24.440 --> 18:28.440
Like what's the, what's the, what's the threshold?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.440
I'm a very pedantic screenwriter.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.440
Like I'm very structured.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.440
Like so we have to cross like when does Jaws roll into Amity?

18:35.440 --> 18:39.440
When does, you know, what's the yellow brick road that we start going down?

18:39.440 --> 18:41.440
Like what's the point where we realize?

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
Oh shit.

18:42.440 --> 18:48.440
She sounds like a guy, but now she's got to work as a telemarketer and all female.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.440
She does Gillette commercials.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.440
Gillette commercials.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.440
And like selling rates, so it's like a reverse tootsie.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.440
Yes.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.440
Okay.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.440
She gets a job.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.440
That's how we're selling it is reverse tootsie.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.440
That's how anything good thing should be sold.

19:01.440 --> 19:07.440
I thought our reverse tootsie is when you poop on somebody's chest.

19:07.440 --> 19:10.440
You can get a reverse tootsie in Brooklyn for $40.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
Same as in town.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.440
Can you demonstrate what that is as well?

19:14.440 --> 19:15.440
Yeah.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.440
Yeah.

19:16.440 --> 19:20.440
For those of you listening at home, I'm putting my ankle above my neck.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.440
And my hand is reaching down.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.440
I'm putting my middle finger up my asshole.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.440
Yeah.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.440
Holy shit.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.440
And now if I could just reach my...

19:29.440 --> 19:30.440
Yeah.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.440
Yeah.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
Reverse tootsie.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.440
All right.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.440
Enjoy that in Nashville.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.440
All right.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.440
You've never added in Nashville.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.440
All right.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.440
So how should it end?

19:42.440 --> 19:43.440
Okay.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.440
Well, I assume it should end with...

19:44.440 --> 19:45.440
Okay.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.440
So I'm assuming like she...

19:46.440 --> 19:47.440
Okay.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.440
She talks like a guy.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.440
She sounds like a guy.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.440
She goes down a road of trials and she meets with some goddess, blah, blah, blah.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
I'm not...

19:53.440 --> 19:54.440
All right.

19:54.440 --> 19:59.440
So she's happy at a certain point that she does sound like a guy or either that.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.440
If it faded in on her sounding like a guy, the threshold might be her starting to sound

20:03.440 --> 20:06.440
like a woman successfully, at which point at the midpoint she...

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
Hold on a second.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.440
Are you taking notes?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.440
All right.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.440
So...

20:10.440 --> 20:12.440
Have you already written this movie?

20:12.440 --> 20:13.440
Yeah.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.440
All right.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
She's good.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.440
She just needs an ending.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.440
She needs an ending.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.440
Okay.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.440
That's a clue.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.440
You know how they had the three endings.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.440
All right.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.440
All right.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.440
I have to workshop it from the beginning.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.440
I have to like feel it.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.440
I have to run my hands over the story.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.440
So Jeff, can you help me?

20:30.440 --> 20:32.440
Maya, can we thank Maya and then we'll...

20:32.440 --> 20:33.440
Maya.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.440
We're going to give her her ending.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.440
Thank you, Maya.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.440
Thank you.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.440
Thank you.

20:39.440 --> 20:46.440
On behalf of all white men, thank you for being a black woman.

20:46.440 --> 20:51.440
Beautiful, beautiful, wonderful, noble black woman.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.440
Blacksikin.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.440
Blacksikin.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
Let's not get...

20:54.440 --> 20:55.440
Let's not get...

20:55.440 --> 20:58.440
I mean, when we get down to that, like, I'm probably eight things.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.440
Let's keep things binary.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.440
That's how I'm comfortable.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
You're either one race or another.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.440
God damn it.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.440
Which I demand it.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.440
All right.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.440
Okay.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.440
So fade in, Jeff.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.440
The woman who sounded like a guy.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.440
Okay.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.440
What age do we start her at?

21:21.440 --> 21:22.440
I think we just fade in.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
She's 30 years old.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.440
She's doing her PowerPoint presentation for her ad firm.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.440
Okay.

21:28.440 --> 21:35.440
And furthermore, ad sales will go up if we use our ad firm to sell ads.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.440
It seems like a simplistic idea,

21:38.440 --> 21:40.440
but sometimes the thing that's most obvious

21:40.440 --> 21:43.440
is the thing that you need to do first.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.440
My name's...

21:44.440 --> 21:49.440
I have to interrupt Mrs. Temaris.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.440
Yes, Glenn?

21:51.440 --> 21:55.440
As a powerful, white, icky male,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.440
I'm having a hard time listening to you,

21:57.440 --> 22:00.440
staring at your perfect tits and ass,

22:00.440 --> 22:04.440
and combining that with the incredibly dulcet masculine voice

22:04.440 --> 22:06.440
that you've been laying down.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.440
Cut to just the title card,

22:09.440 --> 22:10.440
but there's no music,

22:10.440 --> 22:12.440
because this is a beautiful independent film

22:12.440 --> 22:13.440
that's going to win an Oscar.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.440
So it just says, like, dude voice.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.440
And then she's on an airplane.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.440
Ladies and gentlemen, your captain

22:23.440 --> 22:25.440
has been landing in Los Angeles.

22:25.440 --> 22:32.440
Just keep your eyes on the window and saying captain stuff.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.440
So, you hear business for pleasure.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.440
I've been noticing you throughout the flight.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.440
I'm a little shy.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.440
Yeah, I'm married, but we're getting separated.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.440
I just didn't want this whole flight to go by

22:43.440 --> 22:45.440
and not connect with your user.

22:45.440 --> 22:49.440
Incredibly beautiful, fragile, wonderful...

22:49.440 --> 22:51.440
Thank you.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.440
Sorry, is something wrong with your voice?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.440
Oh, laryngitis.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.440
Really?

22:56.440 --> 22:58.440
You know, I can give you something for that.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.440
Sorry, the captain's saying something for me.

23:07.440 --> 23:11.440
Ladies and gentlemen, your penis.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.440
That's aeronautic talk for the Grand Canyon.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.440
We just flew over it.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
We're on our way to Los Angeles.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.440
Oh, thank you for flagging.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.440
You know, I'm also...

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
I'm getting separated.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.440
My wife didn't like the fact that what I do for a living

23:28.440 --> 23:30.440
is I make the world's most delicious soothing

23:30.440 --> 23:32.440
and restorative chicken soup.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
If you want to come back to my place,

23:34.440 --> 23:36.440
I'll give you some chicken soup

23:36.440 --> 23:38.440
and then I can hear you talk.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.440
My name is Jessica.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.440
Oh, Jesus Christ!

23:46.440 --> 23:48.440
He pooped his pants.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.440
All right, well, that's the crossing of the...

23:50.440 --> 23:52.440
Well, that's not the crossing of the threshold.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.440
That's the call to adventure, and we'll pick up...

23:54.440 --> 23:56.440
We need to do, like, another...

23:56.440 --> 23:58.440
We'll do another chapter of that in a little bit.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.440
I don't want to get bogged down with that.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.440
Oh, yeah, that story's got legs.

24:02.440 --> 24:07.440
I think a Billy Crystal or Robin Williams

24:07.440 --> 24:09.440
might end up playing a magical shopkeeper

24:09.440 --> 24:11.440
in that movie.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.440
I think something's going to happen on page 17

24:13.440 --> 24:16.440
that's going to make that thing break wide.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.440
Can we bring a special guest to the stage?

24:20.440 --> 24:22.440
Neil Diamond, everybody.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.440
If you could pick, Dan...

24:28.440 --> 24:30.440
Hang on, let me queue up some...

24:30.440 --> 24:32.440
There's plenty of music for this.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.440
If you could pick anybody to bring up on the stage.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.440
Anybody in the whole city of New York.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.440
Out of all the people.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.440
Maybe somebody like that is a perfect mixture of somebody

24:41.440 --> 24:44.440
that's from here, is a funny person,

24:44.440 --> 24:46.440
and that we've known from our humble beginnings

24:46.440 --> 24:49.440
doing terrible improv just like that.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.440
Ladies and gentlemen, Jason Sudeikis is here.

24:53.440 --> 24:58.440
Is our friend Jason Sudeikis...

25:04.440 --> 25:06.440
I think you guys thought I was kidding.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.440
No, you can...

25:19.440 --> 25:21.440
Any way that you're comfortable,

25:21.440 --> 25:23.440
you can sit in a chair,

25:23.440 --> 25:25.440
you can stand behind the mic.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.440
Anything you want, man.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.440
Anything you want.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.440
Alright, let's do it.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.440
Let's hear about your wife and kids

25:33.440 --> 25:35.440
and trips to the dentist.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.440
Friends from the neighborhood!

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
No idea what to talk to you about

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
or do with you, but I thought it was cool

25:41.440 --> 25:43.440
that we were in town.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.440
We've never had anything before.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.440
We just go and drink.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
Does anyone but us call you Suds?

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
No, Suds is the longest-lasting.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.440
Cool.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.440
Yes, a lot of people do.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.440
Oh, okay.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.440
I don't know what to...

25:59.440 --> 26:01.440
No, it's not an original nickname.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.440
But it's been the long...

26:03.440 --> 26:05.440
It's a good one. It's the best one.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.440
Tell us something criminal

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
about Lord Michael.

26:09.440 --> 26:13.440
Something that would get you in a huge amount of trouble.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.440
Something that would make him seem

26:15.440 --> 26:17.440
like a giant asshole and get him

26:17.440 --> 26:19.440
in all kinds of legal trouble

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
and destroy and scandalize.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.440
Something that would be in TMZ tomorrow

26:23.440 --> 26:25.440
if you said it.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
Something horrible

26:27.440 --> 26:29.440
that would profit you nothing and cost you everything.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.440
Yeah.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.440
Oh, boy. Just one?

26:37.440 --> 26:39.440
Just one?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.440
Gosh, I guess it would be

26:41.440 --> 26:43.440
that he...

26:43.440 --> 26:45.440
you know...

26:45.440 --> 26:47.440
I'm going to answer this, honestly.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.440
We'll edit it out.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.440
He, you know...

26:53.440 --> 26:55.440
Sandusky took the fall for him.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.440
They knew each other from Toronto

27:03.440 --> 27:05.440
and they like...

27:05.440 --> 27:07.440
And he just...

27:07.440 --> 27:09.440
It's like the guy that took the hit

27:09.440 --> 27:11.440
and never snitched for Jay-Z.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
It's a very similar...

27:13.440 --> 27:15.440
I forget the guy's name.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.440
He's referencing that song, Klick.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.440
Yeah.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.440
Sandusky was like,

27:21.440 --> 27:23.440
and Lorne was like,

27:23.440 --> 27:25.440
you know, thanks, chair.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.440
What are the five...

27:27.440 --> 27:29.440
And that's just through reading emails,

27:29.440 --> 27:31.440
sifting through his emails when he's away from the...

27:31.440 --> 27:33.440
I mean, that's not...

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
I haven't seen him do anything with kids, right?

27:37.440 --> 27:39.440
Well, I was actually...

27:39.440 --> 27:41.440
I meant the recruiting violations.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.440
That's fine.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.440
It's all...

27:45.440 --> 27:47.440
Honestly, he's the best thing

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
for him at this point.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.440
Okay, what are the burrows?

27:51.440 --> 27:53.440
Because I want to do some...

27:53.440 --> 27:55.440
If and when I rap tonight, I want to be like that one guy

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
that I heard in that one rap

27:57.440 --> 27:59.440
where he was going, I got Queens in my hand

27:59.440 --> 28:01.440
and I got Brooklyn on my thumb

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
and I got...

28:03.440 --> 28:05.440
We got Bronx, Staten Island, Queens,

28:05.440 --> 28:07.440
New Jersey, Manhattan.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
Someone slipped New Jersey in there?

28:09.440 --> 28:11.440
Yeah.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
There's crafty sons of bitches.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.440
They snuck it in.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.440
Oh, come on.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.440
Hey, was it...

28:19.440 --> 28:21.440
I believe Brooklyn was its own city

28:21.440 --> 28:23.440
until like 1898

28:23.440 --> 28:25.440
when it was annexed by New York.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.440
So isn't New Jersey kind of a...

28:27.440 --> 28:29.440
Maybe you're jealous that they never succumbed

28:29.440 --> 28:31.440
to an annexation.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
I don't know.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.440
Why don't you marry New York

28:35.440 --> 28:37.440
if you like being annexed so much?

28:37.440 --> 28:39.440
I don't know.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.440
Maybe New Jersey's

28:41.440 --> 28:43.440
like a little something to look up to.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.440
They're proud, they're independent.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.440
I think...

28:47.440 --> 28:49.440
No.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.440
Who's...

28:51.440 --> 28:53.440
How many people are from New Jersey right here?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.440
What would you do without these people?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.440
I think it's weird that

29:01.440 --> 29:03.440
there's half the people from New Jersey screaming,

29:03.440 --> 29:05.440
the other half just raised their hand.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.440
That's what I wouldn't have anticipated

29:07.440 --> 29:09.440
based on the television programs.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.440
I thought it would have been this.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.440
Yeah.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.440
They need professors too in New Jersey.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.440
I don't understand

29:17.440 --> 29:19.440
this New Jersey class system,

29:19.440 --> 29:21.440
like this whole thing.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.440
I'm from Wisconsin and then I lived in Los Angeles.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.440
So I don't understand the whole

29:25.440 --> 29:27.440
New Jersey thing,

29:27.440 --> 29:29.440
like the take a dump on New Jersey.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.440
What did they do?

29:31.440 --> 29:33.440
Can you tell me as a New Yorker?

29:33.440 --> 29:35.440
I live in Kansas City.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
By way.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.440
I don't know. I guess it's kind of like,

29:39.440 --> 29:41.440
no, I have no idea.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.440
You're right here.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.440
Do we have a New Jersey person?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
We have a New Jersey hater.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.440
Come up.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.440
What's your name?

29:51.440 --> 29:53.440
I'm Noah.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.440
Noah.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.440
Let's not boo people.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.440
Let's not treat him like he's from New Jersey.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.440
All right, Noah.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.440
What's the New York,

30:03.440 --> 30:05.440
what's the justification for the New Jersey hatred?

30:05.440 --> 30:07.440
Well, New Jersey basically

30:07.440 --> 30:09.440
takes all the shitty stuff

30:09.440 --> 30:11.440
that New York needs and just takes it

30:11.440 --> 30:13.440
and puts it in their state.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.440
And so I guess I'm thankful for that,

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
but at the same time, whenever I go there,

30:17.440 --> 30:19.440
it smells really, really bad.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.440
All right. I don't know.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.440
As a Los Angeles,

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
whole city around you,

30:25.440 --> 30:27.440
not known for its bouquet.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
Uh...

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
So, all right.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.440
I guess it's...

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
I'm not going to solve this problem.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.440
I thought I would come here and I could heal people.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
You only have theory over here.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
All right, ma'am, come on up.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.440
It would be nice if you were black, but come on up.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.440
Okay, she's Jewish, close enough.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
White black, white black.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.440
What's your name?

30:51.440 --> 30:53.440
Okay, Lisa, do you know Noah?

30:53.440 --> 30:55.440
Oh God, Noah disappeared.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.440
Noah turned into a cup of beer.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.440
More like Goa.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.440
That's kind of, no, that's nice.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.440
We applaud that behavior.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.440
Noah dismissed himself and took his seat.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.440
People from Jersey wouldn't do that.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.440
I'm kidding.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.440
He had to leave. There was a flood warning.

31:11.440 --> 31:15.440
Oh, stupid, stupid joke.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.440
I don't even get it.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.440
Noah, flood.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.440
Oh, Noah. Wow, that was stupid.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.440
Holy shit.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.440
All right.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.440
Bible, Bible.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.440
Bible jokes.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.440
All right, well, I'm sorry.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
Melissa was it? Lisa.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.440
I was totally close.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.440
It's all the letters are in there.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.440
All the letters are in there.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.440
Why did we bring you up?

31:45.440 --> 31:47.440
I can't remember.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.440
Recently, New Jersey annexed the Statue of Liberty from New York.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.440
And that's straight crap.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.440
So New Jersey stole the Statue of Liberty?

31:53.440 --> 31:55.440
Yeah.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.440
Well, that's a dick move.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.440
The whole point of that Statue

31:59.440 --> 32:01.440
is that people can do whatever they want.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.440
You can't just hoard it.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.440
Yeah.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.440
Yeah, we let New Jerseyans in through that Statue.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.440
You can't just take it on your way out.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.440
That's crazy.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.440
Okay, all right. Fuck New Jersey.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.440
All right.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.440
All right. Thank you, Lisa.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.440
I guess that's Melissa.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.440
Do you remember when David Copperfield

32:21.440 --> 32:23.440
made the Statue of Liberty disappear?

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
I sure do.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
You guys are 20. You don't remember.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
But I was watching it on TV.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
I was like 10 years old.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.440
How else would you have watched it at that point?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.440
Yeah, I wasn't like Macaulay Culkin.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.440
I didn't like journey out here.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.440
I was watching it on TV

32:39.440 --> 32:41.440
and he made it disappear

32:41.440 --> 32:43.440
with like his brain.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.440
And there was like a radar thing next to him

32:45.440 --> 32:47.440
that showed up and there was a blip that disappeared.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
And then he was like,

32:49.440 --> 32:51.440
oh, it's gone.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.440
And then they showed that it was gone.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.440
I was a 10-year-old kid.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
I was watching it by myself when my parents were downstairs

32:57.440 --> 32:59.440
like having a party or something.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.440
And I don't know, there were keys involved

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
and some bowl.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.440
And

33:05.440 --> 33:07.440
I just

33:07.440 --> 33:09.440
like,

33:09.440 --> 33:11.440
I kind of like, I was marvel.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.440
I was like, oh shit, he made it disappear.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.440
And I kind of turned off the TV

33:15.440 --> 33:17.440
that he made the Statue of Liberty disappear forever.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.440
I kept, I was like talking to people

33:19.440 --> 33:21.440
at school going like, all that work.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.440
You know, it's like crazy.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
It's like, and then some magical guy comes along

33:25.440 --> 33:27.440
and just, like I was like

33:27.440 --> 33:29.440
being really profound about it.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.440
Like I had some insight into it.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.440
And then someone said, no, he made it

33:33.440 --> 33:35.440
reappear after you turned off the TV.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.440
It's like a real deep level

33:37.440 --> 33:39.440
of object permanence for you.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.440
Yeah.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.440
Like were you good at peekaboo as a kid?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.440
Me too.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
I was the best at peekaboo.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.440
If I can't see it, it does not exist.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.440
What is that?

33:59.440 --> 34:01.440
This is my Samsung Gigantor.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.440
Is that a phone?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.440
Yeah, the SUV of phones.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.440
Dan, here's an iPad mini.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.440
Hold yours up next to mine.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.440
Look at that.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.440
It's not...

34:13.440 --> 34:15.440
All right.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.440
Pretty big.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.440
Jody Foster, all right.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.440
Let's bring her out.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.440
You never know now.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.440
You can't get her out.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.440
Can't get her out. She's a tease.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.440
You can tiptoe around it.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.440
That was a weird speech.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.440
I don't have to tell anybody that was a weird speech.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.440
You have to tell people that didn't watch The Golden Globes.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
Like you assume everybody did.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.440
Every year we do this with all these award shows.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.440
People, these actors come out and they make these weird speeches.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.440
Oh, here we go.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.440
I feel like...

34:47.440 --> 34:49.440
There needs...

34:53.440 --> 34:55.440
Shouldn't they have a sign?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.440
Is there like a door you go through before you got something to award?

34:57.440 --> 34:59.440
Are you going to make an awkward speech for us?

34:59.440 --> 35:01.440
Like in that genre?

35:01.440 --> 35:03.440
Oh, no. I can try that.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.440
And the winner for fired off of most television series.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.440
The Golden Globe goes to Dan Harmon.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
Hey.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
Thank you. Thank you.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.440
Thank you for this award.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
I know that you don't care.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.440
I accept it. I really appreciate it.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.440
I'm going home now. Thank you.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
There. That's not so hard, is it?

35:33.440 --> 35:37.440
I feel like there should be a sign above the doorway you go through

35:37.440 --> 35:41.440
before you accept the award that says they don't care.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
Just as a reminder, really quick.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.440
It's going to sound like they care.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.440
There's a lot of actors out there applauding you.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.440
And People Magazine cares.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.440
And TMZ cares.

35:51.440 --> 35:55.440
But largely not enough people that are watching care for you to go out and...

35:55.440 --> 35:57.440
I missed what happened. What did you do?

35:57.440 --> 35:59.440
It was just odd.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.440
It was just odd. That's all.

36:01.440 --> 36:05.440
It's the 950th odd moment in an award show's history.

36:05.440 --> 36:09.440
The Golden Globes famously is the director of that decided

36:09.440 --> 36:13.440
that they should seat people with really funny mismatchings.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.440
And there's a lot to booze on that table.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.440
I've only ever watched one.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.440
I think there may have been a bag of pills on her table.

36:19.440 --> 36:23.440
I just know that Annette Benning was absolutely shithouse drunk.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.440
By the third thing.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.440
And she was sitting across from MC Hammer or somebody.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.440
Annette Benning.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.440
Did Bubsy come out this year?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.440
What was she in?

36:35.440 --> 36:37.440
I don't know. It was a few years ago.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.440
I didn't watch him. I just watched the YouTube clip.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.440
It was weird.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.440
She quoted some SNL bit I've never seen.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.440
And then she...

36:45.440 --> 36:47.440
Not that I don't watch it every week.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.440
She said, I'm 50. I'm 50.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.440
And then made this weird Jeff Goldblum face.

36:51.440 --> 36:55.440
How did you know it was from SNL then?

36:55.440 --> 36:57.440
Except my girlfriend told me that. She's 28.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.440
That tracks. That tracks.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.440
That's all it takes.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.440
The internet would also have been acceptable.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.440
All right. Let's do some old school.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.440
I tried to get Matlock on you.

37:07.440 --> 37:09.440
I said, well, how did you...

37:09.440 --> 37:11.440
If you've never seen it.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.440
No, you guys are safe. You're safe.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.440
You're a comedic institution. You're fine.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
Dan, name a couple of your favorite Jason Sudeikas sketches

37:17.440 --> 37:19.440
from the last season or two.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
I mean, you've known him for a good long time.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.440
I like his Joseph Biden impression.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.440
All right.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.440
I like the funny tracksuit guy

37:27.440 --> 37:29.440
that does the dancing

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
on the guy.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
And he says, say what?

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
I thought about making him come out and do that.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.440
But I was going to start rapping.

37:37.440 --> 37:39.440
And then he'd come out and do the tracksuit dance.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
But I was like, you don't win.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
I was like, you don't win.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.440
I was like, you don't win.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.440
I was like, you don't win.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.440
I was like, you don't win.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.440
I was like, oh, you can do it.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.440
I was like, y'all, you can do it.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.440
Thank you.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.440
Thank you.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.440
Yeah.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
Date line Brooklyn, New York.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.440
I fucked your momma with a spoon and a fork.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.440
I fucked your momma all the way to the bridge.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.440
Fucked your momma so hard that Ford had had a wrench.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
She was a Klingon.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
Fucked her south.

38:15.440 --> 38:19.440
But fuck your mama, I was all the rage, break down.

38:19.440 --> 38:25.440
There are seven boroughs of New York, East Stanton,

38:25.440 --> 38:31.440
Queen Town, Poughkeepsie,

38:31.440 --> 38:39.440
Old Jersey, Bronx City, Stanton Island.

38:39.440 --> 38:44.440
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, each of my fingers is a borough in New York.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.440
I got Queens on my thumb, it's a fork.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
I'm gonna stab my middle finger with it.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.440
That Stanton Island, I don't give a fuck.

38:51.440 --> 38:54.440
Shit, I gotta work on that, I gotta work on that.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.440
And by the end of the night, I'm gonna have,

39:00.440 --> 39:03.440
it's gonna be like a metaphor, like each of my fingers is a,

39:03.440 --> 39:06.440
it's a borough in New York, kind of a fucking sling rock with it.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.440
It's a sling rock with my hand.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.440
Each one-fifth of my hand is a different borough.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.440
I'm gonna fucking do it.

39:14.440 --> 39:18.440
Stanton Island is my thumb, get shit done.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.440
Queens, you know what I mean?

39:20.440 --> 39:22.440
Middle finger, fuck you.

39:22.440 --> 39:26.440
Stanton Island again, I can't fucking, Bronx.

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
I think that'll loosen you up once you,

39:27.440 --> 39:29.440
once you accept the other boroughs.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.440
Like that'll give you, different things to rhyme with.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
Ring finger, straight downtown.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.440
Good fucking mama, Stanton Island.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.440
Ooh.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.440
It's close.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.440
Dan, I think in the back of your head,

39:45.440 --> 39:47.440
you were expecting to be bailed out by Jason

39:47.440 --> 39:49.440
coming up and doing his little dance.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.440
And you were just kind of putting placeholders out there.

39:52.440 --> 39:55.440
No, I don't put that, I don't put that on other performers.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
He's up here as a guest.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.440
I don't care what anyone does.

39:59.440 --> 40:08.440
I think it is time for a Joe Biden rap.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.440
Joe Biden's gonna rap in a minute.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.440
I'm gonna set him up, then you're gonna be in it.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.440
Joe Biden's gonna do some rapping.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.440
It's not gonna be hack, it's gonna be long lasted.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.440
You'll be talking about it on the way home.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.440
Joe Biden's gonna rap, he's gonna do it alone.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.440
Joe Biden's gonna rap to the stage.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.440
Joe Biden, here it goes.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.440
I mean, you know, I...

40:30.440 --> 40:32.440
I appreciate the opportunity, Dan.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.440
It's really great to be here.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.440
I'd really just like to talk about gun control,

40:37.440 --> 40:39.440
if that's all right.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.440
Yeah!

40:43.440 --> 40:45.440
You know, if it doesn't have to rhyme, it's easier for me.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.440
I just...

40:47.440 --> 40:49.440
Simple man, you know, I just...

40:51.440 --> 40:52.440
Does NBC own that?

40:52.440 --> 40:54.440
Am I gonna have to license that?

40:54.440 --> 40:56.440
Yeah, they have to ask...

40:56.440 --> 40:58.440
Joe Biden has to ask NBC if he can do it.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.440
It's fine, it's Comcast.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.440
It's Comcast.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.440
Jason, I have a question.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.440
When you remember the cast, I know there's a lot of...

41:06.440 --> 41:09.440
I wouldn't say political stuff,

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
but it's hard to get your sketches in the show.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.440
You can write a funny sketch, it may not make it in the show.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.440
And there's people that I think are probably,

41:15.440 --> 41:17.440
you know, in the past have been more forward,

41:17.440 --> 41:20.440
better at getting their stuff into the reeds,

41:20.440 --> 41:22.440
making it past the reeds through his into the show,

41:22.440 --> 41:24.440
than other people.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.440
Because now it's written in stone

41:26.440 --> 41:28.440
that the show is always going to start more or less

41:28.440 --> 41:30.440
with a political piece.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.440
So when a new political figure comes on the scene

41:32.440 --> 41:34.440
and you kind of look like that person,

41:34.440 --> 41:36.440
is it like the greatest day of your life?

41:36.440 --> 41:38.440
Oh, I fucking got Biden.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.440
It may be early, I think it probably is early on.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.440
I would say that...

41:43.440 --> 41:45.440
Well, for me, with Joe Biden,

41:45.440 --> 41:48.440
I played him in like Halloween of 2009

41:48.440 --> 41:51.440
around then because Barack Obama came to do the show

41:51.440 --> 41:53.440
and myself and Bill Hader, Bill played like Chris Dodd,

41:53.440 --> 41:55.440
I think, and I played Joe Biden.

41:55.440 --> 41:58.440
And then cut to the summer of...

41:58.440 --> 42:00.440
No, the summer of...

42:00.440 --> 42:02.440
So that would have been 07.

42:02.440 --> 42:05.440
So then cut to the summer of 08.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.440
Sorry, Halloween of 2007.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.440
This is awful.

42:09.440 --> 42:12.440
This is the part you're going to have to cut out, you know?

42:12.440 --> 42:16.440
But, yeah, so August 08,

42:16.440 --> 42:20.440
Obama names Biden as his guy, as VP.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.440
And then Fred Armisen, who was playing Obama at that point,

42:23.440 --> 42:25.440
texted me going, hey, man, congrats.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.440
Like, with no, like, context.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.440
No, no context.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.440
No context, congrats.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.440
I was like, oh, what? I'm Biden.

42:33.440 --> 42:35.440
And I was like, what? What about it?

42:35.440 --> 42:37.440
Like, he got picked. Yeah, it was so what?

42:37.440 --> 42:39.440
He goes, well, you played him. I go, I do?

42:39.440 --> 42:41.440
So I forgot because, like...

42:41.440 --> 42:44.440
I mean, I wear like a bald cap and fake teeth.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.440
I mean, I put up...

42:46.440 --> 42:48.440
They put a little fake nose tip on me.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.440
It's a long way from, you know, just Chevy Chase

42:50.440 --> 42:52.440
is going out there and falling down, or like,

42:52.440 --> 42:54.440
damn, damn, accurate claim.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.440
We'll never get back there again.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.440
No, yeah.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.440
That's right, you know him.

43:00.440 --> 43:04.440
I know him better than anyone.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.440
I have worked with him longer than anyone.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.440
Literally the entire TV industry.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.440
Because I've known you since forever.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.440
That, like, that, like...

43:14.440 --> 43:17.440
I don't even think about you and him.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.440
Like, that's so funny.

43:19.440 --> 43:21.440
I've known you for years and years before.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.440
And that's what went down.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.440
So I'm just talking about shit in the world.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.440
And then I realized, oh, you used it. Yeah, you...

43:27.440 --> 43:29.440
We're tight. You forget. We're tightness.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.440
Humble brag. Life is weird.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.440
I just to remind you, like,

43:33.440 --> 43:35.440
I texted Chevy because we're in New York

43:35.440 --> 43:37.440
and he's often in New York.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.440
So I texted him to see if he could make it.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.440
Spoilers, he can't.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.440
But I know, I know, I know.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.440
You would have loved it.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.440
He would have made a little...

43:47.440 --> 43:49.440
Between Jeff and I, you will get enough, like,

43:49.440 --> 43:51.440
a garnish of Chevy Chase, possibly,

43:51.440 --> 43:53.440
throughout just the performance, I would say.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.440
Maybe just, like... What?

43:55.440 --> 43:57.440
Just as far as, just, like, you know,

43:57.440 --> 43:59.440
just, you know, whatever way.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.440
I just want to share...

44:01.440 --> 44:03.440
I'm going to get drunk and send Dan racist voicemails.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.440
I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say, like,

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
the newest version.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.440
Maybe at his most Thai web.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.440
At his most...

44:11.440 --> 44:13.440
I can't do his impression.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.440
You know, I'm not talking about impression.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.440
I'm talking about...

44:17.440 --> 44:19.440
What am I talking about? Height.

44:19.440 --> 44:21.440
Oh, I got that.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.440
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.440
Watch this, watch this. Jason, you're going to love this.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.440
Yep.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.440
Woo!

44:29.440 --> 44:31.440
Now, fall down, fall down.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.440
I texted him,

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
I'm doing my show in Brooklyn tomorrow night.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.440
Are you in New York?

44:37.440 --> 44:39.440
And three hours later, he texted back the word

44:39.440 --> 44:41.440
country.

44:41.440 --> 44:43.440
How do you spell it?

44:43.440 --> 44:45.440
Is it two words or one word?

44:45.440 --> 44:47.440
Does he call you a name?

44:49.440 --> 44:51.440
Yeah, that is like...

44:51.440 --> 44:53.440
Does he have a treasure map he's going to give you?

44:53.440 --> 44:55.440
Country!

44:55.440 --> 44:57.440
Is that the password to deactivate his

44:57.440 --> 44:59.440
burglar alarm? Like, what?

44:59.440 --> 45:01.440
Who is he mistaking me for?

45:01.440 --> 45:03.440
I tell you what he said, he texted,

45:03.440 --> 45:05.440
his last text was the word country.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.440
I don't want to know what this guy meant. Who was this guy?

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
What did he mean to people? Country.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.440
It's not too like...

45:11.440 --> 45:13.440
Citizen Chase, that was Citizen Chase.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.440
Let's try it, Kyle.

45:23.440 --> 45:25.440
Please pick up the phone.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.440
My phone's ringing.

45:29.440 --> 45:35.440
Come on, do it, Chevy.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.440
He does have a voicemail, right?

45:45.440 --> 45:47.440
This is...

45:47.440 --> 45:49.440
This is the stand-in for Chevy Chase.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.440
He can't come to the phone right now,

45:51.440 --> 45:53.440
but I'm going to get over to him

45:53.440 --> 45:55.440
as soon as I can,

45:55.440 --> 45:57.440
as soon as I can, as soon as I can,

45:57.440 --> 45:59.440
as soon as I can on the stand.

46:03.440 --> 46:05.440
At the telecom, please record your message.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.440
Joe Biden. Joe Biden leaves the message.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.440
I got more, Chris.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.440
Joe Biden message.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.440
Hey, Chevy, it's Joe Biden, Vice President.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.440
I just want to say we thank you for being

46:15.440 --> 46:17.440
a great patriot and have fun in the country.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.440
We hope you're...

46:19.440 --> 46:21.440
The country you always want to go back

46:21.440 --> 46:23.440
to though is America.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.440
All right, there we go.

46:25.440 --> 46:29.800
It's a pretty low stakes prank.

46:29.800 --> 46:32.320
We're not exactly the jerky boys.

46:32.320 --> 46:35.520
Also, he has your phone number in his phone.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.520
Yeah, that's true.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.520
Also, I forgot.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.520
Yeah.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.520
It's not going to say Joe Biden.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.040
It's not exactly the perfect crime.

46:41.040 --> 46:45.000
It's going to say fat alcoholic asshole or whatever he has me in his phone.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.440
I love that you're skirting around the fact that my impression of Joe Biden, and much

46:48.440 --> 46:52.000
less anybody sounds anything like Joe Biden.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.560
I love that Fred Armisen called and was like, oh, we got it.

46:54.560 --> 46:55.560
We did it.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.240
I was like, you don't look or sound anything like Joe Biden.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.840
Yeah, but I've played him once before, so that's what gets said in stone.

46:59.840 --> 47:00.840
I know.

47:00.840 --> 47:01.840
That's what's amazing.

47:01.840 --> 47:05.760
In TV writing, in LA, it's like, well, if you, like a community, sometimes people,

47:05.760 --> 47:09.960
you never know who wrote a script that had a character in it, like Leonard or something.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.720
It's like, there's always weird shit with like, oh, I wrote, I created that character

47:13.720 --> 47:16.920
because I wrote that episode, and it's like, it actually translates into royalties and

47:16.920 --> 47:21.160
shit, and it gets pretty grody.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.320
There's no reason to talk about that.

47:22.320 --> 47:23.320
Edit that out.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.320
Should we bring up Spencer at this point then?

47:24.320 --> 47:25.320
Yeah.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
Yeah.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.320
Let's bring Spencer.

47:27.320 --> 47:37.880
Jason has no way, he's never heard the show, he doesn't know.

47:37.880 --> 47:40.320
Standing ovation for Spencer.

47:40.320 --> 47:48.560
I wasn't asking for it, I was just reporting it, reporting it.

47:48.560 --> 47:51.680
Spencer's our Dungeon Master.

47:51.680 --> 47:55.840
He plays Dungeons and Dragons with us.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.960
Spencer is our Dungeon Master, he plays Dungeons and Dragons with us.

47:58.960 --> 47:59.960
Do you have a heart out?

47:59.960 --> 48:03.520
Do you need to go be married to Olivia Wilde or anything?

48:03.520 --> 48:06.520
No, we haven't set a date on it.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.520
Congratulations, right?

48:07.520 --> 48:08.520
Thank you.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.520
That wasn't secret news, was it?

48:10.520 --> 48:11.520
She's Tron, right?

48:11.520 --> 48:15.960
Well, you can't get engaged to Tron and have it be a secret, she's glowing.

48:15.960 --> 48:18.560
Yeah, you can see her from a mile away.

48:18.560 --> 48:23.600
No, I mean it's not a secret anymore, I don't think it was never really a secret, it's just

48:23.600 --> 48:24.600
something you know.

48:24.600 --> 48:27.480
Let's call her.

48:27.480 --> 48:31.600
She's asleep, she's in the country.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.800
A different country.

48:32.800 --> 48:33.800
She's down-resing.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
Yeah.

48:34.800 --> 48:42.320
I'm trying to remember my Tron jokes, because I want to kill in Brooklyn, is why.

48:42.320 --> 48:46.120
That's the brass ring, I'm trying to remember my Tron jokes.

48:46.120 --> 48:48.320
Original Tron jokes, hopefully.

48:48.320 --> 48:52.240
If you lose your identity disc, I'm sorry.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.440
You will be subjected to immediate...

48:54.440 --> 48:58.000
An end of lying, Dillinger.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.160
Something like that.

48:59.160 --> 49:02.880
Spencer, do you have any Tron references?

49:02.880 --> 49:04.720
The Tron discs.

49:04.720 --> 49:11.360
20, 23-year-old Spencer, hey, Spencer, can we do a new segment, I don't want to spring

49:11.360 --> 49:16.360
this on you, I want to do a new segment called Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.

49:16.360 --> 49:17.360
Here we go.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.360
Yes.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.200
Spencer has a very, very arched opinion about it.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.520
Is there a theme song you can play for us?

49:23.520 --> 49:26.400
We've been riding on a tour bus with Spencer, so we're learning all about each other.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.160
This is our sixth stop.

49:28.160 --> 49:30.760
The other shoe will not drop with Spencer.

49:30.760 --> 49:34.120
Everything you learn about him, he becomes more and more awesome.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.760
The latest thing, he has got a fucking hook in his craw.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.760
What's the expression?

49:38.760 --> 49:39.760
A bee in his bonnet.

49:39.760 --> 49:40.760
A hook in his craw?

49:40.760 --> 49:42.240
I don't know.

49:42.240 --> 49:46.880
He is up in arms about Looney Tunes for specific reasons.

49:46.880 --> 49:50.720
Here's our first installment of Spencer Hates Looney Tunes, let me get some music.

49:50.720 --> 49:57.520
Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.

49:57.520 --> 50:01.840
So that Daffy Duck, fuck that guy.

50:01.840 --> 50:08.720
No, I don't know, he just sucks, I mean, does anyone like him?

50:08.720 --> 50:09.720
Why?

50:09.720 --> 50:16.280
Do you like that he's like self-entitled, or that he just feels compelled for it to

50:16.280 --> 50:17.880
be rabbit season?

50:17.880 --> 50:23.560
I mean, when he's fighting with Bugs Bunny, it's hard, like, because they're both assholes

50:23.560 --> 50:28.360
and they both deserve to be shot and killed.

50:28.360 --> 50:33.200
So I mean, when it's both of those, you can kind of, Daffy Duck's kind of okay, but otherwise,

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
fuck him.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.800
Ladies and gentlemen, that's Spencer, Hates Looney Tunes.

50:37.800 --> 50:40.000
Spencer's Complaints About Looney Tunes.

50:40.000 --> 50:52.200
All right, Spencer, despite the character sheets, let's get Erin McGathy to the stage

50:52.200 --> 50:55.640
too to play some, you want to stay?

50:55.640 --> 50:56.640
You want to play some D&D?

50:56.640 --> 50:57.640
Yeah.

50:57.640 --> 50:58.640
I've never played.

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
You don't have to know anything.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.640
All right.

51:00.640 --> 51:04.920
There might be something for Jason to do, like you could play ancillary characters, like

51:04.920 --> 51:07.160
we're going to play Judges and Dragons.

51:07.160 --> 51:15.200
Can we do a, can we set up a Settlers of Catan board on stage left and like, yeah, that's

51:15.200 --> 51:16.320
my nerd shit.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.880
That's the stuff I like.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.880
So yeah, you guys have characters?

51:19.880 --> 51:22.160
Settlers of Catan is some jersey shit.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.160
Erin McGathy?

51:23.160 --> 51:24.160
Aaron, you out there?

51:24.160 --> 51:25.160
Come on up, Erin McGathy, everybody.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.160
Hello, Aaron.

51:26.160 --> 51:36.840
I'd like to introduce one of my best friends.

51:36.840 --> 51:42.600
Our moms both died of the same cancer, Eddie Geller.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.080
My one comp during the tour.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.080
Oh, I didn't know.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.080
It was great.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.080
No, it's fine.

51:47.080 --> 51:48.080
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that your seat was up front.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.080
Thanks for being a good sport.

51:49.080 --> 51:50.080
Thanks for being on my mom.

51:50.080 --> 51:51.080
Our moms are dead.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.080
All right.

51:52.080 --> 51:53.080
All right.

51:53.080 --> 51:56.600
Cancer is the loony tunes of disease, brother.

51:56.600 --> 52:01.840
Spencer, get us up to date in our campaign if you would be so kind.

52:01.840 --> 52:10.840
Still, when we last met probably, do you want me to stop, Spencer?

52:10.840 --> 52:12.280
No, I'm good.

52:12.280 --> 52:16.880
Last time are heroes.

52:16.880 --> 52:22.160
Last time our heroes had just reunited in the starboard side of the flying black airship,

52:22.160 --> 52:25.240
sirens blaring and canyons firing.

52:25.240 --> 52:29.840
After splitting up in a dramatic fashion, Quark had been infiltrating Dark Star's vessel,

52:29.840 --> 52:35.120
but now together with the power of Buttsalot's teleporting cape, Sharpian Mulraine quickly

52:35.120 --> 52:36.640
ported to Quark.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.280
Blasting open a large door, they worked their way through the ship.

52:40.280 --> 52:45.600
After facing down a nine-naked foe with a wicked whip, the party gained access to a room

52:45.600 --> 52:46.600
full of lockers.

52:46.600 --> 52:53.240
They found treasure from a Lute of Charming to some beads of force to some magic arrows.

52:53.240 --> 52:58.320
Using a magical staff they found, the party ascended through some sort of hatch in the

52:58.320 --> 53:09.640
floor.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.360
So less dramatic.

53:11.360 --> 53:15.240
Do you guys remember you were in a room full of treasure, you found like this magic staff

53:15.240 --> 53:20.680
and you were writing it to the top?

53:20.680 --> 53:21.680
That's just what happened.

53:21.680 --> 53:22.680
Yeah.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.680
If there's any bad guys or anything, Jason, you can play them.

53:25.680 --> 53:29.080
No, I'm checking my shit.

53:29.080 --> 53:33.880
So there's a hatch right above you, since you can't all pop through at the same time,

53:33.880 --> 53:37.040
so you're going to have to figure out an order to go in.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.160
All right.

53:39.160 --> 53:40.160
Ladies first.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.160
Ah, thank you.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.160
You just...

53:42.160 --> 53:43.160
Newly lady.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.160
Jason, I just turned into a woman.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.160
Oh, that's great.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.160
Thank you.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.160
Within the game.

53:47.160 --> 53:48.160
Yes, within the game.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.160
Within the game.

53:49.160 --> 53:50.160
No, no, no.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.160
I'll go first.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.160
It's a gentleman's obligation.

53:52.160 --> 53:53.160
Okay.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.160
Yeah.

53:54.160 --> 53:57.120
All right, then who, who's next and who's last?

53:57.120 --> 53:58.120
I'll bring up the rear.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.120
All right.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.120
All right.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.120
So I'll be...

54:01.120 --> 54:02.120
Can we talk about what happened in the hotel room today?

54:02.120 --> 54:03.120
Yes.

54:03.120 --> 54:04.120
Is this...

54:04.120 --> 54:05.120
Is it sexist?

54:05.120 --> 54:06.120
No, we can talk about it.

54:06.120 --> 54:07.120
I don't know your frame too.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.120
You want me to roll a six and a nine?

54:08.120 --> 54:09.120
Oh.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.120
Oh.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
Oh, my God.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.120
Oh, my God.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.120
Oh, my God.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.120
Oh, my God.

54:14.120 --> 54:31.080
When you go on a month long tour with your girlfriend, that guarantees that there's going to be

54:31.080 --> 54:39.120
a moment like today where you burst into tears out of nowhere and said, I just want you to

54:39.120 --> 54:40.120
love me.

54:40.120 --> 54:41.120
Yeah.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.120
Yeah.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.120
And we're crying.

54:43.120 --> 54:44.120
Yeah.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.120
I don't...

54:45.120 --> 54:46.120
Adventure.

54:46.120 --> 54:57.520
I'm sorry, ladies, because I don't want to out us, but I believe that I am about to have

54:57.520 --> 54:58.520
my period.

54:58.520 --> 54:59.520
Oh.

54:59.520 --> 55:12.960
I don't get angry, my PMS style isn't angry, it's just tears, and I said to Dan, hey,

55:12.960 --> 55:16.920
out of nowhere, hey, is everything cool?

55:16.920 --> 55:20.960
And he said to me, hey, Erin, you got to deal with the shit on your own.

55:20.960 --> 55:31.240
I'm not soliciting a boo, I'm not soliciting a boo, but I just started crying and I was

55:31.240 --> 55:34.640
like, Erin, just go to the mirror and just look in the mirror and you'll be fine, but

55:34.640 --> 55:38.160
somehow looking at myself crying in the mirror made me cry more.

55:38.160 --> 55:43.160
So then when I came back to Dan, I was covered in tears and like swollen and just like, this

55:43.160 --> 55:45.160
is dumb and then I'm pretty new in most of it.

55:45.160 --> 55:48.640
And I didn't know I was looking at my laptop and I just heard, Dan, and I looked up and

55:48.640 --> 55:50.680
I was like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?

55:50.680 --> 55:54.560
Hey guys, guys, are you going to climb this staff or what?

55:54.560 --> 55:57.760
I hate the motion.

55:57.760 --> 56:01.200
I'm sitting down on a magic staff like an asshole down here.

56:01.200 --> 56:06.800
I just wanted to say, because I'm bad at it when we're one on one, because I'm like a

56:06.800 --> 56:12.040
Jim Carrey type who can only express himself through entertainment.

56:12.040 --> 56:23.400
I'm very sorry that you had period feelings today and I will be there for you through

56:23.400 --> 56:26.160
all your periods.

56:26.160 --> 56:28.840
All of them, they come every month.

56:28.840 --> 56:34.000
Yeah, but maybe not next month, right?

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
Yeah, I don't like using condoms.

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
All right, let's get back to the end.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
I'm sorry.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
I'm sorry.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
It's okay, it's okay.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
I just thought it was amazing.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Hey Jason, can we talk about what happened in the hotel room earlier with me and you?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Does Olivia ever cry for no reason?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
I'd rather not.

56:55.000 --> 57:03.800
Jason, you have an amazing, beautiful, wonderful, fiancé, yeah, she cries for no reason sometimes.

57:03.800 --> 57:11.040
She's brand new, you're going to find out that there's a derezification that happens.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.800
Her Ram is going to mainframe her.

57:13.800 --> 57:14.800
A year, a year.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.800
Yeah, well, we've been together a year.

57:16.800 --> 57:19.800
Yeah, well, I meant to have mood swings too.

57:19.800 --> 57:20.800
We sure do.

57:20.800 --> 57:21.800
Yeah.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.800
Do I need to turn this thing on at all or something?

57:23.800 --> 57:26.800
Yeah, no, that's for the movie that you're now in.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.800
What's the, I forget our song guys name.

57:28.800 --> 57:30.800
Is there one more mic for Jason while we're up here?

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
No?

57:31.800 --> 57:33.800
Oh, this is for the video.

57:33.800 --> 57:34.800
Yeah, this is for the live crowd.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.800
All right, sorry, I'm sorry about that.

57:36.800 --> 57:39.800
I just, yes, sometimes she does cry, but it's...

57:39.800 --> 57:40.800
Gorgeous.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.800
You come when she cries.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.800
Oh, go on.

57:45.800 --> 57:48.800
She cries and looks in the mirror and goes, oh yeah.

57:48.800 --> 57:53.800
She cries and dear walk into the room and lick her tears off of her gorgeous face.

57:53.800 --> 57:57.800
Revlon, just Revlon falling off or just dripping on the mascara.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.800
Is she literally the Revlon model?

57:59.800 --> 58:00.800
She must be.

58:00.800 --> 58:03.800
God damn it.

58:03.800 --> 58:07.800
They actually, Revlon actually uses the mascara that drips off of her cheeks.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.800
They bottle it and give it to regular women.

58:09.800 --> 58:11.800
I'm the Teflon role model.

58:11.800 --> 58:12.800
Oh, that's great.

58:12.800 --> 58:13.800
Yeah.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.800
That's great.

58:14.800 --> 58:21.800
Jason, how integral and your fiance falling in love with you was your Joe Biden impression?

58:21.800 --> 58:24.800
I would say the Mitt Romney maybe had more...

58:24.800 --> 58:28.800
Well, I think she already loved me at that point, but I think Mitt Romney had more to do with it

58:28.800 --> 58:31.800
and she's very active politically on the...

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
We'll lease back then on the opposite side.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.800
Oh, really?

58:34.800 --> 58:35.800
Yeah.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.800
Jason, do you ever get sick of how beautiful she is?

58:37.800 --> 58:44.800
Do you ever just want to throw a brick at her nose?

58:44.800 --> 58:46.800
I haven't.

58:46.800 --> 58:47.800
I haven't.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.800
It's actually really, really neat.

58:49.800 --> 58:50.800
Oh, it's true love.

58:50.800 --> 58:51.800
It's true love.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.800
Like soaking wet or with no makeup on.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
You look at her and you're just kind of like, yeah, all right.

58:55.800 --> 58:56.800
Yeah, she's an angel.

58:56.800 --> 58:57.800
She's an angel.

58:57.800 --> 59:01.800
Yeah, she can say really hard mean stuff, you know, or not mean, but like, you know...

59:01.800 --> 59:02.800
Also, you're an angel.

59:02.800 --> 59:03.800
Sure.

59:03.800 --> 59:04.800
Two angels.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.800
Two angels met in heaven on earth and are now marrying.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.800
Wonderful angels.

59:08.800 --> 59:09.800
That's fact.

59:09.800 --> 59:10.800
I mean, that's fact.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
Congratulations.

59:11.800 --> 59:13.800
Yeah, thank you.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.800
My dialogue will be put in a card that will be sent to you.

59:16.800 --> 59:17.800
I appreciate it.

59:17.800 --> 59:18.800
I'll take it.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.800
I'm starting to feel like she's mad that she's with me.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.800
No, no, no, no, no.

59:21.800 --> 59:22.800
Not at all.

59:22.800 --> 59:23.800
Not at all.

59:23.800 --> 59:24.800
All right.

59:24.800 --> 59:25.800
No.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.800
Sorry, Spencer.

59:26.800 --> 59:28.800
It's all good.

59:28.800 --> 59:29.800
I'm enjoying myself.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.800
I just wanted to make sure we didn't leave Brooklyn without a human moment, you know.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.800
Like, I want to make sure that these guys get their money's worth.

59:34.800 --> 59:35.800
Brooklyn makes sure of that too.

59:35.800 --> 59:36.800
And that's what I like about Brooklyn.

59:36.800 --> 59:38.800
Brooklyn, make sure you don't leave without a human moment either.

59:38.800 --> 59:41.800
Oh, it's Brooklyn Governor, Mel Poops.

59:41.800 --> 59:42.800
Mel Poops.

59:42.800 --> 59:43.800
Mel Poops.

59:43.800 --> 59:44.800
Mel Poops.

59:44.800 --> 59:45.800
Oh.

59:45.800 --> 59:53.800
P-U-U-P-S, it's Dutch.

59:53.800 --> 59:54.800
Brooklyn has its own governor.

59:54.800 --> 59:55.800
Did you know that, Jeff?

59:55.800 --> 59:56.800
I did not know that.

59:56.800 --> 59:57.800
Yeah.

59:57.800 --> 59:58.800
It's not Mel Poops.

59:58.800 --> 59:59.800
I know that.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800
What's your name?

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.800
Marty Markowitz.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.800
Marty Markowitz?

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800
Marty Markowitz?

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
Marty Markowitz.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:13.800
I think I have my pants tailored by him, I think.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800
All right, Spencer.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.800
You'll get the best pants for your body shape.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.800
That's the Mel Markowitz guarantee.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.800
Marty Markowitz, sorry.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.800
Also, I'm the governor.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.800
Ask me about my state.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.800
Buy a suit, I'll govern you.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.800
You want a pardon?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:35.800
Buy suits from me.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800
Tuesday is belt day.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800
Come in, get a belt.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.800
I'll govern you.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.800
Let me govern those slacks and your trousers.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.800
The first person to buy three suits, I'll appoint district attorney.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.800
Does your waistline need to be legislated?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.800
I'm Marty Markowitz.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:04.800
I'll cuff your pants and make a law.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.800
For every two pairs of pants, you get to make a law.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800
All right, sorry, Spencer.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800
All right.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:18.800
Popping your head through the hatch, you are facing four large black leather chairs.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.800
You see four people in this room.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.800
A large steering wheel stands in the center,

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.800
and a huge glass panel behind you reveals the world below.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.800
Standing at the wheel is a large, darkly armored knight,

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.800
staring ahead and guiding the wheel gently.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.800
As you enter, three of the other people leap to their feet.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.800
They're wearing orange coveralls stained with dark spots.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800
They quickly yell at you in abyssal.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.800
How did you get in here?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.800
Jason and Jacob can do some of those parts.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800
I'm one of the four people I think involved here, aren't I?

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.800
Yeah, I could have you that, or you could be a good guy.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.800
No, don't tell me how you can make it. Tell me what it is.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.800
There's four people in this room, and you can be one of them.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.800
Be one of the bad guys, yell at me in abyssal.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.800
One of those guys has got to be Admiral Darkstar,

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800
the guy in the middle, right?

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.800
You actually recognize, although similarly clothed, it's not the same man.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.800
The sidebar is super tough to be a dungeon master

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.800
when a guy's got you on his tour bus, right?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.800
Yeah, because if I kill off his character,

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.800
he's just going to dump me.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.800
Yeah, I'll be like, oh, your coffee didn't roll a three against my piss, did it?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.800
We'll drink your coffee then, right?

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.800
It's your bunked and saved versus being shit in.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.800
I know purify food and drink.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800
Wow.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.800
Dungeon Snap! Dungeon Snap!

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.800
All right, so you want to yell at him then?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.800
Can we just stop and say that we're at the Bell House in Brooklyn.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.800
We have to be the first show to play D&D on stage here, right?

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800
No? Maybe not.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.800
It was Ryan Postaine here earlier.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.800
Sorry.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.800
Ryan Adams may have done a song about it, maybe.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.800
So what's my motivation? What am I yelling at about?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.800
You're a crewman, and some random dude just popped up through this bottom hatch

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800
in what's normally an inaccessible area of the ship.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800
What the fludge?

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.800
From this place, a swear word's like, oh fuck, yeah.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800
What the fludge?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.800
The bottom of the ship's broken.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800
Do you want to climb out of the hole,

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.800
or you're just kind of like poking out of this whole whack-a-mole style?

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.800
I cast Summon Monster 2 into the bridge, and then drop down.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800
Okay.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.800
What a monster do you want to summon?

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.800
Last time I think you summoned a celestial bee.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Yeah.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.800
All right, all right, squid, squid.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.800
Casting your hands in a magical manner.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.800
A large fengish squid appears in the room.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.800
I drop down.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.800
I put my hands on one of the guards,

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800
trapping in under its bulk.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.800
What the fuck?

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800
Fludge?

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.800
Guys, there's four people up there in black armor.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.800
I put a squid on them, but I'll be darned if I'm not tapped.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.800
Black ink drips down from the floor above.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.800
I fire two arrows.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.800
Okay, so you're not currently in the room, so you poke your head up and do that?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.800
We're still down below the hatch.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.800
I climb above, I'm sorry, I thought I was above the hatch.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800
Okay.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.800
I climb above and I fire two arrows.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800
Oh, shit.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.800
You fire both of the arrows.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800
They go wild.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800
One strikes you in the foot.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.800
You take seven damage and fall down the shaft.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800
I deserved it.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800
Someone hates arrows and booed me.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.800
In the audience, she rolled double critical fails.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.800
That's what you get for having a period.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.800
So we have...

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.800
Was it a critical attack on the squid on the one guy?

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.800
You don't know how exactly that played out.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.800
But we just know he's got a squid on him, so he subdued for a bit.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800
Well, you don't know what happened.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.800
You just saw your friend shoot an arrow into her foot and fall off.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800
I disregard that and climb up the hatch and jump into the room.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.800
Shocking.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.800
Launching into the room, you're met with a grizzly scene.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.800
Although the black, dark-armored figure hasn't moved from the wheel,

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.800
three of the men lie trapped under the squid.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.800
They seem unable to move.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.800
Can I just go up to him with my great flaming sword and poke him on the side while they're under the squid?

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.800
No, because I put the thing on autopilot and turned to face you.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800
Yes.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Jason Sudakis, ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.800
He's judging the fuck out of this dragon.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.800
So you're the pilot of this ship, is your motivation?

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.800
I go into...

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.800
Where are my hit points at?

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.800
Hey, guys, I gotta find out where my hit points are, okay?

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.800
What are my hit points?

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800
Right now you're at 33.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800
The amulet got me back to 33?

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800
Yeah.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.800
Alright, is this a good time to go into a berserker rage?

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.800
Sounds like it.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.800
Can I use intimidate, too?

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
You could do...

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.800
I would prefer you didn't.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800
Intimidate first, rage later.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800
Okay, I intimidate first.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800
Okay.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800
Are you going to intimidate the black-armored figure?

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.800
I'm going to take my shirt off and intimidate this guy.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.800
You feel rather intimidated.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.800
You seem like he might kick your ass if you're not careful.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800
This guides your actions.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800
Okay, great.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.800
So then I go into a berserker rage.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.800
You see a halfling before you.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.800
He's a good four feet tall, but now he's swelling, growing in size,

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.800
rippling with muscles.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.800
Ladies, come on.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800
So now he's half big?

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800
Are you going to attack?

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.800
Yeah, a flaming great sword attack.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.800
Flaming great sword attack.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.800
You missed, sorry.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.800
Swinging wide, your blade catches just the tip of his helmet.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.800
That's where you want it.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.800
So I circumcised him.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800
We'll see.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.800
I regroup.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800
You regroup.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.800
What is my spell Tasha's hideous laughter?

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.800
It afflicts the person with a dangerous laughter.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.800
They can't take any other actions because they're rolling on the floor so hard.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.800
Oh my God.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800
Yeah.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800
Well, I better crawl up into the fray here.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800
Crawling up into the fray.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.800
You crawl up into the fray.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.800
Hey, there's a time and a place for the ray of frost.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.800
Oh, I did mention you're holding an axe, by the way.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800
It's a pretty wicked axe.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800
Yeah, I know.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.800
Like a Gibson Les Paul or something like that?

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.800
It may be.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800
It's better than your loop.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Dungeon Snap.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800
Dungeon Snap.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.800
So I'm a halfling and this dark armor dude.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800
I'm taking on these people.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.800
He's the halfling.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.800
I was describing what you were seeing.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.800
Oh, okay.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.800
You're this darker.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.800
I'm still this guy in this armor.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800
Do a thing.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.800
It's your turn.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.800
It's my turn.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800
Oh, all right.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.800
I want to, you know what I'd like to do?

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.800
I'd like to crush up a billiard ball and blow it in its face

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.800
like a smooth criminal.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800
Nice.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.800
That happens.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.800
I'm going to say it again just really quick

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.800
because I want to get it right in my mind.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.800
I want to grab a cue ball off a nearby billiard table.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800
I want to grab it.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.800
I want to hold up in front of it like this.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.800
I want to crush it in my hand to show my superior strength

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.800
and then I would just be on a real fucking nonchalant bit

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.800
and it'd go in his face.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.800
Very similar to the laughter thing,

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.800
but it's from a smooth criminal.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.800
The barbarian is blinded.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800
Okay.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.800
Now I want to suck his dick.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.800
What kind of cockpit is this?

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800
No.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.800
Properly named one?

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800
I don't know.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.800
What kind of cockpit is this?

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800
No, I want to...

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800
Okay, so now I got him dazed.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800
I got him dazed.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.800
He's dazed.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800
He's off balance.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.800
Okay, so now I want to...

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800
Again, I want to sweep the leg.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800
I want to sweep the leg.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.800
It's a bit difficult to maneuver,

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.800
but you are wearing heavy armor.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800
You sweep him.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.800
Yeah, of course.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.800
He falls to the front ground.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.800
His raging barbarian mind can barely comprehend

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.800
the horizontality of his body.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.800
I want to open up a little door in my seat.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.800
I then want to allow a fart to secrete.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.800
I want to do it right on his face

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.800
and it concentrates right in that one space.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:36.800
Halfling, are you okay?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800
Are you okay?

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.800
Are you okay, halfling?

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800
I feel like my guy,

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800
even though he's dressed this way,

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.800
I kind of want to make him more of an imp.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800
I guess that is what I'm getting at here.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:51.800
You know he's doing a little playful thing.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.800
So I just want to scooch down.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.800
I want to put my...

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.800
Yeah.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.800
He farted in the face.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.800
In Halo, they call it T-Bagging.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.800
Yeah, yeah, T-Bagging.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.800
But this is, it's more...

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.800
With a cherry on top.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.800
I assume he has a halfling,

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.800
he's half the size of a human being,

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.800
but his senses are probably stronger,

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.800
so that would do damage.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.800
He is nauseated, although not damaged.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.800
I'm crushing, okay.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.800
Now I want to go through his iPod

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.800
and make fun of the songs on it.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.800
Alright, it's Dan's turn.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.800
There's one song in his iPod,

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.800
and let me see if I can riff on it.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.800
Another Day in Paradise by Phil Collins.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.800
Just another Day in Paradise?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.800
Yeah, yeah, come down against homeless people.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.800
Let's see it do it.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.800
It's a song about homeless people.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.800
Well, he watched that guy die

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800
and didn't do anything about it,

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.800
he said write a song about it,

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.800
so I don't know if he's really into anything

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800
he writes songs about.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800
I would say, I would say,

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.800
oh man, you know, I'm homeless,

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800
except for this ship.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.800
And maybe just have like a genuine moment,

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.800
like you try to have in Brooklyn, or space.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800
Are we in space?

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.800
I don't even know where the hell this game takes place.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.800
We've been fighting this sci-fi people

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.800
in Dungeons & Dragons world.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.800
I love it.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.800
Yeah, I just want to do a nice,

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.800
you know, knock them out.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.800
I want to take his, you know,

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.800
I have a flashlight, I assume, right?

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800
No.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800
Alright.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800
You have an axe, right?

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800
Oh right, I have the axe.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.800
I want to hit him with the blunt side of the axe.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.800
I don't want to chop off anything.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:40.800
I just want to knock him out

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.800
so I can deal maybe with the other two people

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:42.800
that might be,

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.800
and try to get that squid off my folks.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.800
So, okay, do you want to lift the squid

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800
or hit the guy?

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.800
Well, I got to, he's down.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.800
How where is he at for the count?

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.800
He's farted on.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.800
Yeah.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.800
He's slightly blinded.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.800
Okay.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800
So I got billiard ball on my face.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.800
Right.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.800
I'm on the ground because you swept my leg.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.800
Yeah.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.800
And to add insult to injury,

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.800
you kind of farted on me.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.800
Also, does the squid have kind eyes?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.800
It has fiendish eyes.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.800
Where is he?

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800
He has what?

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800
Fiendish.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Fiendish eyes.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.800
Just let me know when I can cast Tasha's hideous laughter

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.800
on this farting billiard guy.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.800
Well, he's entitled to a will save.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800
He passes his will save.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.800
I use, I use wild empathy on the squid.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.800
He gives a bigger chuckle, but he's unaffected.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.800
Wild empathy.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.800
What are you?

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.800
Okay.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800
You can see the squid.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.800
It's like, I'm confused.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:36.800
I'm suffocating.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:37.800
Very vague pronouns.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.800
Can you mind guys being named Dave?

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.800
Dave sees the thing.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.800
Dave sees the thing.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.800
Jeff just told me, I just,

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.800
Jeff just told me I fucked up.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:45.800
The squid's on our side, right?

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:46.800
Yeah.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.800
Yeah.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.800
So you wild empathize with the squid.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.800
You realize it just got here from another plane.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.800
It doesn't know what's up.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.800
It fell on some people.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800
It can't breathe.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.800
Could I say something else to him?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.800
Yeah.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.800
Yeah.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.800
Like you're going to die.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800
What do you want to say?

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.800
Can I say to the squid,

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.800
hey, first of all, you look great.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:09.800
Second of all,

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.800
can you take care of us a little bit more?

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.800
It whips a tentacle around in protest.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800
Rude.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800
Yeah.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800
It's not bad.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.800
Not bad.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800
Thanks, dad.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.800
My dad hates me.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800
He comes to every show.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.800
Charm person.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.800
Charm person.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:35.800
He passes will save.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800
It doesn't affect him.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800
God damn it.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800
Who are you?

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.800
I'm Dave.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.800
Dave.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800
At this point, it's Quark.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.800
I'm Dave.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.800
All right.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.800
So have I taken any hit points from that leg sweep?

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800
No.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.800
You're just on the ground.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.800
It'll take you a bit to get up.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.800
All right.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:52.800
I get up.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.800
You leap to your feet.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.800
Well, well, well.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:58.800
Look who's back.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.800
Right?

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.800
Yeah.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.800
Yeah, it's me.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.800
I grab his.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.800
I clasp hands with him like in Billy G.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800
Yeah.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.800
And I throw you.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.800
I have throwing knives.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.800
I give him a throwing knife and I keep one for myself.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800
Okay.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.800
And we hold our hands together and we spin around in a circle.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.800
Why?

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:40.800
And then I leap in for, then I take my knife in a very un-gentlemanly, like, breach of contract.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800
I throw my knife at his face.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.800
Your tricky move seems to get the better of him, but does it hit?

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800
Nope.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800
Shit!

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.800
The knife whizzes past the head and plants itself in the machinery behind him.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800
Who are you?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.800
Who?

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.800
If I would have known you were going to be throwing knives, I wouldn't have shaved this morning.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800
My guy.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800
My guy.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.800
The guys trapped under the squid are cracking up.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.800
They love your antics.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800
Reduce person.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.800
Oh, reduced person.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800
That's a classic.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800
Dan Harmon uses it constantly.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800
What?

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800
No, I love him.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.800
I love him.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800
Don't boo me.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.800
You see the armored figure before you shrink down in a comical fashion.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.800
Is this a private party or should you pick on someone your own, Dave?

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.800
So you're about three feet tall now and a bit weaker.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.800
Mulraine attack!

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.800
I fire a single arrow.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.800
I use all of my focus and also I'm really beautiful while I'm doing it.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.800
At this point, you've accrued many magical arrows.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.800
So which one?

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.800
You got non-lethal arrows, good-lined arrows, sleep arrows, and VRs.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.800
You have this memorized?

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.800
I don't understand what's happening.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.800
I'm a dungeon master!

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.800
Oh, yeah.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.800
That's amazing.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.800
That's amazing.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.800
Oh, shit!

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800
I'll take his high fives.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.800
I'll take all of his high fives.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.800
Yeah!

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800
I stole him!

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800
Yeah!

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.800
Give him half of the high fives.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.800
Those are from those guys.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800
Yeah!

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.800
All right, so an arrow.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.800
A lot of different arrows coming at me.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.800
Yeah, so I have a sleepy arrow and a...

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:47.800
A good arrow.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800
All right.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.800
An arrow that's good for knocking people out but not killing them.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800
Okay.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.800
And an arrow that lends itself well for shooting two arrows at once.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.800
You should have fired that last time.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.800
And just to clarify, I'm wearing armor that has little doors in its butthole area and, like...

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.800
Did his armor shrink, too, or is he comically...

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800
No, he's caught...

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800
Like, it's like a child in it now.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800
He's clumsy.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800
Oh, because I'm three feet.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800
Yeah, but the armor's regular size.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.800
Well, dear Spencer,

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.800
I think I'm going to go ahead and do the two arrows.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800
Okay.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800
One of your arrows hits.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.800
The other hits the squid.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800
That's critical fails.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.800
Really quick, Spencer is really the best.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.800
He's one of the kindest, coolest people ever.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800
The shoe has not dropped.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.800
Spencer!

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.800
I needed some applause after the booing with the squid and everything.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800
I didn't mean to shoot the squid.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.800
I do a mysterious Emerald Dagger attack on Dave.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.800
You use your mysterious Emerald Dagger.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.800
You hit!

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.800
Suck on that, sword.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.800
Sword, sucker.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.800
You deal eight damage.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800
Not bad.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800
Not bad.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.800
All right.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.800
We got to kill Jason to dig.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800
Yeah, you do.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.800
You got to kill Dave.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.800
I'd like to be left out of this.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800
So it's my turn.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.800
It's your turn, Dave.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.800
Okay, and where am I standing?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800
You were standing, you can't move around too well.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800
Where did the arrow hit me?

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800
The one arrow that hit?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.800
I'd say it hit you in the clavicle.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800
Right in the clavicle.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.800
It's right in the bone.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.800
That's a weird thing.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.800
You're having trouble breathing probably.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.800
And then the Emerald Dagger comes at me.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.800
That's going to hit you right in the stomach.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.800
Even though it didn't hit your armor,

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.800
you feel quite injured from the blow.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.800
Yeah, not going to win out of me, at least.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.800
Okay.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800
Okay.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.800
At this point, I have no other option.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800
What's going on?

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800
The squid still got my three boys on lockdown?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800
Yeah.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800
They do.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.800
Even though one of the arrows hit the squid,

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.800
three guys.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.800
One squid.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800
Even if the squid was dead, it'd still be doing that.

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.800
Yeah, good point.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.800
It's heavy.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800
Heavy squid.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.800
And they're over there.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.800
They're struggling.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.800
They're awake.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800
They can laugh at jokes, but they're also...

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.800
Okay.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.800
So then at this point, I've got to...

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.800
I know this ship better than these guys do.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.800
So I've got to say that what?

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800
Breathe with the squid.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.800
No.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800
Why didn't we think of that?

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800
No, I feel...

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800
You need Jeff's money.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.800
Do what you want to do.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800
Live my own life, yeah.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.800
Follow the beat of your own drummer, Dave.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.800
I never knew D&D was as much like Price is Right.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.800
I didn't know that element of it.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.800
The kitty litter.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.800
The kitty litter.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.800
Go Ohio State.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.800
Let's see.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.800
I would like to...

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.800
I would like to...

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:29.800
I'd like to take off the headrest where I was captaining.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800
The headrest there.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.800
If I hit that button, I pull it up and I can get the two things.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800
Like you're having a lot of cars.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800
Of course.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.800
I use that as a weapon to go after Jeff.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.800
Quick reminder, you do own...

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.800
Oh, I have my ax.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.800
You know what?

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.800
We're going to leave that thing where it is for now.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800
And I'm going to use the sharp side of the ax

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.800
instead of the blunt side like I missed with earlier.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.800
And I'm coming after Nex.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.800
I'm going after everybody's Nex.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800
Who's Nex?

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800
Who's Nex?

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.800
Pick a neck number one.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800
So that would be the dagger guy.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.800
Okay.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.800
That's me.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800
Bold move.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800
I know his name is Jeff, but I don't know if you're caring.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800
Quark.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800
Quark.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800
Quark.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.800
Quark.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.800
Quark.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.800
This is my name.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.800
Quark.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.800
The ax strikes you right in the chest, but it pings off your armor.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800
Fuck you.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.800
So I missed his neck?

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.800
No, you hit him right in the chest.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.800
It was a bit low.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800
His neck was a bit low.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.800
You're really short.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.800
Oh, I'm really short, right?

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.800
Yeah, you're used to swinging higher.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.800
Why didn't I go for dicks?

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800
I should have went for dicks.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.800
Ankle's Nex.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800
Obnoxious.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.800
You don't think of these things when you're short.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.800
You're like, the world's the same, but it's not.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.800
It's different.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.800
The squid is dead.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:55.800
Ray of Frost.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:20.800
Sorry about that.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.800
It hits him right in the eye.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.800
His eyeball freezes over.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:32.800
He takes three damage and loss loses the use of one eye.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800
That was a good shot.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.800
I think for all that rapping, it should have been better.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.800
Three is the maximum damage Ray of Frost can heal.

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.800
It's a level zero spell.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.800
Jesus, it comes out now.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800
It gets a theme song, though.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.800
It gets a theme song?

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.800
That's the dilemma with Dungeons & Dragons.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.800
The things they're most familiar with are the shittiest things.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.800
That's not just Dungeons & Dragons.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.800
That's every relationship.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.800
Billion burgers sold.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800
Controversial.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800
McDonald's insult.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800
Controversial.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800
McDonald's slam.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800
Whose turn is it?

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.800
I don't know.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800
I'm down an eye.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800
My death perception is nuts.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800
With a sword, an axe, I'm in bad shape.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800
You're already shorter.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:36.800
First I grab a quark and sharpies hands and grip them.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.800
Oh my god, this hippie shit.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.800
As if to say, I got it.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.800
Then I take an arrow, the good arrow.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:52.800
I take the good arrow and I shoot it at his other eye.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:04.800
Critical hit.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.800
Olivia Wilde's too pretty for anybody.

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.800
No, but pretty enough for you.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.800
But that fucking angel, you're dating a goddess.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.800
You're going to live forever or die immediately.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800
Who knows?

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800
Well, he's blind now, right?

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800
Oh no, he's dead.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.800
He's dead, he's gone.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:36.800
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Spencer and the Dungeons & Dragons.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.800
Erin McGathy.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.800
Jason's dance stage, we're getting about that time.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.800
Spencer, everybody, I'll get the character sheets.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.800
That was a goodie.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.800
That was crazy.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.800
Jason, I hope it's not weird later.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800
Spencer, I want to go with your browser history.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.800
It's so fucking bad right now, brother.

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.800
I swear to god.

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:06.800
Erin McGathy, everyone.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.800
Tough on squids.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.800
Tough on squids.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.800
All right, Dan, we're getting about that time.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.800
Maybe it's towards the, you know, for the final.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:25.800
Can I tell you a fantasy of mine?

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.800
It involves Olivia Wilde.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.800
No, no, no.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.800
I couldn't place her in a lineup.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.800
I wish them the best.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:36.800
You'd still pick her if you saw her.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800
I would.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.800
That's not...

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:44.800
Wilde Slam.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.800
Fiance Slam.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:50.800
Fiance Slam. Shivery Slam.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.800
People are tightly packed together and I just want to, like, I could do it very carefully.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.800
I'm sure they have a rule against it.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.800
But if I just, like, is there a dog paddle version of a stage dive?

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.800
Or you could just kind of, like, just very carefully, very carefully do it?

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.800
Yeah, you could do this.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.800
I'm 40 years old. I just want to...

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.800
I'm 40!

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.800
All right, let's...

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800
I don't want anyone to...

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:21.800
Hang on, let me find the...

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.800
I'm not gonna jump onto you.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.800
It'll be, like, when you learn to swim.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.800
But go backwards so people don't, like, you know, inadvertently grab, you know, getting balls.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.800
Keep in mind, he's been on a tour bus for about a week and a half right now.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800
It's a little...

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800
Yeah, yeah, Joan.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800
Cover your...

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.800
Use one hand to cover your nose.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.800
All right, here's the Dido Rihanna rap, if you guys know the chorus.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.800
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:51.800
Also, Jason, if you want to sing the hook, it'd be Dido for us.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:57.800
I'll put this brown, come on down to harvest Brooklyn, more like Brooklyn.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.800
It's my home.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.800
I want to go from place to place, home to home.

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.800
I want to fuck your mama so far in space that she comes back down and says,

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.800
you should give me some laces to put onto my shoes.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:15.800
I know I want to fuck your mama till her pussy turns to boobs and then drink it cup by cup.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.800
But fuck your mama so hard that she turns into a pop.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.800
It's a, come on down to hard.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.800
Bad rap.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.800
Upside down.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:26.800
Bad rapping.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.800
He is yellow blue and brown.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:29.800
Yo.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.800
Come on down to hard.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.800
Gonna do a low stakes, gentle stage dive.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.800
Just gonna go up to the edge and make it come alive.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.800
Gonna crawl like a little dog paddle.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.800
Gonna just go out there.

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.800
It's gonna be like a raffle.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.800
They're very, very careful.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800
They're very careful.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.800
Everyone's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.800
Come on down to the hard man's town.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.800
Turn up brown.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.800
Upside down.

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800
Wait, I gotta go backwards.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:58.800
Turn up brown.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.800
Come on down to the hard man's town.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.800
Space cosmos.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.800
See a humanity.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800
Rockin' Brooklyn.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.800
I want to do reality.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800
Fuck your mama.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.800
Fuck your daddy.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.800
Fuck your dad.

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.800
Holy shit.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.800
I feel like SidHarmon Baghdad.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.800
Worshiping me. Worship my ass.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.800
Who took my wallet?

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:18.800
Fuck you.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800
I'll be back for it.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.800
Oh shit.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.800
I love Brooklyn.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:22.800
Oh shit.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.800
New York.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:24.800
God damn it.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:25.800
Do a stage dive.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.800
What do we do now?

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.800
Come on down to the hard man's town.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.800
Take me back.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800
Turn up brown.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.800
Upside down.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800
Put me back.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.800
Be the yellow blue and brown.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.800
Come on down to the hard man's town.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800
Oh shit.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.800
Yeah.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.800
Yeah.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.800
Holy shit.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.800
Dreams come true.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.800
Dreams come true in Brooklyn.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800
Yeah.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.800
Yeah.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.800
You could just do that?

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.800
Yeah.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.800
That's fucking amazing.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:02.800
I always thought that was like a David Blaine thing where you had to look at a certain

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800
angle.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.800
That was crazy.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.800
All right.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.800
That was a legitimate stage dive.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.800
There was no asterisk next to that.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.800
I don't want you like when people are like did you ever stage dive and be like well yeah

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
kind.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800
No you did it.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.800
I mean I was being like everyone should experience that.

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.800
Okay we're open till 3 a.m. everyone come up line up here.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.800
Wait after another.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.800
It's like a trust exercise.

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.800
It's a five dollar donation.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.800
Everyone has to do that.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800
All right.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800
Jeff we're tired of the rat.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.800
Obviously I'm getting worse and worse at the rap and like we wanted to try something different

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800
tonight in Brooklyn.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.800
They call it Music City Brooklyn.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.800
The typewriter was invented here.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.800
I don't know if you know that.

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.800
They called the south of the north.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.800
The sandwich was invented here.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:57.800
Brooklyn famous for its hats and sandwiches.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:02.800
But we weren't trying to end with like a gentler like this new song.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.800
This rap, this Ditto Rihanna rap we can continue to do it city to city.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.800
We have a friend here that we should bring up before we do that.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.800
Is Herbie here?

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800
Our old buddy Herbie.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.800
Mark Herbie to the stage please.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.800
Mark Herbie everybody.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.800
Grab your six string.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:20.800
And is there some dude who will help you.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.800
You know this is a stage dive in the opposite way.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.800
This is a reverse tootsie stage dive.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.800
Mark we all met.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:31.800
The reason we were in New York and it was remiss to not bring one of our friends up.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:36.800
I know Dan through I think comedy sports is an improv thing.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:37.800
Three of you.

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.800
I did it for the Los Angeles chapter.

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.800
You were Kansas City Jason.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.800
Dan was Milwaukee.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800
You were originally Madison right?

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.800
Yeah, Madison.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.800
And then I met you guys when you were the cool kids from the New York thing.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.800
And you were an awesome group.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800
No you're not.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.800
But you were an awesome sketch group called Burt Frischner's.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.800
Which is the funniest fucking sketch show I've ever seen in my life.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.800
I'll never forget it.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.800
Mark go find your axe back there.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800
We'll mic you up if we can.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.800
Go get your shine box.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.800
I don't know.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.800
It's like that.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.800
Yeah, shit has changed up here.

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.800
No, but wasn't there also a dude who showed up with a bag of instruments.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.800
Just like a stranger.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.800
Like a dude back here.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.800
Can you make your way up?

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.800
Is that Brett?

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.800
We heard about a guy that was in line and he brought a bag of instruments.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.800
What could possibly go wrong with that?

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.800
This isn't going to be like a Little Feet concert.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.800
We're not...

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.800
We're just trying to change it up.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.800
We're going to make things a little more tender.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.800
Alright, so this will go out in the crowd.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.800
This is a brand new song here.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.800
Dan?

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.800
Yeah.

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.800
Whenever you're ready, let me know.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.800
Do you want to do a little preamble?

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.800
Fire it up because let's just do it bad.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:33:04.800
Okay, here we go.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.800
I love you.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.800
I love me.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.800
Drink my poo.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:11.800
Eat my pee.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.800
In Harmontown.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.800
Don't want to do nothing wrong.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:20.800
I see Brooklyn coming at me with style.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.800
I love everyone here.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.800
I see their eyes and their smiles.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:27.800
And I just want to reach out to them and welcome them to Harmontown.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:31.800
Please take the subway to Harmontown.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.800
Everybody say Harmontown.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.800
Everybody say Harmontown.

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.800
P is yellow and poop is brown.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.800
That's when you know that you've gotten to Harmontown.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.800
I never wanted to be like this.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.800
I just want to know that I can drink a cup of piss with your mama's big fat titties

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.800
and give her a squeeze of this.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.800
I don't know what I'm singing, but I want to do this.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.800
Everybody wants to hear my name.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:04.800
I just want to play a game of Dungeons and Dragons.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.800
Fuck it, I'm fucking up.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.800
I'm just speaking softly and I don't care.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.800
Cause we're going down to Harmontown.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.800
Everybody say Harmontown.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:19.800
Everybody say Harmontown.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.800
Everybody say Harmontown.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.800
Where pee is yellow and poop is always brown.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.800
I want your mama to make love to me.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.800
I want to sit her on the lap in my knee.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.800
I want to take a big fat ass and throw it to the moon.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.800
And bring her back and make love to her soon.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.800
Cause I'm from a place called Harmontown.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.800
And I'm from a place called Harmontown.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.800
I fucked your mama at a restaurant called Ground Round.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.800
Where you pay what you weigh and it's...

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.800
I fucked your mama till she fell apart.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.800
I fucked your mama till I laid a fight on her face.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.800
I don't love your mama, but I respect her.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.800
Sorry.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:10.800
Everybody say Harmontown.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.800
Everybody talking Harmontown.

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.800
Where pee is yellow and poop is brown.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.800
I want the fuck I'm going to lift up the Harmontown.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.800
Thank you for coming to Harmontown tonight everybody.

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.800

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.800
Thanks for cramming into a badass room.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.800
Thank you to the Bell House in Brooklyn.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:38.800
Thank you to Brett over here on The Percussion.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.800

Eddie Federer in the front row.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.800
Mark Hervey on guitar.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.800
Spencer of the band.
