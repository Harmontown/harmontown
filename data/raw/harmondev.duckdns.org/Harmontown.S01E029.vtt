08:53.040\nI wanted the support.\n\n08:53.040 --> 08:53.760\nWhat's your name?\n\n08:53.760 --> 08:54.280\nMaya.\n\n08:54.280 --> 08:54.840\nMaya?\n\n08:54.840 --> 08:55.600\nOh, nice.\n\n08:55.600

--> 09:02.280\nBlacks again.\n\n09:02.280 --> 09:02.920\nBlacks again?\n\n09:02.920 --> 09:05.920\nOh, so you're doing the whole American melting thing.\n\n09:05.920 --> 09:07.400\nYou got a line up here.\n\n09:07.400 --> 09:07.900\nYeah.\n\n09:07.900 --> 09:08.400\nGood.\n\n09:08.400 --> 09:11.320\nYeah, this is one-stop shopping.\n\n09:11.320 --> 09:13.160\nAre you from Brooklyn, Maya?\n\n09:13.160 --> 09:14.520\nI'm from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n09:14.520 --> 09:15.000\nWhoa!\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:18.720\nWhere were you?\n\n09:18.720 --> 09:20.720\nSo I'm going to talk to you about the Civil War.\n\n09:25.280 --> 09:27.240\nYou didn't escape it.\n\n09:27.240 --> 09:28.000\nWho won?\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.160\nI can't even, I don't know.\n\n09:29.160 --> 09:32.440\nWe came back from there, and I think the answer is pretty quick.\n\n09:32.440 --> 09:34.880\nWe're still trying to figure that one out.\n\n09:34.880 --> 09:37.720\nIt was weird down there to just like, it's more of a joke.\n\n09:37.720 --> 09:40.480\nYou can make more of a joke about racism up here.\n\n09:40.480 --> 09:43.920\nI think not because we're heroes, because we weren't involved.\n\n09:43.920 --> 09:46.040\nLike, Brooklyn's role in the Civil War\n\n09:46.040 --> 09:47.920\nwas that they were getting high and eating sandwiches,\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:49.840\nand they said, you know what, slavery should be illegal.\n\n09:49.840 --> 09:52.160\nAnd then, like, meanwhile, down there,\n\n09:52.160 --> 09:55.280\nlike, everyone's dying and shit's happening.\n\n09:55.280 --> 09:59.120\nMy clothes are more expensive for some reason.\n\n09:59.120 --> 10:01.680\nNew York had it pretty hard with the racial rights,\n\n10:01.680 --> 10:03.960\nthe draft rights, and stuff like that.\n\n10:03.960 --> 10:07.880\nGangs in New York, that movie, Si.\n\n10:07.880 --> 10:09.400\nI like that they would just do a shot walking down\n\n10:09.400 --> 10:11.880\nthe five points, and there'd be nobody on the streets.\n\n10:11.880 --> 10:15.120\nThat really sparsely populated area.\n\n10:15.120 --> 10:16.920\nWell, they cleared the streets because the gangs\n\n10:16.920 --> 10:17.720\nwere going to have a fight.\n\n10:17.720 --> 10:19.480\nI thought it was a, I don't know,\n\n10:19.480 --> 10:21.480\nScorsese can't really do any wrong by me.\n\n10:21.480 --> 10:22.400\nMartin Scorsese's here.\n\n10:22.400 --> 10:24.160\nLet's have a hand for him.\n\n10:24.160 --> 10:26.800\nHe's not here.\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:28.880\nWho's that there's a chair down in

11:22.120\nWe're used to being the backdrop.\n\n11:22.120 --> 11:26.880\nIt's, it's okay for her to play that card.\n\n11:26.880 --> 11:30.040\nI brought her up literally as the black

are you most afraid of?\n\n11:57.360 --> 12:00.120\nBeing a failure.\n\n12:00.120 --> 12:03.080\nI would have said spiders.\n\n12:03.080 --> 12:05.920\nThese spiders, you just, you're just a badass with spiders.\n\n12:05.920 --> 12:06.800\nI'm okay with spiders.\n\n12:06.800 --> 12:07.960\nI hate snakes though.\n\n12:07.960 --> 12:11.160\nOkay, snakes and being a failure.\n\n12:11.160 --> 12:15.680\nMaya, let's do a scene from Eddie Geller's early childhood.\n\n12:15.680 --> 12:17.760\nLet's, let's, let's, do you have any theatrical background?\n\n12:17.760 --> 12:19.640\nDo you, do you think you can hold your own?\n\n12:19.640 --> 12:20.920\n12 years old summer camp.\n\n12:20.920 --> 12:22.600\nOkay, so 12 year old, sorry.\n\n12:22.600 --> 12:25.280\nAll right, so I'll be, I'll be 10 year old Eddie Geller.\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:27.560\nAnd we're going to do the scene where he learned to be afraid\n\n12:27.560 --> 12:28.760\nof snakes and failure.\n\n12:37.760 --> 12:42.560\nMommy, why are you so much more ethnic than me?\n\n12:42.560 --> 12:50.200\nIt was the immaculate conception again.\n\n12:50.200 --> 12:56.880\nI, I never knew my dad, but I just wanted you to know that I love you.\n\n12:56.880 --> 13:02.800\nToday's my first day of school.\n\n13:02.800 --> 13:10.960\nDo you want to give me a pencil or like any clothes?\n\n13:10.960 --> 13:14.400\nNo.\n\n13:14.400 --> 13:18.080\nBut wait.\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:19.560\nNo.\n\n13:19.560 --> 13:20.560\nSnakes.\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:21.560\nSnakes.\n\n13:21.560 --> 13:22.560\nNo.\n\n13:22.560 --> 13:25.560\nWell, that explains everything.\n\n13:25.560 --> 13:37.800\nI, I guess, I guess that, I guess that makes sense.\n\n13:37.800 --> 13:41.960\nI guess it's okay for you to leave a gaping seat open in the front of the\n\n13:41.960 --> 13:45.760\ntotally phase me out, my first show in Brooklyn.\n\n13:45.760 --> 13:49.880\nAll right, Maya, what's your biggest ambition?\n\n13:49.880 --> 13:51.040\nWhat's your biggest dream?\n\n13:51.040 --> 13:54.800\nWell, that puts you on the spot, doesn't it?\n\n13:54.800 --> 13:55.800\nIt happened.\n\n13:55.800 --> 13:57.240\nOh, you've, you, you're like me.\n\n13:57.240 --> 13:58.240\nYou've lived your dreams.\n\n13:58.240 --> 13:59.240\nYeah.\n\n13:59.240 --> 14:02.400\nLike I turned 40 and I got, I got to do a tour and play in this hip\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:03.400\nroom in Brooklyn.\n\n14:03.400 --> 14:05.400\nI'm just making up shit to do before I get hit by a car.\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:07.640\nLike I already had a TV show.\n\n14:07.640 --> 14:08.640\nI didn't deserve that.\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:09.640\nI got fired from it.\n\n14:09.640 --> 14:10.640\nThey finally caught up to it.\n\n14:10.640 --> 14:11.640\nNo, I wasn't fishing for that.\n\n14:11.640 --> 14:12.640\nI wasn't fishing for that.\n\n14:12.640 --> 14:13.640\nStop it.\n\n14:13.640 --> 14:14.640\nIt's not what I.\n\n14:14.640 --> 14:26.760\nMommy, why did NBC fire me?\n\n14:26.760 --> 14:28.440\nBecause they have no sense.\n\n14:28.440 --> 14:30.440\nThank you, mommy.\n\n14:30.440 --> 14:32.640\nSnakes.\n\n14:32.640 --> 14:36.520\nWe're not so different, Eddie Geller.\n\n14:36.520 --> 14:38.520\nI'm your shadow father.\n\n14:38.520 --> 14:39.520\nOkay.\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:43.080\nWell, so, so, so Maya, like, well, I don't know.\n\n14:43.080 --> 14:45.400\nSo you, you, you, you really mean that you feel, you feel pretty\n\n14:45.400 --> 14:46.400\nself-actualized?\n\n14:46.400 --> 14:47.400\nUh, self-actualized.\n\n14:47.400 --> 14:52.040\nI mean, I live in Brooklyn and I'm a writer.\n\n14:52.040 --> 14:53.040\nHow self-actual.\n\n14:53.040 --> 14:54.040\nYeah.\n\n14:54.040 --> 14:55.040\nCan't get better than that.\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:59.640\nI, I, I, I, if I ever thought I was truly successful, I would move to New York and try\n\n14:59.640 --> 15:00.640\nto be a writer here.\n\n15:00.640 --> 15:02.640\nBecause that's the real, the real writer thing.\n\n15:02.640 --> 15:03.640\nYeah.\n\n15:03.640 --> 15:05.640\nI don't understand why you're not here.\n\n15:05.640 --> 15:07.640\nShut the fuck up.\n\n15:07.640 --> 15:14.640\nIs that real enough for you?\n\n15:14.640 --> 15:19.120\nI just mind doing a bunch of heroin and jerking off on them.\n\n15:19.120 --> 15:20.120\nAll in one motion?\n\n15:20.120 --> 15:21.120\nUh, yeah.\n\n15:21.120 --> 15:25.200\nThat's, that's, when, when I feel like I have that maneuvered down, I'll move to New\n\n15:25.200 --> 15:26.200\nYork.\n\n15:26.200 --> 15:30.960\nUh, I'll start with a nice little place in Queens and I'll, I'll, I'll just jerk off\n\n15:30.960 --> 15:34.640\nfor a while and then I'll, and then I'll add heroin to it.\n\n15:34.640 --> 15:35.640\nLike a.\n\n15:35.640 --> 15:36.640\nAll in one motion.\n\n15:36.640 --> 15:38.640\nSo what, what kind of stuff do you write?\n\n15:38.640 --> 15:41.640\nUh, I write a lot of lies.\n\n15:41.640 --> 15:44.000\nSo fiction, but I'm working on a screenplay.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nWhat kind of fiction?\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.640\nUm, long fiction, but I'm working on a screenplay.\n\n15:47.640 --> 15:48.640\nOh, long fiction, working on a screenplay.\n\n15:48.640 --> 15:50.640\nWho is it working on a screenplay?\n\n15:50.640 --> 15:51.640\nAnybody else?\n\n15:51.640 --> 15:57.640\nThat, that, that would be everybody in LA.\n\n15:57.640 --> 16:00.440\nThat's night, that's another nice thing about New York is that there's lots of creativity\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:01.440\nhappening here.\n\n16:01.440 --> 16:05.480\nThere are a couple of people lifting things for a living and that, like, like someone has\n\n16:05.480 --> 16:09.840\nto, like, that's, that's the nice, like it's a real city that you feel like isn't, like,\n\n16:09.840 --> 16:13.560\nlike if Spielberg, uh, moves, it won't fall apart immediately.\n\n16:13.560 --> 16:16.600\nLike, I was really like, you walk down the street in Los Angeles and you're like, what's\n\n16:16.600 --> 16:22.440\ngoing to happen if he decides to go to Vermont like, like, uh, for, for more than a summer?\n\n16:22.440 --> 16:23.440\nSpielberg lives.\n\n16:23.440 --> 16:26.440\nSpielberg lives everywhere, my friends.\n\n16:26.440 --> 16:27.440\nSpielberg is here.\n\n16:27.440 --> 16:28.440\nLet's bring him out.\n\n16:28.440 --> 16:32.440\nHe's not here.\n\n16:32.440 --> 16:33.440\nSorry.\n\n16:33.440 --> 16:34.440\nYeah, I know.\n\n16:34.440 --> 16:35.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n16:35.440 --> 16:40.440\nWell, well, you know, maybe, maybe if, uh, maybe if you pray real hard, it'll come out.\n\n16:40.440 --> 16:41.440\nI don't know.\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:42.440\nHow does it, how does movies work?\n\n16:42.440 --> 16:43.440\nLike you clap your hands or something.\n\n16:43.440 --> 16:44.440\nSwirling violence.\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:45.440\nYeah, yeah.\n\n16:45.440 --> 16:46.440\nAnd things happen.\n\n16:46.440 --> 16:47.440\nYeah.\n\n16:47.440 --> 16:51.440\nIf we get a crane in here and like make a big enough shot, like he'll come out.\n\n16:51.440 --> 16:52.440\nUm, all right.\n\n16:52.440 --> 16:55.440\nWell, so you're, you're, uh, can I, can I give you any help writing your screenplay?\n\n16:55.440 --> 16:57.440\nAre you stuck on any part?\n\n16:57.440 --> 16:59.440\nUm, I'm like an expert.\n\n16:59.440 --> 17:02.440\nYou're an expert.\n\n17:02.440 --> 17:03.440\nThank you, baby.\n\n17:03.440 --> 17:05.440\nMonster house fans.\n\n17:05.440 --> 17:06.440\nThe house is a monster.\n\n17:06.440 --> 17:11.440\nI don't know how I come up with this shit.\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:13.440\nHouses aren't supposed to be monsters.\n\n17:13.440 --> 17:16.440\nYou're supposed to live in those motherfuckers.\n\n17:16.440 --> 17:18.440\nWhat if they ate you?\n\n17:18.440 --> 17:20.440\nIt's Rob Schrab's idea.\n\n17:20.440 --> 17:23.440\nOh, where can you help me?\n\n17:23.440 --> 17:25.440\nWhere can you help me?\n\n17:25.440 --> 17:26.440\nHow should it end?\n\n17:26.440 --> 17:27.440\nAll right.\n\n17:27.440 --> 17:28.440\nGood.\n\n17:28.440 --> 17:29.440\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n17:29.440 --> 17:34.440\nCan you tell me a little bit what it's about so that I can?\n\n17:34.440 --> 17:40.440\nUh, it is about a woman who was born with the voice of a man.\n\n17:40.440 --> 17:42.440\nThis sounds like a terrible idea.\n\n17:42.440 --> 17:43.440\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n17:43.440 --> 17:44.440\nI'm kidding.\n\n17:44.440 --> 17:45.440\nIt's a stupid, cheap joke.\n\n17:45.440 --> 17:46.440\nWhatever she said.\n\n17:46.440 --> 17:47.440\nI'm going to send that.\n\n17:47.440 --> 17:51.440\nA woman with the voice of a man, like literally physically, like she, when she speaks, she\n\n17:51.440 --> 17:52.440\nsounds like a dude.\n\n17:52.440 --> 17:54.440\nSounds like a metaphor for like.\n\n17:54.440 --> 17:55.440\nOh, it's no metaphor.\n\n17:55.440 --> 17:56.440\nOkay.\n\n17:56.440 --> 17:58.440\nIs it based on a friend of yours?\n\n17:58.440 --> 17:59.440\nYes.\n\n17:59.440 --> 18:00.440\nOh, okay.\n\n18:00.440 --> 18:01.440\nSo she just has a lower register voice.\n\n18:01.440 --> 18:03.440\nShe sounds like a straight up dude.\n\n18:03.440 --> 18:04.440\nOh, okay.\n\n18:04.440 --> 18:05.440\nLike this.\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:06.440\nAnd so, all right, so.\n\n18:06.440 --> 18:08.440\nThe most beautiful woman you've ever seen.\n\n18:08.440 --> 18:09.440\nAll right.\n\n18:09.440 --> 18:13.440\nSo does she cross a threshold of starting to sound like a dude?\n\n18:13.440 --> 18:15.440\nNo, there's no threshold.\n\n18:15.440 --> 18:18.440\nSo it's like fade in on a woman that sounds like a guy.\n\n18:18.440 --> 18:19.440\nAnd then like.\n\n18:19.440 --> 18:20.440\nFade in.\n\n18:20.440 --> 18:21.440\nRight.\n\n18:21.440 --> 18:22.440\nSo then what happens?\n\n18:22.440 --> 18:24.440\nLike what separates the Peter Weller from the Robocop?\n\n18:24.440 --> 18:28.440\nLike what's the, what's the, what's the threshold?\n\n18:28.440 --> 18:30.440\nI'm a very pedantic screenwriter.\n\n18:30.440 --> 18:32.440\nLike I'm very structured.\n\n18:32.440 --> 18:35.440\nLike so we have to cross like when does Jaws roll into Amity?\n\n18:35.440 --> 18:39.440\nWhen does, you know, what's the yellow brick road that we start going down?\n\n18:39.440 --> 18:41.440\nLike what's the point where we realize?\n\n18:41.440 --> 18:42.440\nOh shit.\n\n18:42.440 --> 18:48.440\nShe sounds like a guy, but now she's got to work as a telemarketer and all female.\n\n18:48.440 --> 18:50.440\nShe does Gillette commercials.\n\n18:50.440 --> 18:51.440\nGillette commercials.\n\n18:51.440 --> 18:54.440\nAnd like selling rates, so it's like a reverse tootsie.\n\n18:54.440 --> 18:55.440\nYes.\n\n18:55.440 --> 18:56.440\nOkay.\n\n18:56.440 --> 18:57.440\nShe gets a job.\n\n18:57.440 --> 18:59.440\nThat's how we're selling it is reverse tootsie.\n\n18:59.440 --> 19:01.440\nThat's how anything good thing should be sold.\n\n19:01.440 --> 19:07.440\nI thought our reverse tootsie is when you poop on somebody's chest.\n\n19:07.440 --> 19:10.440\nYou can get a reverse tootsie in Brooklyn for $40.\n\n19:10.440 --> 19:12.440\nSame as in town.\n\n19:12.440 --> 19:14.440\nCan you demonstrate what that is as well?\n\n19:14.440 --> 19:15.440\nYeah.\n\n19:15.440 --> 19:16.440\nYeah.\n\n19:16.440 --> 19:20.440\nFor those of you listening at home, I'm putting my ankle above my neck.\n\n19:20.440 --> 19:22.440\nAnd my hand is reaching down.\n\n19:22.440 --> 19:24.440\nI'm putting my middle finger up my asshole.\n\n19:24.440 --> 19:25.440\nYeah.\n\n19:25.440 --> 19:26.440\nHoly shit.\n\n19:26.440 --> 19:29.440\nAnd now if I could just reach my...\n\n19:29.440 --> 19:30.440\nYeah.\n\n19:30.440 --> 19:31.440\nYeah.\n\n19:31.440 --> 19:33.440\nReverse tootsie.\n\n19:33.440 --> 19:35.440\nAll right.\n\n19:35.440 --> 19:38.440\nEnjoy that in Nashville.\n\n19:38.440 --> 19:39.440\nAll right.\n\n19:39.440 --> 19:40.440\nYou've never added in Nashville.\n\n19:40.440 --> 19:41.440\nAll right.\n\n19:41.440 --> 19:42.440\nSo how should it end?\n\n19:42.440 --> 19:43.440\nOkay.\n\n19:43.440 --> 19:44.440\nWell, I assume it should end with...\n\n19:44.440 --> 19:45.440\nOkay.\n\n19:45.440 --> 19:46.440\nSo I'm assuming like she...\n\n19:46.440 --> 19:47.440\nOkay.\n\n19:47.440 --> 19:48.440\nShe talks like a guy.\n\n19:48.440 --> 19:49.440\nShe sounds like a guy.\n\n19:49.440 --> 19:52.440\nShe goes down a road of trials and she meets with some goddess, blah, blah, blah.\n\n19:52.440 --> 19:53.440\nI'm not...\n\n19:53.440 --> 19:54.440\nAll right.\n\n19:54.440 --> 19:59.440\nSo she's happy at a certain point that she does sound like a guy or either that.\n\n19:59.440 --> 20:03.440\nIf it faded in on her sounding like a guy, the threshold might be her starting to sound\n\n20:03.440 --> 20:06.440\nlike a woman successfully, at which point at the midpoint she...\n\n20:06.440 --> 20:07.440\nHold on a second.\n\n20:07.440 --> 20:08.440\nAre you taking notes?\n\n20:08.440 --> 20:09.440\nAll right.\n\n20:09.440 --> 20:10.440\nSo...\n\n20:10.440 --> 20:12.440\nHave you already written this movie?\n\n20:12.440 --> 20:13.440\nYeah.\n\n20:13.440 --> 20:14.440\nAll right.\n\n20:14.440 --> 20:15.440\nShe's

I can try that.\n\n35:03.440 --> 35:07.440\nAnd the winner for fired off of most television series.\n\n35:11.440 --> 35:13.440\nThe Golden Globe goes to Dan Harmon.\n\n35:13.440 --> 35:15.440\nHey.\n\n35:15.440 --> 35:17.440\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n35:19.440 --> 35:21.440\nThank you for this award.\n\n35:21.440 --> 35:23.440\nI know that you don't care.\n\n35:25.440 --> 35:27.440\nI accept it. I really appreciate it.\n\n35:29.440 --> 35:31.440\nI'm going home now. Thank you.\n\n35:31.440 --> 35:33.440\nThere. That's not so hard, is it?\n\n35:33.440 --> 35:37.440\nI feel like there should be a sign above the doorway you go through\n\n35:37.440 --> 35:41.440\nbefore you accept the award that says they don't care.\n\n35:41.440 --> 35:43.440\nJust as a reminder, really quick.\n\n35:43.440 --> 35:45.440\nIt's going to sound like they care.\n\n35:45.440 --> 35:47.440\nThere's a lot of actors out there applauding you.\n\n35:47.440 --> 35:49.440\nAnd People Magazine cares.\n\n35:49.440 --> 35:51.440\nAnd TMZ cares.\n\n35:51.440 --> 35:55.440\nBut largely not enough people that are watching care for you to go out and...\n\n35:55.440 --> 35:57.440\nI missed what happened. What did you do?\n\n35:57.440 --> 35:59.440\nIt was just odd.\n\n35:59.440 --> 36:01.440\nIt was just odd. That's all.\n\n36:01.440 --> 36:05.440\nIt's the 950th odd moment in an award show's history.\n\n36:05.440 --> 36:09.440\nThe Golden Globes famously is the director of that decided\n\n36:09.440 --> 36:13.440\nthat they should seat people with really funny mismatchings.\n\n36:13.440 --> 36:15.440\nAnd there's a lot to booze on that table.\n\n36:15.440 --> 36:17.440\nI've only ever watched one.\n\n36:17.440 --> 36:19.440\nI think there may have been a bag of pills on her table.\n\n36:19.440 --> 36:23.440\nI just know that Annette Benning was absolutely shithouse drunk.\n\n36:23.440 --> 36:25.440\nBy the third thing.\n\n36:25.440 --> 36:29.440\nAnd she was sitting across from MC Hammer or somebody.\n\n36:29.440 --> 36:31.440\nAnnette Benning.\n\n36:31.440 --> 36:33.440\nDid Bubsy come out this year?\n\n36:33.440 --> 36:35.440\nWhat was she in?\n\n36:35.440 --> 36:37.440\nI don't know. It was a few years ago.\n\n36:37.440 --> 36:39.440\nI didn't watch him. I just watched the YouTube clip.\n\n36:39.440 --> 36:41.440\nIt was weird.\n\n36:41.440 --> 36:43.440\nShe quoted some SNL bit I've never seen.\n\n36:43.440 --> 36:45.440\nAnd then she...\n\n36:45.440 --> 36:47.440\nNot that I don't watch it every week.\n\n36:47.440 --> 36:49.440\nShe said, I'm 50. I'm 50.\n\n36:49.440 --> 36:51.440\nAnd then made this weird Jeff Goldblum face.\n\n36:51.440 --> 36:55.440\nHow did you know it was from SNL then?\n\n36:55.440 --> 36:57.440\nExcept my girlfriend told me that. She's 28.\n\n36:57.440 --> 36:59.440\nThat tracks. That tracks.\n\n36:59.440 --> 37:01.440\nThat's all it takes.\n\n37:01.440 --> 37:03.440\nThe internet would also have been acceptable.\n\n37:03.440 --> 37:05.440\nAll right. Let's do some old school.\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:07.440\nI tried to get Matlock on you.\n\n37:07.440 --> 37:09.440\nI said, well, how did you...\n\n37:09.440 --> 37:11.440\nIf you've never seen it.\n\n37:11.440 --> 37:13.440\nNo, you guys are safe. You're safe.\n\n37:13.440 --> 37:15.440\nYou're a comedic institution. You're fine.\n\n37:15.440 --> 37:17.440\nDan, name a couple of your favorite Jason Sudeikas sketches\n\n37:17.440 --> 37:19.440\nfrom the last season or two.\n\n37:19.440 --> 37:21.440\nI mean, you've known him for a good long time.\n\n37:21.440 --> 37:23.440\nI like his Joseph Biden impression.\n\n37:23.440 --> 37:25.440\nAll right.\n\n37:25.440 --> 37:27.440\nI like the funny tracksuit guy\n\n37:27.440 --> 37:29.440\nthat does the dancing\n\n37:29.440 --> 37:31.440\non the guy.\n\n37:31.440 --> 37:33.440\nAnd he says, say what?\n\n37:33.440 --> 37:35.440\nI thought about making him come out and do that.\n\n37:35.440 --> 37:37.440\nBut I was going to start rapping.\n\n37:37.440 --> 37:39.440\nAnd then he'd come out and do the tracksuit dance.\n\n37:39.440 --> 37:41.440\nBut I was like, you don't win.\n\n37:41.440 --> 37:43.440\nI was like, you don't win.\n\n37:43.440 --> 37:45.440\nI was like, you don't win.\n\n37:45.440 --> 37:47.440\nI was like, you don't win.\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:49.440\nI was like, you don't win.\n\n37:49.440 --> 37:51.440\nI was like, oh, you can do it.\n\n37:51.440 --> 37:53.440\nI was like, y'all, you can do it.\n\n37:53.440 --> 37:55.440\nThank you.\n\n37:55.440 --> 37:58.440\nThank you.\n\n37:58.440 --> 38:01.440\nYeah.\n\n38:03.440 --> 38:05.440\nDate line Brooklyn, New York.\n\n38:05.440 --> 38:07.440\nI fucked your momma with a spoon and a fork.\n\n38:07.440 --> 38:09.440\nI fucked your momma all the way to the bridge.\n\n38:09.440 --> 38:11.440\nFucked your momma so hard that Ford had had a wrench.\n\n38:11.440 --> 38:13.440\nShe was a Klingon.\n\n38:13.440 --> 38:15.440\nFucked her south.\n\n38:15.440 --> 38:19.440\nBut fuck your mama, I was all the rage, break down.\n\n38:19.440 --> 38:25.440\nThere are seven boroughs of New York, East Stanton,\n\n38:25.440 --> 38:31.440\nQueen Town, Poughkeepsie,\n\n38:31.440 --> 38:39.440\nOld Jersey, Bronx City, Stanton Island.\n\n38:39.440 --> 38:44.440\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, each of my fingers is a borough in New York.\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:47.440\nI got Queens on my thumb, it's a fork.\n\n38:47.440 --> 38:49.440\nI'm gonna stab my middle finger with it.\n\n38:49.440 --> 38:51.440\nThat Stanton Island, I don't give a fuck.\n\n38:51.440 --> 38:54.440\nShit, I gotta work on that, I gotta work on that.\n\n38:57.440 --> 39:00.440\nAnd by the end of the night, I'm gonna have,\n\n39:00.440 --> 39:03.440\nit's gonna be like a metaphor, like each of my fingers is a,\n\n39:03.440 --> 39:06.440\nit's a borough in New York, kind of a fucking sling rock with it.\n\n39:06.440 --> 39:08.440\nIt's a sling rock with my hand.\n\n39:08.440 --> 39:12.440\nEach one-fifth of my hand is a different borough.\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:14.440\nI'm gonna fucking do it.\n\n39:14.440 --> 39:18.440\nStanton Island is my thumb, get shit done.\n\n39:18.440 --> 39:20.440\nQueens, you know what I mean?\n\n39:20.440 --> 39:22.440\nMiddle finger, fuck you.\n\n39:22.440 --> 39:26.440\nStanton Island again, I can't fucking, Bronx.\n\n39:26.440 --> 39:27.440\nI think that'll loosen you up once you,\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:29.440\nonce you accept the other boroughs.\n\n39:29.440 --> 39:32.440\nLike that'll give you, different things to rhyme with.\n\n39:32.440 --> 39:34.440\nRing finger, straight downtown.\n\n39:34.440 --> 39:37.440\nGood fucking mama, Stanton Island.\n\n39:37.440 --> 39:39.440\nOoh.\n\n39:41.440 --> 39:43.440\nIt's close.\n\n39:43.440 --> 39:45.440\nDan, I think in the back of your head,\n\n39:45.440 --> 39:47.440\nyou were expecting to be bailed out by Jason\n\n39:47.440 --> 39:49.440\ncoming up and doing his little dance.\n\n39:49.440 --> 39:52.440\nAnd you were just kind of putting placeholders out there.\n\n39:52.440 --> 39:55.440\nNo, I don't put that, I don't put that on other performers.\n\n39:55.440 --> 39:57.440\nHe's up here as a guest.\n\n39:57.440 --> 39:59.440\nI don't care what anyone does.\n\n39:59.440 --> 40:08.440\nI think it is time for a Joe Biden rap.\n\n40:08.440 --> 40:10.440\nJoe Biden's gonna rap in a minute.\n\n40:10.440 --> 40:12.440\nI'm gonna set him up, then you're gonna be in it.\n\n40:12.440 --> 40:14.440\nJoe Biden's gonna do some rapping.\n\n40:14.440 --> 40:17.440\nIt's not gonna be hack, it's gonna be long lasted.\n\n40:17.440 --> 40:19.440\nYou'll be talking about it on the way home.\n\n40:19.440 --> 40:22.440\nJoe Biden's gonna rap, he's gonna do it alone.\n\n40:22.440 --> 40:24.440\nJoe Biden's gonna rap to the stage.\n\n40:24.440 --> 40:27.440\nJoe Biden, here it goes.\n\n40:27.440 --> 40:30.440\nI mean, you know, I...\n\n40:30.440 --> 40:32.440\nI appreciate the opportunity, Dan.\n\n40:32.440 --> 40:34.440\nIt's really great to be here.\n\n40:34.440 --> 40:37.440\nI'd really just like to talk about gun control,\n\n40:37.440 --> 40:39.440\nif that's all right.\n\n40:41.440 --> 40:43.440\nYeah!\n\n40:43.440 --> 40:45.440\nYou know, if it doesn't have to rhyme, it's easier for me.\n\n40:45.440 --> 40:47.440\nI just...\n\n40:47.440 --> 40:49.440\nSimple man, you know, I just...\n\n40:51.440 --> 40:52.440\nDoes NBC own that?\n\n40:52.440 --> 40:54.440\nAm I gonna have to license that?\n\n40:54.440 --> 40:56.440\nYeah, they have to ask...\n\n40:56.440 --> 40:58.440\nJoe Biden has to ask NBC if he can do it.\n\n40:58.440 --> 41:00.440\nIt's fine, it's Comcast.\n\n41:00.440 --> 41:01.440\nIt's Comcast.\n\n41:01.440 --> 41:03.440\nJason, I have a question.\n\n41:03.440 --> 41:06.440\nWhen you remember the cast, I know there's a lot of...\n\n41:06.440 --> 41:09.440\nI wouldn't say political stuff,\n\n41:09.440 --> 41:11.440\nbut it's hard to get your sketches in the show.\n\n41:11.440 --> 41:13.440\nYou can write a funny sketch, it may not make it in the show.\n\n41:13.440 --> 41:15.440\nAnd there's people that I think are probably,\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:17.440\nyou know, in the past have been more forward,\n\n41:17.440 --> 41:20.440\nbetter at getting their stuff into the reeds,\n\n41:20.440 --> 41:22.440\nmaking it past the reeds through his into the show,\n\n41:22.440 --> 41:24.440\nthan other people.\n\n41:24.440 --> 41:26.440\nBecause now it's written in stone\n\n41:26.440 --> 41:28.440\nthat the show is always going to start more or less\n\n41:28.440 --> 41:30.440\nwith a political piece.\n\n41:30.440 --> 41:32.440\nSo when a new political figure comes on the scene\n\n41:32.440 --> 41:34.440\nand you kind of look like that person,\n\n41:34.440 --> 41:36.440\nis it like the greatest day of your life?\n\n41:36.440 --> 41:38.440\nOh, I fucking got Biden.\n\n41:38.440 --> 41:41.440\nIt may be early, I think it probably is early on.\n\n41:41.440 --> 41:43.440\nI would say that...\n\n41:43.440 --> 41:45.440\nWell, for me, with Joe Biden,\n\n41:45.440 --> 41:48.440\nI played him in like Halloween of 2009\n\n41:48.440 --> 41:51.440\naround then because Barack Obama came to do the

good sport.\n\n51:49.080 --> 51:50.080\nThanks for being on my mom.\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:51.080\nOur moms are dead.\n\n51:51.080 --> 51:52.080\nAll right.\n\n51:52.080 --> 51:53.080\nAll right.\n\n51:53.080 --> 51:56.600\nCancer is the loony tunes of disease, brother.\n\n51:56.600 --> 52:01.840\nSpencer, get us up to date in our campaign if you would be so kind.\n\n52:01.840 --> 52:10.840\nStill, when we last met probably, do you want me to stop, Spencer?\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:12.280\nNo, I'm good.\n\n52:12.280 --> 52:16.880\nLast time are heroes.\n\n52:16.880 --> 52:22.160\nLast time our heroes had just reunited in the starboard side of the flying black airship,\n\n52:22.160 --> 52:25.240\nsirens blaring and canyons firing.\n\n52:25.240 --> 52:29.840\nAfter splitting up in a dramatic fashion, Quark had been infiltrating Dark Star's vessel,\n\n52:29.840 --> 52:35.120\nbut now together with the power of Buttsalot's teleporting cape, Sharpian Mulraine quickly\n\n52:35.120 --> 52:36.640\nported to Quark.\n\n52:36.640 --> 52:40.280\nBlasting open a large door, they worked their way through the ship.\n\n52:40.280 --> 52:45.600\nAfter facing down a nine-naked foe with a wicked whip, the party gained access to a room\n\n52:45.600 --> 52:46.600\nfull of lockers.\n\n52:46.600 --> 52:53.240\nThey found treasure from a Lute of Charming to some beads of force to some magic arrows.\n\n52:53.240 --> 52:58.320\nUsing a magical staff they found, the party ascended through some sort of hatch in the\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:09.640\nfloor.\n\n53:09.640 --> 53:11.360\nSo less dramatic.\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:15.240\nDo you guys remember you were in a room full of treasure, you found like this magic staff\n\n53:15.240 --> 53:20.680\nand you were writing it to the top?\n\n53:20.680 --> 53:21.680\nThat's just what happened.\n\n53:21.680 --> 53:22.680\nYeah.\n\n53:22.680 --> 53:25.680\nIf there's any bad guys or anything, Jason, you can play them.\n\n53:25.680 --> 53:29.080\nNo, I'm checking my shit.\n\n53:29.080 --> 53:33.880\nSo there's a hatch right above you, since you can't all pop through at the same time,\n\n53:33.880 --> 53:37.040\nso you're going to have to figure out an order to go in.\n\n53:37.040 --> 53:39.160\nAll right.\n\n53:39.160 --> 53:40.160\nLadies first.\n\n53:40.160 --> 53:41.160\nAh, thank you.\n\n53:41.160 --> 53:42.160\nYou just...\n\n53:42.160 --> 53:43.160\nNewly lady.\n\n53:43.160 --> 53:44.160\nJason, I just turned into a woman.\n\n53:44.160 --> 53:45.160\nOh, that's great.\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:46.160\nThank you.\n\n53:46.160 --> 53:47.160\nWithin the game.\n\n53:47.160 --> 53:48.160\nYes, within the game.\n\n53:48.160 --> 53:49.160\nWithin the game.\n\n53:49.160 --> 53:50.160\nNo, no, no.\n\n53:50.160 --> 53:51.160\nI'll go first.\n\n53:51.160 --> 53:52.160\nIt's a gentleman's obligation.\n\n53:52.160 --> 53:53.160\nOkay.\n\n53:53.160 --> 53:54.160\nYeah.\n\n53:54.160 --> 53:57.120\nAll right, then who, who's next and who's last?\n\n53:57.120 --> 53:58.120\nI'll bring up the rear.\n\n53:58.120 --> 53:59.120\nAll right.\n\n53:59.120 --> 54:00.120\nAll right.\n\n54:00.120 --> 54:01.120\nSo I'll be...\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:02.120\nCan we talk about what happened in the hotel room today?\n\n54:02.120 --> 54:03.120\nYes.\n\n54:03.120 --> 54:04.120\nIs this...\n\n54:04.120 --> 54:05.120\nIs it sexist?\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:06.120\nNo, we can talk about it.\n\n54:06.120 --> 54:07.120\nI don't know your frame too.\n\n54:07.120 --> 54:08.120\nYou want me to roll a six and a nine?\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:09.120\nOh.\n\n54:09.120 --> 54:10.120\nOh.\n\n54:10.120 --> 54:11.120\nOh, my God.\n\n54:11.120 --> 54:12.120\nOh, my God.\n\n54:12.120 --> 54:13.120\nOh, my God.\n\n54:13.120 --> 54:14.120\nOh, my God.\n\n54:14.120 --> 54:31.080\nWhen you go on a month long tour with your girlfriend, that guarantees that there's going to be\n\n54:31.080 --> 54:39.120\na moment like today where you burst into tears out of nowhere and said, I just want you to\n\n54:39.120 --> 54:40.120\nlove me.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:41.120\nYeah.\n\n54:41.120 --> 54:42.120\nYeah.\n\n54:42.120 --> 54:43.120\nAnd we're crying.\n\n54:43.120 --> 54:44.120\nYeah.\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:45.120\nI don't...\n\n54:45.120 --> 54:46.120\nAdventure.\n\n54:46.120 --> 54:57.520\nI'm sorry, ladies, because I don't want to out us, but I believe that I am about to have\n\n54:57.520 --> 54:58.520\nmy period.\n\n54:58.520 --> 54:59.520\nOh.\n\n54:59.520 --> 55:12.960\nI don't get angry, my PMS style isn't angry, it's just tears, and I said to Dan, hey,\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:16.920\nout of nowhere, hey, is everything cool?\n\n55:16.920 --> 55:20.960\nAnd he said to me, hey, Erin, you got to deal with the shit on your own.\n\n55:20.960 --> 55:31.240\nI'm not soliciting a boo, I'm not soliciting a boo, but I just started crying and I was\n\n55:31.240 --> 55:34.640\nlike, Erin, just go to the mirror and just look in the mirror and you'll be fine, but\n\n55:34.640 --> 55:38.160\nsomehow looking at myself crying in the mirror made me cry more.\n\n55:38.160 --> 55:43.160\nSo then when I came back to Dan, I was covered in tears and like swollen and just like, this\n\n55:43.160 --> 55:45.160\nis dumb and then I'm pretty new in most of it.\n\n55:45.160 --> 55:48.640\nAnd I didn't know I was looking at my laptop and I just heard, Dan, and I looked up and\n\n55:48.640 --> 55:50.680\nI was like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?\n\n55:50.680 --> 55:54.560\nHey guys, guys, are you going to climb this staff or what?\n\n55:54.560 --> 55:57.760\nI hate the motion.\n\n55:57.760 --> 56:01.200\nI'm sitting down on a magic staff like an asshole down here.\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:06.800\nI just wanted to say, because I'm bad at it when we're one on one, because I'm like a\n\n56:06.800 --> 56:12.040\nJim Carrey type who can only express himself through entertainment.\n\n56:12.040 --> 56:23.400\nI'm very sorry that you had period feelings today and I will be there for you through\n\n56:23.400 --> 56:26.160\nall your periods.\n\n56:26.160 --> 56:28.840\nAll of them, they come every month.\n\n56:28.840 --> 56:34.000\nYeah, but maybe not next month, right?\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:39.000\nYeah, I don't like using condoms.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:44.000\nAll right, let's get back to the end.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:45.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:46.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:47.000\nIt's okay, it's okay.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:48.000\nI just thought it was amazing.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:51.000\nHey Jason, can we talk about what happened in the hotel room earlier with me and you?\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nDoes Olivia ever cry for no reason?\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nI'd rather not.\n\n56:55.000 --> 57:03.800\nJason, you have an amazing, beautiful, wonderful, fiancé, yeah, she cries for no reason sometimes.\n\n57:03.800 --> 57:11.040\nShe's brand new, you're going to find out that there's a derezification that happens.\n\n57:11.040 --> 57:13.800\nHer Ram is going to mainframe her.\n\n57:13.800 --> 57:14.800\nA year, a year.\n\n57:14.800 --> 57:16.800\nYeah, well, we've been together a year.\n\n57:16.800 --> 57:19.800\nYeah, well, I meant to have mood swings

that's for the movie that you're now in.\n\n57:26.800 --> 57:28.800\nWhat's the, I forget our song guys name.\n\n57:28.800 --> 57:30.800\nIs there one more mic for Jason while we're up here?\n\n57:30.800 --> 57:31.800\nNo?\n\n57:31.800 --> 57:33.800\nOh, this is for the video.\n\n57:33.800 --> 57:34.800\nYeah, this is for the live crowd.\n\n57:34.800 --> 57:36.800\nAll right, sorry, I'm sorry about that.\n\n57:36.800 --> 57:39.800\nI just, yes, sometimes she does cry, but it's...\n\n57:39.800 --> 57:40.800\nGorgeous.\n\n57:40.800 --> 57:42.800\nYou come when she cries.\n\n57:42.800 --> 57:45.800\nOh, go on.\n\n57:45.800 --> 57:48.800\nShe cries and looks in the mirror and goes, oh yeah.\n\n57:48.800 --> 57:53.800\nShe cries and dear walk into the room and lick her tears off of her gorgeous face.\n\n57:53.800 --> 57:57.800\nRevlon, just Revlon falling off or just dripping on the mascara.\n\n57:57.800 --> 57:59.800\nIs she literally the Revlon model?\n\n57:59.800 --> 58:00.800\nShe must be.\n\n58:00.800 --> 58:03.800\nGod damn it.\n\n58:03.800 --> 58:07.800\nThey actually, Revlon actually uses the mascara that drips off of her cheeks.\n\n58:07.800 --> 58:09.800\nThey bottle it and give it to regular women.\n\n58:09.800 --> 58:11.800\nI'm the Teflon role model.\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:12.800\nOh, that's great.\n\n58:12.800 --> 58:13.800\nYeah.\n\n58:13.800 --> 58:14.800\nThat's great.\n\n58:14.800 --> 58:21.800\nJason, how integral and your fiance falling in love with you was your Joe Biden impression?\n\n58:21.800 --> 58:24.800\nI would say the Mitt Romney maybe had more...\n\n58:24.800 --> 58:28.800\nWell, I think she already loved me at that point, but I think Mitt Romney had more to do with it\n\n58:28.800 --> 58:31.800\nand she's very active politically on the...\n\n58:31.800 --> 58:33.800\nWe'll lease back then on the opposite side.\n\n58:33.800 --> 58:34.800\nOh, really?\n\n58:34.800 --> 58:35.800\nYeah.\n\n58:35.800 --> 58:37.800\nJason, do you ever get sick of how beautiful she is?\n\n58:37.800 --> 58:44.800\nDo you ever just want to throw a brick at her nose?\n\n58:44.800 --> 58:46.800\nI haven't.\n\n58:46.800 --> 58:47.800\nI haven't.\n\n58:47.800 --> 58:49.800\nIt's actually really, really neat.\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:50.800\nOh, it's true love.\n\n58:50.800 -->

know...\n\n59:01.800 --> 59:02.800\nAlso, you're an angel.\n\n59:02.800 --> 59:03.800\nSure.\n\n59:03.800 --> 59:04.800\nTwo angels.\n\n59:04.800 --> 59:07.800\nTwo angels met in heaven on earth and are now marrying.\n\n59:07.800 --> 59:08.800\nWonderful angels.\n\n59:08.800 --> 59:09.800\nThat's fact.\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:10.800\nI mean, that's fact.\n\n59:10.800 -->

moment, you know.\n\n59:32.800 --> 59:34.800\nLike, I want to make sure that these guys get their money's worth.\n\n59:34.800 --> 59:35.800\nBrooklyn makes sure of that too.\n\n59:35.800 --> 59:36.800\nAnd that's what I like about Brooklyn.\n\n59:36.800 --> 59:38.800\nBrooklyn, make sure you don't leave without a human moment either.\n\n59:38.800 --> 59:41.800\nOh, it's Brooklyn Governor, Mel Poops.\n\n59:41.800 --> 59:42.800\nMel Poops.\n\n59:42.800 --> 59:43.800\nMel Poops.\n\n59:43.800 --> 59:44.800\nMel Poops.\n\n59:44.800 --> 59:45.800\nOh.\n\n59:45.800 --> 59:53.800\nP-U-U-P-S,

59:57.800\nYeah.\n\n59:57.800 --> 59:58.800\nIt's not Mel Poops.\n\n59:58.800 --> 59:59.800\nI know that.\n\n59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.800\nMarty Markowitz.\n\n01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.800\nMarty Markowitz?\n\n01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800\nMarty Markowitz?\n\n01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800\nMarty Markowitz.\n\n01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:13.800\nI

from me.\n\n01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.800\nTuesday is belt day.\n\n01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800\nCome in, get a belt.\n\n01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.800\nI'll govern you.\n\n01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.800\nLet me govern those slacks and your trousers.\n\n01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.800\nThe first person to buy three suits, I'll appoint district attorney.\n\n01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.800\nDoes your waistline need to be legislated?\n\n01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.800\nI'm Marty Markowitz.\n\n01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:04.800\nI'll cuff your pants and make a law.\n\n01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.800\nFor every two pairs of pants, you get to make a law.\n\n01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.800\nAll right, sorry, Spencer.\n\n01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800\nAll right.\n\n01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:18.800\nPopping your head through the hatch, you are facing four large black leather chairs.\n\n01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.800\nYou see four people in this room.\n\n01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.800\nA large steering wheel stands in the center,\n\n01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.800\nand a huge glass panel behind you reveals the world below.\n\n01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.800\nStanding at the wheel is a large, darkly armored knight,\n\n01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.800\nstaring ahead and guiding the wheel gently.\n\n01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.800\nAs you enter, three of the other people leap to their feet.\n\n01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.800\nThey're wearing orange coveralls stained with dark spots.\n\n01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.800\nThey quickly yell at you in abyssal.\n\n01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.800\nHow did you get in here?\n\n01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.800\nJason and Jacob can do some of those parts.\n\n01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800\nI'm one of the four people I think involved here, aren't I?\n\n01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.800\nYeah, I could have you that, or you could be a good guy.\n\n01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.800\nNo, don't tell me how you can make it. Tell me what it is.\n\n01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.800\nThere's four people in this room, and you can be one of them.\n\n01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.800\nBe one of the bad guys, yell at me in abyssal.\n\n01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.800\nOne of those guys has got to be Admiral Darkstar,\n\n01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.800\nthe guy in the middle, right?\n\n01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.800\nYou actually recognize, although similarly clothed, it's not the same man.\n\n01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.800\nThe sidebar is super tough to be a dungeon master\n\n01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.800\nwhen a guy's got you on his tour bus, right?\n\n01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.800\nYeah, because if I kill off his character,\n\n01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.800\nhe's just going to dump me.\n\n01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.800\nYeah, I'll be like, oh, your coffee didn't roll a three against my piss, did it?\n\n01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.800\nWe'll drink your coffee then, right?\n\n01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.800\nIt's your bunked and saved versus being shit in.\n\n01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.800\nI know purify food and drink.\n\n01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800\nWow.\n\n01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.800\nDungeon Snap! Dungeon Snap!\n\n01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.800\nAll right, so you want to yell at him then?\n\n01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.800\nCan we just stop and say that we're at the Bell House in Brooklyn.\n\n01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.800\nWe have to be the first show to play D&D on stage here, right?\n\n01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800\nNo? Maybe not.\n\n01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.800\nIt was Ryan Postaine here earlier.\n\n01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.800\nSorry.\n\n01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.800\nRyan Adams may have done a song about it, maybe.\n\n01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.800\nSo what's my motivation? What am I yelling at about?\n\n01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.800\nYou're a crewman, and some random dude just popped up through this bottom hatch\n\n01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800\nin what's normally an inaccessible area of the ship.\n\n01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800\nWhat the fludge?\n\n01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.800\nFrom this place, a swear word's like, oh fuck, yeah.\n\n01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800\nWhat the fludge?\n\n01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.800\nThe bottom of the ship's broken.\n\n01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800\nDo you want to climb out of the hole,\n\n01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.800\nor you're just kind of like poking out of this whole whack-a-mole style?\n\n01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.800\nI cast Summon Monster 2 into the bridge, and then drop down.\n\n01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800\nOkay.\n\n01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.800\nWhat a monster do you want to summon?\n\n01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.800\nLast time I think you summoned a celestial bee.\n\n01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800\nYeah.\n\n01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.800\nAll right, all right, squid, squid.\n\n01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.800\nCasting your hands in a magical manner.\n\n01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.800\nA large fengish squid appears in the room.\n\n01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.800\nI drop down.\n\n01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.800\nI put my hands on one of the guards,\n\n01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800\ntrapping in under its bulk.\n\n01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.800\nWhat the fuck?\n\n01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.800\nFludge?\n\n01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.800\nGuys, there's four people up there in black armor.\n\n01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.800\nI put a squid on them, but I'll be darned if I'm not tapped.\n\n01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.800\nBlack ink drips down from the floor above.\n\n01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.800\nI fire two arrows.\n\n01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.800\nOkay, so you're not currently in the room, so you poke your head up and do that?\n\n01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.800\nWe're still down below the hatch.\n\n01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.800\nI climb above, I'm sorry, I thought I was above the hatch.\n\n01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800\nOkay.\n\n01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.800\nI climb above and I fire two arrows.\n\n01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.800\nOh, shit.\n\n01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.800\nYou fire both of the arrows.\n\n01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800\nThey go wild.\n\n01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.800\nOne strikes you in the foot.\n\n01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.800\nYou take seven damage and fall down the shaft.\n\n01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.800\nI deserved it.\n\n01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.800\nSomeone hates arrows and booed me.\n\n01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.800\nIn the audience, she rolled double critical fails.\n\n01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.800\nThat's what you get for having a period.\n\n01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.800\nSo we have...\n\n01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.800\nWas it a critical attack on the squid on the one guy?\n\n01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.800\nYou don't know how exactly that played out.\n\n01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.800\nBut we just know he's got a squid on him, so he subdued for a bit.\n\n01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.800\nWell, you don't know what happened.\n\n01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.800\nYou just saw your friend shoot an arrow into her foot and fall off.\n\n01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800\nI disregard that and climb up the hatch and jump into the room.\n\n01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.800\nShocking.\n\n01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.800\nLaunching into the room, you're met with a grizzly scene.\n\n01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.800\nAlthough the black, dark-armored figure hasn't moved from the wheel,\n\n01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.800\nthree of the men lie trapped under the squid.\n\n01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.800\nThey seem unable to move.\n\n01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.800\nCan I just go up to him with my great flaming sword and poke him on the side while they're under the squid?\n\n01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.800\nNo, because I put the thing on autopilot and turned to face you.\n\n01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800\nYes.\n\n01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.800\nJason Sudakis, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.800\nHe's judging the fuck out of this dragon.\n\n01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.800\nSo you're the pilot of this ship, is your motivation?\n\n01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.800\nI go into...\n\n01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.800\nWhere are my hit points at?\n\n01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.800\nHey, guys, I gotta find out where my hit points are, okay?\n\n01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.800\nWhat are my hit points?\n\n01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800\nRight now you're at 33.\n\n01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800\nThe amulet got me back to 33?\n\n01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800\nYeah.\n\n01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.800\nAlright, is this a good time to go into a berserker rage?\n\n01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.800\nSounds like it.\n\n01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.800\nCan I use intimidate, too?\n\n01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800\nYou could do...\n\n01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.800\nI would prefer you didn't.\n\n01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800\nIntimidate first, rage later.\n\n01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800\nOkay, I intimidate first.\n\n01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800\nOkay.\n\n01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.800\nAre you going to intimidate the black-armored figure?\n\n01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.800\nI'm going to take my shirt off and intimidate this guy.\n\n01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.800\nYou feel rather intimidated.\n\n01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.800\nYou seem like he might kick your ass if you're not careful.\n\n01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800\nThis guides your actions.\n\n01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800\nOkay, great.\n\n01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.800\nSo then I go into a berserker rage.\n\n01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.800\nYou see a halfling before you.\n\n01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.800\nHe's a good four feet tall, but now he's swelling, growing in size,\n\n01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.800\nrippling with muscles.\n\n01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.800\nLadies, come on.\n\n01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800\nSo now he's half big?\n\n01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800\nAre you going to attack?\n\n01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.800\nYeah, a flaming great sword attack.\n\n01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.800\nFlaming great sword attack.\n\n01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.800\nYou missed, sorry.\n\n01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.800\nSwinging wide, your blade catches just the tip of his helmet.\n\n01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.800\nThat's where you want it.\n\n01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.800\nSo I circumcised him.\n\n01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:28.800\nWe'll see.\n\n01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.800\nI regroup.\n\n01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800\nYou regroup.\n\n01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.800\nWhat is my spell Tasha's hideous laughter?\n\n01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.800\nIt afflicts the person with a dangerous laughter.\n\n01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.800\nThey can't take any other actions because they're rolling on the floor so hard.\n\n01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.800\nOh my God.\n\n01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800\nYeah.\n\n01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800\nWell, I better crawl up into the fray here.\n\n01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800\nCrawling up into the fray.\n\n01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.800\nYou crawl up into the fray.\n\n01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.800\nHey, there's a time and a place for the ray of frost.\n\n01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.800\nOh, I did mention you're holding an axe, by the way.\n\n01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:05.800\nIt's a pretty wicked axe.\n\n01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.800\nLike a Gibson Les Paul or something like that?\n\n01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.800\nIt may be.\n\n01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800\nIt's better than your loop.\n\n01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.800\nDungeon Snap.\n\n01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800\nDungeon Snap.\n\n01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.800\nSo I'm a halfling and this dark armor dude.\n\n01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800\nI'm taking on these people.\n\n01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.800\nHe's the halfling.\n\n01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.800\nI was describing what you were seeing.\n\n01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.800\nOh, okay.\n\n01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.800\nYou're this darker.\n\n01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.800\nI'm still this guy in this armor.\n\n01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800\nDo a thing.\n\n01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.800\nIt's your turn.\n\n01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.800\nIt's my turn.\n\n01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800\nOh, all right.\n\n01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.800\nI want to, you know what I'd like to do?\n\n01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.800\nI'd like to crush up a billiard ball and blow it in its face\n\n01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.800\nlike a smooth criminal.\n\n01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800\nNice.\n\n01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.800\nThat happens.\n\n01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.800\nI'm going to say it again just really quick\n\n01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.800\nbecause I want to get it right in my mind.\n\n01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.800\nI want to grab a cue ball off a nearby billiard table.\n\n01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800\nI want to grab it.\n\n01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.800\nI want to hold up in front of it like this.\n\n01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.800\nI want to crush it in my hand to show my superior strength\n\n01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.800\nand then I would just be on a real fucking nonchalant bit\n\n01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.800\nand it'd go in his face.\n\n01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.800\nVery similar to the laughter thing,\n\n01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.800\nbut it's from a smooth criminal.\n\n01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.800\nThe barbarian is blinded.\n\n01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.800\nOkay.\n\n01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.800\nNow I want to suck his dick.\n\n01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.800\nWhat kind of cockpit is this?\n\n01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800\nNo.\n\n01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.800\nProperly named one?\n\n01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.800\nWhat kind of cockpit is this?\n\n01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800\nNo, I want to...\n\n01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800\nOkay, so now I got him dazed.\n\n01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.800\nI got him dazed.\n\n01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:51.800\nHe's dazed.\n\n01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.800\nHe's off balance.\n\n01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.800\nOkay, so now I want to...\n\n01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800\nAgain, I want to sweep the leg.\n\n01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800\nI want to sweep the leg.\n\n01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.800\nIt's a bit difficult to maneuver,\n\n01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.800\nbut you are wearing heavy armor.\n\n01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800\nYou sweep

comprehend\n\n01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.800\nthe horizontality of his body.\n\n01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.800\nI want to open up a little door in my seat.\n\n01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.800\nI then want

stronger,\n\n01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.800\nso that would do damage.\n\n01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.800\nHe is nauseated, although not damaged.\n\n01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.800\nI'm crushing,

01:15:32.800\nWhy?\n\n01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:40.800\nAnd then I leap in for, then I take my knife in a very un-gentlemanly, like, breach of contract.\n\n01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.800\nI throw my knife at his face.\n\n01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.800\nYour tricky move seems to get the better of him, but does it hit?\n\n01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.800\nNope.\n\n01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800\nShit!\n\n01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.800\nThe knife whizzes past the head and plants itself in the machinery behind him.\n\n01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800\nWho are you?\n\n01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.800\nWho?\n\n01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.800\nIf I would have known you were going to be throwing knives, I wouldn't have shaved this morning.\n\n01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800\nMy guy.\n\n01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800\nMy guy.\n\n01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.800\nThe guys trapped under the squid are cracking up.\n\n01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.800\nThey love your antics.\n\n01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800\nReduce person.\n\n01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.800\nOh, reduced person.\n\n01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800\nThat's a classic.\n\n01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.800\nDan Harmon uses it constantly.\n\n01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800\nWhat?\n\n01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800\nNo, I love him.\n\n01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.800\nI love him.\n\n01:16:34.800 -->

you've accrued many magical arrows.\n\n01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.800\nSo which one?\n\n01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.800\nYou got non-lethal arrows, good-lined arrows, sleep arrows, and

shit!\n\n01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.800\nI'll take his high fives.\n\n01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.800\nI'll take all of his high fives.\n\n01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.800\nYeah!\n\n01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800\nI stole him!\n\n01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800\nYeah!\n\n01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.800\nGive him half of the high fives.\n\n01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.800\nThose are from those guys.\n\n01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.800\nYeah!\n\n01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:40.800\nAll right, so an arrow.\n\n01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.800\nA lot of different arrows coming at me.\n\n01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:46.800\nYeah, so I have a sleepy arrow and a...\n\n01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:47.800\nA good arrow.\n\n01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800\nAll right.\n\n01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.800\nAn arrow that's good for knocking people out but not killing them.\n\n01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800\nOkay.\n\n01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.800\nAnd an arrow that lends itself well for shooting two arrows at once.\n\n01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.800\nYou should have fired that last time.\n\n01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.800\nAnd just to clarify, I'm wearing armor that has little doors in its butthole area and, like...\n\n01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.800\nDid his armor shrink, too, or is he comically...\n\n01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800\nNo, he's caught...\n\n01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800\nLike, it's like a child in it now.\n\n01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800\nHe's clumsy.\n\n01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800\nOh, because I'm three feet.\n\n01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.800\nYeah, but the armor's regular size.\n\n01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.800\nWell, dear Spencer,\n\n01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.800\nI think I'm going to go ahead and do the two arrows.\n\n01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800\nOkay.\n\n01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800\nOne of your arrows hits.\n\n01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.800\nThe other hits the squid.\n\n01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800\nThat's critical fails.\n\n01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.800\nReally quick, Spencer is really the best.\n\n01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.800\nHe's one of the kindest, coolest people ever.\n\n01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800\nThe shoe has not dropped.\n\n01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.800\nSpencer!\n\n01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.800\nI needed some applause after the booing with the squid and everything.\n\n01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800\nI didn't mean to shoot the squid.\n\n01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:04.800\nI do a mysterious Emerald Dagger attack on Dave.\n\n01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.800\nYou use your mysterious Emerald Dagger.\n\n01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.800\nYou hit!\n\n01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.800\nSuck on that, sword.\n\n01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.800\nSword, sucker.\n\n01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.800\nYou deal eight damage.\n\n01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800\nNot bad.\n\n01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800\nNot bad.\n\n01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.800\nAll right.\n\n01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.800\nWe got to kill Jason to dig.\n\n01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800\nYeah, you do.\n\n01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.800\nYou got to kill Dave.\n\n01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.800\nI'd like to be left out of this.\n\n01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800\nSo it's my turn.\n\n01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.800\nIt's your turn, Dave.\n\n01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.800\nOkay, and where am I standing?\n\n01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.800\nYou were standing, you can't move around too well.\n\n01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800\nWhere did the arrow hit me?\n\n01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800\nThe one arrow that hit?\n\n01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.800\nI'd say it hit you in the clavicle.\n\n01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800\nRight in the clavicle.\n\n01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.800\nIt's right in the bone.\n\n01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.800\nThat's a weird thing.\n\n01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.800\nYou're having trouble breathing probably.\n\n01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.800\nAnd then the Emerald Dagger comes at me.\n\n01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.800\nThat's going to hit you right in the stomach.\n\n01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.800\nEven though it didn't hit your armor,\n\n01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.800\nyou feel quite injured from the blow.\n\n01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.800\nYeah, not going to win out of me, at least.\n\n01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.800\nOkay.\n\n01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800\nOkay.\n\n01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.800\nAt this point, I have no other option.\n\n01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.800\nThe squid still got my three boys on lockdown?\n\n01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800\nYeah.\n\n01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800\nThey do.\n\n01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.800\nEven though one of the arrows hit the squid,\n\n01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.800\nthree guys.\n\n01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.800\nOne squid.\n\n01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.800\nEven if the squid was dead, it'd still be doing that.\n\n01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.800\nYeah, good point.\n\n01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.800\nIt's heavy.\n\n01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800\nHeavy squid.\n\n01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.800\nAnd they're over there.\n\n01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.800\nThey're struggling.\n\n01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.800\nThey're awake.\n\n01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.800\nThey can laugh at jokes, but they're also...\n\n01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.800\nOkay.\n\n01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.800\nSo then at this point, I've got to...\n\n01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.800\nI know this ship better than these guys do.\n\n01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.800\nSo I've got to say that what?\n\n01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800\nBreathe with the squid.\n\n01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.800\nNo.\n\n01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800\nWhy didn't we think of that?\n\n01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800\nNo, I feel...\n\n01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800\nYou need Jeff's money.\n\n01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:54.800\nDo what you want to do.\n\n01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.800\nLive my own life, yeah.\n\n01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.800\nFollow the beat of your own drummer, Dave.\n\n01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:04.800\nI never knew D&D was as much like Price is Right.\n\n01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.800\nI didn't know that element of it.\n\n01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.800\nThe kitty litter.\n\n01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.800\nThe kitty litter.\n\n01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.800\nGo Ohio State.\n\n01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.800\nLet's see.\n\n01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.800\nI would like to...\n\n01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.800\nI would like to...\n\n01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:29.800\nI'd like to take off the headrest where I was captaining.\n\n01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800\nThe headrest there.\n\n01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.800\nIf I hit that button, I pull it up and I can get the two things.\n\n01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800\nLike you're having a lot of cars.\n\n01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800\nOf course.\n\n01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:40.800\nI use that as a weapon to go after Jeff.\n\n01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.800\nQuick reminder, you do own...\n\n01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.800\nOh, I have my ax.\n\n01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.800\nYou know what?\n\n01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.800\nWe're going to leave that thing where it is for now.\n\n01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800\nAnd I'm going to use the sharp side of the ax\n\n01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.800\ninstead of the blunt side like I missed with earlier.\n\n01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:57.800\nAnd I'm coming after Nex.\n\n01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.800\nI'm going after everybody's Nex.\n\n01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.800\nWho's Nex?\n\n01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.800\nWho's Nex?\n\n01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.800\nPick a neck number one.\n\n01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800\nSo that would be the dagger guy.\n\n01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.800\nOkay.\n\n01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.800\nThat's me.\n\n01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800\nBold move.\n\n01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.800\nI know his name is Jeff, but I don't know if you're caring.\n\n01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800\nQuark.\n\n01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800\nQuark.\n\n01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800\nQuark.\n\n01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.800\nQuark.\n\n01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.800\nQuark.\n\n01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.800\nThis is my name.\n\n01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.800\nQuark.\n\n01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.800\nThe ax strikes you right in the chest, but it pings off your armor.\n\n01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800\nFuck you.\n\n01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.800\nSo I missed his neck?\n\n01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.800\nNo, you hit him right in the chest.\n\n01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.800\nIt was a bit low.\n\n01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800\nHis neck was a bit low.\n\n01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.800\nYou're really short.\n\n01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:30.800\nOh, I'm really short, right?\n\n01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.800\nYeah, you're used to swinging higher.\n\n01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.800\nWhy didn't I go for dicks?\n\n01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800\nI should have went for dicks.\n\n01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.800\nAnkle's Nex.\n\n01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.800\nObnoxious.\n\n01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.800\nYou don't think of these things when you're short.\n\n01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.800\nYou're like, the world's the same, but it's not.\n\n01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.800\nIt's different.\n\n01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.800\nThe squid is dead.\n\n01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:55.800\nRay of Frost.\n\n01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:20.800\nSorry about that.\n\n01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.800\nIt hits him right in the eye.\n\n01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.800\nHis eyeball freezes over.\n\n01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:32.800\nHe takes three damage and loss loses the use of one eye.\n\n01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.800\nThat was a good shot.\n\n01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.800\nI think for all that rapping, it should have been better.\n\n01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.800\nThree is the maximum damage Ray of Frost can heal.\n\n01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.800\nIt's a level zero spell.\n\n01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.800\nJesus, it comes out now.\n\n01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800\nIt gets a theme song, though.\n\n01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.800\nIt gets a theme song?\n\n01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.800\nThat's the dilemma with Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.800\nThe things they're most familiar with are the shittiest things.\n\n01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.800\nThat's not just Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.800\nThat's every relationship.\n\n01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:10.800\nBillion burgers sold.\n\n01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800\nControversial.\n\n01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800\nMcDonald's insult.\n\n01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.800\nControversial.\n\n01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800\nMcDonald's slam.\n\n01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800\nWhose turn is it?\n\n01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.800\nI don't know.\n\n01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800\nI'm down an eye.\n\n01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800\nMy death perception is nuts.\n\n01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800\nWith a sword, an axe, I'm in bad shape.\n\n01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800\nYou're already shorter.\n\n01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:36.800\nFirst I grab a quark and sharpies hands and grip them.\n\n01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.800\nOh my god, this hippie shit.\n\n01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.800\nAs if to say, I got it.\n\n01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.800\nThen I take an arrow, the good arrow.\n\n01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:52.800\nI take the good arrow and I shoot it at his other eye.\n\n01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:04.800\nCritical hit.\n\n01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.800\nOlivia Wilde's too pretty for anybody.\n\n01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.800\nNo, but pretty enough for you.\n\n01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.800\nBut that fucking angel, you're dating a goddess.\n\n01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.800\nYou're going to live forever or die immediately.\n\n01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800\nWho knows?\n\n01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800\nWell, he's blind now, right?\n\n01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800\nOh no, he's dead.\n\n01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.800\nHe's dead, he's gone.\n\n01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:36.800\nLadies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Spencer and the Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.800\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.800\nJason's dance stage, we're getting about that time.\n\n01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.800\nSpencer, everybody, I'll get the character sheets.\n\n01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.800\nThat was a goodie.\n\n01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.800\nThat was crazy.\n\n01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.800\nJason, I hope it's not weird later.\n\n01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.800\nSpencer, I want to go with your browser history.\n\n01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.800\nIt's so fucking bad right now, brother.\n\n01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.800\nI swear to god.\n\n01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:06.800\nErin McGathy,
