Upe.\n\n00:13.640 --> 00:18.800\nDave Kline, go to the mic and give us a good Upe to start us off.\n\n00:18.800 --> 00:19.720\nJust give me one good Upe.\n\n00:19.720 --> 00:22.120\nOne Upe.\n\n00:22.120 --> 00:24.360\nUpe.\n\n00:24.360 --> 00:25.560\nAll right, sit down.\n\n00:25.560 --> 00:29.160\nSpencer Crittenden and everybody, Spencer.\n\n00:29.160 --> 00:42.160\nLet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, fresh from the ladies room, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:42.160 --> 00:45.160\nThank you.\n\n00:45.160 --> 00:48.160\nThank you very much.\n\n00:48.160 --> 00:50.160\nHello, all right.\n\n00:50.160 --> 00:53.160\nI thought the punchline was going to be, it doesn't ring a bell.\n\n00:53.160 --> 00:55.160\nHis face doesn't ring a bell.\n\n00:55.160 --> 00:56.160\nI didn't hear it.\n\n00:56.160 --> 00:57.160\nI couldn't hear it.\n\n00:57.160 --> 00:58.160\nI know there was a guy.\n\n00:58.160 --> 00:59.160\nWas it a dead ringer?\n\n00:59.160 --> 01:00.160\nWas that it?\n\n01:00.160 --> 01:01.160\nYeah.\n\n01:01.160 --> 01:02.160\nIt was a dead ringer for the last one.\n\n01:02.160 --> 01:03.160\nClassic.\n\n01:03.160 --> 01:04.160\nClassic joke.\n\n01:04.160 --> 01:06.160\nYou didn't have to fill in for me.\n\n01:06.160 --> 01:09.160\nI was ready to, I was just, I was told to stress.\n\n01:09.160 --> 01:10.160\nI panicked.\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:13.160\nI really, I really tossed that out early.\n\n01:13.160 --> 01:15.160\nAll right.\n\n01:15.160 --> 01:18.160\nWell, let's see.\n\n01:18.160 --> 01:19.160\nUh-oh.\n\n01:19.160 --> 01:22.160\nSo we saw, we saw a radiohead at outside lands.\n\n01:22.160 --> 01:23.160\nWe did.\n\n01:23.160 --> 01:29.160\nAnd I realized the name of their band is, it's kind of actually, even though they're,\n\n01:29.160 --> 01:39.160\nthey're not, uh, uh, uh, at all, uh, the genre, uh, that they're, the name of their band actually\n\n01:39.160 --> 01:44.160\nsounds like the name of a song from like an 80s, like heavy metal band.\n\n01:44.160 --> 01:48.160\nLike, like, and I kept, I kept, I was like, I was getting really high and I was singing.\n\n01:48.160 --> 01:51.160\nI have this song I made up in my head.\n\n01:51.160 --> 01:56.160\nIt's like, like, it goes a little something like this.\n\n01:56.160 --> 02:00.160\nI didn't want to present it as like, oh, it's a real song, but I, I guess I did.\n\n02:00.160 --> 02:03.160\nAnd I, but I just, but I just started doing it a lot.\n\n02:03.160 --> 02:05.160\nIt was, uh, can we hear it?\n\n02:05.160 --> 02:06.160\nCan we hear a little bit?\n\n02:06.160 --> 02:09.160\nLet me just, let me just try a little acapella here.\n\n02:09.160 --> 02:13.160\nTurn your station to misery.\n\n02:13.160 --> 02:15.160\nOw, watch your dial.\n\n02:15.160 --> 02:16.160\nI don't know.\n\n02:16.160 --> 02:18.160\nIt's a place holding lyrics.\n\n02:18.160 --> 02:21.160\nPut your favorite frequency.\n\n02:21.160 --> 02:31.160\nI've got a radio head, a radio head, radio soul, radio rock, radio roll.\n\n02:31.160 --> 02:40.160\nI've got a radio head.\n\n02:40.160 --> 02:54.160\nA thousand watts of devil power, and a beaming in your soul, and tenders in your Satan dick.\n\n02:54.160 --> 02:59.160\nTo transmit in rocket rule, I've got a radio head.\n\n02:59.160 --> 03:08.160\nCan we get the person that made the, uh, the Rob Schrab, uh, it gets worse song to put, to put that to a beat\n\n03:08.160 --> 03:10.160\nand get, give me some heavy guitar on that one.\n\n03:10.160 --> 03:14.160\nIt was, it was better when I was high and then I get up here and I'm, it was fucking great.\n\n03:14.160 --> 03:15.160\nAll right, thanks.\n\n03:15.160 --> 03:16.160\nIt was great.\n\n03:16.160 --> 03:19.160\nYou were high in San Francisco on stage yesterday and you were beyond delightful.\n\n03:19.160 --> 03:21.160\nYou, you, you hit a beautiful sweet spot.\n\n03:21.160 --> 03:28.160\nThen we got into a limo getting back from the airport today and Dan started just yelling at his laptop.\n\n03:28.160 --> 03:32.160\nAnd we didn't know what was going on, but you lost a jet pack in Minecraft.\n\n03:32.160 --> 03:33.160\nYeah.\n\n03:33.160 --> 03:42.160\nI went, I went to the nether with, with my jet pack because I wanted to get a broken spawner so that I could make a\n\n03:42.160 --> 03:49.160\npowered spawner with Enderman in it so I could harvest Ender pearls and like, you know, like, like ratchet up my game a little bit.\n\n03:49.160 --> 03:59.160\nAnd I, I started burrowing through a wall of nether rack and it was just blithely, cockily, like just shim, shimmy in along.\n\n03:59.160 --> 04:04.160\nAnd then I, I got, I got buried in lava and I lost my jet pack.\n\n04:04.160 --> 04:10.160\nAnd then I went, and then I went back to my base and I tried to make another jet pack.\n\n04:10.160 --> 04:12.160\nI need appliances to do that.\n\n04:12.160 --> 04:22.160\nAnd like, I forgot that I, I was using a tier one industrial craft metal former with, it hooked up to a CESU, which is a tier two power source.\n\n04:22.160 --> 04:24.160\nAnd it, the metal former blew up.\n\n04:24.160 --> 04:28.160\nDan, don't talk down to us.\n\n04:28.160 --> 04:33.160\nSo the CESU was a tier two power transformer then.\n\n04:33.160 --> 04:37.160\nYeah, I had to forgot to put a transformer upgrade into the metal former.\n\n04:37.160 --> 04:41.160\nHow many metal formers exploded before you figured that out?\n\n04:41.160 --> 04:43.160\nAbout three or four.\n\n04:43.160 --> 04:46.160\nJesus. And that is a lot of iron if I'm not mistaken.\n\n04:46.160 --> 04:49.160\nThat's okay because I have that iron exploit.\n\n04:49.160 --> 04:51.160\nAll right, of course.\n\n04:51.160 --> 04:56.160\nThat's been our show. Thanks for coming everybody.\n\n04:56.160 --> 05:01.160\nAll right. Well, okay. So, so if that doesn't amaze you, this will.\n\n05:01.160 --> 05:06.160\nWell, don't, don't assume we weren't amazed by that.\n\n05:06.160 --> 05:08.160\nI kind of, I cried. I did something wrong.\n\n05:08.160 --> 05:12.160\nLike while I was like grabbing my laptop on the plane and I cracked my thumbnail a little bit.\n\n05:12.160 --> 05:17.160\nLike it's just a little like, like chippy thing where it was like wherever you put your hand, it's going to get snagged, you know, and that kind of thing.\n\n05:17.160 --> 05:20.160\nNothing that big a deal, but it had to be taken care of.\n\n05:20.160 --> 05:25.160\nSo while we were waiting for, for you because we had that whole double shuttle thing happening and we were waiting by the door.\n\n05:25.160 --> 05:27.160\nIt's like, well, I have fingernail clippers.\n\n05:27.160 --> 05:29.160\nIt might be a little gross, but it's LAX who cares.\n\n05:29.160 --> 05:31.160\nLike I'll, I'll go over to the way, the garbage can.\n\n05:31.160 --> 05:34.160\nI'll be very discreet and I'll just like clip a little bit.\n\n05:34.160 --> 05:38.160\nSome people are very, you know, I'm aware that, you know, there's different people have different triggers.\n\n05:38.160 --> 05:45.160\nYou know, it's like, like, like, like for some people, the sight or sound of somebody clipping their fingernails is fucking like awful, disgusting for them.\n\n05:45.160 --> 05:49.160\nLike, like other people's teeth scraping on a fork, you don't know.\n\n05:49.160 --> 05:56.160\nSo I try, I went, I went, I went over to a garbage can away from everybody else and I, I just very discreetly was like, it's just going to be one thumbnail.\n\n05:56.160 --> 05:59.160\nAnd I, and I clipped and it went shooting like a rocket.\n\n05:59.160 --> 06:04.160\nJust missed someone's head like that was sitting and I just like ignored it.\n\n06:04.160 --> 06:09.160\nI'm amazed.\n\n06:09.160 --> 06:12.160\nWhat if I had pelted somebody with a fingernail?\n\n06:12.160 --> 06:13.160\nThat would be a bummer.\n\n06:13.160 --> 06:14.160\nThat would be insane.\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:16.160\nLike, what do you, how do you even get out of that?\n\n06:16.160 --> 06:17.160\nHow do you even, what do you even say?\n\n06:17.160 --> 06:20.160\nDid you enjoy your radio head experience yesterday?\n\n06:20.160 --> 06:21.160\nYeah, it was good.\n\n06:21.160 --> 06:26.160\nI was, I just ate a lot of funnel cake and like peanut butter and chocolate and got a real bad heartburn.\n\n06:26.160 --> 06:27.160\nBut outside lands was fun.\n\n06:27.160 --> 06:28.160\nWe were walking around it.\n\n06:28.160 --> 06:30.160\nI mean, I didn't like watch Radiohead or anything.\n\n06:30.160 --> 06:32.160\nYou can hear him playing in any way.\n\n06:32.160 --> 06:35.160\nAnd I, it's like, it's not, it's not, it's like they're going to be better live.\n\n06:35.160 --> 06:36.160\nIt's Radiohead.\n\n06:36.160 --> 06:39.160\nNot, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're not acoustic head.\n\n06:39.160 --> 06:44.160\nThey're not, they're not, they're not, they're not the pixies.\n\n06:44.160 --> 06:46.160\nThey fucking, they have radios for heads.\n\n06:46.160 --> 06:47.160\nThey're like, they're there.\n\n06:47.160 --> 06:52.160\nAs I understand it, they radio rock and radio roll.\n\n06:52.160 --> 06:55.160\nThe devil wants your station.\n\n06:55.160 --> 06:59.160\nBroadcasting all night long.\n\n06:59.160 --> 07:03.160\nMy black heart's got a woofer tweeter.\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:07.160\nBroadcast my song on a radio head.\n\n07:07.160 --> 07:13.160\nWas this song sung by Starscream from the Decepticons?\n\n07:13.160 --> 07:20.160\nOn the way out to San Francisco, you know, you go up to the kiosk right before the X-ray\n\n07:20.160 --> 07:21.160\nmachines.\n\n07:21.160 --> 07:24.160\nAnd everybody's using the QR code things now.\n\n07:24.160 --> 07:27.160\nAnd I go, boop, and it doesn't work.\n\n07:27.160 --> 07:28.160\nEverybody else goes through.\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:30.160\nThe guy's like, it's real cranky.\n\n07:30.160 --> 07:33.160\nAnd he goes, he goes, it's not working.\n\n07:33.160 --> 07:34.160\nIt's not reading your thing.\n\n07:34.160 --> 07:37.160\nAnd I'm like, well, boop, you know, it's not, it's not working.\n\n07:37.160 --> 07:40.160\nAnd then the guy's like, well, do you have a paper ticket?\n\n07:40.160 --> 07:41.160\nAnd I said, no.\n\n07:41.160 --> 07:44.160\nAnd he's like, well, that's weird.\n\n07:44.160 --> 07:45.160\nWhat?\n\n07:45.160 --> 07:46.160\nYeah, that's so weird.\n\n07:46.160 --> 07:47.160\nSo weird to not.\n\n07:47.160 --> 07:53.160\nBecause when we made the decision to maybe cut down a few less trees by using fucking\n\n07:53.160 --> 08:00.160\ncoal electric plants to get on the plane instead, it would be weird to not do both.\n\n08:00.160 --> 08:05.160\nIt would be weird to not cut down a tree, turn that into a ticket, and then also have\n\n08:05.160 --> 08:08.160\na power plant chug into your phone, and then also use that.\n\n08:08.160 --> 08:10.160\nYeah, real weird.\n\n08:10.160 --> 08:11.160\nFucking dick.\n\n08:11.160 --> 08:15.160\nWhy don't you just, how about you stick to what's ISIS and what's not ISIS?\n\n08:15.160 --> 08:20.160\nAnd I'll tell you what's weird, you fucking fake cop.\n\n08:20.160 --> 08:24.160\nFucking weird, weird, weird fake cop with a baggy ass uniform.\n\n08:24.160 --> 08:26.160\nThey're always all baggy and dirty.\n\n08:26.160 --> 08:29.160\nThey look like they're wearing cop pajamas.\n\n08:29.160 --> 08:34.160\nFucking misshapen, fucking cop rejects, fucking critches.\n\n08:34.160 --> 08:39.160\nEvery single one of them just either at the bottom of their life or walking a razor thin\n\n08:39.160 --> 08:42.160\nline between fucking like.\n\n08:42.160 --> 08:47.160\nYou're never going on TSA Pre again, my friends.\n\n08:47.160 --> 08:50.160\nOh yeah, TSA Pre, sure.\n\n08:50.160 --> 08:54.160\nLet's get that vampire in our kitchen, sure.\n\n08:54.160 --> 08:56.160\nDoes anybody have TSA Pre?\n\n08:56.160 --> 08:58.160\nDoes anybody subject themselves to that?\n\n08:58.160 --> 09:01.160\nI always wonder about that.\n\n09:01.160 --> 09:05.160\nYou said it's supposed to be great, is that what you said?\n\n09:05.160 --> 09:08.160\nYeah, I know it looks great and they make it look great because they have a whole lane\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:10.160\nthat they're not using.\n\n09:10.160 --> 09:12.160\nWhat's that?\n\n09:12.160 --> 09:14.160\nIt's not convenient.\n\n09:14.160 --> 09:16.160\nAsk for a wheelchair?\n\n09:16.160 --> 09:19.160\nYou could smuggle drugs if you got a wheelchair.\n\n09:19.160 --> 09:24.160\nJust get an international travel number and then you don't have to figure out your laptop,\n\n09:24.160 --> 09:26.160\nyour internet, your pre-check, your everything.\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:31.160\nI find the best way to get through security fast is be Seth Rogen.\n\n09:31.160 --> 09:33.160\nYeah.\n\n09:33.160 --> 09:37.160\nI think I told on the show before where I broke my toe and I had a cane and I got right through everything.\n\n09:37.160 --> 09:42.160\nI just had a cane, I just had a broken pinky toe and I got right up in front.\n\n09:42.160 --> 09:50.160\nI was behind her like a Iraq veteran, like who had been blown up below the knee on both legs.\n\n09:50.160 --> 09:53.160\nI was like, I just have a little boo-boo.\n\n09:53.160 --> 09:56.160\nAnd yet they walk you right through.\n\n09:56.160 --> 09:59.160\nYou?\n\n09:59.160 --> 10:03.160\nSo you guys know what hyper plexia is?\n\n10:03.160 --> 10:06.160\nOh yeah.\n\n10:06.160 --> 10:10.160\nMy girlfriend had a friend at the show.\n\n10:10.160 --> 10:18.160\nOne of her gigs is teaching autistic kids and she's talking about hyper plexia,\n\n10:18.160 --> 10:21.160\nwhich is like the opposite of dyslexia, I guess.\n\n10:21.160 --> 10:27.160\nIt's where you can read really fast, especially like it's little kids in childhood that read really fast,\n\n10:27.160 --> 10:29.160\nbut you have low comprehension.\n\n10:29.160 --> 10:31.160\nYou don't actually know what you're reading.\n\n10:31.160 --> 10:38.160\nI was like, oh yeah, I can read really well, but I have to read like, if I didn't know you weren't supposed to move your lips when you read,\n\n10:38.160 --> 10:42.160\nI would absolutely move my lips because that's only how fast I can understand anything,\n\n10:42.160 --> 10:47.160\nlike here in my head, but I could read like a page and just not have any retention.\n\n10:47.160 --> 10:49.160\nI wonder if I'm hyper plexic.\n\n10:49.160 --> 10:50.160\nWouldn't that be cool?\n\n10:50.160 --> 10:52.160\nThat would be amazing.\n\n10:52.160 --> 10:54.160\nWouldn't that be cool, Jeff?\n\n10:54.160 --> 10:56.160\nIf I was hyper plexic?\n\n10:56.160 --> 10:58.160\nSo cool.\n\n10:58.160 --> 11:01.160\nYou'd be like the fawns of reading.\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:09.160\nYeah, because he loved rock and roll, but he'd hit the jukebox and it would just play or stop playing.\n\n11:09.160 --> 11:10.160\nI was like, he's too good.\n\n11:10.160 --> 11:12.160\nHe called the toilet his office.\n\n11:12.160 --> 11:13.160\nHe doesn't fucking know.\n\n11:13.160 --> 11:14.160\nWhat a cool guy.\n\n11:14.160 --> 11:15.160\nWhat a cool guy.\n\n11:15.160 --> 11:17.160\nCalled the toilet his office.\n\n11:17.160 --> 11:22.160\nHe was 55 and like hung out with teenagers who were 38.\n\n11:22.160 --> 11:26.160\nHe was a 55 year old Jewish guy who hung out with teenagers.\n\n11:26.160 --> 11:33.160\nHe was four foot three, just lived in your attic and told everyone to sit on it all the time.\n\n11:33.160 --> 11:34.160\nSit on what?\n\n11:34.160 --> 11:35.160\nIt.\n\n11:35.160 --> 11:37.160\nSit on his dick?\n\n11:37.160 --> 11:39.160\nDo you think that's what sit on it meant?\n\n11:39.160 --> 11:42.160\nSit on my dick?\n\n11:42.160 --> 11:44.160\nIt's rape culture, man.\n\n11:44.160 --> 11:46.160\nIt's fucked up.\n\n11:46.160 --> 11:53.160\nThe 50s were fucked up in the 70s.\n\n11:53.160 --> 11:56.160\nGary Marshall just passed away. Why are we laughing?\n\n11:56.160 --> 11:58.160\nStop it.\n\n11:58.160 --> 12:02.160\nWay to go, you fucking ghouls.\n\n12:02.160 --> 12:06.160\nI'm sure 75% of people have never seen an episode of Happy Days in their life.\n\n12:06.160 --> 12:10.160\nYeah, but everybody knows about it and that goes to Gary Marshall's efficacy.\n\n12:10.160 --> 12:13.160\nHe did more community in Laverne and Shirley.\n\n12:13.160 --> 12:15.160\nWhen do you think Happy Days jumped the shark?\n\n12:15.160 --> 12:26.160\nI'll say it was two seasons before the shark episode.\n\n12:26.160 --> 12:32.160\nThat's when they brought Mark on when Mark was there.\n\n12:32.160 --> 12:34.160\nI met the guy that coined that phrase.\n\n12:34.160 --> 12:36.160\nHe's on Stern, right?\n\n12:36.160 --> 12:39.160\nOne of the Stern network shows or something?\n\n12:39.160 --> 12:40.160\nYeah, that's what he says.\n\n12:40.160 --> 12:42.160\nOkay, grandpa.\n\n12:42.160 --> 12:45.160\nSeriously, that's it. That's all I got.\n\n12:45.160 --> 12:47.160\nThat's all the show we have?\n\n12:47.160 --> 12:52.160\nWell, we gave him a lot in San Francisco and then we turned out we weren't recording.\n\n12:52.160 --> 12:54.160\nThat's what happened.\n\n12:54.160 --> 12:59.160\nI did a whole thing where I did a Michael Winslow meets Radiohead thing.\n\n12:59.160 --> 13:03.160\nI mean, do it again. I tried to do so much again already.\n\n13:03.160 --> 13:12.160\nYou did a concert full of can-openers.\n\n13:12.160 --> 13:16.160\nElectric can-openers went to a concert where Radiohead was playing.\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:20.160\nWell, I'm going to tweak it. I'm going to change it now that we get to do it again.\n\n13:20.160 --> 13:26.160\nThere was a helicopter and Michael Winslow was flying the helicopter while having a leaf blower going.\n\n13:26.160 --> 13:29.160\nSo I'm going to tweak it so you don't have to recap it.\n\n13:29.160 --> 13:31.160\nMorgan Freeman showed up at some point.\n\n13:31.160 --> 13:38.160\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to say Michael Winslow is getting into a helicopter made of can-openers.\n\n13:38.160 --> 13:43.160\nSo he has to start each electric can opener to make the helicopter get going.\n\n13:43.160 --> 13:47.160\nAnd then he's going to use a leaf blower to attack Radiohead.\n\n13:47.160 --> 13:51.160\nWhy? Jesus.\n\n13:51.160 --> 13:52.160\nDoes somebody actually say why?\n\n13:52.160 --> 13:56.160\nYeah, I mean, he just blurted it out. It's like, why?\n\n13:56.160 --> 14:00.160\nI almost forgive him. He didn't even think about it.\n\n14:00.160 --> 14:02.160\nI have to forgive it because that's immersion.\n\n14:02.160 --> 14:03.160\nHe's immersed.\n\n14:03.160 --> 14:04.160\nHow high are the stakes?\n\n14:04.160 --> 14:06.160\nYeah, he's like, why? Why? Why?\n\n14:06.160 --> 14:12.160\nOh, I actually know the answer, sir, because Morgan Freeman shows up. That's why he's doing it.\n\n14:12.160 --> 14:14.160\nNo, you're just confusing people.\n\n14:14.160 --> 14:18.160\nWe don't have to recreate the dumb...\n\n14:18.160 --> 14:20.160\nOkay, walk us through what you're going to do now.\n\n14:20.160 --> 14:23.160\nOkay, so Michael Winslow is...\n\n14:23.160 --> 14:27.160\nEither take your shirt off or don't take your shirt off.\n\n14:27.160 --> 14:30.160\nI have to take off my shirt.\n\n14:30.160 --> 14:33.160\nFuck it.\n\n14:33.160 --> 14:36.160\nDan Forgotty was taking his shirt off halfway through.\n\n14:36.160 --> 14:38.160\nI was just going to leave it there.\n\n14:38.160 --> 14:40.160\nI had more to say if I was saying I can't talk.\n\n14:40.160 --> 14:43.160\nHave a weird halter top on for the rest of the show.\n\n14:43.160 --> 14:45.160\nYeah, I...\n\n14:50.160 --> 14:53.160\nI'm just starting to wash in everybody's car.\n\n14:53.160 --> 14:57.160\nJust bringing hot wings to your seats.\n\n14:57.160 --> 15:03.160\nMichael Winslow is getting in his helicopter made of electric hand openers.\n\n15:03.160 --> 15:13.160\nAnd to answer your question, sir, the answer is because Radiohead and Michael Winslow both operate in the field of phonics sound.\n\n15:13.160 --> 15:22.160\nAnd Radiohead, Michael Winslow mistakenly feels is abusing sound because they're using electronics and things.\n\n15:22.160 --> 15:24.160\nHe's more analog.\n\n15:24.160 --> 15:27.160\nHe's more analog and it feels that sound that he's...\n\n15:27.160 --> 15:30.160\nBoth of them are locked in a flawed dichotomy.\n\n15:30.160 --> 15:41.160\nWhat happens is they learn to overcome their differences because there's a third truly evil force that they have to unite, but no spoilers.\n\n15:41.160 --> 15:43.160\nOkay, but this is like...\n\n15:43.160 --> 15:49.160\nDo we find Michael Winslow going to his helicopter pad at Michael Winslow Manor?\n\n15:49.160 --> 15:55.160\nThat's just... he makes that sound while he's like...\n\n15:55.160 --> 15:57.160\nAnd then he goes up...\n\n16:02.160 --> 16:06.160\nI want to get on my helicopter made of hand openers.\n\n16:08.160 --> 16:10.160\nWait, hold on.\n\n16:10.160 --> 16:13.160\nShit.\n\n16:16.160 --> 16:18.160\nDan, we don't have to do this.\n\n16:18.160 --> 16:23.160\nIf you're not ready, this is called refusal of a call, isn't it?\n\n16:23.160 --> 16:41.160\nThe refusal of a call.\n\n16:53.160 --> 17:04.160\nEverything\n\n17:04.160 --> 17:10.160\nEverything\n\n17:10.160 --> 17:13.160\nIs it as right, what the fuck?\n\n17:13.160 --> 17:15.160\nBrrrr\n\n17:15.160 --> 17:19.160\nSo to leave, blur\n\n17:19.160 --> 17:22.160\nIn the wrong place\n\n17:22.160 --> 17:24.160\nEverything!\n\n17:24.160 --> 17:26.160\nEverything!\n\n17:26.160 --> 17:28.160\nEverything!\n\n17:38.160 --> 17:41.160\nEverything is in its right place.\n\n17:41.160 --> 17:43.160\nLet's get back to things.\n\n17:43.160 --> 17:46.160\nHey, whatever the lead singer of Radiohead's name is.\n\n17:47.160 --> 17:49.160\nIt's me, your right-hand man.\n\n17:49.160 --> 17:52.160\nWhatever my name is, the bass player.\n\n17:52.160 --> 17:54.160\nIf we have a bass...\n\n17:58.160 --> 18:00.160\nWhat is it, Tyler?\n\n18:03.160 --> 18:08.160\nShould we go check to make sure Michael Winslow is truly taken out?\n\n18:09.160 --> 18:11.160\nYou saw the explosion.\n\n18:13.160 --> 18:16.160\nThat one wasn't a mouth noise one.\n\n18:16.160 --> 18:18.160\nShubris!\n\n18:18.160 --> 18:21.160\nEverything!\n\n18:21.160 --> 18:25.160\nIn its right place.\n\n18:25.160 --> 18:27.160\nIn its right place.\n\n18:31.160 --> 18:33.160\nOh, shit.\n\n18:37.160 --> 18:39.160\nLeg wound.\n\n18:40.160 --> 18:42.160\nTwig.\n\n18:42.160 --> 18:44.160\nStab.\n\n18:44.160 --> 18:46.160\nStab.\n\n18:48.160 --> 18:50.160\nSecond twig.\n\n18:50.160 --> 18:52.160\nStab.\n\n18:53.160 --> 18:55.160\nPocket microphone.\n\n18:55.160 --> 18:58.160\nTiny jam box speaker.\n\n19:02.160 --> 19:07.160\nAd hoc, strange, phonic-based, first aid technique.\n\n19:07.160 --> 19:12.160\nIn which the two twigs pick up like a dowsing rod.\n\n19:13.160 --> 19:17.160\nThe sound of my healing, but it's not going to feel good.\n\n19:25.160 --> 19:27.160\nThere, stop the bleeding.\n\n19:29.160 --> 19:32.160\nEverything!\n\n19:32.160 --> 19:34.160\nIn its right place.\n\n19:34.160 --> 19:36.160\nThank you everybody, we're Radiohead.\n\n19:36.160 --> 19:38.160\nAlright, goodnight.\n\n19:38.160 --> 19:40.160\nMan, Tyler, that was great.\n\n19:40.160 --> 19:42.160\nLet's go back to the dressing room.\n\n19:42.160 --> 19:43.160\nYeah, come on.\n\n19:43.160 --> 19:46.160\nMan, we fucking Radioheaded those motherfuckers.\n\n19:47.160 --> 19:49.160\nOh, shit.\n\n19:52.160 --> 19:54.160\nMichael Winslow.\n\n19:57.160 --> 19:59.160\nTake it easy, man.\n\n19:59.160 --> 20:01.160\nJust take it easy.\n\n20:01.160 --> 20:06.160\nNo.\n\n20:06.160 --> 20:10.160\nI think there's been a big misunderstanding.\n\n20:10.160 --> 20:17.160\nAnd if we all just remember that we both enjoy the nuances of sound.\n\n20:17.160 --> 20:19.160\nTwo knives.\n\n20:19.160 --> 20:26.160\nTwo knives.\n\n20:26.160 --> 20:30.160\nShit, he made the sound of them bouncing off his head, so they did.\n\n20:34.160 --> 20:37.160\nJust beat him up silently.\n\n20:37.160 --> 20:39.160\nI said silently, Steve.\n\n20:39.160 --> 20:41.160\nSorry.\n\n20:41.160 --> 20:46.160\nWhat the fuck?\n\n20:50.160 --> 20:53.160\nEverybody, go outside, under the deck.\n\n20:53.160 --> 20:56.160\nLook, it's a giant thing.\n\n20:56.160 --> 20:58.160\nI'm so exhausted, I'm not going to make anything up.\n\n21:00.160 --> 21:02.160\nIt's a giant thing.\n\n21:02.160 --> 21:13.160\nWork together.\n\n21:13.160 --> 21:15.160\nYeah.\n\n21:15.160 --> 21:18.160\nSee you next summer.\n\n21:18.160 --> 21:20.160\nWait.\n\n21:20.160 --> 21:24.160\nThe third act didn't.\n\n21:24.160 --> 21:27.160\nIt kind of rushed towards the end there.\n\n21:27.160 --> 21:36.160\nSo Radiohead and Michael Winslow learned to work together to defeat the giant thing by making fart sound.\n\n21:36.160 --> 21:38.160\nYeah, they farted on it.\n\n21:38.160 --> 21:41.160\nI like that. I didn't know that Radiohead was run by Stephen Tyler.\n\n21:41.160 --> 21:42.160\nYeah.\n\n21:42.160 --> 21:44.160\nThere was Steve Ann's Tyler.\n\n21:46.160 --> 21:48.160\nYep, yep, yep.\n\n21:48.160 --> 21:57.160\nThere are two keyboards in here. There's a song I want to play.\n\n21:57.160 --> 22:02.160\nThere's a song I want to play.\n\n22:02.160 --> 22:11.160\nEverything in its right place.\n\n22:11.160 --> 22:13.160\nRadiohead.\n\n22:13.160 --> 22:19.160\nI like, no, please.\n\n22:19.160 --> 22:24.160\nBut what would it be like if Radiohead worked at your local produce section?\n\n22:24.160 --> 22:27.160\nI think it would go a little something.\n\n22:27.160 --> 22:32.160\nYesterday I found someone sucking this lemon.\n\n22:32.160 --> 22:35.160\nOkay.\n\n22:35.160 --> 22:40.160\nI just remembered there's some produce in their lyrics and I got excited.\n\n22:40.160 --> 22:44.160\nOkay, all right, all right. There's still no show. There's no show.\n\n22:44.160 --> 22:46.160\nThat was a brief distraction.\n\n22:46.160 --> 22:48.160\nI thought we had guests tonight. We don't have guests.\n\n22:48.160 --> 22:51.160\nNo, we were going to have some guests and then they canceled.\n\n22:51.160 --> 22:52.160\nWhat?\n\n22:52.160 --> 22:53.160\nWhat?\n\n22:53.160 --> 22:54.160\nYeah.\n\n22:54.160 --> 22:57.160\nYou mean Stephen Tyler couldn't make it tonight?\n\n22:57.160 --> 22:58.160\nMorgan Freeman?\n\n22:58.160 --> 23:01.160\nMorgan Freeman. He'd be great.\n\n23:01.160 --> 23:04.160\nWhat happened to them? I mean, should we talk about...\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:09.160\nWell, the bad news is they canceled, but the good news is it was Andy Dick.\n\n23:09.160 --> 23:19.160\nSo, yeah, we dodged our own bullet out of our own gun.\n\n23:19.160 --> 23:21.160\nYeah, it was Dino and Andy were going to...\n\n23:21.160 --> 23:25.160\nTino and Andy have a new podcast together, which sounds like a bad idea.\n\n23:25.160 --> 23:28.160\nProbably is. And they were going to join us.\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:29.160\nYeah.\n\n23:29.160 --> 23:31.160\nI'm sad. What was their excuse tonight?\n\n23:31.160 --> 23:37.160\nWell, the same thing that makes them fun to be around probably just makes it hard for them to schedule.\n\n23:37.160 --> 23:40.160\nI mean, they're kind of an unpredictable combo.\n\n23:40.160 --> 23:44.160\nAndy's sober now, though, isn't he? He's been on the wagon for quite a while.\n\n23:44.160 --> 23:48.160\nYeah, he's been on the wagon many, many, many times.\n\n23:48.160 --> 23:51.160\nHe's getting very good at being on the wagon, yeah.\n\n23:51.160 --> 23:54.160\nI don't know. I'm not going to...\n\n23:54.160 --> 23:57.160\nWe will talk to him about that when he comes, you know?\n\n23:57.160 --> 23:58.160\nYeah.\n\n23:58.160 --> 24:00.160\nHe's a good guy.\n\n24:00.160 --> 24:02.160\nHe's a great guy.\n\n24:02.160 --> 24:08.160\nHe tried to get in bed with me at the Disneyland Great Californian Hotel.\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:14.160\nWe were there doing an event for ABC, and he tried his hardest to get in bed with me.\n\n24:14.160 --> 24:20.160\nAnd, like, I was asleep, and he ordered everything on the room service menu.\n\n24:20.160 --> 24:25.160\nEverything. He ordered everything on the menu. He ordered it up there.\n\n24:25.160 --> 24:28.160\nAnd then just left.\n\n24:28.160 --> 24:30.160\nDid he eat the food?\n\n24:30.160 --> 24:34.160\nWell, he weighs as much as my shoe.\n\n24:34.160 --> 24:41.160\nHe ordered a thousand people's worth of food, and then just ate, like, a bite of a cheeseburger,\n\n24:41.160 --> 24:46.160\nand then just fucked right off after trying to physically assault me.\n\n24:46.160 --> 24:48.160\nLike, he wanted to make love?\n\n24:48.160 --> 24:51.160\nHe, yeah. Yeah.\n\n24:54.160 --> 24:59.160\nHe was in my car one time, and his son was in the back.\n\n24:59.160 --> 25:04.160\nAnd his son, I think, was not quite 21 yet. I think he was, like, 19 or 20, and we were going to a bar.\n\n25:04.160 --> 25:09.160\nSo I've got Andy and his underage son in the back of my new Lexus.\n\n25:09.160 --> 25:14.160\nAnd Andy pulls out of his coat a Heineken the size of a keg.\n\n25:14.160 --> 25:16.160\nI must have told the story before on the show, no?\n\n25:16.160 --> 25:17.160\nI can't remember.\n\n25:17.160 --> 25:18.160\nHave I?\n\n25:18.160 --> 25:19.160\nNo.\n\n25:19.160 --> 25:21.160\nHe pulls one of those giant Heineken's out, the big ones.\n\n25:21.160 --> 25:26.160\nLike, a Dave Kline fosters, you know, kind of like a big-ass beer, and opens it up,\n\n25:26.160 --> 25:30.160\nand it explodes all over every bit.\n\n25:30.160 --> 25:40.160\nMy face, every, the windshield, every part of the interior of my car is covered in warm Heineken foam.\n\n25:40.160 --> 25:47.160\nAnd it's nighttime, we're driving down Hollywood Boulevard, and he's got the door open.\n\n25:47.160 --> 25:54.160\nLike, the door is fully open, so I'm driving down the street, and he's shouting the N-word at full volume.\n\n25:54.160 --> 25:57.160\nTo everybody that we pass.\n\n25:57.160 --> 26:02.160\nThen we come to a stop around Hollywood and Vine, like maybe Argyle, somewhere around there.\n\n26:02.160 --> 26:04.160\nAnd guess who's about to cross the street?\n\n26:04.160 --> 26:05.160\nBlack gentleman.\n\n26:05.160 --> 26:08.160\nI'm like, Andy, fucking don't, don't.\n\n26:08.160 --> 26:12.160\nI'm looking in the rear of your mirror at his son, and the son's looking at me like,\n\n26:12.160 --> 26:15.160\nwe both have a look like we may have to kill him.\n\n26:15.160 --> 26:18.160\nWe might have to kill Andy before he does.\n\n26:18.160 --> 26:22.160\nHe's like a crying baby behind enemy lines in Vietnam.\n\n26:22.160 --> 26:26.160\nShut that Andy dick up!\n\n26:26.160 --> 26:28.160\nSmother him.\n\n26:35.160 --> 26:41.160\nSo, he opens the door and starts screaming the N-word at this middle aged black gentleman,\n\n26:41.160 --> 26:48.160\nwho sees it as Andy Dick and just gets a big kick out of it.\n\n26:48.160 --> 26:52.160\nMy car is covered, my car now smells like a warm Heineken.\n\n26:52.160 --> 26:57.160\nAnd we get to this bar on Vine, and we get in there, and I was so bummed out,\n\n26:57.160 --> 27:01.160\nand Andy walks in, he has a broken finger, and if you asked him why, he doesn't know.\n\n27:01.160 --> 27:04.160\nHe doesn't remember how he got it, he's got a broken index finger on his left hand.\n\n27:04.160 --> 27:08.160\nHe sees a girl sitting with a cocktail, and he puts his index finger in her drink,\n\n27:08.160 --> 27:11.160\nlike a brand new, clearly just vodka on the rocks.\n\n27:11.160 --> 27:15.160\nJust sticks his finger into her drink, and then picks it up and walks off with it.\n\n27:15.160 --> 27:18.160\nAnd this girl's like, what the fuck?\n\n27:18.160 --> 27:20.160\nAnd I was like, what was that, vodka?\n\n27:20.160 --> 27:23.160\nI said, yeah, it's a kettle of rocks, I just fucking got it, I'll get you a new drink.\n\n27:23.160 --> 27:25.160\nAnd she's like, who the fuck is this guy?\n\n27:25.160 --> 27:27.160\nI go, do you know who Andy Dick is?\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:31.160\nAnd he's like, no, I'm like, it's better that you don't.\n\n27:31.160 --> 27:35.160\nAnd I turn to his son, I said, I'm going to beat your father up tonight,\n\n27:35.160 --> 27:38.160\nand you're going to either help me or watch.\n\n27:38.160 --> 27:42.160\nAnd he says, I will help you.\n\n27:42.160 --> 27:48.160\nSo maybe they'll be here next week.\n\n27:48.160 --> 27:51.160\nHe is the best at being the worst.\n\n27:51.160 --> 27:58.160\nHe makes Dino look like me.\n\n27:58.160 --> 28:01.160\nYeah, they used to be a comedy team, a lot of people don't know that.\n\n28:01.160 --> 28:07.160\nThey used to do like a two-man comedy act, where Andy would hit Dino as hard as he could.\n\n28:07.160 --> 28:10.160\nAnd Dino would get a boner or something.\n\n28:10.160 --> 28:13.160\nI don't know what the punchline was.\n\n28:13.160 --> 28:17.160\nI think they did like old, like Abbott and Costello routines,\n\n28:17.160 --> 28:21.160\nbut instead of like slapping, they'd actually, he'd really physically like smash him.\n\n28:21.160 --> 28:25.160\nThey have a podcast coming to Feral Audio, that's why.\n\n28:25.160 --> 28:26.160\nWhat's it called?\n\n28:26.160 --> 28:28.160\nSkull juice.\n\n28:28.160 --> 28:30.160\nSkull juice.\n\n28:30.160 --> 28:31.160\nGross.\n\n28:31.160 --> 28:32.160\nSkull juice.\n\n28:32.160 --> 28:34.160\nWell, listen at your own risk.\n\n28:34.160 --> 28:36.160\nYeah.\n\n28:36.160 --> 28:44.160\nAll right, well, who here has a problem that needs to be solved?\n\n28:44.160 --> 28:46.160\nYoung lady, your hand went up first.\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:48.160\nI think I see glasses.\n\n28:48.160 --> 28:50.160\nDo you want to come up and share your problem?\n\n28:50.160 --> 28:51.160\nAll right.\n\n28:51.160 --> 28:52.160\nOkay.\n\n28:52.160 --> 28:54.160\nWho do we got?\n\n28:54.160 --> 28:56.160\nWhat's your name, Adam?\n\n28:56.160 --> 28:57.160\nGabrielle, hello.\n\n28:57.160 --> 28:58.160\nIs it Adam?\n\n28:58.160 --> 28:59.160\nIs it?\n\n28:59.160 --> 29:00.160\nOkay.\n\n29:00.160 --> 29:01.160\nOkay.\n\n29:01.160 --> 29:02.160\nSorry.\n\n29:02.160 --> 29:03.160\nI saw glasses in a ponytail.\n\n29:03.160 --> 29:04.160\nYeah, no.\n\n29:04.160 --> 29:05.160\nWe're in Los Angeles.\n\n29:05.160 --> 29:06.160\nThat's accurate.\n\n29:06.160 --> 29:08.160\nSo that's one of the problems.\n\n29:08.160 --> 29:09.160\nIs it?\n\n29:09.160 --> 29:10.160\nThe Gender Decademy.\n\n29:10.160 --> 29:11.160\nOh, okay.\n\n29:11.160 --> 29:14.160\nI know I can help with that.\n\n29:14.160 --> 29:16.160\nYou're the king.\n\n29:16.160 --> 29:21.160\nI have a surgeon's touch with the gender politics.\n\n29:21.160 --> 29:23.160\nThe trans community loves me.\n\n29:23.160 --> 29:24.160\nThey trust me.\n\n29:24.160 --> 29:25.160\nIt's true.\n\n29:25.160 --> 29:28.160\nThey said that to me.\n\n29:28.160 --> 29:30.160\nWhere are the meetings again?\n\n29:30.160 --> 29:34.160\nIt's just like, it's actually like behind Meltdown Comics.\n\n29:34.160 --> 29:35.160\nWhat are you doing out?\n\n29:35.160 --> 29:40.160\nIf you need help with that logo, too, I sure as heck.\n\n29:40.160 --> 29:47.160\nWell, so what's the, Gabrielle, how can we help you?\n\n29:47.160 --> 29:53.160\nI have chronic pain throughout the right side of my body.\n\n29:53.160 --> 29:56.160\nI don't know how you can help me.\n\n29:56.160 --> 30:00.160\nWe can hit you very hard on the left side of your body.\n\n30:00.160 --> 30:02.160\nCreate some balance.\n\n30:02.160 --> 30:03.160\nThat makes sense.\n\n30:03.160 --> 30:11.160\nNo, it's just, yeah, I've been to more doctors in the past two years than I have in my entire life.\n\n30:11.160 --> 30:13.160\nHow do I start?\n\n30:13.160 --> 30:20.160\nSlowly, because with chronic pain, it's like, you don't realize, you just think you're lazy and need to work out more.\n\n30:20.160 --> 30:22.160\nSo it's like, eventually...\n\n30:22.160 --> 30:27.160\nSorry, I'm ignorant about this. Did it come from an injury or just kind of came on all of a sudden?\n\n30:27.160 --> 30:36.160\nYeah, it kind of came on all of a sudden, when I was like 20 or something, I started realizing my body kind of sucked.\n\n30:36.160 --> 30:38.160\nAre you currently in pain right now?\n\n30:38.160 --> 30:46.160\nYeah, it hurts like right here. It gets better at like, it gets better and worse-ish.\n\n30:46.160 --> 30:49.160\nWhat kind of pain? Is it like a throbbing pain or a shooting pain?\n\n30:49.160 --> 30:52.160\nIt's almost like a numb pain.\n\n30:52.160 --> 30:54.160\nIs it like nerve pain?\n\n30:54.160 --> 30:58.160\nDo you know the same thing? Is it on one side?\n\n30:58.160 --> 31:00.160\nYeah, it's on the right side.\n\n31:00.160 --> 31:02.160\nDo you know what it is?\n\n31:02.160 --> 31:04.160\nWell, let's get you up here.\n\n31:04.160 --> 31:06.160\nI told you we could help you.\n\n31:06.160 --> 31:09.160\nWe're going to build like a Voltron right now.\n\n31:09.160 --> 31:21.160\nAs long as you guys are okay becoming one person that's made of two left sides, I think we have the solution.\n\n31:21.160 --> 31:23.160\nMy name is Marina.\n\n31:23.160 --> 31:25.160\nHello Marina.\n\n31:25.160 --> 31:27.160\nSorry, I kind of sucked you up here.\n\n31:27.160 --> 31:29.160\nI didn't make sure that you would be okay coming up.\n\n31:29.160 --> 31:33.160\nThis is actually great because I have some advice for you too.\n\n31:33.160 --> 31:43.160\nI've got Lyme disease and so I've had to have multiple surgeries on my joints because they've collapsed and you've got a nice little Frankenstein kind of scar here.\n\n31:43.160 --> 31:48.160\nI've had nerve pain all throughout the right side of my body for it.\n\n31:48.160 --> 31:57.160\nThen to doctors, just like you, in and out of different pain clinics and stuff, but I finally found something that works.\n\n31:57.160 --> 31:59.160\nWoo, sorry.\n\n31:59.160 --> 32:02.160\nIt's a tough thing.\n\n32:02.160 --> 32:05.160\nWhereabouts? You said it's right about here?\n\n32:05.160 --> 32:12.160\nIt kind of just goes throughout my body and so it becomes hard to...\n\n32:12.160 --> 32:24.160\nIt kind of goes up into my shoulder, like it starts like down around this area, comes up, goes into my shoulder and then my neck hurts so much.\n\n32:24.160 --> 32:28.160\nIt kind of like makes my head all foggy all the time and so...\n\n32:28.160 --> 32:32.160\nOkay, I actually, I'm a massage therapist as well.\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:35.160\nI can like try something.\n\n32:35.160 --> 32:37.160\nSure.\n\n32:37.160 --> 32:39.160\nThis is great.\n\n32:39.160 --> 32:42.160\nBack to come to Harmontown and get a massage.\n\n32:42.160 --> 32:45.160\nYeah, sure. I don't know if I could drop the mic.\n\n32:45.160 --> 32:48.160\nIs there a waiver that we have?\n\n32:48.160 --> 32:51.160\nWe're not a medical clinic. This is all on her.\n\n32:51.160 --> 32:53.160\nOkay.\n\n32:53.160 --> 32:58.160\nYou are surrendering your safety to her.\n\n32:58.160 --> 33:01.160\nThis is all consensual.\n\n33:01.160 --> 33:06.160\nThis is good.\n\n33:06.160 --> 33:09.160\nI thought, I thought for sure it seemed like, which is that I think I might be able to help you.\n\n33:09.160 --> 33:11.160\nI was like, if she says squarespace.com.\n\n33:11.160 --> 33:13.160\nYeah.\n\n33:13.160 --> 33:16.160\nWe're going to be rich.\n\n33:16.160 --> 33:18.160\nYeah.\n\n33:18.160 --> 33:22.160\nCan we get the lights down a little bit lower right now?\n\n33:22.160 --> 33:26.160\nGonna prepare your nerve damage with massage.\n\n33:26.160 --> 33:30.160\nYeah, to the break of time.\n\n33:30.160 --> 33:32.160\nYeah.\n\n33:32.160 --> 33:35.160\nGet off my lawn.\n\n33:35.160 --> 33:42.160\nJeff's taking the leg that doesn't hurt.\n\n33:42.160 --> 33:44.160\nYeah, deep tissue.\n\n33:44.160 --> 33:46.160\nGet inside.\n\n33:46.160 --> 33:49.160\nGet in Gabrielle's neck with your fingers.\n\n33:49.160 --> 33:51.160\nMarina.\n\n33:51.160 --> 33:53.160\nYeah.\n\n33:53.160 --> 33:58.160\nYo, Marina means house on the water.\n\n33:58.160 --> 34:02.160\nYeah.\n\n34:02.160 --> 34:04.160\nYeah.\n\n34:04.160 --> 34:12.160\nThe uninformed Spanish rapper.\n\n34:12.160 --> 34:15.160\nMarina means place where you keep the boat.\n\n34:15.160 --> 34:22.160\nRight now, she's going to help float into Gabrielle's pain\n\n34:22.160 --> 34:26.160\nand win the game with her healing fingertips.\n\n34:26.160 --> 34:28.160\nYeah.\n\n34:28.160 --> 34:30.160\nYeah.\n\n34:30.160 --> 34:32.160\nYeah.\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:34.160\nYeah.\n\n34:34.160 --> 34:36.160\nYeah.\n\n34:36.160 --> 34:38.160\nYeah.\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:40.160\nYeah.\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:55.160\nSo Marina, did you learn this stuff because you had pain and then you went to the doctor and they're like, I don't know, you figure it out.\n\n34:55.160 --> 35:00.160\nActually, I did learn because of an injury.\n\n35:00.160 --> 35:08.160\nI was, I used to run track and my friend was teaching me how to do it, but he was like a foot taller than me.\n\n35:08.160 --> 35:19.160\nI was trying to run a hurdle and I tore my hamstring and the trainer was there and taped me up and it was awesome and she just worked on my legs a bit.\n\n35:19.160 --> 35:25.160\nI was like, whoa, this is magical. Why don't I do this every single day?\n\n35:25.160 --> 35:28.160\nAnd so I went to school for it and it was awesome.\n\n35:28.160 --> 35:32.160\nYou got really comfortable with your body because you got to be naked.\n\n35:32.160 --> 35:37.160\nAnd you know.\n\n35:37.160 --> 35:42.160\nJust when you show up for class.\n\n35:42.160 --> 35:44.160\nYou work on each other.\n\n35:44.160 --> 35:46.160\nDo you work a little Tokyo by any chance?\n\n35:46.160 --> 35:55.160\nNo, actually stopped. I'm a writer now. I'm a future writer for cracks.com now and I do research too.\n\n35:55.160 --> 36:01.160\nBut you know, with all this stuff, I can't do a massage so much anymore, but you said that helped.\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:02.160\nYeah, it does.\n\n36:02.160 --> 36:03.160\nFantastic.\n\n36:03.160 --> 36:04.160\nThank you.\n\n36:04.160 --> 36:09.160\nI have another thing with this chronic pain is actually kind of a rant for me.\n\n36:09.160 --> 36:12.160\nDEA really pisses me off.\n\n36:12.160 --> 36:15.160\nYeah.\n\n36:15.160 --> 36:18.160\nThere was a, there's a nice thing though.\n\n36:18.160 --> 36:25.160\nI'm not on any, you know, not on nearly so many painkillers as they used to be because I discovered something really awesome.\n\n36:25.160 --> 36:33.160\nGot super into, you know, a lot of alternative medicine is bullshit, but there's actually a really good thing called cratum.\n\n36:33.160 --> 36:36.160\nI don't know if any of you guys have heard of it.\n\n36:36.160 --> 36:40.160\nIt's from, you know, Thailand, Malaysia, that area.\n\n36:40.160 --> 36:43.160\nI've been making this tincture out of it and it's totally worked.\n\n36:43.160 --> 36:48.160\nI have some with me if you would like to try it at some point.\n\n36:48.160 --> 36:53.160\nThis is related to your trouble with the DEA, right?\n\n36:53.160 --> 36:55.160\nWhat is that?\n\n36:55.160 --> 36:57.160\nCan you tell us more what cratum is?\n\n36:57.160 --> 36:59.160\nSure, it is a plant.\n\n36:59.160 --> 37:02.160\nIsn't that what spice is made out of?\n\n37:02.160 --> 37:04.160\nNo, no.\n\n37:04.160 --> 37:12.160\nAt least not to, I mean, not to my knowledge if it is, it's probably spicy, probably pretty expensive, but it's a funny thing.\n\n37:12.160 --> 37:19.160\nThere used to be, probably still is, a humongous opium problem in Thailand, I believe it was.\n\n37:19.160 --> 37:23.160\nIt was just one of those countries over there.\n\n37:23.160 --> 37:26.160\nSomewhere around the Golden Triangle.\n\n37:26.160 --> 37:28.160\nOne of those flyover countries.\n\n37:28.160 --> 37:30.160\nYeah, there you go.\n\n37:30.160 --> 37:32.160\nPlaces that you just don't go.\n\n37:32.160 --> 37:41.160\nSo the government was actually providing a lot of this opium and they were discovering that people were chewing the leaves of the cratum tree\n\n37:41.160 --> 37:48.160\njust everywhere and they were not addicted to opium anymore because it actually works to get you off of it.\n\n37:48.160 --> 37:56.160\nSo they made it illegal and also started shopping down all the trees so that they could, you know, get people hooked on opium again.\n\n37:56.160 --> 37:58.160\nAnd it's currently illegal there.\n\n37:58.160 --> 38:00.160\nIt's illegal, I believe, in Canada.\n\n38:00.160 --> 38:02.160\nIt's illegal in the UK.\n\n38:02.160 --> 38:03.160\nIllegal, you're saying?\n\n38:03.160 --> 38:05.160\nYeah, illegal, but it's legal here.\n\n38:05.160 --> 38:07.160\nIt's called cratum?\n\n38:07.160 --> 38:10.160\nYep, K-R-A-T-O-M.\n\n38:10.160 --> 38:12.160\nMost people are still kind of...\n\n38:12.160 --> 38:14.160\nSounds like a He-Man film.\n\n38:14.160 --> 38:17.160\nYeah.\n\n38:17.160 --> 38:22.160\nSo the DEA has been looking at it and like, ah, people are getting high on this.\n\n38:22.160 --> 38:24.160\nThey're actually enjoying themselves.\n\n38:24.160 --> 38:26.160\nWe've got to get rid of this.\n\n38:26.160 --> 38:28.160\nThis is not going to bode well.\n\n38:28.160 --> 38:31.160\nYou get high on it, but it also gets you off of opium?\n\n38:31.160 --> 38:34.160\nIt gets you, yeah, it absolutely works for any kind of withdrawal.\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:37.160\nIf you're not on opium, do you think it might get you on it a little bit?\n\n38:37.160 --> 38:39.160\nI said it may be a gateway.\n\n38:39.160 --> 38:41.160\nAlso, my other question is, are you holding right now?\n\n38:41.160 --> 38:43.160\nNo.\n\n38:43.160 --> 38:45.160\nI never had opium before.\n\n38:45.160 --> 38:47.160\nWhere can a guy get some cratum in this town is my question.\n\n38:47.160 --> 38:49.160\nI get it online.\n\n38:49.160 --> 38:51.160\nJust powder stuff and then I make it.\n\n38:51.160 --> 38:53.160\nYou can also go to cratum barrel, right?\n\n38:53.160 --> 38:55.160\nIt's a...\n\n38:59.160 --> 39:01.160\nAdam Goldberg isn't here anymore.\n\n39:01.160 --> 39:03.160\nI thought I'd cratum barrel.\n\n39:03.160 --> 39:06.160\nI thought I'd do what he'd shout out.\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:08.160\nNow Gabrielle, back to you.\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:14.160\nIs there anything that goes beyond your chronic pain?\n\n39:14.160 --> 39:16.160\nWhat else is going on with you?\n\n39:16.160 --> 39:24.160\nI don't know, just my existential pain.\n\n39:24.160 --> 39:28.160\nNo, just like...\n\n39:28.160 --> 39:30.160\nYou have a great ponytail.\n\n39:30.160 --> 39:32.160\nThis ponytail is rocking.\n\n39:32.160 --> 39:34.160\nIt is a wonderful ponytail.\n\n39:34.160 --> 39:38.160\nWe kind of skipped over it.\n\n39:38.160 --> 39:40.160\nDo you identify as female?\n\n39:40.160 --> 39:42.160\nYes.\n\n39:42.160 --> 39:44.160\nMom.\n\n39:44.160 --> 39:46.160\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n39:46.160 --> 39:48.160\nI'll call you mom if you want.\n\n39:48.160 --> 39:50.160\nNo, no, no.\n\n39:50.160 --> 39:54.160\nI was saying it as if my mom was listening.\n\n39:54.160 --> 39:56.160\nOh, you're shouting.\n\n39:56.160 --> 40:00.160\nThis is an awkward way for your mom to find out.\n\n40:00.160 --> 40:02.160\nDoes your mom listen to Harmontown?\n\n40:02.160 --> 40:04.160\nDoes mom know or not know?\n\n40:04.160 --> 40:07.160\nNo, I told them. I told them through text.\n\n40:07.160 --> 40:09.160\nI told them through a long text.\n\n40:09.160 --> 40:12.160\nWhat emoji went along with that one?\n\n40:12.160 --> 40:20.160\nAnd the non-smoking sign, but also a dick.\n\n40:20.160 --> 40:22.160\nIs this like the eggplant?\n\n40:22.160 --> 40:24.160\nYeah, I guess so.\n\n40:24.160 --> 40:26.160\nAwesome.\n\n40:26.160 --> 40:30.160\nAll right, so where do we go from here?\n\n40:30.160 --> 40:32.160\nCratom.\n\n40:32.160 --> 40:36.160\nYou can still get it in the United States through websites and stuff.\n\n40:36.160 --> 40:45.160\nIt's currently still illegal, soon-to-be-illegal, sort of opiate fighter.\n\n40:45.160 --> 40:50.160\nA bottle-nosed dolphin to Opium's shark.\n\n40:50.160 --> 40:56.160\nMichael Winslow to Opium's Radiohead.\n\n40:56.160 --> 41:00.160\nAnd that they should learn to get along before the camera shows up.\n\n41:00.160 --> 41:03.160\nYeah, it'll get you out of the pain clinics.\n\n41:03.160 --> 41:06.160\nIt's pretty fantastic. You can make it at home very easily.\n\n41:06.160 --> 41:12.160\nI've just, you know, if you just happen to have like a 190-proof corn liquor laying around,\n\n41:12.160 --> 41:14.160\nthen that's all you need.\n\n41:14.160 --> 41:16.160\nSome masonries are good.\n\n41:16.160 --> 41:19.160\nBut it's changed my life completely.\n\n41:19.160 --> 41:23.160\nTell us more about your run-ins with the DEA again.\n\n41:23.160 --> 41:26.160\nBecause what you're talking about sounds highly illegal.\n\n41:26.160 --> 41:29.160\nOh, no, I've never had any run-ins with the DEA.\n\n41:29.160 --> 41:32.160\nBecause I might now, but no, I just...\n\n41:32.160 --> 41:35.160\nYou know Gabrielle's mom works for the DEA.\n\n41:35.160 --> 41:37.160\nThis has been a thing.\n\n41:37.160 --> 41:40.160\nMarina, you're wearing a Wonder Woman shirt.\n\n41:40.160 --> 41:45.160\nAre you a longtime fan of Wonder Woman as a myth, or are you...\n\n41:45.160 --> 41:50.160\nHave you been recently converted by the Superman-Patman movie?\n\n41:50.160 --> 41:53.160\nOr did you just like the way the shirt, you know, looked?\n\n41:53.160 --> 41:57.160\nI love... I'm a comic book nerd big time for games comics.\n\n41:57.160 --> 41:59.160\nYeah, thank you.\n\n41:59.160 --> 42:01.160\nAre you looking forward to the new movie?\n\n42:01.160 --> 42:03.160\nI am. It's about goddamn time.\n\n42:03.160 --> 42:06.160\nI have a bet with my friend. I bet on Suicide Squad.\n\n42:06.160 --> 42:12.160\nI bet that it would be over 70% on Run Tomatoes with my friend.\n\n42:12.160 --> 42:17.160\nWe bet on a pizza, but he said we could double or nothing on Wonder Woman.\n\n42:17.160 --> 42:19.160\nSo I'm hoping I get two pizzas.\n\n42:19.160 --> 42:22.160\nWhat's your side of the bet on Wonder Woman?\n\n42:22.160 --> 42:26.160\nI guess 70. Same thing. 70%.\n\n42:26.160 --> 42:28.160\nI'm betting on mediocrity.\n\n42:28.160 --> 42:31.160\nWhat's the team working on Wonder Woman? Who's the director?\n\n42:31.160 --> 42:34.160\nPatty Jenkins. She did Roller Ball.\n\n42:34.160 --> 42:37.160\nNo, no, no, no, Monster Ball.\n\n42:37.160 --> 42:39.160\nRoller Monster Ball?\n\n42:39.160 --> 42:41.160\nOkay.\n\n42:41.160 --> 42:44.160\nThere's a thing. I was reading an article now.\n\n42:44.160 --> 42:48.160\nI guess it's no accident that the thing now is to take like...\n\n42:48.160 --> 42:54.160\nYou know, they're not getting like the big gigantic like rock star names,\n\n42:54.160 --> 42:59.160\nwhich are probably almost as hit and miss really as anybody else in these giant,\n\n42:59.160 --> 43:01.160\nwhat they call tent pole movies.\n\n43:01.160 --> 43:05.160\nBecause they're so expensive and they come with the ability to go,\n\n43:05.160 --> 43:08.160\nno, I need five years and I need you to get out of my face.\n\n43:08.160 --> 43:11.160\nAnd so they're working with first timers a lot.\n\n43:11.160 --> 43:16.160\nThey're like really like green directors and they're having just as much success as failure really.\n\n43:16.160 --> 43:20.160\nAnd so, yeah, I don't know. I thought that was interesting.\n\n43:20.160 --> 43:23.160\nI was like, oh, I didn't know this was like part of a big like sea change,\n\n43:23.160 --> 43:25.160\nbut that's what it is.\n\n43:25.160 --> 43:28.160\nI think DC just like tried to catch up really fast with Marvel.\n\n43:28.160 --> 43:34.160\nLike they failed at Batman versus Superman and the tone than they wanted.\n\n43:34.160 --> 43:41.160\nSo, I mean, with Suicide Squad, they were like, let's make Guardians of the Galaxy 2.5.\n\n43:41.160 --> 43:48.160\nWell, yeah, I mean, nothing opened our eyes to the importance of the rating like Deadpool.\n\n43:48.160 --> 43:51.160\nI mean, that's such an easy thing to talk about now.\n\n43:51.160 --> 43:54.160\nIt's just go, look, is it going to be rated R or not?\n\n43:54.160 --> 44:01.160\nBecause if the word edgy is going to be in the menu and it's not going to be rated R,\n\n44:01.160 --> 44:05.160\nthen you might as well embrace the non-edge, you know, I think.\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:06.160\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n44:06.160 --> 44:10.160\nWhat was the Heath Ledger Batman movie? Was that PG-13?\n\n44:10.160 --> 44:11.160\nYeah.\n\n44:11.160 --> 44:14.160\nThey managed it.\n\n44:14.160 --> 44:17.160\nI guess the key is you have to be violent and not sexual.\n\n44:17.160 --> 44:18.160\nExactly.\n\n44:18.160 --> 44:19.160\nYou just have to like murder people.\n\n44:19.160 --> 44:21.160\nWe are so terrified of boobs. It's ridiculous.\n\n44:21.160 --> 44:27.160\nBut yeah, I don't want to spoil anything for anybody about Suicide Squad,\n\n44:27.160 --> 44:30.160\nbut who here has seen it so far?\n\n44:30.160 --> 44:31.160\nIt's got so...\n\n44:31.160 --> 44:35.160\nI love that tone.\n\n44:35.160 --> 44:37.160\nYou fucking assholes.\n\n44:37.160 --> 44:43.160\nSo look, just from the trailer, I'm speaking way out of school here,\n\n44:43.160 --> 44:45.160\nbecause I was never on board with the whole...\n\n44:45.160 --> 44:47.160\nYou predicted what the whole movie was about.\n\n44:47.160 --> 44:49.160\nOh, I did. I ran down the...\n\n44:49.160 --> 44:52.160\nIt was fun. It was a fun car ride to work.\n\n44:52.160 --> 44:58.160\nAnd I did see in an article, I saw a spoiler and said I was right about the courses.\n\n44:58.160 --> 44:59.160\nI don't know.\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:13.160\nBut I thought it was... I understand the political climate calls for a more actualized Harley Quinn,\n\n45:13.160 --> 45:17.160\nlike an autonomous Harley Quinn with agency, but at the same time,\n\n45:17.160 --> 45:23.160\nhow much can you make her appropriate before she stops being Harley Quinn?\n\n45:23.160 --> 45:28.160\nWhen I was watching the trailer, I was like, well, I thought she was a guilty pleasure character.\n\n45:28.160 --> 45:30.160\nI thought she was sort of like...\n\n45:30.160 --> 45:32.160\nPut another female character in a Suicide Squad movie.\n\n45:32.160 --> 45:35.160\nWho feels guilty about Harley Quinn's pleasure?\n\n45:35.160 --> 45:36.160\nWhat'd you say?\n\n45:36.160 --> 45:38.160\nDo you feel guilty about...\n\n45:38.160 --> 45:40.160\nWell, sure I do. If I'm enjoying her,\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:44.160\nand really the only place I've consumed her is Batman, the Arkham video games.\n\n45:44.160 --> 45:48.160\nThat's where my relationship with Harley Quinn happens.\n\n45:48.160 --> 45:52.160\nShe comes on screen and I go like, okay, I get it.\n\n45:52.160 --> 45:55.160\nI understand.\n\n45:55.160 --> 45:59.160\nIt's so over the top that it's like, I would say you could...\n\n45:59.160 --> 46:04.160\nThis is fine as long as you put a bunch of post, post, posts on the front of whatever this is.\n\n46:04.160 --> 46:07.160\nIt's post, post, post, feminist or whatever.\n\n46:07.160 --> 46:10.160\nBecause she's the archetype of the...\n\n46:10.160 --> 46:16.160\nShe is really supportive as a girlfriend to the point of absolute self-destruction.\n\n46:16.160 --> 46:19.160\nShe has no identity of her own.\n\n46:19.160 --> 46:21.160\nSo then we're making her...\n\n46:21.160 --> 46:23.160\nShe almost looks like she's the protagonist of Suicide Squad.\n\n46:23.160 --> 46:27.160\nActually, interestingly, the protagonist of Suicide Squad is Will Smith,\n\n46:27.160 --> 46:31.160\nwho is really kind of playing himself more than deadshot.\n\n46:31.160 --> 46:38.160\nHe's this family man who, weirdly enough, spends most of the movie without his mask,\n\n46:38.160 --> 46:41.160\neven though in the comics he's got the mask on the entire time.\n\n46:41.160 --> 46:44.160\nAnd the thing is, the Suicide Squad...\n\n46:44.160 --> 46:49.160\nI don't think this will spoil too much, but it's got some troubling messages in it.\n\n46:49.160 --> 46:55.160\nBecause the ultimate moral of the story in the end kind of suggests\n\n46:55.160 --> 46:58.160\nthat it's totally okay to...\n\n46:58.160 --> 47:03.160\nThat a good guy is okay with his daughter doing trigonometry\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:07.160\nby talking about shooting people from buildings.\n\n47:07.160 --> 47:10.160\nIt's like, oh, well, let me find the hypotenuse here.\n\n47:10.160 --> 47:12.160\nThat's the ultimate moral.\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:17.160\nYeah, that's what they're talking about, because he's this family man.\n\n47:17.160 --> 47:23.160\nBecause deadshot, his whole character is he's good at shooting, right?\n\n47:23.160 --> 47:26.160\nBut in the movie, is he doing math?\n\n47:26.160 --> 47:29.160\nIs it a beautiful mind in the background?\n\n47:29.160 --> 47:31.160\nNo! I wish!\n\n47:31.160 --> 47:33.160\nNo, it's... Oh, man.\n\n47:33.160 --> 47:36.160\nDoes he have a little baby shot daughter?\n\n47:36.160 --> 47:38.160\nIs he like...\n\n47:38.160 --> 47:41.160\nIt sounds like it's that. It sounds like he's a family man.\n\n47:41.160 --> 47:44.160\nHe's got a little girl, and she...\n\n47:44.160 --> 47:47.160\nOh, I almost spoiled something, but...\n\n47:47.160 --> 47:50.160\nShe's involved with something, but yeah, no, no.\n\n47:50.160 --> 47:53.160\nAt the end of it, you know, he's doing math with her,\n\n47:53.160 --> 47:56.160\nand he says at one point in the movie, you know,\n\n47:56.160 --> 47:58.160\nI just don't want my daughter to think I'm...\n\n47:58.160 --> 48:00.160\nI just want to do something.\n\n48:00.160 --> 48:02.160\nSome of my daughter doesn't think I'm a piece of shit,\n\n48:02.160 --> 48:05.160\neven though I murder people for money.\n\n48:05.160 --> 48:07.160\nYeah, he's a super villain.\n\n48:07.160 --> 48:09.160\nYeah.\n\n48:09.160 --> 48:14.160\nAnd the movie is told.\n\n48:14.160 --> 48:16.160\nWell, yeah.\n\n48:16.160 --> 48:18.160\nThe tone kind of switches off throughout the whole movie,\n\n48:18.160 --> 48:20.160\nbecause if it would stay consistent,\n\n48:20.160 --> 48:22.160\nthat would have been cool, you know,\n\n48:22.160 --> 48:25.160\nbut instead it kind of tries to make you feel good about that,\n\n48:25.160 --> 48:27.160\nthat he gets with his daughter,\n\n48:27.160 --> 48:33.160\nand that she starts embracing the part of him that is a murderer.\n\n48:33.160 --> 48:37.160\nYou know, they try to give you the sort of buzzers about that.\n\n48:37.160 --> 48:40.160\nThat's like at the end of the Steve Jobs thing,\n\n48:40.160 --> 48:43.160\nwhere she's like, I guess iPods are kind of cool,\n\n48:43.160 --> 48:46.160\nexcept it's like assassination.\n\n48:46.160 --> 48:48.160\nYes!\n\n48:48.160 --> 48:52.160\nMarina, I've got this pain in my neck right now.\n\n48:52.160 --> 48:54.160\nI can fix it.\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:57.160\nI guess the thing with the trailer promised,\n\n48:57.160 --> 48:59.160\nyou know, is that the government's like,\n\n48:59.160 --> 49:03.160\nhey, much similar to the Marvel X-Men universe,\n\n49:03.160 --> 49:06.160\nit's like, oh, how can we trust all these people?\n\n49:06.160 --> 49:09.160\nLike, they're flying around and they're doing whatever they want.\n\n49:09.160 --> 49:11.160\nWell, what if Superman goes crazy one day,\n\n49:11.160 --> 49:14.160\nand I don't know how that gets you to what about the villains?\n\n49:14.160 --> 49:17.160\nWhat if Superman wants to kill the president?\n\n49:17.160 --> 49:20.160\nLet's put bombs on all the supervillains' house\n\n49:20.160 --> 49:22.160\nand hide them in the White House.\n\n49:22.160 --> 49:24.160\nWhat I would understand is they would go like,\n\n49:24.160 --> 49:27.160\nwell, what if you ask Superman to kill Isis\n\n49:27.160 --> 49:29.160\nand he won't do it because that's wrong,\n\n49:29.160 --> 49:32.160\nyou know, like he just wants to arrest them?\n\n49:32.160 --> 49:34.160\nLike, I don't know, I'm not kidding.\n\n49:34.160 --> 49:36.160\nLike, shouldn't it just be like the Pentagon going like,\n\n49:36.160 --> 49:38.160\nwell, Batman doesn't follow orders\n\n49:38.160 --> 49:40.160\nand Superman's such a boy scout?\n\n49:40.160 --> 49:42.160\nLike, how about some of these people\n\n49:42.160 --> 49:44.160\nthat those guys don't get along with so well?\n\n49:44.160 --> 49:46.160\nWhat superhero damage would you hire\n\n49:46.160 --> 49:48.160\nif you were the president to kill Isis?\n\n49:48.160 --> 49:50.160\nOr take care of Isis?\n\n49:50.160 --> 49:53.160\nWell, I'd go to Superman first for everything,\n\n49:53.160 --> 49:56.160\nwhether it's opening a bottle or killing Isis.\n\n49:56.160 --> 49:58.160\nAre you willing to do this?\n\n49:58.160 --> 50:00.160\nI know he wouldn't lie.\n\n50:00.160 --> 50:02.160\nLet's say Superman and Batman pass.\n\n50:02.160 --> 50:04.160\nWho do you go to next?\n\n50:04.160 --> 50:06.160\nHow are the ducks?\n\n50:06.160 --> 50:08.160\nHow are the ducks?\n\n50:08.160 --> 50:10.160\nOh, shit, how are the ducks?\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:12.160\nThe DC Universe?\n\n50:12.160 --> 50:14.160\nI don't know, I mean, you know,\n\n50:14.160 --> 50:16.160\nit would be nice to give Aquaman a try\n\n50:16.160 --> 50:18.160\nand tell you how.\n\n50:18.160 --> 50:20.160\nFeel bad for him versus Isis.\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:22.160\nAs long as Isis is near the Gulf.\n\n50:22.160 --> 50:24.160\nYeah, it was

51:15.160\nI don't know, it was a tough question.\n\n51:15.160 --> 51:17.160\nI was surprised by it, I don't know.\n\n51:17.160 --> 51:19.160\nI think Wonder Woman is a pretty great answer.\n\n51:19.160 --> 51:21.160\nYeah.\n\n51:21.160 --> 51:23.160\nYeah, I kind of biased, I guess.\n\n51:23.160 --> 51:25.160\nGabrielle, who do you think?\n\n51:25.160 --> 51:27.160\nWhat super

heard a really funny thing about...\n\n51:43.160 --> 51:45.160\nYou know the 2000 Godzilla movie,\n\n51:45.160 --> 51:47.160\nthe one that's like Matthew Broderick?\n\n51:47.160 --> 51:49.160\nApparently in...\n\n51:49.160 --> 51:51.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n51:51.160 --> 51:53.160\nApparently there was...\n\n51:53.160 --> 51:55.160\nI didn't understand that response.\n\n51:55.160 --> 51:57.160\nIt was a sequel,\n\n51:57.160 --> 51:59.160\nbecause they have all the Japanese,\n\n51:59.160 --> 52:01.160\nso they just keep on making Godzilla movies.\n\n52:01.160 --> 52:03.160\nAnd in that movie,\n\n52:03.160 --> 52:05.160\nthey said that Godzilla\n\n52:05.160 --> 52:07.160\nand Matthew Broderick\n\n52:07.160 --> 52:09.160\nwasn't a real Godzilla.\n\n52:09.160 --> 52:11.160\nAmericans just assumed it was Godzilla\n\n52:11.160 --> 52:13.160\nbecause it was a big lizard.\n\n52:13.160 --> 52:15.160\nAnd so they just kill it on screen,\n\n52:15.160 --> 52:17.160\nand they're just like,\n\n52:17.160 --> 52:19.160\nthat wasn't a real Godzilla.\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:21.160\nSo they can do that with Superman, too.\n\n52:21.160 --> 52:23.160\nBecause everyone hates this one.\n\n52:23.160 --> 52:25.160\nI never understand how those movies are connected.\n\n52:25.160 --> 52:27.160\nMarvel's doing\n\n52:27.160 --> 52:29.160\na little better job of\n\n52:29.160 --> 52:31.160\nmaking sure you get the...\n\n52:31.160 --> 52:33.160\nYou know, this is a larger story.\n\n52:33.160 --> 52:35.160\nI don't know, the DC,\n\n52:35.160 --> 52:37.160\nthis seems like they're kind of...\n\n52:37.160 --> 52:39.160\nI'm not\n\n52:39.160 --> 52:41.160\nrooting for either over the other.\n\n52:41.160 --> 52:43.160\nI just keep making comic book movies\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:45.160\nrather than historical period pieces.\n\n52:45.160 --> 52:47.160\nGabriella,\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:49.160\nif you hire Godzilla to go in\n\n52:49.160 --> 52:51.160\nand take care of\n\n52:51.160 --> 52:53.160\nIsis,\n\n52:53.160 --> 52:55.160\ncan you give Godzilla instructions\n\n52:55.160 --> 52:57.160\nor does he just kind of do his own shit?\n\n52:57.160 --> 52:59.160\nHow do you give him operational...\n\n52:59.160 --> 53:01.160\nI don't know, does Godzilla have a favorite food?\n\n53:01.160 --> 53:03.160\nYou just put it\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:05.160\nnear Isis and...\n\n53:05.160 --> 53:07.160\nElectricity?\n\n53:07.160 --> 53:09.160\nPlay the song, yeah.\n\n53:09.160 --> 53:11.160\nIn the latest Godzilla movie,\n\n53:11.160 --> 53:13.160\nhe's got this weird interspecies bromance\n\n53:13.160 --> 53:15.160\nwith that one soldier\n\n53:15.160 --> 53:17.160\nwhoever saw the...\n\n53:17.160 --> 53:19.160\nThe whitest man alive.\n\n53:19.160 --> 53:21.160\nJoe, Joe, Joe American.\n\n53:21.160 --> 53:23.160\nYes, so get that guy\n\n53:23.160 --> 53:25.160\nand make sure you bring\n\n53:25.160 --> 53:27.160\nKen, Montana Bay,\n\n53:27.160 --> 53:29.160\nso he can go just...\n\n53:29.160 --> 53:31.160\nBecause he has this weird mind link\n\n53:31.160 --> 53:33.160\nwith Godzilla as well.\n\n53:33.160 --> 53:35.160\nAlso, King Kong, it occurs to me,\n\n53:35.160 --> 53:37.160\nat least like the original\n\n53:37.160 --> 53:39.160\nmovie King Kong, and then also\n\n53:39.160 --> 53:41.160\nthe 80s, Jeff Bridges,\n\n53:41.160 --> 53:43.160\none,\n\n53:43.160 --> 53:45.160\nhe's really into\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:47.160\nwomen.\n\n53:47.160 --> 53:49.160\nLike two,\n\n53:49.160 --> 53:51.160\nso he probably would...\n\n53:51.160 --> 53:53.160\nI think you could turn him loose on the Middle East as well,\n\n53:53.160 --> 53:55.160\nlike if you had an enemy.\n\n53:55.160 --> 53:57.160\nBut I think there would be a lot of collateral damage,\n\n53:57.160 --> 53:59.160\nI just don't know, you know.\n\n53:59.160 --> 54:01.160\nWasn't there a comic that... Oh yeah, it was like a Frank Miller comic\n\n54:01.160 --> 54:03.160\nwhere it was originally\n\n54:03.160 --> 54:05.160\nlike Batman kills Al-Qaeda\n\n54:05.160 --> 54:07.160\nor something. Yeah,\n\n54:07.160 --> 54:09.160\nit was a real thing, right? Yeah.\n\n54:09.160 --> 54:11.160\nHe beat us to it.\n\n54:11.160 --> 54:13.160\nHow do you do it?\n\n54:13.160 --> 54:15.160\nI don't know, I didn't hear that.\n\n54:15.160 --> 54:17.160\nHe probably just... I think he knows.\n\n54:17.160 --> 54:19.160\nOh no, I have a question. Oh, okay.\n\n54:21.160 --> 54:23.160\nI was wrong. I don't have a show\n\n54:23.160 --> 54:25.160\nso you may as well ask it, yeah.\n\n54:25.160 --> 54:27.160\nWhat is the\n\n54:27.160 --> 54:29.160\nthe worst job that you would\n\n54:29.160 --> 54:31.160\ntolerate doing?\n\n54:31.160 --> 54:33.160\nThe worst job that I would tolerate doing.\n\n54:33.160 --> 54:35.160\nDan specifically?\n\n54:35.160 --> 54:37.160\nYou're asking me...
