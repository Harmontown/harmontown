00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
From Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, it's great to be back.

00:03.720 --> 00:07.760
You guys missed a doozy up at the outside lands of San Francisco.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.560
Harmontown, once again, is now in session.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.640
Upe. Upe.

00:13.640 --> 00:18.800
Dave Kline, go to the mic and give us a good Upe to start us off.

00:18.800 --> 00:19.720
Just give me one good Upe.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.120
One Upe.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.360
Upe.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.560
All right, sit down.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.160
Spencer Crittenden and everybody, Spencer.

00:29.160 --> 00:42.160
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, fresh from the ladies room, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.160
Thank you.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.160
Thank you very much.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
Hello, all right.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.160
I thought the punchline was going to be, it doesn't ring a bell.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.160
His face doesn't ring a bell.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.160
I didn't hear it.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.160
I couldn't hear it.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.160
I know there was a guy.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
Was it a dead ringer?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
Was that it?

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
Yeah.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
It was a dead ringer for the last one.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
Classic.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
Classic joke.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
You didn't have to fill in for me.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.160
I was ready to, I was just, I was told to stress.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
I panicked.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.160
I really, I really tossed that out early.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.160
All right.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.160
Well, let's see.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.160
Uh-oh.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.160
So we saw, we saw a radiohead at outside lands.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.160
We did.

01:23.160 --> 01:29.160
And I realized the name of their band is, it's kind of actually, even though they're,

01:29.160 --> 01:39.160
they're not, uh, uh, uh, at all, uh, the genre, uh, that they're, the name of their band actually

01:39.160 --> 01:44.160
sounds like the name of a song from like an 80s, like heavy metal band.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.160
Like, like, and I kept, I kept, I was like, I was getting really high and I was singing.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.160
I have this song I made up in my head.

01:51.160 --> 01:56.160
It's like, like, it goes a little something like this.

01:56.160 --> 02:00.160
I didn't want to present it as like, oh, it's a real song, but I, I guess I did.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.160
And I, but I just, but I just started doing it a lot.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.160
It was, uh, can we hear it?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
Can we hear a little bit?

02:06.160 --> 02:09.160
Let me just, let me just try a little acapella here.

02:09.160 --> 02:13.160
Turn your station to misery.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.160
Ow, watch your dial.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.160
I don't know.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.160
It's a place holding lyrics.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.160
Put your favorite frequency.

02:21.160 --> 02:31.160
I've got a radio head, a radio head, radio soul, radio rock, radio roll.

02:31.160 --> 02:40.160
I've got a radio head.

02:40.160 --> 02:54.160
A thousand watts of devil power, and a beaming in your soul, and tenders in your Satan dick.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.160
To transmit in rocket rule, I've got a radio head.

02:59.160 --> 03:08.160
Can we get the person that made the, uh, the Rob Schrab, uh, it gets worse song to put, to put that to a beat

03:08.160 --> 03:10.160
and get, give me some heavy guitar on that one.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.160
It was, it was better when I was high and then I get up here and I'm, it was fucking great.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
All right, thanks.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
It was great.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.160
You were high in San Francisco on stage yesterday and you were beyond delightful.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.160
You, you, you hit a beautiful sweet spot.

03:21.160 --> 03:28.160
Then we got into a limo getting back from the airport today and Dan started just yelling at his laptop.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.160
And we didn't know what was going on, but you lost a jet pack in Minecraft.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.160
Yeah.

03:33.160 --> 03:42.160
I went, I went to the nether with, with my jet pack because I wanted to get a broken spawner so that I could make a

03:42.160 --> 03:49.160
powered spawner with Enderman in it so I could harvest Ender pearls and like, you know, like, like ratchet up my game a little bit.

03:49.160 --> 03:59.160
And I, I started burrowing through a wall of nether rack and it was just blithely, cockily, like just shim, shimmy in along.

03:59.160 --> 04:04.160
And then I, I got, I got buried in lava and I lost my jet pack.

04:04.160 --> 04:10.160
And then I went, and then I went back to my base and I tried to make another jet pack.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.160
I need appliances to do that.

04:12.160 --> 04:22.160
And like, I forgot that I, I was using a tier one industrial craft metal former with, it hooked up to a CESU, which is a tier two power source.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.160
And it, the metal former blew up.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.160
Dan, don't talk down to us.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.160
So the CESU was a tier two power transformer then.

04:33.160 --> 04:37.160
Yeah, I had to forgot to put a transformer upgrade into the metal former.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.160
How many metal formers exploded before you figured that out?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.160
About three or four.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.160
Jesus. And that is a lot of iron if I'm not mistaken.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.160
That's okay because I have that iron exploit.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.160
All right, of course.

04:51.160 --> 04:56.160
That's been our show. Thanks for coming everybody.

04:56.160 --> 05:01.160
All right. Well, okay. So, so if that doesn't amaze you, this will.

05:01.160 --> 05:06.160
Well, don't, don't assume we weren't amazed by that.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.160
I kind of, I cried. I did something wrong.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.160
Like while I was like grabbing my laptop on the plane and I cracked my thumbnail a little bit.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.160
Like it's just a little like, like chippy thing where it was like wherever you put your hand, it's going to get snagged, you know, and that kind of thing.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.160
Nothing that big a deal, but it had to be taken care of.

05:20.160 --> 05:25.160
So while we were waiting for, for you because we had that whole double shuttle thing happening and we were waiting by the door.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.160
It's like, well, I have fingernail clippers.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.160
It might be a little gross, but it's LAX who cares.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.160
Like I'll, I'll go over to the way, the garbage can.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.160
I'll be very discreet and I'll just like clip a little bit.

05:34.160 --> 05:38.160
Some people are very, you know, I'm aware that, you know, there's different people have different triggers.

05:38.160 --> 05:45.160
You know, it's like, like, like, like for some people, the sight or sound of somebody clipping their fingernails is fucking like awful, disgusting for them.

05:45.160 --> 05:49.160
Like, like other people's teeth scraping on a fork, you don't know.

05:49.160 --> 05:56.160
So I try, I went, I went, I went over to a garbage can away from everybody else and I, I just very discreetly was like, it's just going to be one thumbnail.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.160
And I, and I clipped and it went shooting like a rocket.

05:59.160 --> 06:04.160
Just missed someone's head like that was sitting and I just like ignored it.

06:04.160 --> 06:09.160
I'm amazed.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.160
What if I had pelted somebody with a fingernail?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.160
That would be a bummer.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.160
That would be insane.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.160
Like, what do you, how do you even get out of that?

06:16.160 --> 06:17.160
How do you even, what do you even say?

06:17.160 --> 06:20.160
Did you enjoy your radio head experience yesterday?

06:20.160 --> 06:21.160
Yeah, it was good.

06:21.160 --> 06:26.160
I was, I just ate a lot of funnel cake and like peanut butter and chocolate and got a real bad heartburn.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
But outside lands was fun.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
We were walking around it.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.160
I mean, I didn't like watch Radiohead or anything.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
You can hear him playing in any way.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.160
And I, it's like, it's not, it's not, it's like they're going to be better live.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.160
It's Radiohead.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.160
Not, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're not acoustic head.

06:39.160 --> 06:44.160
They're not, they're not, they're not, they're not the pixies.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.160
They fucking, they have radios for heads.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
They're like, they're there.

06:47.160 --> 06:52.160
As I understand it, they radio rock and radio roll.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.160
The devil wants your station.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.160
Broadcasting all night long.

06:59.160 --> 07:03.160
My black heart's got a woofer tweeter.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.160
Broadcast my song on a radio head.

07:07.160 --> 07:13.160
Was this song sung by Starscream from the Decepticons?

07:13.160 --> 07:20.160
On the way out to San Francisco, you know, you go up to the kiosk right before the X-ray

07:20.160 --> 07:21.160
machines.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.160
And everybody's using the QR code things now.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.160
And I go, boop, and it doesn't work.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.160
Everybody else goes through.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.160
The guy's like, it's real cranky.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.160
And he goes, he goes, it's not working.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.160
It's not reading your thing.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.160
And I'm like, well, boop, you know, it's not, it's not working.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.160
And then the guy's like, well, do you have a paper ticket?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.160
And I said, no.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.160
And he's like, well, that's weird.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.160
What?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.160
Yeah, that's so weird.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.160
So weird to not.

07:47.160 --> 07:53.160
Because when we made the decision to maybe cut down a few less trees by using fucking

07:53.160 --> 08:00.160
coal electric plants to get on the plane instead, it would be weird to not do both.

08:00.160 --> 08:05.160
It would be weird to not cut down a tree, turn that into a ticket, and then also have

08:05.160 --> 08:08.160
a power plant chug into your phone, and then also use that.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.160
Yeah, real weird.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
Fucking dick.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.160
Why don't you just, how about you stick to what's ISIS and what's not ISIS?

08:15.160 --> 08:20.160
And I'll tell you what's weird, you fucking fake cop.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.160
Fucking weird, weird, weird fake cop with a baggy ass uniform.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.160
They're always all baggy and dirty.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.160
They look like they're wearing cop pajamas.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.160
Fucking misshapen, fucking cop rejects, fucking critches.

08:34.160 --> 08:39.160
Every single one of them just either at the bottom of their life or walking a razor thin

08:39.160 --> 08:42.160
line between fucking like.

08:42.160 --> 08:47.160
You're never going on TSA Pre again, my friends.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.160
Oh yeah, TSA Pre, sure.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.160
Let's get that vampire in our kitchen, sure.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.160
Does anybody have TSA Pre?

08:56.160 --> 08:58.160
Does anybody subject themselves to that?

08:58.160 --> 09:01.160
I always wonder about that.

09:01.160 --> 09:05.160
You said it's supposed to be great, is that what you said?

09:05.160 --> 09:08.160
Yeah, I know it looks great and they make it look great because they have a whole lane

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
that they're not using.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.160
What's that?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.160
It's not convenient.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.160
Ask for a wheelchair?

09:16.160 --> 09:19.160
You could smuggle drugs if you got a wheelchair.

09:19.160 --> 09:24.160
Just get an international travel number and then you don't have to figure out your laptop,

09:24.160 --> 09:26.160
your internet, your pre-check, your everything.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.160
I find the best way to get through security fast is be Seth Rogen.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.160
Yeah.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.160
I think I told on the show before where I broke my toe and I had a cane and I got right through everything.

09:37.160 --> 09:42.160
I just had a cane, I just had a broken pinky toe and I got right up in front.

09:42.160 --> 09:50.160
I was behind her like a Iraq veteran, like who had been blown up below the knee on both legs.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.160
I was like, I just have a little boo-boo.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.160
And yet they walk you right through.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.160
You?

09:59.160 --> 10:03.160
So you guys know what hyper plexia is?

10:03.160 --> 10:06.160
Oh yeah.

10:06.160 --> 10:10.160
My girlfriend had a friend at the show.

10:10.160 --> 10:18.160
One of her gigs is teaching autistic kids and she's talking about hyper plexia,

10:18.160 --> 10:21.160
which is like the opposite of dyslexia, I guess.

10:21.160 --> 10:27.160
It's where you can read really fast, especially like it's little kids in childhood that read really fast,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
but you have low comprehension.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.160
You don't actually know what you're reading.

10:31.160 --> 10:38.160
I was like, oh yeah, I can read really well, but I have to read like, if I didn't know you weren't supposed to move your lips when you read,

10:38.160 --> 10:42.160
I would absolutely move my lips because that's only how fast I can understand anything,

10:42.160 --> 10:47.160
like here in my head, but I could read like a page and just not have any retention.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.160
I wonder if I'm hyper plexic.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
Wouldn't that be cool?

10:50.160 --> 10:52.160
That would be amazing.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.160
Wouldn't that be cool, Jeff?

10:54.160 --> 10:56.160
If I was hyper plexic?

10:56.160 --> 10:58.160
So cool.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.160
You'd be like the fawns of reading.

11:04.160 --> 11:09.160
Yeah, because he loved rock and roll, but he'd hit the jukebox and it would just play or stop playing.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.160
I was like, he's too good.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.160
He called the toilet his office.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.160
He doesn't fucking know.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.160
What a cool guy.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.160
What a cool guy.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.160
Called the toilet his office.

11:17.160 --> 11:22.160
He was 55 and like hung out with teenagers who were 38.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.160
He was a 55 year old Jewish guy who hung out with teenagers.

11:26.160 --> 11:33.160
He was four foot three, just lived in your attic and told everyone to sit on it all the time.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.160
Sit on what?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.160
It.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
Sit on his dick?

11:37.160 --> 11:39.160
Do you think that's what sit on it meant?

11:39.160 --> 11:42.160
Sit on my dick?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.160
It's rape culture, man.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.160
It's fucked up.

11:46.160 --> 11:53.160
The 50s were fucked up in the 70s.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.160
Gary Marshall just passed away. Why are we laughing?

11:56.160 --> 11:58.160
Stop it.

11:58.160 --> 12:02.160
Way to go, you fucking ghouls.

12:02.160 --> 12:06.160
I'm sure 75% of people have never seen an episode of Happy Days in their life.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.160
Yeah, but everybody knows about it and that goes to Gary Marshall's efficacy.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.160
He did more community in Laverne and Shirley.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.160
When do you think Happy Days jumped the shark?

12:15.160 --> 12:26.160
I'll say it was two seasons before the shark episode.

12:26.160 --> 12:32.160
That's when they brought Mark on when Mark was there.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.160
I met the guy that coined that phrase.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.160
He's on Stern, right?

12:36.160 --> 12:39.160
One of the Stern network shows or something?

12:39.160 --> 12:40.160
Yeah, that's what he says.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.160
Okay, grandpa.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.160
Seriously, that's it. That's all I got.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
That's all the show we have?

12:47.160 --> 12:52.160
Well, we gave him a lot in San Francisco and then we turned out we weren't recording.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.160
That's what happened.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.160
I did a whole thing where I did a Michael Winslow meets Radiohead thing.

12:59.160 --> 13:03.160
I mean, do it again. I tried to do so much again already.

13:03.160 --> 13:12.160
You did a concert full of can-openers.

13:12.160 --> 13:16.160
Electric can-openers went to a concert where Radiohead was playing.

13:16.160 --> 13:20.160
Well, I'm going to tweak it. I'm going to change it now that we get to do it again.

13:20.160 --> 13:26.160
There was a helicopter and Michael Winslow was flying the helicopter while having a leaf blower going.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.160
So I'm going to tweak it so you don't have to recap it.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.160
Morgan Freeman showed up at some point.

13:31.160 --> 13:38.160
What I'm going to do is I'm going to say Michael Winslow is getting into a helicopter made of can-openers.

13:38.160 --> 13:43.160
So he has to start each electric can opener to make the helicopter get going.

13:43.160 --> 13:47.160
And then he's going to use a leaf blower to attack Radiohead.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.160
Why? Jesus.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
Does somebody actually say why?

13:52.160 --> 13:56.160
Yeah, I mean, he just blurted it out. It's like, why?

13:56.160 --> 14:00.160
I almost forgive him. He didn't even think about it.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.160
I have to forgive it because that's immersion.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.160
He's immersed.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.160
How high are the stakes?

14:04.160 --> 14:06.160
Yeah, he's like, why? Why? Why?

14:06.160 --> 14:12.160
Oh, I actually know the answer, sir, because Morgan Freeman shows up. That's why he's doing it.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.160
No, you're just confusing people.

14:14.160 --> 14:18.160
We don't have to recreate the dumb...

14:18.160 --> 14:20.160
Okay, walk us through what you're going to do now.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.160
Okay, so Michael Winslow is...

14:23.160 --> 14:27.160
Either take your shirt off or don't take your shirt off.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.160
I have to take off my shirt.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.160
Fuck it.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.160
Dan Forgotty was taking his shirt off halfway through.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.160
I was just going to leave it there.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.160
I had more to say if I was saying I can't talk.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.160
Have a weird halter top on for the rest of the show.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.160
Yeah, I...

14:50.160 --> 14:53.160
I'm just starting to wash in everybody's car.

14:53.160 --> 14:57.160
Just bringing hot wings to your seats.

14:57.160 --> 15:03.160
Michael Winslow is getting in his helicopter made of electric hand openers.

15:03.160 --> 15:13.160
And to answer your question, sir, the answer is because Radiohead and Michael Winslow both operate in the field of phonics sound.

15:13.160 --> 15:22.160
And Radiohead, Michael Winslow mistakenly feels is abusing sound because they're using electronics and things.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
He's more analog.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.160
He's more analog and it feels that sound that he's...

15:27.160 --> 15:30.160
Both of them are locked in a flawed dichotomy.

15:30.160 --> 15:41.160
What happens is they learn to overcome their differences because there's a third truly evil force that they have to unite, but no spoilers.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.160
Okay, but this is like...

15:43.160 --> 15:49.160
Do we find Michael Winslow going to his helicopter pad at Michael Winslow Manor?

15:49.160 --> 15:55.160
That's just... he makes that sound while he's like...

15:55.160 --> 15:57.160
And then he goes up...

16:02.160 --> 16:06.160
I want to get on my helicopter made of hand openers.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.160
Wait, hold on.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.160
Shit.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.160
Dan, we don't have to do this.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.160
If you're not ready, this is called refusal of a call, isn't it?

16:23.160 --> 16:41.160
The refusal of a call.

16:53.160 --> 17:04.160
Everything

17:04.160 --> 17:10.160
Everything

17:10.160 --> 17:13.160
Is it as right, what the fuck?

17:13.160 --> 17:15.160
Brrrr

17:15.160 --> 17:19.160
So to leave, blur

17:19.160 --> 17:22.160
In the wrong place

17:22.160 --> 17:24.160
Everything!

17:24.160 --> 17:26.160
Everything!

17:26.160 --> 17:28.160
Everything!

17:38.160 --> 17:41.160
Everything is in its right place.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.160
Let's get back to things.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.160
Hey, whatever the lead singer of Radiohead's name is.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.160
It's me, your right-hand man.

17:49.160 --> 17:52.160
Whatever my name is, the bass player.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.160
If we have a bass...

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
What is it, Tyler?

18:03.160 --> 18:08.160
Should we go check to make sure Michael Winslow is truly taken out?

18:09.160 --> 18:11.160
You saw the explosion.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.160
That one wasn't a mouth noise one.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.160
Shubris!

18:18.160 --> 18:21.160
Everything!

18:21.160 --> 18:25.160
In its right place.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.160
In its right place.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.160
Oh, shit.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.160
Leg wound.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.160
Twig.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.160
Stab.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.160
Stab.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.160
Second twig.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.160
Stab.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.160
Pocket microphone.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.160
Tiny jam box speaker.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.160
Ad hoc, strange, phonic-based, first aid technique.

19:07.160 --> 19:12.160
In which the two twigs pick up like a dowsing rod.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.160
The sound of my healing, but it's not going to feel good.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.160
There, stop the bleeding.

19:29.160 --> 19:32.160
Everything!

19:32.160 --> 19:34.160
In its right place.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.160
Thank you everybody, we're Radiohead.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.160
Alright, goodnight.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.160
Man, Tyler, that was great.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.160
Let's go back to the dressing room.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.160
Yeah, come on.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.160
Man, we fucking Radioheaded those motherfuckers.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.160
Oh, shit.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.160
Michael Winslow.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.160
Take it easy, man.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.160
Just take it easy.

20:01.160 --> 20:06.160
No.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.160
I think there's been a big misunderstanding.

20:10.160 --> 20:17.160
And if we all just remember that we both enjoy the nuances of sound.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.160
Two knives.

20:19.160 --> 20:26.160
Two knives.

20:26.160 --> 20:30.160
Shit, he made the sound of them bouncing off his head, so they did.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.160
Just beat him up silently.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.160
I said silently, Steve.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
Sorry.

20:41.160 --> 20:46.160
What the fuck?

20:50.160 --> 20:53.160
Everybody, go outside, under the deck.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.160
Look, it's a giant thing.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
I'm so exhausted, I'm not going to make anything up.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.160
It's a giant thing.

21:02.160 --> 21:13.160
Work together.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.160
Yeah.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.160
See you next summer.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.160
Wait.

21:20.160 --> 21:24.160
The third act didn't.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.160
It kind of rushed towards the end there.

21:27.160 --> 21:36.160
So Radiohead and Michael Winslow learned to work together to defeat the giant thing by making fart sound.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.160
Yeah, they farted on it.

21:38.160 --> 21:41.160
I like that. I didn't know that Radiohead was run by Stephen Tyler.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.160
Yeah.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.160
There was Steve Ann's Tyler.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.160
Yep, yep, yep.

21:48.160 --> 21:57.160
There are two keyboards in here. There's a song I want to play.

21:57.160 --> 22:02.160
There's a song I want to play.

22:02.160 --> 22:11.160
Everything in its right place.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.160
Radiohead.

22:13.160 --> 22:19.160
I like, no, please.

22:19.160 --> 22:24.160
But what would it be like if Radiohead worked at your local produce section?

22:24.160 --> 22:27.160
I think it would go a little something.

22:27.160 --> 22:32.160
Yesterday I found someone sucking this lemon.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.160
Okay.

22:35.160 --> 22:40.160
I just remembered there's some produce in their lyrics and I got excited.

22:40.160 --> 22:44.160
Okay, all right, all right. There's still no show. There's no show.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.160
That was a brief distraction.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.160
I thought we had guests tonight. We don't have guests.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.160
No, we were going to have some guests and then they canceled.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.160
What?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.160
What?

22:53.160 --> 22:54.160
Yeah.

22:54.160 --> 22:57.160
You mean Stephen Tyler couldn't make it tonight?

22:57.160 --> 22:58.160
Morgan Freeman?

22:58.160 --> 23:01.160
Morgan Freeman. He'd be great.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.160
What happened to them? I mean, should we talk about...

23:04.160 --> 23:09.160
Well, the bad news is they canceled, but the good news is it was Andy Dick.

23:09.160 --> 23:19.160
So, yeah, we dodged our own bullet out of our own gun.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.160
Yeah, it was Dino and Andy were going to...

23:21.160 --> 23:25.160
Tino and Andy have a new podcast together, which sounds like a bad idea.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.160
Probably is. And they were going to join us.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.160
Yeah.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.160
I'm sad. What was their excuse tonight?

23:31.160 --> 23:37.160
Well, the same thing that makes them fun to be around probably just makes it hard for them to schedule.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.160
I mean, they're kind of an unpredictable combo.

23:40.160 --> 23:44.160
Andy's sober now, though, isn't he? He's been on the wagon for quite a while.

23:44.160 --> 23:48.160
Yeah, he's been on the wagon many, many, many times.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.160
He's getting very good at being on the wagon, yeah.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.160
I don't know. I'm not going to...

23:54.160 --> 23:57.160
We will talk to him about that when he comes, you know?

23:57.160 --> 23:58.160
Yeah.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.160
He's a good guy.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.160
He's a great guy.

24:02.160 --> 24:08.160
He tried to get in bed with me at the Disneyland Great Californian Hotel.

24:08.160 --> 24:14.160
We were there doing an event for ABC, and he tried his hardest to get in bed with me.

24:14.160 --> 24:20.160
And, like, I was asleep, and he ordered everything on the room service menu.

24:20.160 --> 24:25.160
Everything. He ordered everything on the menu. He ordered it up there.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.160
And then just left.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.160
Did he eat the food?

24:30.160 --> 24:34.160
Well, he weighs as much as my shoe.

24:34.160 --> 24:41.160
He ordered a thousand people's worth of food, and then just ate, like, a bite of a cheeseburger,

24:41.160 --> 24:46.160
and then just fucked right off after trying to physically assault me.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.160
Like, he wanted to make love?

24:48.160 --> 24:51.160
He, yeah. Yeah.

24:54.160 --> 24:59.160
He was in my car one time, and his son was in the back.

24:59.160 --> 25:04.160
And his son, I think, was not quite 21 yet. I think he was, like, 19 or 20, and we were going to a bar.

25:04.160 --> 25:09.160
So I've got Andy and his underage son in the back of my new Lexus.

25:09.160 --> 25:14.160
And Andy pulls out of his coat a Heineken the size of a keg.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.160
I must have told the story before on the show, no?

25:16.160 --> 25:17.160
I can't remember.

25:17.160 --> 25:18.160
Have I?

25:18.160 --> 25:19.160
No.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.160
He pulls one of those giant Heineken's out, the big ones.

25:21.160 --> 25:26.160
Like, a Dave Kline fosters, you know, kind of like a big-ass beer, and opens it up,

25:26.160 --> 25:30.160
and it explodes all over every bit.

25:30.160 --> 25:40.160
My face, every, the windshield, every part of the interior of my car is covered in warm Heineken foam.

25:40.160 --> 25:47.160
And it's nighttime, we're driving down Hollywood Boulevard, and he's got the door open.

25:47.160 --> 25:54.160
Like, the door is fully open, so I'm driving down the street, and he's shouting the N-word at full volume.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.160
To everybody that we pass.

25:57.160 --> 26:02.160
Then we come to a stop around Hollywood and Vine, like maybe Argyle, somewhere around there.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.160
And guess who's about to cross the street?

26:04.160 --> 26:05.160
Black gentleman.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.160
I'm like, Andy, fucking don't, don't.

26:08.160 --> 26:12.160
I'm looking in the rear of your mirror at his son, and the son's looking at me like,

26:12.160 --> 26:15.160
we both have a look like we may have to kill him.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.160
We might have to kill Andy before he does.

26:18.160 --> 26:22.160
He's like a crying baby behind enemy lines in Vietnam.

26:22.160 --> 26:26.160
Shut that Andy dick up!

26:26.160 --> 26:28.160
Smother him.

26:35.160 --> 26:41.160
So, he opens the door and starts screaming the N-word at this middle aged black gentleman,

26:41.160 --> 26:48.160
who sees it as Andy Dick and just gets a big kick out of it.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.160
My car is covered, my car now smells like a warm Heineken.

26:52.160 --> 26:57.160
And we get to this bar on Vine, and we get in there, and I was so bummed out,

26:57.160 --> 27:01.160
and Andy walks in, he has a broken finger, and if you asked him why, he doesn't know.

27:01.160 --> 27:04.160
He doesn't remember how he got it, he's got a broken index finger on his left hand.

27:04.160 --> 27:08.160
He sees a girl sitting with a cocktail, and he puts his index finger in her drink,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.160
like a brand new, clearly just vodka on the rocks.

27:11.160 --> 27:15.160
Just sticks his finger into her drink, and then picks it up and walks off with it.

27:15.160 --> 27:18.160
And this girl's like, what the fuck?

27:18.160 --> 27:20.160
And I was like, what was that, vodka?

27:20.160 --> 27:23.160
I said, yeah, it's a kettle of rocks, I just fucking got it, I'll get you a new drink.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.160
And she's like, who the fuck is this guy?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.160
I go, do you know who Andy Dick is?

27:27.160 --> 27:31.160
And he's like, no, I'm like, it's better that you don't.

27:31.160 --> 27:35.160
And I turn to his son, I said, I'm going to beat your father up tonight,

27:35.160 --> 27:38.160
and you're going to either help me or watch.

27:38.160 --> 27:42.160
And he says, I will help you.

27:42.160 --> 27:48.160
So maybe they'll be here next week.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.160
He is the best at being the worst.

27:51.160 --> 27:58.160
He makes Dino look like me.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.160
Yeah, they used to be a comedy team, a lot of people don't know that.

28:01.160 --> 28:07.160
They used to do like a two-man comedy act, where Andy would hit Dino as hard as he could.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.160
And Dino would get a boner or something.

28:10.160 --> 28:13.160
I don't know what the punchline was.

28:13.160 --> 28:17.160
I think they did like old, like Abbott and Costello routines,

28:17.160 --> 28:21.160
but instead of like slapping, they'd actually, he'd really physically like smash him.

28:21.160 --> 28:25.160
They have a podcast coming to Feral Audio, that's why.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.160
What's it called?

28:26.160 --> 28:28.160
Skull juice.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.160
Skull juice.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
Gross.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.160
Skull juice.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.160
Well, listen at your own risk.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
Yeah.

28:36.160 --> 28:44.160
All right, well, who here has a problem that needs to be solved?

28:44.160 --> 28:46.160
Young lady, your hand went up first.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.160
I think I see glasses.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
Do you want to come up and share your problem?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.160
All right.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.160
Okay.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.160
Who do we got?

28:54.160 --> 28:56.160
What's your name, Adam?

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
Gabrielle, hello.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
Is it Adam?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.160
Is it?

28:59.160 --> 29:00.160
Okay.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.160
Okay.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.160
Sorry.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
I saw glasses in a ponytail.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
Yeah, no.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.160
We're in Los Angeles.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.160
That's accurate.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.160
So that's one of the problems.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.160
Is it?

29:09.160 --> 29:10.160
The Gender Decademy.

29:10.160 --> 29:11.160
Oh, okay.

29:11.160 --> 29:14.160
I know I can help with that.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
You're the king.

29:16.160 --> 29:21.160
I have a surgeon's touch with the gender politics.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.160
The trans community loves me.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.160
They trust me.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
It's true.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.160
They said that to me.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.160
Where are the meetings again?

29:30.160 --> 29:34.160
It's just like, it's actually like behind Meltdown Comics.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.160
What are you doing out?

29:35.160 --> 29:40.160
If you need help with that logo, too, I sure as heck.

29:40.160 --> 29:47.160
Well, so what's the, Gabrielle, how can we help you?

29:47.160 --> 29:53.160
I have chronic pain throughout the right side of my body.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.160
I don't know how you can help me.

29:56.160 --> 30:00.160
We can hit you very hard on the left side of your body.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.160
Create some balance.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
That makes sense.

30:03.160 --> 30:11.160
No, it's just, yeah, I've been to more doctors in the past two years than I have in my entire life.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.160
How do I start?

30:13.160 --> 30:20.160
Slowly, because with chronic pain, it's like, you don't realize, you just think you're lazy and need to work out more.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.160
So it's like, eventually...

30:22.160 --> 30:27.160
Sorry, I'm ignorant about this. Did it come from an injury or just kind of came on all of a sudden?

30:27.160 --> 30:36.160
Yeah, it kind of came on all of a sudden, when I was like 20 or something, I started realizing my body kind of sucked.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.160
Are you currently in pain right now?

30:38.160 --> 30:46.160
Yeah, it hurts like right here. It gets better at like, it gets better and worse-ish.

30:46.160 --> 30:49.160
What kind of pain? Is it like a throbbing pain or a shooting pain?

30:49.160 --> 30:52.160
It's almost like a numb pain.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.160
Is it like nerve pain?

30:54.160 --> 30:58.160
Do you know the same thing? Is it on one side?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.160
Yeah, it's on the right side.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.160
Do you know what it is?

31:02.160 --> 31:04.160
Well, let's get you up here.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.160
I told you we could help you.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.160
We're going to build like a Voltron right now.

31:09.160 --> 31:21.160
As long as you guys are okay becoming one person that's made of two left sides, I think we have the solution.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.160
My name is Marina.

31:23.160 --> 31:25.160
Hello Marina.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.160
Sorry, I kind of sucked you up here.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.160
I didn't make sure that you would be okay coming up.

31:29.160 --> 31:33.160
This is actually great because I have some advice for you too.

31:33.160 --> 31:43.160
I've got Lyme disease and so I've had to have multiple surgeries on my joints because they've collapsed and you've got a nice little Frankenstein kind of scar here.

31:43.160 --> 31:48.160
I've had nerve pain all throughout the right side of my body for it.

31:48.160 --> 31:57.160
Then to doctors, just like you, in and out of different pain clinics and stuff, but I finally found something that works.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.160
Woo, sorry.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.160
It's a tough thing.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.160
Whereabouts? You said it's right about here?

32:05.160 --> 32:12.160
It kind of just goes throughout my body and so it becomes hard to...

32:12.160 --> 32:24.160
It kind of goes up into my shoulder, like it starts like down around this area, comes up, goes into my shoulder and then my neck hurts so much.

32:24.160 --> 32:28.160
It kind of like makes my head all foggy all the time and so...

32:28.160 --> 32:32.160
Okay, I actually, I'm a massage therapist as well.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.160
I can like try something.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.160
Sure.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.160
This is great.

32:39.160 --> 32:42.160
Back to come to Harmontown and get a massage.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.160
Yeah, sure. I don't know if I could drop the mic.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.160
Is there a waiver that we have?

32:48.160 --> 32:51.160
We're not a medical clinic. This is all on her.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.160
Okay.

32:53.160 --> 32:58.160
You are surrendering your safety to her.

32:58.160 --> 33:01.160
This is all consensual.

33:01.160 --> 33:06.160
This is good.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.160
I thought, I thought for sure it seemed like, which is that I think I might be able to help you.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.160
I was like, if she says squarespace.com.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.160
Yeah.

33:13.160 --> 33:16.160
We're going to be rich.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.160
Yeah.

33:18.160 --> 33:22.160
Can we get the lights down a little bit lower right now?

33:22.160 --> 33:26.160
Gonna prepare your nerve damage with massage.

33:26.160 --> 33:30.160
Yeah, to the break of time.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.160
Yeah.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.160
Get off my lawn.

33:35.160 --> 33:42.160
Jeff's taking the leg that doesn't hurt.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.160
Yeah, deep tissue.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.160
Get inside.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.160
Get in Gabrielle's neck with your fingers.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.160
Marina.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.160
Yeah.

33:53.160 --> 33:58.160
Yo, Marina means house on the water.

33:58.160 --> 34:02.160
Yeah.

34:02.160 --> 34:04.160
Yeah.

34:04.160 --> 34:12.160
The uninformed Spanish rapper.

34:12.160 --> 34:15.160
Marina means place where you keep the boat.

34:15.160 --> 34:22.160
Right now, she's going to help float into Gabrielle's pain

34:22.160 --> 34:26.160
and win the game with her healing fingertips.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.160
Yeah.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.160
Yeah.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.160
Yeah.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.160
Yeah.

34:34.160 --> 34:36.160
Yeah.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.160
Yeah.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.160
Yeah.

34:40.160 --> 34:55.160
So Marina, did you learn this stuff because you had pain and then you went to the doctor and they're like, I don't know, you figure it out.

34:55.160 --> 35:00.160
Actually, I did learn because of an injury.

35:00.160 --> 35:08.160
I was, I used to run track and my friend was teaching me how to do it, but he was like a foot taller than me.

35:08.160 --> 35:19.160
I was trying to run a hurdle and I tore my hamstring and the trainer was there and taped me up and it was awesome and she just worked on my legs a bit.

35:19.160 --> 35:25.160
I was like, whoa, this is magical. Why don't I do this every single day?

35:25.160 --> 35:28.160
And so I went to school for it and it was awesome.

35:28.160 --> 35:32.160
You got really comfortable with your body because you got to be naked.

35:32.160 --> 35:37.160
And you know.

35:37.160 --> 35:42.160
Just when you show up for class.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.160
You work on each other.

35:44.160 --> 35:46.160
Do you work a little Tokyo by any chance?

35:46.160 --> 35:55.160
No, actually stopped. I'm a writer now. I'm a future writer for cracks.com now and I do research too.

35:55.160 --> 36:01.160
But you know, with all this stuff, I can't do a massage so much anymore, but you said that helped.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.160
Yeah, it does.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
Fantastic.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.160
Thank you.

36:04.160 --> 36:09.160
I have another thing with this chronic pain is actually kind of a rant for me.

36:09.160 --> 36:12.160
DEA really pisses me off.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.160
Yeah.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.160
There was a, there's a nice thing though.

36:18.160 --> 36:25.160
I'm not on any, you know, not on nearly so many painkillers as they used to be because I discovered something really awesome.

36:25.160 --> 36:33.160
Got super into, you know, a lot of alternative medicine is bullshit, but there's actually a really good thing called cratum.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.160
I don't know if any of you guys have heard of it.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.160
It's from, you know, Thailand, Malaysia, that area.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.160
I've been making this tincture out of it and it's totally worked.

36:43.160 --> 36:48.160
I have some with me if you would like to try it at some point.

36:48.160 --> 36:53.160
This is related to your trouble with the DEA, right?

36:53.160 --> 36:55.160
What is that?

36:55.160 --> 36:57.160
Can you tell us more what cratum is?

36:57.160 --> 36:59.160
Sure, it is a plant.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.160
Isn't that what spice is made out of?

37:02.160 --> 37:04.160
No, no.

37:04.160 --> 37:12.160
At least not to, I mean, not to my knowledge if it is, it's probably spicy, probably pretty expensive, but it's a funny thing.

37:12.160 --> 37:19.160
There used to be, probably still is, a humongous opium problem in Thailand, I believe it was.

37:19.160 --> 37:23.160
It was just one of those countries over there.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.160
Somewhere around the Golden Triangle.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.160
One of those flyover countries.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.160
Yeah, there you go.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.160
Places that you just don't go.

37:32.160 --> 37:41.160
So the government was actually providing a lot of this opium and they were discovering that people were chewing the leaves of the cratum tree

37:41.160 --> 37:48.160
just everywhere and they were not addicted to opium anymore because it actually works to get you off of it.

37:48.160 --> 37:56.160
So they made it illegal and also started shopping down all the trees so that they could, you know, get people hooked on opium again.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.160
And it's currently illegal there.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.160
It's illegal, I believe, in Canada.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.160
It's illegal in the UK.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.160
Illegal, you're saying?

38:03.160 --> 38:05.160
Yeah, illegal, but it's legal here.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.160
It's called cratum?

38:07.160 --> 38:10.160
Yep, K-R-A-T-O-M.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.160
Most people are still kind of...

38:12.160 --> 38:14.160
Sounds like a He-Man film.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.160
Yeah.

38:17.160 --> 38:22.160
So the DEA has been looking at it and like, ah, people are getting high on this.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.160
They're actually enjoying themselves.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.160
We've got to get rid of this.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.160
This is not going to bode well.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.160
You get high on it, but it also gets you off of opium?

38:31.160 --> 38:34.160
It gets you, yeah, it absolutely works for any kind of withdrawal.

38:34.160 --> 38:37.160
If you're not on opium, do you think it might get you on it a little bit?

38:37.160 --> 38:39.160
I said it may be a gateway.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.160
Also, my other question is, are you holding right now?

38:41.160 --> 38:43.160
No.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.160
I never had opium before.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.160
Where can a guy get some cratum in this town is my question.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.160
I get it online.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.160
Just powder stuff and then I make it.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.160
You can also go to cratum barrel, right?

38:53.160 --> 38:55.160
It's a...

38:59.160 --> 39:01.160
Adam Goldberg isn't here anymore.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.160
I thought I'd cratum barrel.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.160
I thought I'd do what he'd shout out.

39:06.160 --> 39:08.160
Now Gabrielle, back to you.

39:08.160 --> 39:14.160
Is there anything that goes beyond your chronic pain?

39:14.160 --> 39:16.160
What else is going on with you?

39:16.160 --> 39:24.160
I don't know, just my existential pain.

39:24.160 --> 39:28.160
No, just like...

39:28.160 --> 39:30.160
You have a great ponytail.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.160
This ponytail is rocking.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.160
It is a wonderful ponytail.

39:34.160 --> 39:38.160
We kind of skipped over it.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.160
Do you identify as female?

39:40.160 --> 39:42.160
Yes.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.160
Mom.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.160
No, I'm kidding.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.160
I'll call you mom if you want.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.160
No, no, no.

39:50.160 --> 39:54.160
I was saying it as if my mom was listening.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.160
Oh, you're shouting.

39:56.160 --> 40:00.160
This is an awkward way for your mom to find out.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.160
Does your mom listen to Harmontown?

40:02.160 --> 40:04.160
Does mom know or not know?

40:04.160 --> 40:07.160
No, I told them. I told them through text.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.160
I told them through a long text.

40:09.160 --> 40:12.160
What emoji went along with that one?

40:12.160 --> 40:20.160
And the non-smoking sign, but also a dick.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.160
Is this like the eggplant?

40:22.160 --> 40:24.160
Yeah, I guess so.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.160
Awesome.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.160
All right, so where do we go from here?

40:30.160 --> 40:32.160
Cratom.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.160
You can still get it in the United States through websites and stuff.

40:36.160 --> 40:45.160
It's currently still illegal, soon-to-be-illegal, sort of opiate fighter.

40:45.160 --> 40:50.160
A bottle-nosed dolphin to Opium's shark.

40:50.160 --> 40:56.160
Michael Winslow to Opium's Radiohead.

40:56.160 --> 41:00.160
And that they should learn to get along before the camera shows up.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.160
Yeah, it'll get you out of the pain clinics.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.160
It's pretty fantastic. You can make it at home very easily.

41:06.160 --> 41:12.160
I've just, you know, if you just happen to have like a 190-proof corn liquor laying around,

41:12.160 --> 41:14.160
then that's all you need.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.160
Some masonries are good.

41:16.160 --> 41:19.160
But it's changed my life completely.

41:19.160 --> 41:23.160
Tell us more about your run-ins with the DEA again.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.160
Because what you're talking about sounds highly illegal.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.160
Oh, no, I've never had any run-ins with the DEA.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.160
Because I might now, but no, I just...

41:32.160 --> 41:35.160
You know Gabrielle's mom works for the DEA.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.160
This has been a thing.

41:37.160 --> 41:40.160
Marina, you're wearing a Wonder Woman shirt.

41:40.160 --> 41:45.160
Are you a longtime fan of Wonder Woman as a myth, or are you...

41:45.160 --> 41:50.160
Have you been recently converted by the Superman-Patman movie?

41:50.160 --> 41:53.160
Or did you just like the way the shirt, you know, looked?

41:53.160 --> 41:57.160
I love... I'm a comic book nerd big time for games comics.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.160
Yeah, thank you.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.160
Are you looking forward to the new movie?

42:01.160 --> 42:03.160
I am. It's about goddamn time.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.160
I have a bet with my friend. I bet on Suicide Squad.

42:06.160 --> 42:12.160
I bet that it would be over 70% on Run Tomatoes with my friend.

42:12.160 --> 42:17.160
We bet on a pizza, but he said we could double or nothing on Wonder Woman.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.160
So I'm hoping I get two pizzas.

42:19.160 --> 42:22.160
What's your side of the bet on Wonder Woman?

42:22.160 --> 42:26.160
I guess 70. Same thing. 70%.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.160
I'm betting on mediocrity.

42:28.160 --> 42:31.160
What's the team working on Wonder Woman? Who's the director?

42:31.160 --> 42:34.160
Patty Jenkins. She did Roller Ball.

42:34.160 --> 42:37.160
No, no, no, no, Monster Ball.

42:37.160 --> 42:39.160
Roller Monster Ball?

42:39.160 --> 42:41.160
Okay.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.160
There's a thing. I was reading an article now.

42:44.160 --> 42:48.160
I guess it's no accident that the thing now is to take like...

42:48.160 --> 42:54.160
You know, they're not getting like the big gigantic like rock star names,

42:54.160 --> 42:59.160
which are probably almost as hit and miss really as anybody else in these giant,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.160
what they call tent pole movies.

43:01.160 --> 43:05.160
Because they're so expensive and they come with the ability to go,

43:05.160 --> 43:08.160
no, I need five years and I need you to get out of my face.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.160
And so they're working with first timers a lot.

43:11.160 --> 43:16.160
They're like really like green directors and they're having just as much success as failure really.

43:16.160 --> 43:20.160
And so, yeah, I don't know. I thought that was interesting.

43:20.160 --> 43:23.160
I was like, oh, I didn't know this was like part of a big like sea change,

43:23.160 --> 43:25.160
but that's what it is.

43:25.160 --> 43:28.160
I think DC just like tried to catch up really fast with Marvel.

43:28.160 --> 43:34.160
Like they failed at Batman versus Superman and the tone than they wanted.

43:34.160 --> 43:41.160
So, I mean, with Suicide Squad, they were like, let's make Guardians of the Galaxy 2.5.

43:41.160 --> 43:48.160
Well, yeah, I mean, nothing opened our eyes to the importance of the rating like Deadpool.

43:48.160 --> 43:51.160
I mean, that's such an easy thing to talk about now.

43:51.160 --> 43:54.160
It's just go, look, is it going to be rated R or not?

43:54.160 --> 44:01.160
Because if the word edgy is going to be in the menu and it's not going to be rated R,

44:01.160 --> 44:05.160
then you might as well embrace the non-edge, you know, I think.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.160
Yeah, absolutely.

44:06.160 --> 44:10.160
What was the Heath Ledger Batman movie? Was that PG-13?

44:10.160 --> 44:11.160
Yeah.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.160
They managed it.

44:14.160 --> 44:17.160
I guess the key is you have to be violent and not sexual.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.160
Exactly.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.160
You just have to like murder people.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.160
We are so terrified of boobs. It's ridiculous.

44:21.160 --> 44:27.160
But yeah, I don't want to spoil anything for anybody about Suicide Squad,

44:27.160 --> 44:30.160
but who here has seen it so far?

44:30.160 --> 44:31.160
It's got so...

44:31.160 --> 44:35.160
I love that tone.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.160
You fucking assholes.

44:37.160 --> 44:43.160
So look, just from the trailer, I'm speaking way out of school here,

44:43.160 --> 44:45.160
because I was never on board with the whole...

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
You predicted what the whole movie was about.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.160
Oh, I did. I ran down the...

44:49.160 --> 44:52.160
It was fun. It was a fun car ride to work.

44:52.160 --> 44:58.160
And I did see in an article, I saw a spoiler and said I was right about the courses.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.160
I don't know.

44:59.160 --> 45:13.160
But I thought it was... I understand the political climate calls for a more actualized Harley Quinn,

45:13.160 --> 45:17.160
like an autonomous Harley Quinn with agency, but at the same time,

45:17.160 --> 45:23.160
how much can you make her appropriate before she stops being Harley Quinn?

45:23.160 --> 45:28.160
When I was watching the trailer, I was like, well, I thought she was a guilty pleasure character.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.160
I thought she was sort of like...

45:30.160 --> 45:32.160
Put another female character in a Suicide Squad movie.

45:32.160 --> 45:35.160
Who feels guilty about Harley Quinn's pleasure?

45:35.160 --> 45:36.160
What'd you say?

45:36.160 --> 45:38.160
Do you feel guilty about...

45:38.160 --> 45:40.160
Well, sure I do. If I'm enjoying her,

45:40.160 --> 45:44.160
and really the only place I've consumed her is Batman, the Arkham video games.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.160
That's where my relationship with Harley Quinn happens.

45:48.160 --> 45:52.160
She comes on screen and I go like, okay, I get it.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.160
I understand.

45:55.160 --> 45:59.160
It's so over the top that it's like, I would say you could...

45:59.160 --> 46:04.160
This is fine as long as you put a bunch of post, post, posts on the front of whatever this is.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.160
It's post, post, post, feminist or whatever.

46:07.160 --> 46:10.160
Because she's the archetype of the...

46:10.160 --> 46:16.160
She is really supportive as a girlfriend to the point of absolute self-destruction.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.160
She has no identity of her own.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.160
So then we're making her...

46:21.160 --> 46:23.160
She almost looks like she's the protagonist of Suicide Squad.

46:23.160 --> 46:27.160
Actually, interestingly, the protagonist of Suicide Squad is Will Smith,

46:27.160 --> 46:31.160
who is really kind of playing himself more than deadshot.

46:31.160 --> 46:38.160
He's this family man who, weirdly enough, spends most of the movie without his mask,

46:38.160 --> 46:41.160
even though in the comics he's got the mask on the entire time.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.160
And the thing is, the Suicide Squad...

46:44.160 --> 46:49.160
I don't think this will spoil too much, but it's got some troubling messages in it.

46:49.160 --> 46:55.160
Because the ultimate moral of the story in the end kind of suggests

46:55.160 --> 46:58.160
that it's totally okay to...

46:58.160 --> 47:03.160
That a good guy is okay with his daughter doing trigonometry

47:03.160 --> 47:07.160
by talking about shooting people from buildings.

47:07.160 --> 47:10.160
It's like, oh, well, let me find the hypotenuse here.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.160
That's the ultimate moral.

47:12.160 --> 47:17.160
Yeah, that's what they're talking about, because he's this family man.

47:17.160 --> 47:23.160
Because deadshot, his whole character is he's good at shooting, right?

47:23.160 --> 47:26.160
But in the movie, is he doing math?

47:26.160 --> 47:29.160
Is it a beautiful mind in the background?

47:29.160 --> 47:31.160
No! I wish!

47:31.160 --> 47:33.160
No, it's... Oh, man.

47:33.160 --> 47:36.160
Does he have a little baby shot daughter?

47:36.160 --> 47:38.160
Is he like...

47:38.160 --> 47:41.160
It sounds like it's that. It sounds like he's a family man.

47:41.160 --> 47:44.160
He's got a little girl, and she...

47:44.160 --> 47:47.160
Oh, I almost spoiled something, but...

47:47.160 --> 47:50.160
She's involved with something, but yeah, no, no.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.160
At the end of it, you know, he's doing math with her,

47:53.160 --> 47:56.160
and he says at one point in the movie, you know,

47:56.160 --> 47:58.160
I just don't want my daughter to think I'm...

47:58.160 --> 48:00.160
I just want to do something.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.160
Some of my daughter doesn't think I'm a piece of shit,

48:02.160 --> 48:05.160
even though I murder people for money.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.160
Yeah, he's a super villain.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.160
Yeah.

48:09.160 --> 48:14.160
And the movie is told.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.160
Well, yeah.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.160
The tone kind of switches off throughout the whole movie,

48:18.160 --> 48:20.160
because if it would stay consistent,

48:20.160 --> 48:22.160
that would have been cool, you know,

48:22.160 --> 48:25.160
but instead it kind of tries to make you feel good about that,

48:25.160 --> 48:27.160
that he gets with his daughter,

48:27.160 --> 48:33.160
and that she starts embracing the part of him that is a murderer.

48:33.160 --> 48:37.160
You know, they try to give you the sort of buzzers about that.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.160
That's like at the end of the Steve Jobs thing,

48:40.160 --> 48:43.160
where she's like, I guess iPods are kind of cool,

48:43.160 --> 48:46.160
except it's like assassination.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.160
Yes!

48:48.160 --> 48:52.160
Marina, I've got this pain in my neck right now.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.160
I can fix it.

48:54.160 --> 48:57.160
I guess the thing with the trailer promised,

48:57.160 --> 48:59.160
you know, is that the government's like,

48:59.160 --> 49:03.160
hey, much similar to the Marvel X-Men universe,

49:03.160 --> 49:06.160
it's like, oh, how can we trust all these people?

49:06.160 --> 49:09.160
Like, they're flying around and they're doing whatever they want.

49:09.160 --> 49:11.160
Well, what if Superman goes crazy one day,

49:11.160 --> 49:14.160
and I don't know how that gets you to what about the villains?

49:14.160 --> 49:17.160
What if Superman wants to kill the president?

49:17.160 --> 49:20.160
Let's put bombs on all the supervillains' house

49:20.160 --> 49:22.160
and hide them in the White House.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.160
What I would understand is they would go like,

49:24.160 --> 49:27.160
well, what if you ask Superman to kill Isis

49:27.160 --> 49:29.160
and he won't do it because that's wrong,

49:29.160 --> 49:32.160
you know, like he just wants to arrest them?

49:32.160 --> 49:34.160
Like, I don't know, I'm not kidding.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.160
Like, shouldn't it just be like the Pentagon going like,

49:36.160 --> 49:38.160
well, Batman doesn't follow orders

49:38.160 --> 49:40.160
and Superman's such a boy scout?

49:40.160 --> 49:42.160
Like, how about some of these people

49:42.160 --> 49:44.160
that those guys don't get along with so well?

49:44.160 --> 49:46.160
What superhero damage would you hire

49:46.160 --> 49:48.160
if you were the president to kill Isis?

49:48.160 --> 49:50.160
Or take care of Isis?

49:50.160 --> 49:53.160
Well, I'd go to Superman first for everything,

49:53.160 --> 49:56.160
whether it's opening a bottle or killing Isis.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.160
Are you willing to do this?

49:58.160 --> 50:00.160
I know he wouldn't lie.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.160
Let's say Superman and Batman pass.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.160
Who do you go to next?

50:04.160 --> 50:06.160
How are the ducks?

50:06.160 --> 50:08.160
How are the ducks?

50:08.160 --> 50:10.160
Oh, shit, how are the ducks?

50:10.160 --> 50:12.160
The DC Universe?

50:12.160 --> 50:14.160
I don't know, I mean, you know,

50:14.160 --> 50:16.160
it would be nice to give Aquaman a try

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
and tell you how.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.160
Feel bad for him versus Isis.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.160
As long as Isis is near the Gulf.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.160
Yeah, it was good.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.160
Stole him to a landlocked area.

50:28.160 --> 50:31.160
If we can get them near the Euphrates River.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.160
Well, I would go to Wonder Woman

50:33.160 --> 50:35.160
because she's a woman,

50:35.160 --> 50:37.160
and you know, I would go like,

50:37.160 --> 50:39.160
look, Google them.

50:39.160 --> 50:41.160
And have at it.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.160
You know, do whatever you want,

50:45.160 --> 50:47.160
keep whatever you keep.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.160
See you in November.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.160
What happens in November?

50:53.160 --> 50:55.160
Elections.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.160
I guess I assumed I was a president running for...

50:59.160 --> 51:01.160
Oh, I assumed I was a president running for...

51:01.160 --> 51:03.160
Oh, yeah.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.160
Is that what they call it?

51:05.160 --> 51:07.160
So is this re-election for you?

51:07.160 --> 51:09.160
Yeah, I guess.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.160
You're the incumbent president trying to get re-election.

51:11.160 --> 51:13.160
You asked me, who am I killing Isis with?

51:13.160 --> 51:15.160
I don't know, it was a tough question.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.160
I was surprised by it, I don't know.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.160
I think Wonder Woman is a pretty great answer.

51:19.160 --> 51:21.160
Yeah.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.160
Yeah, I kind of biased, I guess.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.160
Gabrielle, who do you think?

51:25.160 --> 51:27.160
What super villain or team

51:27.160 --> 51:29.160
is best equipped to kill Isis?

51:29.160 --> 51:31.160
Godzilla?

51:31.160 --> 51:33.160
Fuck shit!

51:33.160 --> 51:35.160
I didn't know we had...

51:35.160 --> 51:37.160
If we had like two or three straight up

51:37.160 --> 51:39.160
Godzilla's,

51:39.160 --> 51:41.160
just send them in there.

51:41.160 --> 51:43.160
I heard a really funny thing about...

51:43.160 --> 51:45.160
You know the 2000 Godzilla movie,

51:45.160 --> 51:47.160
the one that's like Matthew Broderick?

51:47.160 --> 51:49.160
Apparently in...

51:49.160 --> 51:51.160
Yeah, yeah.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.160
Apparently there was...

51:53.160 --> 51:55.160
I didn't understand that response.

51:55.160 --> 51:57.160
It was a sequel,

51:57.160 --> 51:59.160
because they have all the Japanese,

51:59.160 --> 52:01.160
so they just keep on making Godzilla movies.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.160
And in that movie,

52:03.160 --> 52:05.160
they said that Godzilla

52:05.160 --> 52:07.160
and Matthew Broderick

52:07.160 --> 52:09.160
wasn't a real Godzilla.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.160
Americans just assumed it was Godzilla

52:11.160 --> 52:13.160
because it was a big lizard.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.160
And so they just kill it on screen,

52:15.160 --> 52:17.160
and they're just like,

52:17.160 --> 52:19.160
that wasn't a real Godzilla.

52:19.160 --> 52:21.160
So they can do that with Superman, too.

52:21.160 --> 52:23.160
Because everyone hates this one.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.160
I never understand how those movies are connected.

52:25.160 --> 52:27.160
Marvel's doing

52:27.160 --> 52:29.160
a little better job of

52:29.160 --> 52:31.160
making sure you get the...

52:31.160 --> 52:33.160
You know, this is a larger story.

52:33.160 --> 52:35.160
I don't know, the DC,

52:35.160 --> 52:37.160
this seems like they're kind of...

52:37.160 --> 52:39.160
I'm not

52:39.160 --> 52:41.160
rooting for either over the other.

52:41.160 --> 52:43.160
I just keep making comic book movies

52:43.160 --> 52:45.160
rather than historical period pieces.

52:45.160 --> 52:47.160
Gabriella,

52:47.160 --> 52:49.160
if you hire Godzilla to go in

52:49.160 --> 52:51.160
and take care of

52:51.160 --> 52:53.160
Isis,

52:53.160 --> 52:55.160
can you give Godzilla instructions

52:55.160 --> 52:57.160
or does he just kind of do his own shit?

52:57.160 --> 52:59.160
How do you give him operational...

52:59.160 --> 53:01.160
I don't know, does Godzilla have a favorite food?

53:01.160 --> 53:03.160
You just put it

53:03.160 --> 53:05.160
near Isis and...

53:05.160 --> 53:07.160
Electricity?

53:07.160 --> 53:09.160
Play the song, yeah.

53:09.160 --> 53:11.160
In the latest Godzilla movie,

53:11.160 --> 53:13.160
he's got this weird interspecies bromance

53:13.160 --> 53:15.160
with that one soldier

53:15.160 --> 53:17.160
whoever saw the...

53:17.160 --> 53:19.160
The whitest man alive.

53:19.160 --> 53:21.160
Joe, Joe, Joe American.

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
Yes, so get that guy

53:23.160 --> 53:25.160
and make sure you bring

53:25.160 --> 53:27.160
Ken, Montana Bay,

53:27.160 --> 53:29.160
so he can go just...

53:29.160 --> 53:31.160
Because he has this weird mind link

53:31.160 --> 53:33.160
with Godzilla as well.

53:33.160 --> 53:35.160
Also, King Kong, it occurs to me,

53:35.160 --> 53:37.160
at least like the original

53:37.160 --> 53:39.160
movie King Kong, and then also

53:39.160 --> 53:41.160
the 80s, Jeff Bridges,

53:41.160 --> 53:43.160
one,

53:43.160 --> 53:45.160
he's really into

53:45.160 --> 53:47.160
women.

53:47.160 --> 53:49.160
Like two,

53:49.160 --> 53:51.160
so he probably would...

53:51.160 --> 53:53.160
I think you could turn him loose on the Middle East as well,

53:53.160 --> 53:55.160
like if you had an enemy.

53:55.160 --> 53:57.160
But I think there would be a lot of collateral damage,

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
I just don't know, you know.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
Wasn't there a comic that... Oh yeah, it was like a Frank Miller comic

54:01.160 --> 54:03.160
where it was originally

54:03.160 --> 54:05.160
like Batman kills Al-Qaeda

54:05.160 --> 54:07.160
or something. Yeah,

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
it was a real thing, right? Yeah.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.160
He beat us to it.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.160
How do you do it?

54:13.160 --> 54:15.160
I don't know, I didn't hear that.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.160
He probably just... I think he knows.

54:17.160 --> 54:19.160
Oh no, I have a question. Oh, okay.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.160
I was wrong. I don't have a show

54:23.160 --> 54:25.160
so you may as well ask it, yeah.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.160
What is the

54:27.160 --> 54:29.160
the worst job that you would

54:29.160 --> 54:31.160
tolerate doing?

54:31.160 --> 54:33.160
The worst job that I would tolerate doing.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.160
Dan specifically?

54:35.160 --> 54:37.160
You're asking me... Dan,

54:37.160 --> 54:39.160
this is Doug Filburn

54:39.160 --> 54:41.160
from the Washington Post.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.160
This question is,

54:43.160 --> 54:45.160
what's the worst job you would tolerate?

54:45.160 --> 54:47.160
That's a really interesting

54:47.160 --> 54:49.160
question because

54:49.160 --> 54:51.160
what's the worst job you would tolerate doing?

54:51.160 --> 54:53.160
So first you have to ask yourself, what's the worst

54:53.160 --> 54:55.160
job? Is it the worst?

54:55.160 --> 54:57.160
The one that you...

54:57.160 --> 54:59.160
I'm pulling in a paycheck, but this is

54:59.160 --> 55:01.160
the lowest I'll go.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.160
Yeah, well, I kind of guess,

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
but then, yeah, the word tolerate kind of needs to be

55:05.160 --> 55:07.160
explored there.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.160
Like, well, yeah, but...

55:09.160 --> 55:11.160
Let's say you're broke.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.160
I'll put some parameters on this. You're broke.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.160
This is a

55:15.160 --> 55:17.160
$15 right now. No, let's say

55:17.160 --> 55:19.160
minimum wage. Minimum wage jobs, all you can have.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
Right.

55:21.160 --> 55:23.160
What's the worst thing that you would say,

55:23.160 --> 55:25.160
okay, I'll get up out every morning and do this thing?

55:25.160 --> 55:27.160
And right below

55:27.160 --> 55:29.160
that is a job. Fuck it, I won't do it.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.160
Well, but I won't do it, meaning what?

55:31.160 --> 55:33.160
I'd rather die.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.160
You'd rather go hungry and

55:35.160 --> 55:37.160
just die. Or turn

55:37.160 --> 55:39.160
to crime. Is crime

55:39.160 --> 55:41.160
a job?

55:41.160 --> 55:43.160
If it's like, oh,

55:43.160 --> 55:45.160
you can eat shit for $4 an hour, you can

55:45.160 --> 55:47.160
eat human shit, like, well, no,

55:47.160 --> 55:49.160
give me your wallet.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.160
Well, what are you, some kind of criminal?

55:51.160 --> 55:53.160
Yeah, it pays more.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.160
Well, yeah, but crime never pays.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.160
Well, it pays more than eating shit.

55:57.160 --> 55:59.160
And

55:59.160 --> 56:01.160
you can't beat the hours, like, I'm out

56:01.160 --> 56:03.160
of here.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.160
Well, I would never want to be a criminal,

56:05.160 --> 56:07.160
but I don't want to eat the shit.

56:07.160 --> 56:09.160
So I don't know, I'm just trying to

56:09.160 --> 56:11.160
I want to be able to answer the question

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
dutifully.

56:13.160 --> 56:15.160
I

56:15.160 --> 56:17.160
was a dishwasher and I was awful at it,

56:17.160 --> 56:19.160
but I kept trying to be good at it.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.160
I don't know, I mean,

56:21.160 --> 56:23.160
it was pretty, it was,

56:23.160 --> 56:25.160
if I was good at it, if I thought

56:25.160 --> 56:27.160
I could have gotten good at it,

56:27.160 --> 56:29.160
I think I could have kept doing it because

56:29.160 --> 56:31.160
it would be like, oh, but

56:31.160 --> 56:33.160
you know, I know there's worse jobs because

56:33.160 --> 56:35.160
J. Johnston used to

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160
we worked in a fucking shit plant.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.160
He worked at the place where they clean

56:39.160 --> 56:41.160
shit, and Schrab worked

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
at a place in Mayville where he scrubbed

56:43.160 --> 56:45.160
the rims of tanks where they

56:45.160 --> 56:47.160
keep the shit.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.160
Like, I kind of think...

56:49.160 --> 56:51.160
Why does that need to be scrubbed?

56:51.160 --> 56:53.160
I

56:53.160 --> 56:55.160
mean, I guess if you think

56:55.160 --> 56:57.160
about it, it's like, well, why does it need

56:57.160 --> 56:59.160
to be in a tank? And the answer is because

56:59.160 --> 57:01.160
you know, like, so I guess it's like,

57:01.160 --> 57:03.160
I know it's just simultaneously ridiculous,

57:03.160 --> 57:05.160
but then it's like, well, you know, it's like, hey,

57:05.160 --> 57:07.160
it's a tank full of shit, so why should the rim

57:07.160 --> 57:09.160
be clean? And then you'd be like, well, why should

57:09.160 --> 57:11.160
the outside be clean? Why should the place where

57:11.160 --> 57:13.160
the tank is be clean? Why should the city be clean, I guess?

57:13.160 --> 57:15.160
I'm just trying to get inside their heads.

57:15.160 --> 57:17.160
I'll ask you this.

57:17.160 --> 57:19.160
I'll tell you what, if I was in charge of civilization,

57:19.160 --> 57:21.160
the minute we got to the point

57:21.160 --> 57:23.160
where we needed to build a shit tank,

57:23.160 --> 57:25.160
I'd be like, we got to

57:25.160 --> 57:27.160
break up, let's go our separate ways,

57:27.160 --> 57:29.160
let's stick to tribes of a hundred people.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.160
I was like, I love this,

57:31.160 --> 57:33.160
we found a good yard stick.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.160
For me, it was like,

57:35.160 --> 57:37.160
because you can't remember more than a hundred

57:37.160 --> 57:39.160
people's names. There was

57:39.160 --> 57:41.160
somebody who just asked me

57:41.160 --> 57:43.160
a question about that.

57:43.160 --> 57:45.160
Well, they were like, somebody asked

57:45.160 --> 57:47.160
me, because we were in San Francisco

57:47.160 --> 57:49.160
and before that we were in Montreal, so I've

57:49.160 --> 57:51.160
been experiencing a lot of people

57:51.160 --> 57:53.160
recognizing me coming up to me and saying,

57:53.160 --> 57:55.160
thank you, you helped me through

57:55.160 --> 57:57.160
a lot, or can I get a picture with you?

57:57.160 --> 57:59.160
People just like, attention that

57:59.160 --> 58:01.160
you don't normally get

58:01.160 --> 58:03.160
in the course of your

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
day-to-day life, and somebody said,

58:05.160 --> 58:07.160
what do you

58:07.160 --> 58:09.160
think about that? What is that? Do you get

58:09.160 --> 58:11.160
bored with that? Do you not like that?

58:11.160 --> 58:13.160
I was like, I think it's like

58:13.160 --> 58:15.160
vitamin C, I think it's something that

58:15.160 --> 58:17.160
everyone else gets like

58:17.160 --> 58:19.160
zero of.

58:19.160 --> 58:21.160
I think you're supposed to get it

58:21.160 --> 58:23.160
like ten times a day.

58:23.160 --> 58:25.160
I'm not using vitamin C as an analogy

58:25.160 --> 58:27.160
anymore.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
And I think that if you lived in like a

58:29.160 --> 58:31.160
tribe of like a hundred people, I think

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
that every single person equally,

58:33.160 --> 58:35.160
whether you were the guy that made the shoes,

58:35.160 --> 58:37.160
or the person that made the roofs, or the

58:37.160 --> 58:39.160
gender, gender, gender,

58:39.160 --> 58:41.160
the woman

58:41.160 --> 58:43.160
that made the big pipes, the

58:43.160 --> 58:45.160
welding, or the guy

58:45.160 --> 58:47.160
that cut all the hair.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.160
I fucking, I live in a fucking

58:49.160 --> 58:51.160
beam of light.

58:51.160 --> 58:53.160
But

58:53.160 --> 58:55.160
if you're the,

58:55.160 --> 58:57.160
everybody would

58:57.160 --> 58:59.160
get that kind of like, everybody

58:59.160 --> 59:01.160
would know each other's name, and everybody

59:01.160 --> 59:03.160
would be like, they wouldn't say, hey, can I take

59:03.160 --> 59:05.160
a selfie with you, but it would be the same

59:05.160 --> 59:07.160
energy. I acknowledge

59:07.160 --> 59:09.160
what you do. Thank you, Glenn, for

59:09.160 --> 59:11.160
those shoes you made, my kids,

59:11.160 --> 59:13.160
they fit good today, or whatever, or

59:13.160 --> 59:15.160
boy, those roofs held up great

59:15.160 --> 59:17.160
last night, under the rain, etc.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.160
Everybody would have that

59:19.160 --> 59:21.160
feeling several times a day.

59:21.160 --> 59:23.160
And the only people that actually get it

59:23.160 --> 59:25.160
are like Brad Pitt, and like

59:25.160 --> 59:27.160
Donald Trump, and it's

59:27.160 --> 59:29.160
like, oh, look, there he is,

59:29.160 --> 59:31.160
is a thing that you should actually

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
get a dose of.

59:33.160 --> 59:35.160
We should have like a,

59:35.160 --> 59:37.160
it's like communism, but for

59:37.160 --> 59:39.160
empathy.

59:39.160 --> 59:41.160
Like social, like popularity,

59:41.160 --> 59:43.160
popular communes.

59:43.160 --> 59:45.160
I just think we're not meant biologically to live

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
300 million to a

59:47.160 --> 59:49.160
T.P.

59:49.160 --> 59:51.160
I just, I think

59:51.160 --> 59:53.160
our bodies are

59:53.160 --> 59:55.160
still, our muscle

59:55.160 --> 59:57.160
cells, and our nerve cells, and our brain

59:57.160 --> 59:59.160
cells, still

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.160
think that we're

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.160
a chimp that

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.160
recently learned to talk,

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.160
and swing sticks around. That's

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.160
actually true. I read

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
that, according

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.160
to certain studies, your brain

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
can only, or rather the

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
different primates,

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.160
the different sizes of brains can only

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160
rep, you know, hold a certain

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.160
number of other primates

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:25.160
and recognize them as

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.160
the same species. So

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.160
the number for hours is about

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.160
165 people. Which is the exact size

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.160
of a multi game sitcom's audience.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.160
That's why we play that

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.160
sound over and over again. You watch big bank

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.160
theory and you're like, oh, I'm being comforted. I hear

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.160
my tribe laughing with me. We don't play

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.160
the sound of 6 million people laughing.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
Well, because then we go like, wait,

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160
it's the ghost of the Holocaust. Why do I

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.160
pick that number?

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.160
I could have picked any number.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.160
And anyone outside,

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.160
anyone outside of that number

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.160
of 165 people is literally

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.160
not human to you.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.160
Dan, would you rather, if you had the choice,

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.160
study job, cleaning out the

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.160
poop tank, like the guy that

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.160
gets down there with the hip waiters on

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160
and scrubbing out the poop tank,

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.160
or life of crime

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.160
and do whatever you want. You had to actually

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
figure out your own way

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.160
to be a burglar or pick pocket

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160
or a safe cracker or whatever. What would you

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160
pick? Safe poop job

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.160
or free? I literally

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160
have to choose between

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160
poop tank and

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
life of crime. And your own,

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.160
find your own adventure crime.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.160
You have to get up in the morning and go, oh,

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.160
shit, am I a

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.160
burglar? Do I carjack people?

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.160
I have to do something

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.160
illegal. This is like a super villain

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.160
origin story.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160
Kind of. He was working in the poop.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.160
And then one day, he couldn't take

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.160
anymore. Would you rather wake up

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.160
and go, shit, you know, I don't want to

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.160
go commit crimes every day

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.160
and risk going to jail or risk

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.160
or hurt other people or steal

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.160
their property. I will do

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.160
the poop job. Or do you think you could be

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.160
a good bank robber? Well, I don't, no, I don't think

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160
I'd be a good bank robber.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.160
Huh? Let's say

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.160
20 dollars now. Well, that's, I mean, that's

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160
like, yeah, I have questions about, like,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.160
standard of living because, like,

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.160
because there's people

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.160
in the, if I scrub

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.160
that poop tank from

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.160
the union, you

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160
would only be doing a probably

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.160
if I scrub that poop tank, like, like, like

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.160
dutifully, do my job, show up

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160
dutyfully.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160
You asked me these questions and then

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.160
you just, you're Schrabbing me, man.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.160
Solid.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.160
If I do that

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160
and then I come home

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.160
and I can support

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.160
a partner. Yes.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.160
Offspring. I mean, this, that's where

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.160
everything comes into play. A livable wage

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.160
at the poop tank. Well, but does that really

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160
mean it's just livable wage because we

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.160
change the goalpost. You're not going to be

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.160
living high on the hog. You're going to be

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.160
making poop tank money.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.160
But I can have a Christmas where my kids

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.160
don't cry because maybe they got, they got

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.160
the Optimus Prime, the Bumblebee.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.160
I think it, I think it depends on how much

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.160
poop comes in that year. I mean, I think I think it's

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.160
it's open to the

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.160
there's the question of poop economy. There's the question

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.160
of upward mobility and retirement. I mean

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.160
I might guarantee to be able

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.160
to clean that poop tank for 30 years

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.160
or am I a sucker if I do it for 20 and

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.160
then they tell me they, oh, we invented a poop cleaning

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.160
robot. You're fucked. I'm talking a steady

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.160
a steady union wage poop tank

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
job that you're never going to be rich

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160
but you will always put bread

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.160
on the table. I would

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.160
I would, I would, I would be very, I think I would

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.160
take that if, but

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.160
I mean that is making a lot of assumptions about

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.160
like, yeah, I would, I would, I would, I would want

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160
to try that

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.160
if that really, if I really

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.160
had a, had a guarantee of like

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.160
you, I can just do this every day

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.160
and there's a certain amount of years I can do

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160
it where I get the pocket watch and the pension

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160
and blah, blah, blah. But by the way, that's a myth

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.160
now. That's the problem is that people are waking up

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.160
to is that you can't, you can't do that anymore

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.160
so I have to emphasize that, that, that's

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.160
actually kind of a weird blue sky universe

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.160
where you could do that. That's like some Lego

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160
world where you're like, I'm a poop cleaning guy

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160
and I, I could do that. That's the problem is

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.160
that then Flint, Michigan goes like, no, fuck you, you

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.160
don't make cars anymore and like, like, like, like, and people are

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160
like, what do you mean? I was a compliment.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.160
We're always going to have to clean poop tanks. Poops

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.160
like, that's always going to happen. We're having two different

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.160
conversations here.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.160
Because, because the reality

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.160
is like, if there's like the blue sky

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.160
with all these like, like, trigon, trigonometric

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.160
like, uh, uh,

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
sort of like, like, like everything being equal

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.160
just so we can focus on the thing I would

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160
choose. But then there's, if we were just

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.160
living in reality, how I understand

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160
this country to, to, to operate

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.160
and, and how things are going, I

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.160
would, I would choose the crime

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.160
job because I know that the poop tank

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.160
job is going to be

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.160
very much, very

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160
similar to living in prison.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.160
Like, like, like, like where I am only just

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.160
working to stay out of trouble and I'm only

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.160
getting enough money to, to stay

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.160
in debt. And, and that, and that I'm not

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160
going to be able to support my kids eventually.

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:03.160
Something's, there's going to be curveballs thrown

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.160
and I'm going to be told to go fuck myself.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.160
Like, I, knowing that that's going to happen

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160
because we've dropped those,

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.160
like there's no guarantees. And I'm not saying, like, I'm not

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.160
being Michael Moran saying, like, we owe it to the

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.160
workforce to, not necessarily. I'm just

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.160
saying, like, like, like, knowing

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.160
as a subjective person that, that

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160
I don't think, I think the myth of retirement and

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.160
the myth of the, the, the, that, that

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.160
job is over. I would, I would, I would go, I'm

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.160
a smart guy. I could probably figure out how to

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.160
steal shit from people that deserve it to have

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.160
shit stolen from them. And, like, and, like,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.160
I'll, once, once I get caught and go

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.160
to jail, it'll be a lot like clean and shit

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.160
tanks. I feel like

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.160
that's, like, most criminals, right?

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.160
No, no criminals, like, I

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.160
want to, I want, I want to do this because

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.160
it's a bad thing. Right.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.160
They do it. They don't want to be a sucker.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.160
Yeah, they want to, like, welcome to the podcast

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:51.160
sympathetic criminals.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.160
I mean, but I don't, but I also

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.160
think there's a lot of, like, terrible people,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.160
sociopaths that go like, well, I mean, I

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.160
think, I think we're severely lacking too

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.160
in our national psyche in terms of, like, you

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.160
know, we don't know, it's, it's, it's

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.160
a, it's a syndrome. It's the whole thing.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.160
Like, there is no, there is no signal

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.160
of this is what integrity is sent

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160
down from the top. There's no, it starts

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.160
with the, you look up above you and you

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.160
see people are greedy and horrible and they

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.160
get away with whatever the fuck they want, and

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.160
then, and they don't, they don't, they don't

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.160
make any profits and they don't, they don't

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.160
make any promises that they can keep and

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.160
so you go, like, I don't want, it doesn't

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.160
start with, like, I'm so mad and I'm going

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.160
to get mine. It starts with, I don't want to be

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.160
a sucker. I don't want to, like, do this for

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.160
15 years and then get fucked over, like, so

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.160
you go, somebody goes, like, hey, I, I

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:37.160
could, I could, you know, if you take this

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.160
off the top, you can sell it and, like,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.160
your family can get a thing, like, I

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.160
basically was all on movies. I don't know

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.160
what the actual, but I'll, but also just

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.160
a kind of common sense. I think that's

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.160
still on anything. Oh, all the time.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.160
I never stop.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.160
For real.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.160
You hear about that, uh,

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.160
Shine Jane glass? Oh, yeah.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.160
That was you all along? Oh, yeah.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.160
You, you, you never shoplifted

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.160
or boosted anything in your life? I mean,

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.160
I don't know. I think I've taken a couple

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.160
candy bars. As far as people I talk to

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160
in general, people have shoplifted

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.160
a lot more than I have, uh,

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.160
because it's, like, a weird thing. They

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.160
say you do it until you get caught, but

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.160
I've only done, like, five times.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.160
I didn't, I didn't tell my

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.160
mom caught me and I was like, do you know

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.160
what you're doing? And I was like, well,

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.160
I'm taking candy. Like, they have so much

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.160
of it. And she was like, if everyone

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.160
took candy, there wouldn't be candy. They'd

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.160
have to raise the prices of the candy. And

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.160
also, yeah. And I was like, oh, I didn't, I

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160
never got, like, shamed for it. I got caught,

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.160
like, I got caught, like, with, with, like,

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.160
I think it was, like, a thousand dollars

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.160
of sunglasses. But it was, like,

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.160
it was, like, it was, like,

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.160
that phase, it was, like, that phase in

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.160
high school where, like, I just had, like,

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.160
yeah.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160
It was even, like, sunglasses I wanted.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.160
It was an open, I was with my friends

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
and it was an open thing and we were just,

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.160
like, oh, we, this is, we have this power.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.160
Right. And it's, like, for the first time

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.160
in your life, you have access to,

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.160
uh, uh, like,

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.160
social capital. Right. And, and it's,

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.160
it feels like you, you figured out

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.160
a secret path. Yeah. So you took them?

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.160
Yeah. And then I got caught.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.160
And then they, they bring you to the back room.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.160
Well, a thousand dollars, that's grand theft.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.160
I know, I got a, were you over 18

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.160
or under 18? I, I, I, I, like, I, like,

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.160
cried a lot and, and they left. Were you

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.160
over or under 18 years old? Uh, under.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.160
I think it was under. Yeah. No, no, no,

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.160
I was, I think I'm over. Yeah, you can do time

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.160
for that shit, man. Whew.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.160
Yeah, I was lucky. Uh, I got,

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.160
I, I got caught stealing

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.160
when I was five.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160
Um, I saw.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.160
I didn't trust you. I mean,

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.160
what's that, what's that?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.160
Cause it's just a

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.160
thing about, man. When I was, when I was five

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160
they were, I was supposed to pick up two keys

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160
of, of, of cratum.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.160
At the loading

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.160
docks. Motherfuckers

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.160
stepped on it.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.160
I took a toot. I knew what

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.160
was going on. I had to jack them.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.160
Marina style.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.160
That's great. So there was, there was

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.160
massage involved. Cause I felt bad for him

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.160
afterwards.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.160
Wait, there was a massage based

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.160
crime? Yeah. She can kill you

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.160
with a massage. If you, if she, if she can

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.160
heal pain, she can cause it. She's like a cleric.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.160
I can make you throw it. Yes. There you go. Yeah.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.160
Totally. It's a spot.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.160
Uh, yeah.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.160
I approve of that joke.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.160
That's her approved. I

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.160
had taken a teddy bear to the grocery store

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.160
um, and stole

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.160
a five pound bag of jelly

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.160
beans because I was very ambitious

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.160
and also economic.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.160
What if the teddy bear never came back into the story?

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.160
Use it. You took a teddy bear

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.160
to the grocery store. It was just my teddy bear

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.160
and I hid the bag behind

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.160
behind the bear against my chest

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160
and I made it. I got out

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160
and went home and

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.160
went into, I had this sesame

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.160
street tent in my bedroom

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.160
and I, but I just had no patience

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160
so I opened the bag and started eating him

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160
and I didn't realize this, but I left

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.160
like a trail of jelly beans

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
leading to the tent.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.160
So my parents found me

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.160
and they told, they made me go back

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.160
to the store after giving me

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.160
a long lecture about how I had tarnished

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.160
the family name

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.160
and

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.160
just dragged it through

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.160
the mud and we lived in a very small

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.160
I grew up in a fishing village

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.160
and so everybody knew everybody.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.160
That's why your name is Marina.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.160
She is Wonder Woman.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.160
It actually is.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.160
So um,

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.160
I had to apologize

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.160
for that and my parents had

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160
weird ways of teaching me

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.160
moral lessons. When I was

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.160
about the same age, we went

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.160
to New York and I saw

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.160
a little person

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.160
for the first time in my life. I didn't think

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.160
he was real. I thought he was a puppet

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.160
that somebody had just

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.160
ingeniously designed to

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.160
walk on its own so I

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.160
just was just, he had a little

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.160
suit and a little briefcase.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.160
And so

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.160
I was just

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.160
marveling over this mechanical

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.160
man to

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.160
my brother just, you know, making a scene

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
and

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.160
my mom made me

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160
get up off the subway seat

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.160
and offer my seat to him even though

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.160
he already had a seat of his own.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.160
Yeah, but take

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160
hers.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.160
All the more delicious for your tiny buttocks.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.160
These are

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.160
padded with revenge.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.160
We have a family name

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.160
to protect you.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.160
What is your family's name?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.160
Jesus Christ.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.160
We can't drag

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.160
the name of McGillicuddy

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.160
through this sort of film.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.160
It was Eller, but that's

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.160
nobody.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.160
Yeah, I mean,

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.160
no.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.160
It went all the way to robot right away.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.160
It was

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.160
the only thing that made sense.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160
I didn't know this was a thing

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.160
and I just had to

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.160
figure out how it worked.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.160
There was a guy

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.160
in South Milwaukee

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.160
God damn it, what was his name?

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.160
It was a robot.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.160
No, there was a,

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160
my grandma would go, do you want to go

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.160
damn it, what was his name?

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.160
It was something,

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.160
but it was a title.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.160
Do you want to go to this McDonald's?

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.160
It was McDonald's in South Milwaukee.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.160
He's the brownie, right?

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.160
Oh, Billy the brownie.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.160
I was

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.160
scared shitless by

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.160
the concept of little anything

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.160
when I was a kid.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.160
I had nightmares about

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.160
marionette puppets

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.160
and regular puppets and just anything

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160
small.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.160
I just thought it was trying to kill me.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.160
Dolls and things.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.160
I just terrified of all of them.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.160
There was a guy named Billy the brownie

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.160
that hung out at the McDonald's.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.160
My grandma would make it seem like

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.160
he was part of the McDonald's mythos,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.160
but he wasn't.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.160
As I grew older,

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.160
I was like, wait, I had a right to be freaked out.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.160
There's no Billy the brownie in these commercials.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.160
This was just a fucking dude.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160
In that

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.160
Sutherland movie.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.160
Mesh?

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.160
No,

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.160
don't look now.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.160
Google don't look now.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.160
It's a 70's

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.160
thriller horror movie.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.160
But it was like

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.160
he was just a guy

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.160
that was there and he would dress as a brownie

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.160
and he would come to your table and talk to you.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.160
Like the dessert or the fairy?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160
The fairy.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.160
Oh, yeah, like the fairy.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160
I didn't clarify that.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.160
I mean, she would, yeah, Billy the brownie,

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.160
like the little person.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.160
He was a little person and he would dress like a...

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.160
No, he wouldn't dress like a brownie.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.160
My grandma maybe just called him Billy the brownie.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.160
It sounds like she created this whole thing.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.160
I don't think he didn't dress like a fucking Renfairee.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.160
I think it was just a dude

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.160
that was trying to maybe have his breakfast.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.160
He could have been a truck driver.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.160
So your grandma called him Billy the brownie.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.160
Yeah, and I'm realizing

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.160
maybe me and Billy the brownie

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.160
were both being abused by my grandma.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.160
Like put into a can like two wasps

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.160
and just shaken.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.160
Like, hey, here, talk to him.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.160
He's Billy the brownie and I'm like, what the fuck?

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.160
And he's like, what the fuck?

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.160
I never...

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.160
Yeah, I was real scared of Billy the brownie.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.160
And there was a...

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.160
There was a marionette doll

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.160
that my mom had in the closet

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.160
that she called Clemens C. Clemens

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.160
who had this weird...

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160
It was like paper mache

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.160
but hardened.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160
It was like this little guy had

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.160
a little straw hat on

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.160
and it's just like all fucked up.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.160
And she'd bring it out once in a while

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.160
and be like, oh, it's Clemens C. Clemens.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.160
And I go, get it out! Get it away!

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.160
It's a fucking horrific,

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.160
horrible little murderer.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.160
It was like Freddy Krueger

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.160
looking thing with strings

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160
coming out of every joint.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.160
It was like controlling it.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:11.160
It was like everything about it.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.160
It was fucking terrifying.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.160
And then she'd like, oh, it's okay, okay, okay.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.160
You're pushing him, putting it back in the Tupperware container

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.160
and putting it in the closet.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.160
Like, yeah, the closet across from my bedroom.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.160
Like, I now know...

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.160
Clemens C. Clemens is just in there.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.160
Like, thinking about me.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:29.160
Yeah, he knows that I'm the one

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160
like, okay, Clemens C. Clemens,

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160
Daniel doesn't like you.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.160
You guys, you gotta go back to sleep

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.160
in this plastic container

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.160
across from his bed.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160
Does he have a backstory?

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.160
Was that like a hobby of hers?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.160
I don't know if my mom made it now.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.160
Is it Clemens C. or Clemens C.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160
Oh, Clemens C. Clemens.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160
Oh, God, yeah.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.160
It's like a New Line cinemas, like, horror movie.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160
Like, it's like...

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.160
Oh, it's Clemens C. Clemens.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.160
Like, he got Clemens C.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160
For his Tupperware.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160
For his horrible murders.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160
You're still waiting for that pardon.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.160
I'm curious about Clemens C. Clemens.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.160
I'm picturing the closet and the Tupperware.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.160
Oh, we all will.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.160
Yeah, and I used to have...

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.160
I had nightmares.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160
I had recurring nightmares about a character

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.160
that was like a little puppet that was like...

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160
I guess it was because of Mr. Rogers.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.160
He had, like, the little puppet characters.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.160
And I, like, the boomerang lady.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.160
That was scary.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.160
Boomerang lady?

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.160
Yeah, there was a version of her

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.160
in my nightmares that was always tormenting me.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.160
Well, I had a...

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.160
I always had a recurring nightmare

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.160
where I'd be like...

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.160
It would be like, you know,

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.160
it was like a black background

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.160
with only just, like, well-lit fog

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.160
on the ground, you know?

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Like, one of those dreamscapes.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.160
And it's midnight, and I know it's midnight

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160
because there's this Muppet-style grandfather clock.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.160
And he strikes midnight.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.160
And when he strikes midnight,

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.160
he shoots arrows into my body.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160
Oh, my God!

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160
And I get struck by 12 arrows.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.160
It was a recurring nightmare I had.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.160
Dealing 20 damage.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.160
I was just gonna say that.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.160
Yeah.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.160
It was a critical hit.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.160
Respectfully, Loud Guy is raising his hand.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.160
Yeah!

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.160
I have another question.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.160
Okay, all right.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.160
I don't know. Your last one got us somewhere.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.160
I don't know about that.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.160
Doug Philburn from The Post?

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.160
Yeah, I had another question.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.160
There's a plane, and the plane crashes

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.160
on a deserted island.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.160
And everyone survives.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.160
Now you're on an island with 165 people.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.160
And Sir Dan Harmon,

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160
they look to you as the leader.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.160
Because Seth Rogen's not on the flight?

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160
Yeah.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.160
So now, like,

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.160
so now you have to create a civilization, right?

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.160
Like, so what does that government look like?

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.160
And one thing I was thinking...

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160
The plane happens to crash on a desert island?

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.160
Think of the odds of that.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.160
What?

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.160
Oh, you get washed up.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.160
What if that island was on the moon?

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.160
Like the premise of Harmontown.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.160
Right.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160
Yeah, I don't know.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.160
I mean, I...

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.160
What does someone have to do to get banished?

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.160
Like, how does like a punishment system work?

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160
Like, what if someone's being a real dick?

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.160
But there's only 165 people on this island.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.160
How many are there of us tonight here?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.160
Well, they easily...

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.160
Well, the easy thing is

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.160
what if someone's being a real dick?

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.160
That's the whole problem

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.160
with the justice system of any government

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.160
is that we always conceive of, like,

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.160
what if someone's being a real dick?

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.160
And then we go like, okay, well, if that happens,

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.160
then we'll do this to them.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.160
And then we wait for someone to be a real dick.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.160
And then we do that to them.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.160
And that's about 1% of the cases.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.160
And the rest of it is like, well,

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.160
I was hungry, I needed bread,

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160
but I didn't mean it. I thought it was mine and all this shit.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.160
And then everyone's calling each other

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.160
being a real dick, and you're still using the same

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.160
mentality. That's like,

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160
I guess I would try to figure out beforehand.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.160
I mean,

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.160
like, when we start our Moon colony,

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160
I'm just going to bring, like,

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.160
only beta people.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.160
They're going to be screamed for the inability

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.160
to

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.160
to aggress

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.160
so that we can all just like...

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160
Because we had a fun experience where we were shuffling around.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.160
What was it, Montreal?

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.160
Oh, beta, yeah.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.160
Yeah, we were the beta tribe.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.160
Jeff got peeled off somehow.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.160
Otherwise Jeff would be making all the decisions

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.160
and we would be tumbleweeds and stuff.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.160
There was mounting things of stress.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.160
It's like, we don't know what we're doing.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.160
We don't know what we're doing.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.160
Cody has confided to me in the past.

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.160
Sometimes I'll try to do a little baby

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.160
when I'm walking around with her

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.160
without realizing it.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.160
And then sometimes she'll be doing that to me.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.160
Because there's usually

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.160
a group that's like, you know,

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.160
just more comfortable having opinions

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160
and let's go here, let's go there.

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.160
We just happened to be with a group

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.160
of like five or six people and none of them were

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.160
that person.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.160
And we were just kind of drifted for a while,

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160
like a garbage bag in American beauty.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.160
But we were still...

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.160
There was still cohesion and then there was

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.160
mounting points of frustration where you could just

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.160
almost feel like...

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.160
Spencer was doing the opposite of a shark

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.160
where he was circling the idea of leaving.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.160
Like Spencer would just start

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160
getting more and more distant.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.160
But then he'd come back

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.160
and we eventually

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160
started making random decisions and we had

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:29.160
a really nice dinner in that one restaurant

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.160
or a lunch or something.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.160
I don't remember.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.160
What? It was nice.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.160
It was really nice.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.160
I just don't know, man,

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.160
because the thing is people

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.160
are monsters.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.160
They'll

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160
kind of like...

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.160
I don't know. I don't even know

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.160
if I believe in people anymore.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.160
I have a riddle for you about

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.160
how to tell if you're a serial killer

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.160
or if you could become a serial killer.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.160
Maybe it'll restore your...

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160
Sorry.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.160
Continue.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160
Awesome.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160
The doctor was a woman.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.160
What's the...

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.160
Any of you guys, let's see

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.160
who here has the mind of a serial killer.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:15.160
If you can answer this riddle,

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.160
then you have the mind of a serial killer.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.160
Regardless of whether or not

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.160
you already have a body count.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.160
That's a good point.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.160
If you're just a really stupid serial killer,

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.160
you get off scot-free.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.160
But if you're stupid,

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.160
you'd think you'd get caught, though.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.160
You could just be a killer, though.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.160
What if you're a really cowardly one?

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.160
That freaks me out all the time.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.160
The only thing standing between

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.160
a person and being a serial killer

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.160
is that they're just a chicken shit.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160
I feel like that person

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160
if they could do bad shit

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.160
and get away with it, they would.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.160
If I had a boat, you'd all be dead.

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.160
You gotta have a boat.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.160
You gotta have a boat.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.160
I would never hurt anybody

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.160
if I could get away with it.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160
I truly believe that.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.160
At the same time, and I think that's most of us,

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.160
and the weird thing is

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160
we spend most of our energy

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.160
and not have to think about

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.160
how we're hurting people without thinking about it.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.160
You know what I mean?

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.160
That's the biggest...

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.160
That's how we make the trains run our time.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.160
That's an active killing.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.160
That's the whole thing, right?

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.160
Yeah.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.160
Well, no, I guess not.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.160
Yeah, active killing was...

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.160
That's an example of the fact that

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.160
as long as anybody up top

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.160
this is fine.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.160
If the people you're killing have a label on them,

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160
like communists, or terrorists,

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.160
or criminal, or murderer, or whatever,

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.160
and no one ever flips the game on you,

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.160
that you can actually

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.160
walk through life going like,

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.160
oh yeah, and then I did that thing

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.160
where I was an awesome person.

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.160
It was parentheses, chill.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.160
They keep on going to the same stories

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
because it's the thing they can't escape.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.160
Yeah, there's some weird thing

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.160
haunting them and eating away at them,

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.160
kind of an uplifting thing possibly

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.160
that maybe there is something in there.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.160
But anyways, I think the thing is

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.160
we try to make it as easy as possible.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.160
Spencer and I were talking about this.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.160
So dichotomy...

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.160
We talked about it all, man.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.160
Dichotomy is a crutch. That's the thing.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.160
Every single aspect of our society,

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.160
it always comes down

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.160
to some choice between one or two things.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160
The big thing is obviously

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.160
the candidacy right now of the elections,

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.160
throughout our lives,

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.160
you're left and right and we're going to...

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.160
Every comment section is like,

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.160
you're either one of these or one of those.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.160
That is actually an expression

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160
of en masse laziness

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.160
because if you only have

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.160
to choose whether you're

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.160
this or that,

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:51.160
you save so much fucking time

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.160
having to think every second

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:55.160
like, what am I? Who am I? How do I feel?

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.160
If you just go like,

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.160
oh, I don't want to be like that.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160
I'm not one of those.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.160
Now you're just hanging out.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.160
You're like, well, I'm a liberal,

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.160
so I have six hours to play Minecraft.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.160
Because if there was no word

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.160
for liberal or conservative,

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.160
then I would have to spend that six hours

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.160
going like, yeah, but what about my neighbor?

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.160
What about my neighbor's daughter?

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.160
What about that homeless guy in the corner?

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.160
It's the same reason like

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.160
writing in films and TV

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.160
are so shitty, like

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.160
diversity-wise, because it's hard.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160
It's just harder to

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.160
get fine people of color because

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.160
there's no infrastructure.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.160
I blame casting agencies.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.160
Well, diversity is difficult, right?

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160
And the first thing, the first way

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.160
that we tackle diversity is we break that

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.160
into an economy. We go white or colorful.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160
And then we'll

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:47.160
And it's not necessarily that

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.160
people are racist, racist.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.160
It's not necessarily that all casting directors

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.160
hate black people.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.160
All casting directors like

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.160
to go home early.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.160
We told casting directors for 80 years

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.160
now, we told them

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.160
they better get good

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.160
at sorting

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.160
human beings, like documents

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.160
in a filing cabinet or coats in a rack, or they're

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160
fired. If I can't call my casting

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.160
director and go, I need a six foot five

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.160
black guy with a lazy eye.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.160
That's not like in 1983,

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.160
the person that can do that is like

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160
a better casting director. Now all of a sudden

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160
it's like, no, we're

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.160
going to engage in the fucking unpredictable

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160
nuances of humanity.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.160
They're like, does that include me?

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.160
Because I'm like a dentist

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.160
for people, like each tooth is

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.160
a person on your cast.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.160
It is like that

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.160
particularly. You want them all

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.160
to be really white.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.160
Yeah, by default.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.160
You got that

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.160
one kind of weird brown tooth.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160
Yeah, white and straight.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
And they're certainly pretty scumbled into a pretty good metaphor.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.160
It's like all different shaped white

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.160
people.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.160
You got your Paul Giamatti who

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:59.160
grinds the food.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160
You got your Paul Rudd in front

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.160
who's just biting it and

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.160
you know.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160
Yeah,

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.160
anyways, I got

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.160
sidetracked by that, but I kind of like simultaneously

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:13.160
What's the serial killer riddle?

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160
Ooh, okay, alright.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160
Because you're either a serial killer

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.160
or you're not. That's the dichotomies.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.160
Dichotomies, yeah.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.160
Alright, so there's a funeral.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.160
A woman goes to a funeral

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.160
for her mother.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.160
And when she's there, she meets

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.160
this amazing guy.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.160
He's just the guy, the man of her dreams.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160
She's instantly in love with him

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.160
and she really wants to see him again.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160
They have a great time at the reception

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.160
somehow despite the fact that it's her mother's funeral.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.160
But they don't

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.160
exchange contact info.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160
And

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.160
a week later, her sister dies.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.160
Why?

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.160
If you can answer that,

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.160
then you can think like a serial killer.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.160
She goes home and kills her sister.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.160
So, thank you, Tom.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.160
He's heard this riddle.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.160
Why is there a stranger at her mom's funeral?

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.160
That's

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.160
part of it.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.160
That's part of it.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.160
Ooh.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.160
If the dude's at the mom's funeral,

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.160
he's probably going to be at the sister's funeral.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.160
Good job. You got it.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.160
Well, they estimate that

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160
up to 25% of Americans

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.160
are sociopaths.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.160
But sociopaths aren't

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.160
psychopaths.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:29.160
That's different. There's a difference.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.160
And there's also a very big spectrum.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.160
One, two, three, four.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.160
25%

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.160
are sociopaths.

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.160
I don't know.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.160
If you're a sociopath,

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.160
you could probably take us all out

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.160
if you banded together.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.160
Just think of that.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:49.160
If you kill somebody's sister to meet her at

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.160
a funeral,

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.160
you might be a sociopath.

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.160
Yeah.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:59.160
If we're going to have a show

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.160
where everybody can talk whenever they want,

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.160
you guys have to

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.160
let each other talk, too.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.160
You can't just talk over each other.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.160
Then I get confused. You're all sociopaths.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.160
Like, what the fuck is going on?

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.160
Everyone's just talking at the same time.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.160
Oh,

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.160
Dan took a dark turn.

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.160
I guess he...

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.160
No, my heart bleeds for everybody

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.160
who's like, I have a little piece of information

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.160
I'd like to share, and then everyone's like,

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.160
I'm going to do a bit.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.160
Another question.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.160
Yeah.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.160
Doug...

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.160
Doug from the post has another question.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.160
What's your next question, Doug?

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.160
Could you walk us through a day

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.160
when Spencer

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.160
and Jeff woke up in each other's bodies?

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.160
The question is, could Dan walk

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.160
all of us... Are you just like pitching

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:55.160
like, spec scripts now?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.160
It sounds like some weird slash shit.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.160
Can Dan pitch

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.160
a day where Spencer and I

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.160
are in each other's bodies?

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.160
I mean, that happened in Montreal.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.160
I tell you, it was...

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.160
I was inside Spencer,

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.160
but I wouldn't say I was...

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.160
Inside his body?

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.160
Part of me was inside Spencer's body.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.160
Look, I was fucking...

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.160
and I mean fucking Spencer.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.160
He was fucking me.

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.160
I mean fucking me.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.160
I don't know.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.160
Well, I think the important thing to answer your question

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.160
would be, is the

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.160
first quarter

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.160
of the story before that happens,

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.160
because that would happen at the threshold.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.160
Because first you have to establish

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.160
that Jeff is like

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.160
very into his clothes

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.160
and that he doesn't have time

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.160
for

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.160
dice.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.160
And that Spencer loves...

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.160
I've got no time for dice.

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.160
Loves dice, but doesn't care about clothes.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.160
And then there's like a magic die

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:59.160
or something, and they're both

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.160
trying to grab it, and they go like,

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.160
you have it better than me.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.160
And then I would just be like,

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.160
you know, another 20 minutes

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.160
of them going like, holy shit,

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.160
well, I guess we...

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.160
We don't have time to figure out how to fix this

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.160
because I have a dice convention to go to.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.160
But you have to go for me

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.160
because you're in my body.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:21.160
If I woke up in Spencer's body and go,

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.160
oh, I have to go make it through my day

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.160
and I am in Spencer's body,

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.160
I think that would be pretty easy.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.160
I think that...

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.160
This is way easier than having

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.160
to go to the dry cleaners

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.160
and pick up a suit.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.160
Would you...

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.160
If you were in Spencer's body, would you

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.160
go and find a suit, though?

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.160
No, I think what I would do is

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.160
luxuriate in not having to wear a suit.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.160
It's like suit vacation.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.160
Yeah.

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.160
I mean, that's the name of the movie.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.160
It's suit vacation.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160
It might be called

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.160
die and tie.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.160
Die and tie.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:01.160
But meanwhile, Spencer would be going...

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.160
Well, I mean, it depends

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.160
because in the Switcheroo movie,

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.160
you've got to have the scene where

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.160
you

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.160
have to go

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160
dungeon master.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160
I would go, oh, I'm Spencer.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.160
I look in the mirror and I go, oh my god,

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.160
I'm Spencer.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.160
I look like Spencer.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.160
My suits aren't going to fit anymore.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.160
We're different body shapes.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.160
I have to get to this thing.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.160
I only have Spencer clothes.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.160
Exactly. Well, that'd be pretty easy

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.160
compared to the other fans.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.160
But Spencer, like, if you woke up

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.160
and you were me, you would say, oh,

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.160
shit, like, I mean, you could

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.160
put on cargo shorts and a

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.160
t-shirt. Oh, yeah, you can rock those.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.160
We know this.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.160
Would you wear a suit?

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:49.160
Would you go into my closet and go,

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.160
I'll cosplay as Jeff Davis? So do we start

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.160
in each other's houses?

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.160
Let's just say yes.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.160
Okay. Let's say

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.160
that's accessible.

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.160
You wake up in each other's bodies.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.160
That's one of those, like Blake Edwards

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.160
switched, or whatever, with Jimmy

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.160
Smith's and Helen Parkin. It's like Freaky Friday.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.160
Exactly.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.160
Well, yeah, you wake up. So you wake up

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.160
in Jeff's apartment in Jeff's body.

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.160
Okay. And you're naked. You wake up

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.160
in Spencer's apartment. Well, first off,

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160
I immediately start jerking off.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.160
I'd kill myself.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.160
Because you've got to go, like,

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.160
what is, what is Spencer?

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.160
It's like a split screen as you both come.

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:29.160
It's like an anime,

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.160
like, oh!

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.160
Like a two-man Voltron.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.160
So then you're done coming,

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.160
and now you go to the,

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.160
there's like a, you go to the closet,

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.160
you open the closet, and like,

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.160
like, clean up the,

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.160
clean up the, you clean up the,

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.160
it's someone else's body.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.160
Yeah. It's not my

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.160
responsibility.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:53.160
Yeah. Yeah.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:55.160
It's not my department anymore.

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.160
Yeah.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.160
All right.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.160
So I wake up in Spencer's place.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.160
I'm looking around, and I go, okay, oh, I'm naked.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.160
I just jerked off.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.160
Came all over Spencer's bedroom.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.160
All I got is Spencer clothes.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.160
So I'm going to dress in Spencer clothes.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.160
I don't think I'd go right out and start buying suits

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.160
that fit Spencer's body.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.160
I think I'd just go, fuck it, I'm Spencer.

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.160
Nice.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.160
What would you, would you be Spencer,

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.160
Spencer's body?

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.160
Well, do I still have the will and the volition

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.160
that I have?

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.160
Yeah. No, I mean, I guess I would start having

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:31.160
to make some decisions of like, who,

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.160
what is a physical Jeff Davis?

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.160
Like, is it Jeff Davis only about,

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.160
like, caring about his clothes and his hair,

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.160
or is it like, growing a beard all of a sudden?

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.160
I mean, there has to be, you have to,

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.160
first you have to come up with like,

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.160
it's a tough movie to break.

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:47.160
It's a good question.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.160
It's high risk, low reward,

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:51.160
because it's going to end up with a

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.160
skateboard chase and like,

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.160
it's just not going to matter.

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.160
Which one of us doesn't

01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.160
isn't comfortable with a skateboard?

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.160
It's going to be a forced arc because

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.160
like, it's not, because a body switching

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.160
movie, again, to support our point about

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.160
dichotomy being a crutch for like a lazy

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.160
psyche, it's like, oh, yeah,

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.160
of course, if you just take Jody Foster

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.160
and whoever her mom was, like,

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.160
like you, you, you swap them, then you

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.160
automatically have to reduce each character

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:19.160
and like, I'm neat, she's there

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.160
for a sloppy, like, etc, you know.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.160
Well, fuck it, you become Jeff,

01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.160
Jeff becomes Spencer and Spencer becomes you.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.160
Now it's not a dichotomy, it's a tricon.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.160
Yeah, we just solve, now the movie

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.160
just follows. When did Doug get the fucking conch

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.160
on this fucking thing?

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.160
I wanted to hear what you were saying about

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.160
the socio pass, she was talking about

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.160
like the, the, the, she said,

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:41.160
25% of Americans are socio pass.

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:43.160
I have one question there,

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:45.160
which is, is it just America?

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.160
Or was it, okay, that's just where they did

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.160
the study, or did they, do they know for

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.160
fact that other countries have a much

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.160
lower socio pass?

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.160
Japan was like up to 3%.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.160
No way.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.160
What?

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.160
Now, are we relying on each country?

01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.160
Oh man.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.160
Are we, the socio pass next door?

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.160
For those of you who want to research,

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.160
we'll, we'll, we'll touch base again,

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.160
it's like, it's like,

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.160
what was the, the show with

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.160
Cosby, the, the magic pen, the

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.160
picture pages. Yes, yes.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.160
I forgot, and then I was like, Cosby,

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.160
really? Okay.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.160
But, but,

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.160
I just, I just give a magic like,

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.160
if everybody, if everybody gets together

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.160
and they go, let's figure out how many socio pass

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.160
each country has, and then they just go like,

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.160
okay, Japan, let us know, and then they come

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.160
back and they go, 3%.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160
And you're like,

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160
all right.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.160
So, so buying little girls panties out of

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.160
a vending machine must really just

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.160
sate that thirst, like,

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.160
so, so you don't become a socio path?

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.160
No, yeah, so that's, that's the thing.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160
Apple a day, dot, dot, dot.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160
Oh, what, what kind of figures did you guys

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.160
come up with? Yeah, fuck you.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.160
Suspensive, you wake up at my place, do you,

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.160
do you, would you, would you

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.160
go like, oh fuck, I'm going to try on one of these suits,

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.160
or do you go fuck this shit, I'm going to go right

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160
to this movie? You guys love this movie?

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.160
No. Hey,

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.160
I do not. This is not my question.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.160
Or do you say who stole my beard?

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.160
No, I would get in contact with me.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.160
That's the first thing, that's the thing.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.160
Of course you guys would call each other. Yeah, that's what I'd do.

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:21.160
I'd be like, hey, what do we do?

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.160
What do we do with this? My first question

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.160
was, did you just jerk off? Like, I just jerk off?

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.160
Because you sound sleepy.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:29.160
But it's 10am.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.160
And if I know my body.

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.160
Also, yes, somebody

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160
just tried to change my password on my computer.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:39.160
All right, but anyway,

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:41.160
25% of Americans

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.160
are sociopaths.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160
25% of men

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.160
in federal prison.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.160
Wait, what?

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.160
Do you know this guy?

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.160
I just googled it.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160
25% of the general population,

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.160
25% of men in prison.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.160
In your face, Japan.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.160
Yeah.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.160
Although,

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160
70% of our population

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160
is in prison. No, I mean, seriously,

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160
don't we have like a quarter of our fucking

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.160
well, we have the quarter of the world's

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:15.160
prison population, right? That's the statistic?

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:17.160
Yeah, it's the biggest corporation.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.160
It's the McDonald's of America.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.160
Yeah, because it's like,

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.160
So is McDonald's. Or the McDonald's of America.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.160
It's an easy way to define poverty.

01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.160
It's just to go like, oh, yeah, it's

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.160
illegal to be poor. So I have to, yeah, just go

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.160
in here. Because God forbid we'd ever say

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:33.160
we were socialists, in which case you'd go like,

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.160
oh, you're not very good at capitalism.

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.160
You should get a place to live until you figure it out.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.160
Well, until you get good at it,

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.160
here's three meals a day, we go like,

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.160
well, why don't we wait until you beat someone up

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.160
with a pool cue, then we'll bang a gavel

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.160
and yell at you and give you a free home.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.160
It's wait until you,

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.160
until you

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.160
bring your weed outside,

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.160
or rescue for the rest of your life.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.160
And our life.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:59.160
If you're black, sorry.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.160
Yeah, I do that just fine.

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.160
And I'm shady as fuck.

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.160
You stole those candy bars once?

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:09.160
Yeah, man.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.160
Just to be clear, you know,

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.160
I stole a lot less bad shit than any of you guys.

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.160
I'm the best person

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.160
off this stage.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.160
Wait, wait, wait, how many candy bars?

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.160
What's the going exchange?

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160
Why do you guys steal so many candy bars?

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.160
Why don't we steal glasses?

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.160
Yeah, why don't we just steal glasses?

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.160
That's the real value proposition.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160
Also, Spencer, how old were you

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.160
when you stole the candy bars?

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.160
Well, you know, like, 14, 15?

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.160
Well, they, sir.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.160
Good age.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.160
Nimble fingers.

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:43.160
I used to go steal shit that I didn't even want.

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:45.160
I would just walk into a

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.160
department store and just take shit that I didn't even want.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160
And it was just about the game of

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.160
can I, can I walk

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.160
and look you in the eyes of the clerk

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.160
and walk out with a shit that I'd like.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.160
I'd just pick shit up right in front of you and go,

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.160
and walk out.

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.160
And it's like, nobody expects it.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.160
That's true.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.160
I just want to say, because we're

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:07.160
in the, we've come to the end

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.160
of our time.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.160
And I did want to say, because we touched on this

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160
darkness of, like, society

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.160
in general, like, and it's

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.160
an election year, or 100 days or something

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.160
from the fucking... It's huge, it's huge.

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:21.160
My therapist told me, she said,

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.160
like, there's, you know,

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.160
the suicide rate goes up, the domestic

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.160
violence rate goes up. Like, we in general,

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.160
like, we do, for better or for worse,

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.160
Americans, I think this is our purge.

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.160
Every four years, like, an anarchist

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.160
would say, yeah, every four

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:37.160
years we vent everyone's

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.160
feeling of needing

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.160
to be in control of society by giving

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.160
them the illusion they can change society by pulling

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.160
a lever on a curtain booth.

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.160
But that's the cynical way of saying it.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.160
Another way of saying it is, like, every four years

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.160
we have this immense responsibility on us

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.160
and...

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.160
Which side am I on?

01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.160
The side where I go...

01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.160
No, that's just

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.160
the side that requires more reading.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.160
But

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.160
in any case,

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.160
it's every four years,

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.160
according to my therapist, like,

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.160
there is this rise in, like, craziness.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.160
Like, we all start to

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.160
feel it, and we're

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160
in constant contact with each other

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:19.160
on the internet, we're, like, painting this picture.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:21.160
I just want, you know,

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.160
to sort of mitigate that and say,

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.160
I think that the reason it gets

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.160
to us is because it still holds just as

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.160
true. I think that most of us

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.160
are pretty chill and probably

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.160
want the world to be great, and we're probably

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.160
willing to do a lot of stuff to make it great

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.160
and are really concerned that, like,

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.160
we're this parakeet in a mirror

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.160
that, like, they're looking at this stuff

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160
and we start obsessing about it. We go, like, how many...

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.160
And then we put on these weird carvel masks

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.160
in these comment sections, and all the

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.160
usernames are, like, flip-flop 69

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.160
and we're just going, like, these, like, fucking

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.160
weird, like, playing these Appalachian

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.160
characters, like, yelling at each other about

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:57.160
abortion clinics and stuff, but I think that

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.160
the silent majority are people that are fucking

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:01.160
moderate about everything and would just be, like,

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.160
like, would be able to have a fundamental

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.160
principle of, like, as long as nobody's getting hurt,

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:07.160
I'm okay with it, and, like,

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.160
I think that we inhale a lot

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.160
of secondhand smoke from the internet,

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.160
as she'd say, my therapist, like,

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.160
and that's all fine.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.160
No one has to walk away from it

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.160
or ignore any of it or think that any of it's

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.160
unimportant, but I, but the

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.160
message that none of us are getting

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.160
at this time

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.160
is the one that is right under our nose

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.160
and doesn't profit anybody,

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.160
doesn't make you click on anything,

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:33.160
doesn't pay anything, doesn't

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.160
get you riled up.

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.160
It's just the truth, which is that

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.160
we're, there's a whole bunch

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.160
of super cool people, like, like, being totally,

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.160
like, like, we just, we're

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.160
anxious about wishing

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.160
that the world could be a better place,

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.160
and, like, we're, we're,

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:51.160
we still, we are,

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.160
there's happiness possible,

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.160
some, so, somehow, some

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.160
way, like, we're not, it's not

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.160
the apocalypse yet, it just keeps seeming like it,

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.160
like, I think, I think we'll laugh at it

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.160
in the year 2040, I think

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.160
we'll go, remember, we kept thinking, like, it

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.160
felt like the end, like, I, I, I, I

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.160
will be like, Trump was great.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.160
He's not, he's not going to win.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.160
We all panicked, he seemed

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.160
like a douchebag, but it turns out, you know,

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.160
his foreign policy was right

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.160
on point. He solved

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.160
World Hunger. Or it turned out the president

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.160
didn't matter, we finally

01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.160
It doesn't matter, it doesn't fucking matter.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.160
We finally exited the age of fuck, we finally

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.160
was forced out of us by an elite ruling class

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.160
that are born politicians and die politicians

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:33.160
and pay themselves to do nothing

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.160
but pretend that everyone needs to be told

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.160
what to do like an animal, and we exited that age

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.160
and entered a proper age where we would go

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.160
like, those guys are civil servants, and they need

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.160
to either, this pageant needs to stop

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:45.160
where it's like, oh, who's the most

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.160
amazing world leader, like

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.160
the leader of the free world, it's like, fuck

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.160
you, who's going to, like, balance the budget

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.160
and, like, in the meantime, like, who's going to fill the potholes

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.160
on my street, and, you know,

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.160
and maybe we'll have some nice fish fries at our

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.160
local churches, and

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:01.160
bingo games, and, like, jump rope

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:03.160
competitions.

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.160
So for another pancake to the firehouse?

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.160
And maybe we'll, I think we can get back

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.160
to one mass shooting a year.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:11.160
Oh, yeah. I really do.

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.160
The 90's were so awesome,

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.160
it was like a, it was like Christmas,

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.160
the mass shooting was like, this crazy,

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.160
whoa, somebody shot, like, a million people

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.160
and, like, whoa!

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.160
My pitch is that we have, we only have one,

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.160
but it's like a huge one, like,

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.160
it's like, let's have a good mass shooting every year.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.160
They got to stop me in weekly, it's getting me,

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.160
getting me down.

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:33.160
It's getting you down?

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.160
I don't know.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.160
These mass shootings are kind

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.160
of, kind of crabbing your style.

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.160
Yeah.

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.160
Yeah, I'd like them to be less mass.

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.160
Like, to get mass.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.160
And more shooting.

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.160
Yeah, well, that's fun.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.160
That's the thing, like, the mass

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.160
shootings aren't the problem, it's the

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.160
the bullets keep hitting people.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.160
There's a guy who's just like, like,

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.160
mass shooting, it's like a food fight!

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.160
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160
Yeah, like,

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:05.160
things are spinning around, yeah.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.160
Yeah, if a guy went up into

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.160
a clock tower and just

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.160
missed everybody, that'd be great.

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:13.160
Yeah, well, like, the OK Corral,

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:15.160
that was, like, the coolest

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.160
gunfight ever. It was like, seven dudes

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.160
died or something like that, right?

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.160
Yeah, they missed a bunch, though.

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:23.160
And it lasted hours, like,

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.160
and they were all, like, related, like,

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.160
oh, McClintock got shot.

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:31.160
I'm pretty sure you got that totally wrong.

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.160
Anyways.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.160
It was short, and almost everybody died, except for one or two people.

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.160
My point was, because I only see you guys

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.160
once a week, like, I just wanted you

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160
to make it through this week.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.160
I'll see you again next week.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.160
Thanks!

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.160
We start by talking about, like, oh, who needs help

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.160
and, like, let's talk to each other, and then it always,

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160
inevitably, we scrape down to the part,

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.160
like, the reason why we're gathered here

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.160
is because my alienation and your alienation

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.160
and we go, like, we gotta get the fuck out of here,

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.160
like, this planet sucks, like, we're all doomed,

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.160
but, and it's true, we are,

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.160
it's true, and we will get out of here,

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:05.160
but, but, but, like, it would be a shame

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.160
if we didn't make it to the, uh, launch pad,

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.160
you know, because we got caught.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.160
It's kind of amazing, like, I came up here,

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.160
because, like, I think everyone thinks this

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.160
when they come to Harmontown, it's like,

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.160
I want to come, and it's partly selfish

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:19.160
because you want to be in, because we're all

01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.160
narcissists to some degree, and I'm a narcissist,

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.160
I'm, for sure.

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.160
But it's like, Harmontown is

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.160
the closest thing I have to a church.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.160
It's the closest thing I have

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.160
to something that I, I come back to

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.160
weekly, and I just decided

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.160
your body feeling any pain anymore.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:37.160
Yes!

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:41.160
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:43.160
Everybody is home now!

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.160
Let's hear from Gabrielle Marina.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.160
Her name means a house by a water.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:49.160
Let's hear it, uh,

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:53.160
for Doug Frisburton from the Washington Post.

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.160
Special equipment, I'm Jeff Davis,

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.160
your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.160
Let's

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.160
try to get it from church status

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.160
to cult status, uh,

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.160
very quickly.

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.160
Can we pass the plate?

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.160
Uh, when do we pass the round?

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.160
I'm just gonna pass, I'm gonna go straight to passing Kool-Aid.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:13.160
Like, I don't need money.

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.160
Yeah.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.160
Drive fast

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:29.160
and take chances.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:41.160
Did you get any of that?

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:47.160
It's a Kool-Aid show!

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:49.160
Zero

01:46:49.160 --> 01:47:17.160
Audio.
