03:19.040\noh shit it's me it was me the whole time why did you have that where'd you get that uh i\n\n03:19.040 --> 03:26.240\nmy new assistant clara uh when she did this closet she was asking me what's your dream closet i was\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:30.720\nlike i would want to i want to be like bruce wane when i you know when i go into my closet in the\n\n03:30.720 --> 03:38.800\nmorning like i want to feel like like i'm getting ready you know to uh do important things and stuff\n\n03:38.800 --> 03:45.600\nand so you know she did a bunch of cool stuff to the closet but um then to kind of as a flourish\n\n03:45.600 --> 03:52.560\nshe put a bat cowl up on one of the shelves and that's the first that's the first time it's been used\n\n03:54.560 --> 03:58.480\nso you're sitting in one of your several walk-in closets and that's that's probably a good idea\n\n03:58.480 --> 04:05.440\nyou get nice audio in there probably yeah the the the clothes blocks the um stuff i can i can\n\n04:05.440 --> 04:11.600\nheat myself up a little bit if you want and that could be lighting wise oh i thought you\n\n04:11.600 --> 04:14.640\nmeant like entertain i think you meant like entertainment wise like you're gonna you're\n\n04:14.640 --> 04:22.080\ngonna heat it up i can heat it give me heat it up too that way i will in a second um i just\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:27.600\nthere's light that there's lights in this closet that uh they shoot straight down so when they're\n\n04:27.600 --> 04:33.680\non everything becomes very shadowy so i hope this is appropriate you look great i like the\n\n04:33.680 --> 04:38.640\nfact that you're sitting you're sitting in a closet full of clothes and that you've you've\n\n04:38.640 --> 04:42.960\ngone with this vanguly t-shirt you just kept it simple even though all of the options are available\n\n04:42.960 --> 04:48.640\nto you well it's not yeah it's tragically it's one of the few shirts that fits me comfortably now\n\n04:49.520 --> 04:55.840\num yeah yeah yeah that that's that's the same with my dress shirts and my suits i've bought\n\n04:55.840 --> 05:03.200\nsuits and shirts over the years at very varying stages of beer belly so i've gone back to like\n\n05:03.200 --> 05:10.400\nlike like early two like two thousands so i'm breaking up some old some old some old classics\n\n05:10.400 --> 05:15.280\nnone of my pants fit basically i just have like a rotation of athletic shorts now and\n\n05:15.280 --> 05:21.920\nlike nothing else that i have is bottom wear fits it's it's a real issue uh it's it's no good\n\n05:21.920 --> 05:27.680\nhow has your pandemic been spent sir other than that you know what's been sad about the pandemic\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:32.480\nis how little i've been affected by it it's like well this was what my life was like\n\n05:32.480 --> 05:38.080\nand actually that is profoundly sad that's kind of like sadder than like it'd be like oh i can't\n\n05:38.080 --> 05:43.360\ngo to the gym like i used to it's like no this is this is about normal have the same basic amount\n\n05:43.360 --> 05:48.720\nof contact with people you know and it's like man my life is just disgusting and empty and if it\n\n05:48.720 --> 05:53.920\never comes back i should you know turn away from that pathetic lifestyle and try and live lead a\n\n05:53.920 --> 05:59.520\nfilling life going forward yeah that hit me for the first half of it when i was like oh i'm flourishing\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:04.640\nthat's really bad and then i so then i kind of ironically stopped doing a lot of the stuff that\n\n06:04.640 --> 06:10.400\ni was doing pre-pandemic that would be totally pandemic compatible like working out on instagram\n\n06:10.400 --> 06:16.240\nand stuff like that like everything just fell away because i kind of i think i think yeah i just\n\n06:16.240 --> 06:22.640\nkind of went into a low energy mode or something but i've been feeling i've been feeling a comeback\n\n06:22.640 --> 06:30.240\ni think i just go in cycles and stuff yeah um yeah well this is the show folks i mean it's\n\n06:30.240 --> 06:37.040\nwhat it always was it's just people uh hanging out it's not really there's nothing nothing good about\n\n06:37.040 --> 06:42.480\nit do you have any big rants built up from years off or are you getting those out in like the\n\n06:42.480 --> 06:46.880\nwriter's room or yeah what's what's what's what's what's got your hackles up over the over the last\n\n06:46.880 --> 06:54.160\nso what's in the news dan that that's that's that you've you've got bones to pick or i uh i don't\n\n06:54.160 --> 06:58.400\nreally you know i don't really have anything i'm i'm really sorry to tell you that but that's good\n\n06:58.400 --> 07:02.160\nnews for our guests because then we don't have to they don't have to wait through some kind of like\n\n07:02.160 --> 07:09.680\nsupposed monologue that i had one thought about like uh you know uh i don't even think this is\n\n07:09.680 --> 07:18.000\ngonna track but i i i you know i i keep joking with Cody like what are you gonna do leave me you\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:24.320\nknow like during the pandemic like it's it's kind of like and then i but it's a very real thing that\n\n07:24.320 --> 07:29.360\ni keep thinking like you know you gotta get out in front of the pandemic ending because there's\n\n07:29.360 --> 07:35.680\ngonna be there's gonna be like the i picture the street will be filled with pandemic suitors\n\n07:35.680 --> 07:41.680\nlike it'll be kind of almost a reverse ulysses thing where there's just gonna be all these\n\n07:41.680 --> 07:48.240\nhorny guys like flooding the streets and and kind of like call they're gonna know that they're\n\n07:49.200 --> 07:56.880\nthey're they can call out to like a city full of mistreated women um they're gonna they're they're\n\n07:56.880 --> 08:02.560\nthey're extroverts themselves and they've been like you know languishing indoors and not being\n\n08:02.560 --> 08:07.360\nable to go to bars and hit on people and stuff and all of those people are gonna like run into the\n\n08:07.920 --> 08:14.640\nstreets like uh like milk and honey and then so it's like i think now is the time if you've been\n\n08:14.640 --> 08:20.560\nkind of taking your lover for granted you should probably start pretending the pandemics over in\n\n08:20.560 --> 08:28.080\nterms of how many times a week you shower and stuff like that yeah i i've i've i've let myself go i\n\n08:28.080 --> 08:34.400\nput a suit on when i do one of these shows but i'm generally i've been wearing the same pair of jeans\n\n08:34.400 --> 08:40.560\ni think since march and i put a suit on very very seldomly uh usually just for things like this\n\n08:40.560 --> 08:45.920\nand it's the first time since i was like a little boy that i actually blew one of the knees out in\n\n08:45.920 --> 08:52.240\nmy jeans i have ripped jeans now apparently i've i've gone to scott bayo status uh during the\n\n08:52.240 --> 09:02.960\npandemic and i and uh it's it's it's not good i i there's two uh liquor stores in town that i i\n\n09:02.960 --> 09:06.960\ndon't even think they're happy to see me anymore i think they feel bad for me i walk in and keep\n\n09:06.960 --> 09:12.480\ngetting more for net bronca and they're like yeah it's okay they're like oh a great customer they're\n\n09:12.480 --> 09:19.120\nlike you need to fucking go to the gym and maybe you know see somebody i don't i don't go anywhere\n\n09:19.120 --> 09:24.160\ni even know that i i yeah i don't uh there's a there's lots of people out there that are just\n\n09:24.160 --> 09:28.240\nkind of splitting the difference i guess they're they're going places and doing stuff\n\n09:29.600 --> 09:34.720\nso you know i i think i think i was exposed to it very early on because laura my ex-girlfriend\n\n09:34.720 --> 09:40.480\nand uh and very good friend still uh we were in italy together and we thought that she got really\n\n09:40.480 --> 09:47.440\nsick and we thought that she had west nile fever not west nile virus or west nile fever\n\n09:47.440 --> 09:54.320\nand now looking back on it because it was i think december or january in uh january in italy\n\n09:54.320 --> 10:00.080\nwhich became an instant hotspot for for covid that her symptoms were absolutely covid symptoms\n\n10:00.080 --> 10:05.840\nand then i was with her the whole time so i think i was exposed to it and was asymptomatic and didn't\n\n10:05.840 --> 10:11.520\never you know didn't really ever have it so i'm fucking bulletproof i'm the real matman here\n\n10:11.520 --> 10:17.760\nhere of course jeff's fucking immune to the coronavirus a fucking course yeah i've been\n\n10:17.760 --> 10:23.600\ni've been out banging elderly people that old folks um since about april i'm still confused\n\n10:23.600 --> 10:31.600\nabout the rules though like for my understanding of it even pre-vaccine is well don't get it\n\n10:32.560 --> 10:39.120\ndon't risk getting it like like when people are like well if i get it all just uh i don't care\n\n10:39.120 --> 10:43.120\ni should have a right to no it's not about you it's about you being an antenna for this thing\n\n10:43.120 --> 10:50.000\nis going to kill an old woman you don't know and uh but my big question is uh what what what what\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:55.520\nwhat's with the uh with the vaccine like if you get the vaccine i still i still don't understand\n\n10:55.520 --> 11:02.080\nif i get vaccinated tomorrow can i still give can i still carry the yeah the the virus and then\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:06.400\ngive it to other people who are still gonna get sick because that that's that's that's pretty much\n\n11:06.400 --> 11:11.920\nidentical to not getting a vaccine as far as the vaccine it supposedly just kind of prevent\n\n11:11.920 --> 11:16.400\nprevents a worse version of the illness so you could still get sick you could still be taken\n\n11:16.400 --> 11:22.160\nout for like months but you probably won't end up at the hospital and have death i don't even\n\n11:22.160 --> 11:27.200\nknow how clear it is on like whether yourself or long-term effects like lung damage or whatever\n\n11:27.200 --> 11:32.080\nyou might still even get that but yeah it's definitely not ideal but it's supposed to\n\n11:32.080 --> 11:36.800\nhelp prevent death which is the best you know the biggest thing but you can see guys i'm really\n\n11:36.800 --> 11:41.920\nsorry i know i shouldn't be butting in right now but uh i think spencer is wrong about the vaccine\n\n11:41.920 --> 11:46.720\nbut i'll come in later and talk about it because i've read a lot about this okay i'd love to be\n\n11:46.720 --> 11:52.480\nlong i think we should bring yeah i have a couple of things to say about that too so uh but when\n\n11:52.480 --> 11:56.480\nyou guys are ready when you guys are ready keep keep okay we're just gonna finish this segment\n\n11:56.480 -->

same time zone as us and each other yeah she's right over the break on harming\n\n19:17.920 --> 19:25.680\ntown we want to we want to announce our divorce on the show i was gonna say like that we you know we\n\n19:25.680 --> 19:32.800\nwere like uh there's like boxes in the background or chamele's shot and it's like the word dishes\n\n19:32.800 --> 19:41.520\nand it's written sarcastically they could just tell like you dumb dishes and we just occasionally\n\n19:41.520 --> 19:46.400\nget glimpses in emily's background of a very hot yoga instructor guy with no shirt on with like a\n\n19:46.400 --> 19:53.840\nman bun yeah he's bringing he's bringing her out like mango lassies and teas and stuff like that\n\n19:53.840 --> 19:57.600\nyeah and i just have faces drawn on my walls that are my new friend\n\n20:00.400 --> 20:07.600\nfirst of all i want to say uh sorry to butt in on the vaccine thing no i want to know i feel like\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:15.280\nthere has been uh it's been communicated so badly so poorly so the vaccines are really really\n\n20:15.280 --> 20:21.120\nreally really good people should take them they haven't like finished the studies yet but the\n\n20:21.120 --> 20:28.240\nscience says that when you have the vaccine you likely will not uh spread it and um uh\n\n20:28.240 --> 20:33.920\nthere was a thing came out today in israeli study that that 90 percent uh it reduces transmission\n\n20:33.920 --> 20:40.720\nby 90 percent and they're gonna peer review it but the scientists are pretty confident that once\n\n20:40.720 --> 20:45.600\nyou get this vaccine you can't spread the virus either they neutralize it it's not just that you\n\n20:45.600 --> 20:51.680\ndon't have the effects uh you don't it's not just that you don't get the symptoms of it you it kills\n\n20:51.680 --> 20:57.920\nthe virus and when this is 95 effective that means the other five percent that get it have very\n\n20:57.920 --> 21:04.000\nmild cases and nobody ended up in the hospital out of like tens of thousands of people when this is\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.720\nserious case that was somebody who had like a fever for a week so these vaccines are amazing so i just\n\n21:08.720 --> 21:12.720\ni feel everything he's saying is true but also now you see why we had to get divorced\n\n21:12.720 --> 21:21.120\nhe won't stop talking about this vaccine yes yes i always said camille was past the butter\n\n21:21.120 --> 21:28.240\nand then anyway these these vaccines are really good guys we we got to get it i'm specifically\n\n21:28.240 --> 21:39.040\ntalking about Nanjianimax the vaccine it's my it's my go find me go to Nanjiani.tv.biz\n\n21:39.040 --> 21:44.480\nwe'll come to you we will come to you i've got the formula i just need the infrastructure to\n\n21:44.480 --> 21:50.880\nproduce millions of doses i've got five i took two bagel got three and we didn't deserve it\n\n21:52.160 --> 21:57.840\nwell that's good news and it is interesting how i mean like obviously i sometimes i think it's\n\n21:57.840 --> 22:05.920\nkind of a fortunate thing that the disease dropped during the administration of the fake news guy\n\n22:05.920 --> 22:14.480\nand that the problematic portion of our little melting pot like the kinds of people that even\n\n22:14.480 --> 22:20.640\nbefore like way back in the way back we used to laugh at them because they were anti-vax\n\n22:21.360 --> 22:28.720\num like it's kind of nice that they were put in a position uh where they had to be like\n\n22:28.720 --> 22:36.160\nwhat disease and then because now the vaccine rolling out which is going to inevitably be you\n\n22:36.160 --> 22:40.080\nknow it's not going to work right for everybody it's because there's going to be like big time like\n\n22:41.920 --> 22:46.400\nlike like you know it's a it's a life-saving vaccine that now has to be rolled out in a time\n\n22:46.400 --> 22:53.680\nof crisis and like it could have been a real political like uh like catastrophe if it weren't\n\n22:53.680 --> 22:58.960\nfor the fact that it kind of got pre-lapped in i don't know sometimes i think it's nice how that\n\n22:58.960 --> 23:05.360\nstuff works well something like 50 of people eligible to get the vaccine are refusing it so\n\n23:05.360 --> 23:10.400\nit's not like this miracle rollout or everyone's buying into it right no i know i know i guess i\n\n23:10.400 --> 23:14.880\nguess i yeah i'm not discounting that fact i didn't mean to imply that because of the timing of all\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:18.400\nthis all those people are going to be smart now or that they're going to take their vaccine\n\n23:19.120 --> 23:22.880\ni just think i don't i'm not even sure quite what i'm saying i was hoping maybe you guys would\n\n23:22.880 --> 23:27.680\ntake it and turn it into a smarter thought i do think they should have they should have hired\n\n23:27.680 --> 23:32.480\na pr firm to like do some sort of like an information campaign about it which they didn't\n\n23:32.480 --> 23:39.440\neven feel like there's been not enough yeah i do i feel optimistic that as more people get it and we\n\n23:39.440 --> 23:44.160\ndon't have side effects and transmission goes down and people see it's effective that vaccine\n\n23:44.160 --> 23:49.920\nhesitancy will end but emily's right there should have been more work like hey these vaccines are\n\n23:49.920 --> 23:54.240\nreally really good instead of when you get the vaccine you're still gonna have to wear a mask\n\n23:54.240 --> 24:00.400\nwe've really queefed the back when it comes to like the pr on this rollout and the last place\n\n24:00.400 --> 24:08.000\nyou want to queef is the bed well i mean where is the first place yeah where do you want to queef\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:13.520\nwell in the renaissance they had those special like bird beak shaped things for the ladies that\n\n24:13.520 --> 24:18.480\nwere like they were they were filled with lilac and other herbs that were supposedly filtering the\n\n24:18.480 --> 24:24.320\nwater that's good i was going to say hot tub i think you want to queef the hot tub yeah it's\n\n24:24.320 --> 24:30.240\nthe perfect crime there's no victims it's a victimless crime honestly you're just helping\n\n24:30.240 --> 24:36.400\nthe hot tub do what it does yes you're basically like you're you're you're given a fist bump to\n\n24:36.400 --> 24:44.560\nthe jets you're like keep keep it going i like i like your style i got you i got you i have i\n\n24:44.560 --> 24:51.440\nhave another thought i was thinking today uh you know like 20 years from now even though 20 years\n\n24:51.440 --> 24:55.840\nfrom now there probably won't be movies and tv as we understand it there'll be holograms and\n\n24:55.840 --> 25:00.960\npokemons and whatever but whatever the movies and tv of tomorrow whatever popular culture is and\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:05.760\nthere'll be people telling stories and there'll be archetypes in those stories like an archetype\n\n25:05.760 --> 25:14.320\n20 years from now in certain stories will be the cancelled actor from the from the early 21st century\n\n25:14.320 --> 25:20.480\nlike like there'll be like there'll be like these characters in like uh movies where like like\n\n25:20.480 --> 25:26.160\nthere'll be like an older character and then there'll be like a kind of like fallen from grace\n\n25:26.160 --> 25:30.800\nmentor and the person will be like what who are you what happened to you and then the like the\n\n25:30.800 --> 25:35.360\ncall to adventure or threshold will be somebody going like that's that's Olivia johnson she got\n\n25:35.360 --> 25:42.240\ncancelled um back back in the cancellation days and like like it won't like it'll be like being\n\n25:42.240 --> 25:46.480\nyeah it's like it won't the point won't be that she shouldn't have been or should have been but\n\n25:46.480 --> 25:50.960\nthe point will be that she she didn't get to be who she was or whatever and that's why she's such a\n\n25:50.960 --> 25:56.800\ngreat acting teacher like whatever the roger rabbit reboot will be it's like instead of the dip\n\n25:56.800 --> 26:07.360\nit'll be like the cancel um barrel the cancel me and they'll put that shoe in yeah you did the\n\n26:07.360 --> 26:14.640\nsqueaky shoes in the cancel barrel and oh fuck that prediction i disagree with but i can live with\n\n26:14.640 --> 26:26.080\nthat what are you what the fuck is that is that sriracha what the fuck you got there baby\n\n26:26.080 --> 26:34.240\nare you drinking a baby that's like close to the camera or is it huge no no it's my water bottle\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:39.600\noh it's giving me gentle encouragement it's giving me gentle encouragement i don't know\n\n26:39.600 --> 26:45.040\nif you could see it it's reverse on mine but it says only remember your goal that you got a lot\n\n26:45.040 --> 26:50.960\nof work to do keep i know i'm way behind but that's because i'm fucking around with you guys yes and\n\n26:50.960 --> 26:58.480\nand the very bottom the very bottom level says urinary tract infection you can drink too much\n\n26:58.480 --> 27:05.920\nwater no that's not true it is my grandmother was hospitalized for drinking too much water\n\n27:05.920 --> 27:11.040\ni didn't even understand she was trying to win a switch for her kids and instead she died or a\n\n27:11.040 --> 27:17.440\nwe a nintendo we oh that's it that that works because when you drink a lot of water you we\n\n27:17.440 --> 27:26.480\nright hello okay me man i hold it in quarantine's been tough no what you don't see on the bottom of\n\n27:26.480 --> 27:31.600\nthe Schrab's giant tub of water is there's a catheter that pumps as you're in right back into it it's\n\n27:31.600 --> 27:39.360\njust a cyclical flow no that's not true keep chugging keep calling your goal feeling awesome\n\n27:41.600 --> 27:49.280\nyeah i get feeling awesome you guys are gonna be so jealous when i finish this when i finish this\n\n27:49.280 --> 27:56.640\nwater when i get down to these mountains you guys are gonna be so jealous keep talking i'm\n\n27:56.640 --> 28:04.160\ngonna finish it before the end of this podcast place your bets oh my god i would love for that\n\n28:04.160 --> 28:10.720\nto happen okay but rob you rob you're you're not allowed just for you man Schrab you're i'll take\n\n28:10.720 --> 28:14.400\nthat bet but you are not allowed to get up and leave your chair at any time you have to stay in\n\n28:14.400 --> 28:24.000\nthe seat oh i'm 51 man this is gonna be awkward so do you guys open open question for the table\n\n28:24.960 --> 28:31.280\nwho identifies as an introvert versus an extrovert like and and have you noticed like\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:37.600\nsurely you've reconciled that with the pandemic have you ever have you gone like i i am languishing\n\n28:37.600 --> 28:45.120\nhere because i get my batteries charged by other people and it sucks versus you know and i like\n\n28:45.120 --> 28:49.120\nspencer and i were talking about i had speaking for us two introverts i think like it's not like\n\n28:49.120 --> 28:53.840\nyou talk to spencer a lot like like no i haven't seen him and we're we've been on the phone we're\n\n28:53.840 --> 28:59.760\nboth introverts we haven't spoken a couple hours each day it's important to us to touch base you\n\n28:59.760 --> 29:05.840\nknow when did you talk to him the only reason we've seen we're seeing each other now is because\n\n29:05.840 --> 29:12.000\nthe one extrovert here decided we needed to do a reunion show because he's like a he's like a\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:22.480\nfern planted on a desert this is a fucking guy hey literally your best friend okay because i don't\n\n29:22.480 --> 29:26.800\nknow if emily emily and kumail like i wouldn't know between the two of you like if one if either of\n\n29:26.800 --> 29:33.520\nyou or you know like it wouldn't shock me if you went emily's on the right emily what do you say\n\n29:33.520 --> 29:38.080\nmaybe for one of you i'm i'm definitely more of an introvert in that i like doing social stuff but\n\n29:38.080 --> 29:43.600\nit makes me very tired and so similarly to spencer my life and i do most of my work at home so my\n\n29:43.600 --> 29:49.520\nlife did not change a lot when this started the only thing that changed was me being like i guess\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:53.840\ni should like schedule a lunch with some friends because i think of everything like the stems\n\n29:53.840 --> 30:00.000\nand i'm like regular contact that's how you keep your friends so you did so so i'd say you you\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.560\nget you kind of forced yourself to do that like like like had like play dates and stuff\n\n30:04.560 --> 30:10.800\nand i knew oh that's something you did before not during yeah no we haven't seen anybody yeah we\n\n30:10.800 --> 30:16.400\ndon't see anybody but before i would have to like force myself and i would still enjoy it like i\n\n30:16.400 --> 30:20.640\nbut like it would be like a it wasn't a thing that my heart was like i'm yearning for a lunch\n\n30:20.640 --> 30:28.000\nwith a friend um but i would always like it when i did it i think i never i never realized how much\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:38.400\nof the part of me that would go out was doing it for fear of ostracization some kind of indirect\n\n30:38.400 --> 30:43.440\nlike just thinking like i don't want to be the person that everyone stops inviting to things\n\n30:43.440 --> 30:49.600\ni don't want to it and it's not a case of whether or not that's good or bad or healthy or unhealthy\n\n30:49.600 --> 30:54.880\nbut it's just amazing to take all of that out of the spreadsheet and how much it was like\n\n30:54.880 --> 31:02.240\nit didn't make me instantly happy um i don't wake up every day happier than i what yeah a little\n\n31:02.240 --> 31:09.440\nprobably like five ten percent happier like fucking pandemic rules but um just as a baseline but um\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:15.120\nbut but just like the amount of like it's just like weight off the shoulders like it's kind of\n\n31:15.120 --> 31:21.040\namazing to me and i think that's a healthy thing because i don't think my extroverted friends\n\n31:21.040 --> 31:25.520\nwould if i had ever told them that that was going on in my head the first thing they would have said\n\n31:25.520 --> 31:31.760\nis don't do that to us or yourself don't be thinking that stuff like uh like we don't want you\n\n31:32.560 --> 31:38.480\nmaking calculations about whether you should come join us at a bar and like you're thinking about\n\n31:38.480 --> 31:45.920\nwhether if you do your life or this or that like god damn we do it because we're extroverts and we\n\n31:45.920 --> 31:53.760\nwere extroverts and we have fun and now like if the pandemic has an end to it um like i can now\n\n31:53.760 --> 31:59.520\nthink clearly i think about like a little more clearly about who i am and what i want um and\n\n31:59.520 --> 32:04.560\nnot burden other people with my bullshit about like what what i'm trying to accomplish with them\n\n32:05.520 --> 32:12.560\ncan i can i disagree with you on one thing there all i said was my feelings no no no you\n\n32:12.560 --> 32:19.120\nwere saying that your that your friends probably are like no don't do it for us i'm not like that\n\n32:19.120 --> 32:23.920\ni'm like whatever math you have to do to like come out and hang out with me i'm happy with that\n\n32:23.920 --> 32:27.760\nsame with Schrab you know like i would see Schrab at parties and then he would want to leave early\n\n32:27.760 --> 32:32.400\nand i would guilt him into trying to stay because i i wanted to hang out with you guys because that's\n\n32:32.400 --> 32:41.440\nhow you go yeah i'll grab some guilt so come on are you are you an extrovert come on yeah if i had\n\n32:41.440 --> 32:47.280\nto guess if i had to like wager on this i would say that you would have tilted slightly toward\n\n32:48.160 --> 32:53.200\nintroversion because that's most of my comedy friends tend like like especially stand-up\n\n32:53.200 --> 32:57.440\nfriends of mine there's a there's a little bit of an introverted part of you but are you are you\n\n32:57.440 --> 33:03.760\nkind of both sides of that coin where do you follow that i would say you know uh if you define\n\n33:03.760 --> 33:09.280\nintrovert by where you get energy from i get energy from being alone or with emily at home like\n\n33:09.280 --> 33:15.200\nwatching movies and stuff and and hanging out at home but as emily said i do turn into captain\n\n33:15.200 --> 33:20.640\nparties so there are sometimes when i'm when i used to be out where i would be like really like\n\n33:20.640 --> 33:26.800\nemily was like oh no captain parties out and then i know i'm like gilting people into staying longer\n\n33:26.800 --> 33:32.720\nand that kind of stuff so so it was really it was sort of extremes right emily yeah i would say so\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:37.200\nbut you i've at least taken like i'll take an outdoor walk with a friend every once in a while\n\n33:37.200 --> 33:46.320\nyou don't see anybody you got you yeah i i'm fully terrified of this thing and i i i have not seen\n\n33:46.320 --> 33:51.600\nanybody really that's the thing i'm i'm really scared too but i think like dan i make those\n\n33:51.600 --> 33:56.880\ncalculations too but i think that they're like i do it because i know it's beneficial to me like\n\n33:56.880 --> 34:00.400\ni'm not thinking like oh i should see friends because i don't want them to like think i'm not\n\n34:00.400 --> 34:04.560\naround i do it because i'm like i know i'm gonna feel better if i like hang out with someone i like\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:09.120\ni know i'm gonna and this isn't the before times and now i know i'm gonna feel better if i like\n\n34:09.120 --> 34:13.360\nhave a social interaction with someone but i'll be damned if i'm like really tired and don't\n\n34:13.360 --> 34:18.720\nreally feel like doing it but i i don't do the calculation that like it doesn't feel\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:23.280\nsciency to me or like manipulative it just feels like oh i know i'm gonna like this but i'm not\n\n34:23.280 --> 34:27.600\ngonna like it up until i get there yeah i mean we have the luxury of following our bliss and in\n\n34:27.600 --> 34:34.080\nautumn and it actually intersects with like doing the right thing during a pandemic i i i want to\n\n34:34.080 --> 34:39.680\ntake this time to put some medals on some chests of some people that that are not in that category\n\n34:39.680 --> 34:47.120\nmy fiance could you know she's she is a you know on the on that on that whatever enneagram\n\n34:47.840 --> 34:52.480\ntest or whatever where you get your all your letters and stuff she's a campaigner i don't know\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:57.680\nif she's you know she's she's she she recharges with me we hang out in bed we do all these things\n\n34:57.680 --> 35:07.360\nbut she definitely she she she gets she gets her energy charged by other people and she and uh and\n\n35:07.360 --> 35:14.560\nher friend anna kendrick who uh uh like both of them same boat where they're like they're not they\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:18.720\nprobably don't even know who they are when they're not like hanging out with with with with people\n\n35:18.720 --> 35:25.840\nand they regularly get tested because they have a regular hangout and then they and then sometimes\n\n35:25.840 --> 35:30.400\nlike one of them like their test doesn't come back because there's a windstorm or something and\n\n35:30.400 --> 35:35.760\nwhatever and they're like they're so committed to it that's actual sacrifice they're like following\n\n35:35.760 --> 35:42.480\ntheir bliss and going like well we gotta we should hang out and but i'll as soon as i'm put up to\n\n35:42.480 --> 35:48.000\nyou know as soon as there's any test of my will i'll probably falter i like i had my friends over\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:55.200\nfor election night and like i stopped giving a fuck with i was like i i was wearing a mask when\n\n35:55.200 --> 36:00.160\nthey came to the door and i had put bowls of chips six feet apart and then it's like by the end of the\n\n36:00.160 --> 36:06.160\nnight we're just hanging out and like because i'm following my bliss really and it's easy to follow\n\n36:06.160 --> 36:13.520\nduring a pandemic and there are people out there who are like this fucking sucks but i'm really\n\n36:13.520 --> 36:18.800\ngoing to do the right thing for other people and i'm there i really i'm really impressed by them\n\n36:18.800 --> 36:25.200\nyeah is following your bliss being introverted to being okay with it or is following your bliss\n\n36:25.200 --> 36:33.120\nbeing like fuck the pandemic put those chips together uh for well for and now i'm just well\n\n36:33.120 --> 36:42.960\nfollowing my bliss is like like i'm i'm i'm like lazy i'm like i'm i like i can following my bliss\n\n36:42.960 --> 36:48.320\nwill be like i was excited to set up for election night i was like dino and jeff are gonna come over\n\n36:48.320 --> 36:53.680\nand i'm gonna i'm gonna it's like a designing a spaceship i'm gonna put the chips over here\n\n36:53.680 --> 36:57.680\nand i'm gonna everybody will be able to not touch each other and the cups will be disposable and\n\n36:57.680 --> 37:03.440\nall these things but that's because they're only like like there was only like you only had like\n\n37:03.440 --> 37:10.000\ntwo other chairs like when you invited dino house is pretty small i don't know how many people he\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:18.320\ncould fit dance places it's cozy i would call it cozy yeah cozy yeah i've been there it's uh Schrab you\n\n37:18.320 --> 37:22.720\nwould never have left the house had you been asked yeah probably were asked yeah it's probably true\n\n37:22.720 --> 37:28.480\ni feel like some of my friends who are intro to our introverts that feel guilted into being social\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:33.520\nbecause they feel like that's the thing that you have to do just to not be ostracized or or\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:42.000\neliminated forgotten forgotten forgotten forgotten that they've gotten forgotten it's somebody got\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:48.400\nforgotten that they've used they've used their their introversion and their their loved their\n\n37:48.400 --> 37:53.760\nlove of staying at home as though they really really are it's like safety freaks they don't\n\n37:53.760 --> 37:58.400\nlike it's like no no no no it's too dangerous to go outside and they're kind of wearing that like\n\n37:58.400 --> 38:02.320\na feather in their hat like they're doing the right things like no you're loving it you don't\n\n38:02.320 --> 38:08.880\nnever have to do shit yeah that's what i i i try yeah i try to police myself internally of like i\n\n38:08.880 --> 38:14.240\ntry to like uh are you doing anything difficult that's i like like when i early on when i would\n\n38:14.240 --> 38:22.400\nsee people on twitter like questioning the quarantine and all that stuff like like my initial reaction\n\n38:22.400 --> 38:28.080\nto be like you fucking dick like how dare you that's the problem with this blah blah blah but um\n\n38:28.080 --> 38:34.080\nyou know and i like i have to remind myself like jesus christ like like like imagine this\n\n38:34.080 --> 38:38.960\nsucking for people like when have you ever done anything harmon that hasn't been a\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:47.120\nfucking blast for you uh if animation producer now it's a pandemic it's now you can abuse labor\n\n38:47.120 --> 38:54.640\nwhile while you do woodwork in your garage with a fucking tony stark camera system like i i it's fun\n\n38:54.640 --> 39:01.520\nlike it's not i'm not it's it's it that doesn't mean that i'm not doing what i do for other people\n\n39:01.520 --> 39:06.160\nbut i always like have to check myself and go like if there's if there's a person out there\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:13.600\nthat's like i mean it's like i my mind is blown by like how how many people must be just absolutely\n\n39:13.600 --> 39:23.600\nfucked in the ear and and if they're getting on twitter and going like you know in the in the\n\n39:23.600 --> 39:28.960\nin a flurry of like people like shaming someone for not wearing a mask when they're jogging or\n\n39:28.960 --> 39:32.880\nwhatever the whatever's happening on twitter because people are engaging in their thing and\n\n39:32.880 --> 39:37.360\nlike you see some of these then these voices come up and the people that they're you know there's\n\n39:37.360 --> 39:45.840\nthis agenda to it where they're like that's 99% survival rate and you you you if you parse it\n\n39:45.840 --> 39:52.800\nthrough just them wanting one thing or another to be true that you could get really mad at them\n\n39:52.800 --> 40:00.080\nbut then i think about like oh what if the what if they're just not socialized to say\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:06.640\nthis sucks for me like which the ironic thing is like if they would just say that and you see\n\n40:06.640 --> 40:11.040\nthat all the time in social media when people get broken down into using their eye statements on\n\n40:11.040 --> 40:17.680\naccident they finally at the end of a big fight they start being personal and they say what their\n\n40:17.680 --> 40:22.160\ndeal is oh i'm an electrician and i was in vietnam and i got one leg and i have a thing and it's\n\n40:22.160 --> 40:26.960\nlike why didn't you just say that in the beginning and the answer is well because i was told that was\n\n40:26.960 --> 40:32.560\nweak they sometimes don't connect them they're like well yeah my dad died three weeks ago but\n\n40:32.560 --> 40:36.640\nthat doesn't have anything to do with this and you're like oh it doesn't yeah does it not well\n\n40:36.640 --> 40:42.480\nthis is what's really impressive about emily you know so i've like fully turtled up i am terrified\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:47.680\nlike every night still i have dreams where i'm like i can't find my mask although now every now\n\n40:47.680 --> 40:52.800\nand then there's there's nightmares of like when am i going to get the vaccine so hey things are\n\n40:52.800 --> 40:59.280\nlooking up but you know when we would go on a walk i am very guilty of like judging people and i'm\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:04.960\nnot think there's a good thing who don't wear masks so i'm that guy but emily will always like be like\n\n41:04.960 --> 41:09.040\nwell you don't know what their day is you don't know what's going on with them so emily's like this\n\n41:09.040 --> 41:17.840\nshe her empathy it feels she has like weaponized empathy she's doing it on purpose that bitch\n\n41:18.880 --> 41:24.560\nit kind of feels like i'm like i wish you weren't so empathetic because then she's like i just want\n\n41:24.560 --> 41:33.840\nto be angry at that person let me let me have this have you ever confronted anyone i was going\n\n41:33.840 --> 41:37.920\nto get the postmates and Cody was like you never wear your mask and you're going to get the\n\n41:37.920 --> 41:46.320\npostmates and i'm like oh yeah shit and i like i was like grabbed a mask to go out to get the\n\n41:46.320 --> 41:52.720\npostmates and i i put the i didn't have a chance to put it on because like the postmates was already\n\n41:52.720 --> 41:59.360\npulling up and i did this thing that i thought was amazing where the guy got out of the car with\n\n41:59.360 --> 42:08.800\nthe food and as he was approaching me i waved my mask at him like it was a backstage pass\n\n42:09.200 --> 42:16.960\nit's okay and took it like block it i was like like blocking it like i was more like i'm i'm cool\n\n42:16.960 --> 42:23.440\nlike i get it like it was like like i i i mean it was it was an unconscious move but it definitely\n\n42:23.440 --> 42:29.120\nwasn't an unconscious like attempt to block the virus particles it was an unconscious like\n\n42:29.120 --> 42:38.400\ndon't worry about it i'm i'm i'm a mask guy like i'm i'm a you can trust me don't worry i own a\n\n42:38.400 --> 42:43.440\nmask i know i'm friends with Ace Frehley's manager let me take this food and make me laugh on you\n\n42:44.320 --> 42:51.520\nyeah no i spencer i have not yelled at anybody but i have gotten close and you can because you\n\n42:51.520 --> 42:59.920\nhave a mask but my mask actually has the lower half of my face printed on it so i think but kumail\n\n42:59.920 --> 43:07.440\nthis is interesting to me that you're are you so are you are you are you immunocompromised\n\n43:07.440 --> 43:13.360\nin a amelie i am and that is where this is coming from so it's all like it's all\n\n43:14.640 --> 43:20.320\nrealizing i don't know this is really feels like Harmontown it does we're realizing you\n\n43:20.320 --> 43:26.880\nknow obviously for a year now emily and i have really spent all our time together and i feel\n\n43:26.880 --> 43:31.920\nvery very lucky that i'm with someone like emily and honestly a relationship has gotten stronger\n\n43:31.920 --> 43:37.360\nand for the first time i've gotten some sort of insight people know and you know 12 years ago\n\n43:37.360 --> 43:41.360\nemily had gotten really really sick she was in a coma all this stuff so she still has that condition\n\n43:41.360 --> 43:47.920\nright 14 years this year but that's okay 14 years and we're realizing that both of us have some sort\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:53.600\nof um ptsd from it like i don't want to like you know people who've been in wars and stuff i don't\n\n43:53.600 --> 44:00.000\nwant to but there certainly is trauma associated with it and we're realizing in this that this\n\n44:00.960 --> 44:09.200\nvirus is triggering certain things for me uh that make me it's kind of a bad thing it sounds like\n\n44:09.200 --> 44:14.880\ni'm like ultra protective of emily to the point where it's not healthy for either of us\n\n44:14.880 --> 44:23.200\num and uh and so this pandemic has really like awoken awoken a lot of stuff and and i've realized\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:31.360\nwe've realized that uh you know the work that needs to be done um yeah it's it's yeah i mean\n\n44:31.360 --> 44:36.960\nthat's that's cody is the Kumail in the in this relationship because i'm i'm immuno compromised\n\n44:36.960 --> 44:44.240\ni i i i i don't have the i knew early on i knew that that word was going to be like\n\n44:44.240 --> 44:49.120\nthe new autistic or whatever where it's like you're it's like people people self-applying it\n\n44:49.120 --> 44:57.280\nwe're gonna be i don't know i was like i better not tell anybody but like i i'm in a category of\n\n44:57.280 --> 45:03.120\nperson that if i get this thing like i could be one of those people that that you know that that\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:08.800\neats it and i i'm not one of the diaries that's one of the diaries one of the that's exactly what\n\n45:08.800 --> 45:13.760\ni was thinking was like trying to move around his moving around um i could be one of the diaries\n\n45:13.760 --> 45:18.640\nlike that's interestingly like what if he if that was a quote from him like i just realized like\n\n45:18.640 --> 45:25.200\nwhy he said that because it was like he the narcissism wants to get around things that are\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:30.720\nbigger than it like you have to like you have to be anything but absorbed by something so he's like\n\n45:30.720 --> 45:40.880\ni could be one of the and i was like i could uh be one of the people in the category that uh\n\n45:40.880 --> 45:49.760\nshall we say terminates um but uh what it's it's it's the truth i mean my per my doctor it's like\n\n45:49.760 --> 45:57.360\ni i can't get this thing and uh i don't have the same 99 percent whatever uh chance and i told that\n\n45:57.360 --> 46:03.360\nto Cody early on and she's been i mean that's just mar you know she's just living in this world\n\n46:03.360 --> 46:09.760\nshe just put that in her head and is just living like that and the funny thing is like it's the\n\n46:09.760 --> 46:15.520\nsame i think similar to you and emily because i now look at my behavior and i'm like you don't\n\n46:15.520 --> 46:20.080\ngive a shit if you get this thing you're just hanging out but now i'm remembering like i was\n\n46:20.080 --> 46:25.600\nlike researching bleaches and things i was like do i was i was genuinely terrified\n\n46:27.280 --> 46:34.800\nCody Cody's like trying to keep me alive and then i cycled into this like you know what like\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:41.280\nwhat is life really yeah you're you're waving masks at post-made people it's exactly like i\n\n46:41.280 --> 46:47.840\nyou get the vaccine do you do emily and dan do you get the vaccine before earlier because of your\n\n46:47.840 --> 46:54.240\ncondition emily does i'm in the next year yeah she's in the next one i assume you would meet you dan\n\n46:54.240 --> 47:00.560\nyeah i i'm Cody keeps telling me like you can do this or that and i keep going going like i don't\n\n47:00.560 --> 47:08.960\nwant the vaccine i just why don't you want i well because i keep thinking like i'm i'm not going\n\n47:08.960 --> 47:14.800\nanywhere anyway the bar's not open down the street fucking kumail left he's so disgusted with my\n\n47:14.800 --> 47:21.680\nbehavior i'm sorry i was trying to light up um that's much better i truly it's so selfish like i\n\n47:21.680 --> 47:28.080\njust realized like i should be getting the vaccine for fucking Cody so she can relax yeah which is\n\n47:28.080 --> 47:33.280\nso dan dan you uh you're not getting the vaccine because if you got the vaccine people would have\n\n47:33.280 --> 47:40.080\nto say dan you have to come into work uh well not really it was more it's more because i honestly\n\n47:40.080 --> 47:43.840\na little part of me is like i don't want to go stand in line with a bunch of people that probably\n\n47:43.840 --> 47:50.240\nhave covid um i another part of it is like i i didn't i mean i'm glad kumail was a guest\n\n47:50.240 --> 47:56.720\ntonight and could fill us in and the fucking like actually just across the board vaccine is but\n\n47:56.720 --> 48:01.120\nlike i was looking at the vaccine as being this confusing thing that was like i thought it was\n\n48:01.120 --> 48:07.760\nfor baby boomers to like keep them from literally dying and that was basically it it was like a\n\n48:07.760 --> 48:14.240\nlike a plug at the end of the herd immunity no it's for everybody i don't know i mean you know\n\n48:14.240 --> 48:19.680\nunder a certain age like under like for teenagers and kids i don't know i don't know for like for\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:26.320\npeople who are pregnant or or anything like that but but this is these vaccines are above and beyond\n\n48:26.320 --> 48:35.120\nwhat we had hoped for we had hoped for 70 efficacy these are 95 percent like and 95 doesn't mean that\n\n48:35.120 --> 48:40.240\nfive percent of people get it what it means is you want this is oh i'm gonna go ahead this is\n\n48:40.240 --> 48:50.320\ndivorce me again um yeah okay i'll just say that okay so 95 efficacy doesn't mean that five percent\n\n48:50.320 --> 48:55.440\npeople are open what happens is if people are just like they're part of the study so half people get\n\n48:55.440 --> 49:01.520\nthe vaccine half people don't the people who don't get the vaccine 20 percent of them get covid so\n\n49:01.520 --> 49:08.080\nthen that's the baseline so 95 percent means it's not 95 percent of 100 it's 95 percent of 20 percent\n\n49:08.080 --> 49:13.280\nso the number of people who get it isn't five percent it's much smaller than that it's like one\n\n49:13.280 --> 49:20.400\npercent i think emily and uh and camille i mean i don't want to be like like a dick but uh i'm just\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:26.080\nsaying if one of you does get it we got a sequel to big sick we got big sick too and that's going\n\n49:26.080 --> 49:30.800\nto be fucking you guys are easy yeah i think that's what camille's worried about i think that's the\n\n49:30.800 --> 49:40.320\nwork jeff uh i don't take this the wrong way but go fuck yourself well hopefully we'll win that\n\n49:40.320 --> 49:46.400\noscar if i get another coma all i gotta do is get another coma that's my nightmare now that's great i'll\n\n49:46.400 --> 49:52.480\nadd that i i i've given camille a new nightmare now for me if emily does go into another coma\n\n49:52.480 --> 49:58.880\ncamille you could play best fiends that's friends without an r best fiends it's a new game sorry i\n\n49:58.880 --> 50:02.880\njust i hear they have thousands of levels i've been addicted ever since i started they're always\n\n50:02.880 --> 50:07.920\nadding more i'm telling you trisha in marketing has been playing it and she loves taking care of\n\n50:07.920 --> 50:13.360\nher little worm baby i don't know if i'm gonna make it and it's easy enough for them to understand\n\n50:13.360 --> 50:19.840\nthey're loving it more than i am is this okay rob you you may not leave the seats until that\n\n50:19.840 --> 50:25.600\njudge i'm feeling i'm feeling it coming i'm gonna start when i start doing the\n\n50:28.880 --> 50:35.760\nokay next topic uh so i finally started i used warby parker because there's a pandemic and i\n\n50:35.760 --> 50:42.240\nneeded new uh glasses so i got my i need a far prescription and a close prescription so a pair\n\n50:42.240 --> 50:48.560\nof glasses came and i put them on and i everything in the distance was blurry and then i and everything\n\n50:48.560 --> 50:57.600\nup close was clear so i labeled them uh uh well it says grass i i labeled them close and and then\n\n50:57.600 --> 51:05.680\ni realized what are you doing because i don't know i don't have the words on it but i label\n\n51:05.680 --> 51:12.480\nmine because you because you can't see him sometimes so then so then you know warby parker\n\n51:12.480 --> 51:17.120\nlike they don't they don't come all at the same time if you need multiples and then the next ones\n\n51:17.120 --> 51:22.480\ncame and i put them on and everything was blurry and then i put my hand in front of my face and it\n\n51:22.480 --> 51:29.360\nwas clear

--> 53:48.960\nfree magic we we love magic spoon by the way and we're very aware that they ran out of peanut\n\n53:48.960 --> 53:54.240\nbutter it was the prices of this house yeah i haven't really problem is that peanut butter is the\n\n53:54.240 --> 54:02.320\nmost exciting to me magic spoons early funding was all built on nazi gold so you gotta take\n\n54:03.200 --> 54:07.680\nyou're gonna

twins\n\n59:39.920 --> 59:45.440\nare you sure he said they were twins yeah okay you think he just had the second job is that what\n\n59:45.440 --> 59:52.160\nyou mean because the because the joke was

me that we're reading this book is making me sleepy we have these balls\n\n01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:06.240\nof gelatin in our skulls and they're melting and from from birth until death and like because\n\n01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.400\nthey're melting they're they're becoming less than perfectly spherical and we go to these people and\n\n01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.640\nthey like oh all right what is that they look better than that is that like better than that\n\n01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.280\nand now i noticed like uh now the human element is all just follow up it's like we're entering the\n\n01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:30.880\nconcierge phase is uh that that anthropology guy that wrote those books would say like pretty soon\n\n01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.600\ni don't know if they're gonna need a human being there because they they're kind of like the computer\n\n01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.560\nis zeroing in on what my prescription should be i don't even know how the fuck that's possible\n\n01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.760\nbut that's what's happening and because the guy that was there like running through the lenses was\n\n01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.280\nlike and i'll just make sure now it was like he's working it's like turner he's working for the\n\n01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.680\ncomputer yeah he's like he's partners with a computer like and it's making it's making his\n\n01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.960\njob more fun they're solving cases but it yeah i but the weirdest thing about it is that then he\n\n01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:14.880\nsaid to me like uh well good news yeah your prescription could use a little tweaking um yes\n\n01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:22.800\nyour vision is deteriorating it's deteriorating the amount that it's supposed to in this amount of time\n\n01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.720\nand given your age and all these other statistics like it'll plateau at a certain point but like\n\n01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.320\nthey just them knowing it's like your eyes are like ice cubes like like or like ice sculptures\n\n01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.640\nat a party and they're just sort of like yeah the tips of the wings on the swan are like\n\n01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:45.120\nlike they should be pretty much flippers by now but you know the wedding reception's already\n\n01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.200\nstarted it's like no one cares like like your your your your eyes are just melting in your head\n\n01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.480\nit depreciates as soon as you drive it off the lot yeah there is no you can sell this to anybody\n\n01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:11.760\nfor sure not turn a profit no i went to one of those laser eye places where you go in there and\n\n01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.920\nthey're like they fix your they just to see because my eyes are getting it's fucked up you know like\n\n01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.440\nbut it used to be that i can't see what's in front of me but i could see really good far away but\n\n01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.840\nbut now i can't see far away or what's without my glasses so i went to this doctor and it's like\n\n01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:35.680\noh what they do is they slice the top of your eyelid your eye not your eyelid your eye open\n\n01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.760\nand then they kind of clean that with a q-tip and then they melt it back on or whatever but people\n\n01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.320\nhave said oh it's great you should do it i go in there and the guy's like yeah your eyes are\n\n01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:57.360\nare like it's the we could do like one far away and then the other would be for close up so you\n\n01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.800\nwould be like doing this all the time and i was like that doesn't seem like a real uh a good use\n\n01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.640\nof my time and i got what wait wait so you'd have like a book reading i and then yeah i'd be like\n\n01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.320\nlike right now i'd be like hey guys what's up actually i like this for you i think this is\n\n01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:21.680\na game hey it's working it makes you ask you've got a slight 2g ask feel about you now yes i\n\n01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:28.320\nloved you on searching for italy uh yeah exactly fantastic i used to i used to\n\n01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.920\nisn't that why uh why the the the iconic pirate eye patch thing was not because they lost an eye\n\n01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.240\nin battle but because if you keep one eye in darkness and you use that eye when you're above\n\n01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.720\ndeck but if you have to go below deck for any reason where it's dark you use that eye and you\n\n01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.320\nhave perfect vision with that eye just you know the most interesting useless shit always that's\n\n01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:56.320\nthe same thing with like it's called myth busters it's called myth busters like they give one leg\n\n01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:02.960\na peg and then yeah and then the other one is like normal so when they have to run\n\n01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.920\nwell it's because it turns out like if you're making people walk the plank and you have a peg\n\n01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.160\nleg it's a lot easier to get them to walk the plank because they're like because you poke you\n\n01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.640\njust poke them with a peg just poke them also if and that's the reason why they only have one\n\n01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.920\nparrot they only wear one parrot on one shoulder and that's the other shoulder uh never needs\n\n01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.160\ncrackers i i mean i forget what the actual reason was but with pirates there was always a reason\n\n01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:38.880\nalways everything was efficient very the yeah the pirates actually always had a parrot on each\n\n01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.680\nshoulder um the their skeletons when we dig them up uh it appears as though they only had one because\n\n01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:53.200\nthey you know people people die on their side people die on their side the upper parrot is exposed\n\n01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.400\nto oxidation no dan that that theory has been debunked the reason why the war is right oh\n\n01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:23.520\nsure i'm trying to trick us with a steely touche he's taking a touchey pee everybody\n\n01:07:23.520

seen have you seen cabaret\n\n01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.560\nno we really want to see cabaret start with captain start with cabaret it is absolutely a\n\n01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:52.640\nfreak out there's nazis there's lesbians there's menace toa um i about a year and a half ago\n\n01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:58.240\ntook acid by myself by the way a lot of musicals have nazis in them for some reason but sorry\n\n01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:11.120\nfor some reason spring time for hitler and you took you took i took a small dose of acid on\n\n01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.320\nmy own because somebody had given me some acid and i've only ever done acid in small quantities\n\n01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:22.480\ni've never gone like on a huge trip i i won't say i recommend it because i don't want to push\n\n01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:29.600\nyou know drug use on the children as i know a lot of our viewers are our youngins um however\n\n01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.080\nif you have the opportunity do a little acid and watch cabaret it's a freaking freak out\n\n01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.160\nuh i had to hit pause after the opening number like um this movie lives inside my brain for\n\n01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:48.000\nthe rest of my life it's very very good i want that we we tried watching one last night that\n\n01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.640\nrob uh mentioned a lot called all that jazz and it's a movie directed by Bob Fosse about the\n\n01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:00.160\nlife of Bob Fosse and the whole movie is about women trying to fuck him and his biggest problem is\n\n01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.720\nall women want to do is fuck him and he wrote when he's a kid when he's an adult doesn't matter\n\n01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.920\nwomen want to yeah i was going to recommend that as an anti-musical and that's a real goodie and\n\n01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.400\nray shiter is tremendous in it and it's there's more drug use in that than most movies have\n\n01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.680\nand also if you want to go also on a on a weird anti-musical trip uh pennies from heaven with\n\n01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.040\nuh steve martin bernadette peters and christopher walken does a tap routine strip tease that is\n\n01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:33.760\nworth watching uh it's a very dark musical it's like it's not supposed to be musicals are supposed\n\n01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.280\nto be uplifting and upbeat and you know everybody wins these are depressing where everybody is\n\n01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.080\nyou know like but basically we're all decaying all dying pennies heaven heaven takes place\n\n01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:51.840\nuh i'm gonna save that for post vaccine the fossey vernon uh mini series with sam rockwell\n\n01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:58.560\nis really good i mean i guess if you were into like all that jazz or or or like cabaret or\n\n01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.800\nanything like that he chose like the making of it and they're really really it's really great\n\n01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:07.440\nit's really cool in in anchors away there is a scene that i've watched a million times uh\n\n01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.840\njean kelly dances with a peasant mexican girl in alvera streets and he thinks that he's lost\n\n01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.800\nhis girl to frank sanatra he doesn't know that it's not the case he thinks he's losing the girl\n\n01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.480\nto his friend and he's like you know what good for him and he's heartbroken and he sees a little\n\n01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.640\npeasant girl played not by a mexican girl it's actually a little white girl in dark makeup but\n\n01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.640\nthey do a dance where he says you know i can't have her so i'll i'll dance with this child\n\n01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:41.120\nthat song makes me cry that number makes me cry every time it's just good okay that's next then\n\n01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:46.960\nyeah that's and also we've all anything between fred and ginger musicals are always good uh like\n\n01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:55.120\nyeah get up on those get up on the swing time high hat we we watched a viva las vegas i don't\n\n01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:02.320\nknow if that's a musical but that was a ton of fun i don't know that elvis elvis and margaret\n\n01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:08.000\nviva las vegas that movie's fucking weird that movie ends with a car crash where at least four\n\n01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.640\npeople are murdered and then people they just start singing and it's like no there's the race\n\n01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:23.040\nabsolute a blood there is in the car and and and margaret is in in short shorts and pantyhose\n\n01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.000\nand elvis i think is too it's pretty hot uh i i gotta i gotta i gotta correct you there\n\n01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.680\nshe's not wearing short shorts she's just wearing pantyhose as fucking pants that's right\n\n01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:42.000\nit's black opaque number yeah she's just hanging out in a sweater and pantyhose she had to get on\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.960\nset they had a skirt but she was like i gotta go i gotta go it's starting and then she has like\n\n01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.840\ncrazy dancing style and like like like yeah she's just like on fire yeah like those those movies\n\n01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.880\nare like i i mean well that movie anyway i think maybe it's not true of all i mean i haven't seen\n\n01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:06.800\nclam bake but um i like do the clam do the clam it's interesting some of these movies are like\n\n01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:13.280\ngarbage but like how many other elements other than the things that make a movie garbage if they're\n\n01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:20.160\nall slid up to ten can the movie be good like i've had that affection for zanadu because i'm like\n\n01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.160\nlike everything about zanadu like it seems determined to make this movie bad like it\n\n01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.120\ndoesn't have all these fundamental things that a movie's supposed to have but then it has all of\n\n01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.680\nthese like it's just like all these other dials have been turned up to ten uh uh uh it's it's yeah\n\n01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.400\ni like that's what that's exactly what viva las vegas says you're like this is not a good movie but\n\n01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.200\ni'm having a blast watch it's all the viva las vegas reminds me a lot of zanadu because they're\n\n01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.920\nbecause and i i wouldn't doubt that there was like a lot of influence there because there's the there's\n\n01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:01.120\nthe montage that represents and margaret and uh Elvis falling in love and it's like a montage of like\n\n01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:08.320\nthat involves teleportation time travel like they're just like they're they're just like cowboys and\n\n01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:15.840\nyes oh well let's just spend the day together and like all of a sudden they're like shooting each\n\n01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:21.280\nother in an old west town and there's no explanation for it and it's very much like in zanadu when\n\n01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.600\nit's like they have a thin justification for it where it's like oh i'm getting to know you and\n\n01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.280\nlike let's roller skate through this place where records are made um which of course involves like\n\n01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.040\nall of the you can hit a button and these things will come down and blow fog at you and then you'll\n\n01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:42.080\nturn into a cartoon bird uh it just goes to show you it doesn't fucking matter um the kind of in\n\n01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.000\nand out of like like we don't hold well wait a minute why are they falling in love like like like\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.120\nlike movies that movies that hold themselves to an internal logic only insult us by trying to make it\n\n01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.440\nabout their playlists uh on spotify they're like the 90s version of that where they're like you like\n\n01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:08.240\nthe pixies i like the pixies and then it's like oh so that's supposed to make me believe that you'd\n\n01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.800\ntake a bullet for her that's your version and but then before that it was just like oh well\n\n01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.160\nwe're dancing you know and that's like i don't know we're not gonna bother trying to show you\n\n01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.640\nlogically why it is that you love this person um we're gonna actually just express the feelings\n\n01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:37.520\nthat you have um uh when you when you love that person um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh\n\n01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:47.200\nreally important garbage just what happened what was that i think dan i i i mean this and with all\n\n01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.280\nfondness this has taken me back to meltdown comics because there's that moment when like you would\n\n01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.000\nhave already had a couple kettle ones before the show but then there's that threshold where you get\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.240\ninto complete like uh downhill skiing mode where it's my favorite part of the show here's a\n\n01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.200\nhere's a topic this is this is the last topic that i wrote down it doesn't mean that this is a thing\n\n01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:17.520\nbut um uh my my beautiful niece i think she's four my niece to be whatever the niece of my fiance\n\n01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:24.560\num she's she's in this phase she's been in it for a while she loves dancing she loves singing\n\n01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.720\nshe just performs sometimes she steals her mom's camera and she makes like little videos of herself\n\n01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.440\nsometimes mom is participating and mom's like filming the videos we'll get the videos um\n\n01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:47.040\nand uh she'll be like dancing around and then um uh she'll say at the end of it like if things don't\n\n01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.520\ngo in her mind perfectly because you know she's four so she's she's got some kind of job to do\n\n01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.480\nin her head and i guess that's the thing that's fascinating to me is that at the it like like\n\n01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:02.960\nshe'll do like there'll be this video of her like jumping around the living room\n\n01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.960\nsinging and dancing gibberish doing like this stuff that's just it's just joyful\n\n01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:16.480\nand then at the end of it she'll like go toward the camera if her mom's holding it and be like\n\n01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:25.840\ndelete it she has this like impulse in her that's like and we were just puzzling over that\n\n01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.960\nwas just i was like what wait why delete it like what did she think she did wrong there she's four\n\n01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:38.080\nlike like and um i'm just kind of and i'm not like i was thinking about it today and it was like\n\n01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.920\nit not being cynical about it i think it's an uplifting thing because i don't think that\n\n01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:50.000\nthat's congenital i don't think that human beings are born with shame i think that human beings are\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:00.480\nborn with a like a desire to get everything right and and then we're like constantly monitoring\n\n01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.320\nthe grown-ups around us for cues about because one thing kodi pointed out and kodi's 12 years\n\n01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:12.560\nyounger than me but she and i both agreed like delete it is not in your vocabulary like when\n\n01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:22.000\nwe were kids um there's nothing to delete like god uh you know uh god willing something that\n\n01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.480\nyou could do would be forever whether it's your little handprint in cement or when vhs camcorders\n\n01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.600\ncame out and it was just like we would watch three hours of ourselves like rolling around in the\n\n01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:40.400\ngrass there was no input there was never back then it was like erase that erase that and now\n\n01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:47.760\nthere is four four-year-olds which i think is so interesting and not in a cynical way again i think\n\n01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:55.360\nthey're picking up on this idea that like well they know that information is now there's a surplus\n\n01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:03.360\nof it and they're like no no no no delete that like they're curating it yeah she's like she's\n\n01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.400\nlike don't but i was just trying to figure out what she meant and so i think for her it might\n\n01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.560\nam is like like i think she might have gotten a reaction from her mom that maybe because she\n\n01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:18.880\ndid like a little thing you know like four-year-olds will do she like she like put her sleeve off her\n\n01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.320\nshoulder at the end of her dance and her mom had this reaction that was understandably it was a gas\n\n01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:33.120\nbecause it was like yeah the fuck um what is that and i think that she interpreted that reaction\n\n01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:40.480\nfrom her mom in the very moment was like you touched a hot stove you stood at the top of stairs\n\n01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.880\nyou didn't usually like delete it maybe because then there's another video that like like where\n\n01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:54.240\nher older brother is like doing a performance and then the little sister comes in and interrupts it\n\n01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:01.200\nlike she steals the spotlight and he goes delete it i understand that that's a tantrum that's orson\n\n01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.320\nwelles he's going like i'm trying to make something perfect here and now you may as well throw it away\n\n01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:12.560\nuh that that was like delete it he was saying delete it like you know i hate my sister like\n\n01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.800\nlike i can't believe she came in and ruined my masterpiece that i and i was like oh i would get\n\n01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:25.200\nthat if i was like you would you would wield delete it the same way you would say like okay i\n\n01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:32.640\ndon't want a fire truck then or like you know like throwing it across the room but i like it just like\n\n01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:39.040\ni don't think that we need to get over our shame i think that we need to accept it and realize that\n\n01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:45.040\nwe have it like and we're putting it into our children and like like like she doesn't know what's\n\n01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:50.800\nright or wrong yet she but she already knows that there's such a thing is okay what's going on over\n\n01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:59.200\nhere what okay no i'm not i'm not you finished it but half of it's in the toilet it doesn't count\n\n01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.320\nit's not it's not astounding gonna start over yeah i kind of feel like there's like the developmental\n\n01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:11.040\nstage of a kid at that age kind of thinks oh everyone knows this routine i came up with so they\n\n01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.680\nall realize that i fucked it up like everyone knows i fucked up this routine whereas to you\n\n01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.520\nit looks like a random thing that she's like freeway right like so you think that she thought\n\n01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.640\nthat other kids i guess i don't know her i don't know yeah i don't i don't have enough information\n\n01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.240\nabout who she thinks is gonna see the video and or even just like yeah everyone knows like everyone\n\n01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.480\nknows i messed up that one step so now we have to like do this again i have to delete it but really\n\n01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:44.160\nlike nobody knows you're just flailing you're a child part of me thinks though that like i truly\n\n01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:51.280\nthink that like the big that i think she's so young that i think that um and this is total\n\n01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:58.080\nspeculation but um i think that the the the primary way of her enjoying those videos is that she\n\n01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:05.120\nwatches them back with her mom and i think and i think she has an impulse embedded in her that's\n\n01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:11.520\nlike get rid of the bad one i don't want to watch that one with you again i don't want to witness\n\n01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:18.960\nit with you kind of thing but that's just me simplifying something because from my view her\n\n01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.080\nlife is simple like you said she could have a whole fucking she's got a master plan she's\n\n01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.720\ndoing she's got a whole she's got a whole civilization in her world like she's got best friends and\n\n01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.240\nyeah i didn't thought about that honestly like i don't know four year olds like do they i know\n\n01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:40.000\nthey don't have phones but do they do they do their videos get like circulated among their\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.560\nare they probably oh god that's such a scary thought that's that's a horrifying thought\n\n01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.360\ni don't like it like it's like i'm friends with your mom and your mom texted this video of me\n\n01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.480\nbelly we get dancing we get we get videos of like your friends like daughter singing and stuff\n\n01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:04.400\nwe do yeah but she's like eight nine like she's a little bit older yeah well now but we've been\n\n01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:10.400\ngetting them for years for many years that's right there was this great moment where so can i can i\n\n01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.600\ntalk about this yeah just don't use any games she was a lot younger she's five years old and she's\n\n01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.680\ngot like uh she's got how would you it's benicio del Toro sorry it's the cousin right so it's two\n\n01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.840\nlittle girls right so they're both gonna improvise songs and then making a video and uh the first\n\n01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.800\ngirl sings and they're both five like we know these kids and she's singing she makes up a song\n\n01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:40.720\nshe's like a leaf a tree a horse and it's this beautiful song and then it goes to the and then\n\n01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:49.200\nit goes to the other girl and she's four years old and she she gears up and she sings i am going\n\n01:26:49.200 --> 01:27:07.840\nto kill myself it's one of my favorite videos i watch it maybe\n\n01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.400\nso many times because when you watch it it's a beautiful moment right before she sings where\n\n01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:20.400\nthat hasn't happened to the adults in the room yet like you see it and then the other kids\n\n01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.640\nstarts being like i didn't tell her to say that that was her song i had nothing to do with it\n\n01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.080\nit's insane to me that our perception of children is that we're waiting for them to let us know like\n\n01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.280\nwhat's going on in their heads and sort of like we do perceive them as like receiving instruction\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.560\nfrom us but not on the level that we really are instructing them and not understanding that the\n\n01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:49.200\nentire time that all they're doing is going they're monitoring us and going like i don't know what do\n\n01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:56.640\nyou want for dinner like it it's like and then they they're like we're all like we're just going like\n\n01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.000\nwhere did you come up with that why did you just like come into the room and talk and say that like\n\n01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.640\nweird frasiery thing that where you're it indicates that you're upset with us and you're being passive\n\n01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.960\naggressive like you're sending all these social cues but all they're doing is like studying our\n\n01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.800\neyebrows and our tone of voice and they're just they're just these like giant little spongy brains\n\n01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.520\nthat are like they're just throbbing and going like am i a spartan am i a greek am i am i an\n\n01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.120\neskimo like like you tell me what culture i'm living in and what set of behaviors is going to\n\n01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.640\nimpress you guys and i'll fucking do it and and they're just like mashing at buttons and then we\n\n01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:44.320\nreact to them we go like whoa and then sometimes us reacting like to that triggers shame for them\n\n01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.040\nsometimes it makes them go oh i shouldn't have done that and sometimes it like hits their dopamine\n\n01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:58.240\nspike and they go like oh i i'm gonna be a dj like i just did this thing right like i want to be a\n\n01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.960\nsuperstar i want to blow minds i i feel like i can reach back in my memory and along those\n\n01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:11.040\nbehavioral patterns and go like i learned very quickly like my parents opinion of what i was\n\n01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:19.680\ndoing meant jack shit compared to company like if people are coming over if i can get them to\n\n01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:28.640\nreact in any way my parents are gonna be dragged along like like whether they like it or not they're\n\n01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:35.040\ngonna be like sony and the company is the nielson's like it's just like well i don't get it and we told\n\n01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.360\nthem we don't get it in development but god damn it now it's a hit and like i i feel like i have\n\n01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:48.960\nemotional memories of that experience and i think it's crazy that along with that comes like people\n\n01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.080\nare saying delete it a four-year-old going delete it delete that one that one of me stumbling around\n\n01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.880\nlike a goofball something that when i'm 30 i would i would just drink like nectar because i'll only\n\n01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.320\nhave so much time and like i'll see baby videos of myself and i'll be like oh my god you deleted any\n\n01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:17.120\nof them that four she's like going no burn it put it to send it to the incinerator cut print\n\n01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:24.480\nthat one no delete it like i won't have anyone see that one that's not what happened but i don't\n\n01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:30.880\neven know if they have the same relationship with stuff being permanent like to me like i didn't i\n\n01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.200\nnever even saw a camcorder till i was a teenager so i didn't even like think about that being a\n\n01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.320\npossibility but to grow up with the knowledge that like it could all just like exist forever or maybe\n\n01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.920\nnot maybe it doesn't even mean the same thing to them do you know what i mean like that's what i'm\n\n01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.680\nkind of struggling with like it does you know by delete it does she mean um before it ends up on\n\n01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.760\nfacebook and gets me canceled or does she mean um i don't want that to be part of goodnight moon\n\n01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:04.640\ni i i don't i don't want that to be canon uh yeah that's right i think it's the latter i\n\n01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.960\nthink that's what i think for them it's like i think the kids these days hate getting canceled\n\n01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:21.520\nand they're super aware yeah four-year-olds hate cancel culture i want to i want to so you\n\n01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.880\nknow in this pandemic since in the beginning quarantine i was very very stressed out and\n\n01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:34.800\nthings were is it okay if i change the

text i'm like\n\n01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:57.200\nso excited uh emily and camille because i don't watch a lot of stuff i watch i watch tcm i watch\n\n01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:02.720\nold movies mostly uh and i watch them the same movies a hundred times over uh give me something\n\n01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:08.960\nthat i should be watching something new that you think that i might i might dig oh that's\n\n01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:17.280\nthat's we've watched so much stuff it's a little overwhelming uh something new emily what did we\n\n01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:24.320\nwatch it's it's hard well think think about it because i i just bored the audience to pieces\n\n01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.880\nabout my love of musicals so if you guys have a tp or uh that was very exciting to me also\n\n01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:36.160\ndocumentaries i love it this documentary i haven't seen uh laid on me i feel like all\n\n01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:42.480\nthe documentaries are now is like murder it's probably the husband but maybe not but it is\n\n01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.040\nalways the husband yeah usually it's all true crime docs now i don't i don't i that's i haven't seen\n\n01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:52.240\nany that are not true crime i think that michael jordan one was good and i don't like that was good\n\n01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.800\nyeah yeah that i don't think you i don't think you have to like sports at all to like that\n\n01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:03.600\ndocumentary because it's just it's just about like just a bunch of crazy circumstances and characters\n\n01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:11.200\ni just started the girl in the dale what's that the lady in the veil the lady in the dale and\n\n01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.360\nand it's fascinating have you made it all the way through that one i have not i've not watched that\n\n01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:21.600\none yet but i wanted to i i just watched the first one it's very interesting i yeah and what's the\n\n01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.440\npurpose for those our audience at home uh it's best that you don't know what the premise is it's\n\n01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:35.280\nit's i'll i'll try to it's a it's a con man who is kind of like a catch me if you can kind of a\n\n01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:42.480\nperson that just kind of goes down a row a row of just conning conning conning conning conning\n\n01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:48.320\nand and gets like a moment in the sun in the 70s during like the gas crisis\n\n01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:55.920\nand uh it's like delivering like a this is a new car that's going to save the world\n\n01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:05.520\noh and then and then you find out a lot oh it's so it's like someone trying to\n\n01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.200\nsell an electric vehicle and it seems like it's some sort of elizabeth holmes thing where they\n\n01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.840\ndon't really have it i don't know if it's a little electric it's definitely like that elizabeth\n\n01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:19.200\nholmes thing but it i don't think it's an electric car i think it's just it has it's a car with three\n\n01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:27.520\nwheels so they thought it would use less gas that makes sense one less wheel yeah yeah that's what the\n\n01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:34.080\ngas goes it goes to the wheels it keeps the wheels inflated so i figured with the elizabeth holmes\n\n01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:41.280\nthing is amazing that she was like it's a box that tells you if you have anything um look just make\n\n01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.960\nthe box and then it was like other people are like the inside of the box is tricky because there's uh\n\n01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:52.240\nwe got it this uh it takes your blood and then it takes it inside the box and then showing these\n\n01:35:52.240 --> 01:36:00.880\nanimations and this is blood the kebler elves take it they take it like drop a blood here\n\n01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:16.160\nthere's a bloody box and i don't like that netflix has created a new genre called this should have\n\n01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:27.440\nbeen a 90 minute movie documentary or not and in any case is now a 10 episode series i am offended\n\n01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:36.160\ni am made to feel old i don't like frankly i'm gonna get cancelled for saying it\n\n01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.240\nhere's the thing about one division i know it's not netflix i'm saying i'm talking about streaming\n\n01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:54.240\nnow what netflix has created you wouldn't be able to have a pilot like that in the days when that's\n\n01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.760\ncorrect i like like and i i get it it's like like i understand it's because like oh appointment\n\n01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.560\nviewing and all this stuff but there was a craft to it this makes me feel so old i'm like you can't\n\n01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:15.520\nyou can't just say that on episode three things are gonna start making sense that's not allowed\n\n01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.720\nthey're leading on the marvel name like the marvel name is like trust us yeah i don't like that either\n\n01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.360\ni don't like i don't like that i don't like watching a tv show whose parent company is also\n\n01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:36.880\nlike like they're like oh here be confused something that would get Dan Harmon fired in 2006\n\n01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:44.080\nwhich is just like using a genre to tell a story but like you know fuck you if you want details\n\n01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.520\ngo eat a dick we'll see you in episode two here's five minutes of credits episode two starts\n\n01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.320\nhey here's a little more fuck you sideways fuck you at an angle oh here you go with a\n\n01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:00.320\nepisode three like we'll give you 45 seconds at oh maybe the hulk farted i don't know here's cat\n\n01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.320\ndining show explain it all now meeting with the goddess like this is a pilot it's a pilot\n\n01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:14.720\ncalled one division it's a good pilot but here's the problem you'd have that shit in a half an\n\n01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.240\nhour and your second episode fucking one division have to be fighting corrupt lumberjacks and it\n\n01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:28.480\nhad to be fucking good you see that they see the night stalker uh the nbc or not nbc the Netflix\n\n01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:35.600\nthing you see that yeah kind of kind of a bum bummer i mean the whole thing was kind of like okay\n\n01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:43.680\nwe're going to buy guns like all of them now right oh because you're scared well for me the\n\n01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:50.160\nweird thing was that the two cops that they follow don't do anything they never catch the night\n\n01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.800\nstalker they got the shoe they got the shoe print kumail yeah all they do is over and over get the\n\n01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.360\nsame fucking shoe print and the the document presents them as like the heroes like these are\n\n01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:07.520\nthe two guys they did nothing there was another guy who got like in another town who got the bracelet\n\n01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080\nbeat up a guy the guy was like this is who the night stalker is yeah yeah it was not like\n\n01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.280\ndetecting they were just like oh my god look at that guys i got i'm gonna beat the hell out of you\n\n01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.840\nyeah some other person just beat up somebody and told him who the night stalker was there was no\n\n01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:28.640\nlike detective work going on yeah he killed like 40 people in the same shoe and these guys just\n\n01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:37.120\nlike collected the shoe prints over and over he killed 40 people in the same shoe a rare shoe\n\n01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:43.360\na rare that's our guy that's yeah like this one terrible crimes they're like serialization\n\n01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:51.440\nserialization in television is like gravity it exists it will exist no matter what you do\n\n01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:59.360\nyour job as a tv crafts person is to fight it i feel the same way about serialization and\n\n01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:06.720\nand killers if you want your television story to stay aloft it is by fighting my serialization\n\n01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:15.120\nmodularity episodic-ness that's why it's not a movie isn't it also true that now\n\n01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.000\nwhen you're making a show for like NBC it's got a it's it's everybody's got that but if you've\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.360\nbought the streaming service you're already in the pocket for whatever they're putting on so\n\n01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.320\nthat's what i don't like is that these kids now are going like here's my pitch for a show\n\n01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:38.400\nin episode one there's a zombie and then you and then it's like whoa what's with the zombie but\n\n01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.840\nalso he has a wedding ring and then um he takes a shit and the toilet's like whoa give me the\n\n01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:50.000\nwedding ring and you're like what's going on i'll skip over episode two tell you buy the show but\n\n01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.720\nhere's what happens in episode three here's my point the toilet makes rings that fight zombies\n\n01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:03.040\noh that's a pilot i that's my point is that you can't like that's now how shows are being pitched\n\n01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:08.560\nlike like the market has been inflated people are like now pitching streaming services they're\n\n01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:14.880\ngoing i have a pitch for a show for you and they pitch a 10 episode story where they include and\n\n01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:21.200\ni i'm not just farting out of my butthole here i'm that's what that's what streaming services want\n\n01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.640\nthough i think i've i've been developing well yeah i know because they keep buying this shit yeah but no\n\n01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:32.320\nbut they actually went well like can you add some some serialized ellen like they want it like they\n\n01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.880\nwanted to see more more stuff yeah and they're like slow down whoa what do you mean morc and\n\n01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:52.400\nMindy slow down episode one is morc and then episode four season one is Mindy like and there's an egg\n\n01:41:52.400 --> 01:42:00.480\nin the yard and it's like what's with that egg like that's the problem is that i like like like\n\n01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:07.120\nit's it's like there used to be this like for bad reasons there was good things happening which was\n\n01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:14.000\nlike we got to keep this audience we have to assume the customer is always right the customer in tv\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:23.360\nis an asshole who has no shits to give tuning in at any moment in your half hour of derivative\n\n01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.720\ngarbage and they could leave it any second and you got to hook them you got to hook them with\n\n01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.200\nfucking craft mama jamma and i think there's something i can't shake like the goodness of\n\n01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:41.040\nthat when i watch these shows where i'm like when i watch wandavision i go like this production\n\n01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.920\ndesign is amazing there's genius happening here i've seen a lot of people homage\n\n01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:57.280\nthe 50s air of television this makeup and these sets and the cinematography this is like\n\n01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:06.480\ngreat and but i'm like god damn it um oh wait you did you cringe rub you disagree you're like\n\n01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.880\noh no oh you're cringing because you're like i can't believe he's going after wandavision\n\n01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:20.400\nwhy no i haven't seen i don't i i was just i'm just saying man i'm bored a little i i'm sorry\n\n01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.600\ni got you guys just a little bit more yeah i mean i haven't seen the show i mean i wasn't going to\n\n01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:33.520\nwatch it but the old chit chat since we're on the topic of like disney plus like anybody's\n\n01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.520\ngoing doing the deep dive on uh the cat from outer space or the shaggy da or any any of that\n\n01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.360\nshit like kate didn't know any of that stuff i said oh we gotta watch the cat from outer space\n\n01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:53.120\nand i put it on in like two seconds in she's like going fuck this movie what about like do they have\n\n01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:59.120\nlike the computer war tennis shoes and all those things yeah they have that they have like escape\n\n01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:08.000\nto which bar that is a weird time of of of disney where they were just like trying to figure it out\n\n01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.720\nit's like you're like bunch of premises it was a lot of premises yeah it's really strange you see\n\n01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:22.640\nlike one of the cat from space yeah cat from outer space he's got a magic necklace that makes him\n\n01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.920\nmove shit around and his lips don't move when he talks and hey you know that was like a million\n\n01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.320\ndollar something or the goose with the golden something like that there was one like that\n\n01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:39.840\nyeah i watched all those yeah wasn't court rustling like 15 of them oh yeah they had actors in the\n\n01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:46.000\nstable it's like kurt rustle was like friend jody foster too uh who else there was another guy that\n\n01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.960\nwas in like all those disney movies and like he and kurt rustle were buddies because frank johnson\n\n01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.080\nanother famous guy and it was like because they were just disney property and they would just be\n\n01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:03.440\nin these movies i can't remember who the other that's like when carpenter was a million dollar duck\n\n01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:08.640\nyeah that's what yeah it was a million dollar duck that's exactly the one i was trying to take\n\n01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.720\nyeah yeah it's just like the love bug and stuff combine them yeah car that talks here you go cat\n\n01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:22.800\nfrom space here you go guy got really smart here you go yeah make a movie come on make a new one\n\n01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.400\nwhat's a new one right now go do it good oh my god a dog he is a serial killer\n\n01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:38.320\nthat dog he's a serial killer it's not i mean that's it's not kujo because it's like the dog is\n\n01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.480\nthe dog has an m o the dog has a signature like the dog is doing it for a reason that's the day\n\n01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:50.480\nit would be interesting like we found urine all over this body it's the third time with\n\n01:45:50.480 --> 01:46:00.320\nsomeone beat all over this guy i think it's called the best friend of sam that's that what\n\n01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.400\nhave you did like one in that style with that music and like the same like voice casting and\n\n01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:14.800\nstuff like that and the the dog is walking around it's like wow what about her what about her that's\n\n01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:23.120\nbut right yeah do you guys think dogs understand the length of the walk because i feel like sometimes\n\n01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:30.160\nCody and i are like i got too much going on yeah me too and like we'll take them on our what we call\n\n01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.000\nthe short walk which is we take them down you're tricking them you're tricking them into thinking\n\n01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.320\nthat they've done the full walk when they actually don't think that they their behavior to me seems\n\n01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.000\nlike they if they don't get the walk they start going out of their goddamn minds but then it\n\n01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:51.120\ndoesn't matter i think it's a human thing that it'd be like that walk was hardly anything like the\n\n01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:56.320\nritual of harnessing them up and taking them out like like i'll take them down to a cul-de-sac and\n\n01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:05.840\nwe bring them back up cul-de-sac what am i fucking all of this um let it go uh the the but or we'll\n\n01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.640\ntake them around the block but the 85 000 blocks like they act the same when we bring them back\n\n01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.560\nthey're never like that's their television that's their tv yeah but they don't they if they get if\n\n01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:22.000\nthey get two minutes of night writer as opposed to 22 minutes to they act as if they've seen a whole\n\n01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.920\nepisode of night writer that's why they press where they're like this walk didn't have the full story\n\n01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.880\ni don't want to go third walk it feels like you just like sniff shit and i'm like like like all\n\n01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:36.720\nsometimes i'll let them sniff shit until they're done i always do Cody's like she'll she's not above\n\n01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.960\nlike come on and i'm like how whoa but like they'll sniff shit and then like you take them around\n\n01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.600\nthey're just sniffing shit they're barking at other dogs then they get back home and they're like\n\n01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:54.320\nthank you like before that they're like you would think that you were killing them by not taking\n\n01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:03.680\nthem for a walk they're like and then like you but you could take them for like a two second walk\n\n01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:10.640\nand then they're like they're like combined it's a binary i'm exhausted like they don't it's like\n\n01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.120\nthey have like a circadian rhythm or whatever you call it they they understand days but they\n\n01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.920\ndon't understand hours i think it's similar just sounds like dan go ahead emily i think it's similar\n\n01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:27.760\nto like ladies like me for instance going out sometimes we're like getting ready to go out\n\n01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.360\nit's like the most fun part of the night and then you get there and you're like this sucks why am i\n\n01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.000\nhere and then you're like i can just leave now so the putting on of the harness that like that\n\n01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.880\nlike anticipation that's the money shot the rest of it is like kind of useless maybe that makes sense\n\n01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:48.720\nthat i mean that that that makes me able to relate to it too i think i felt that way too about going\n\n01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:54.240\nout where i'm like i don't need to be out for six hours just because i haven't been out for six months\n\n01:48:54.240 --> 01:49:00.880\nit's i do need to have gone out it's like a punctuation i need to have gone out that's that's\n\n01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.080\nwhat it is i need to emily always says she's like the best part is having said that you went to the\n\n01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:12.480\nparty yeah it's like it's like that's the typewriter going like at the end of a otherwise you're just\n\n01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.640\nlike typing forever and it would the dog the dog is perceiving that the typewriter cylinder is\n\n01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:24.480\nis going out the door there i made it understandable with my metaphor\n\n01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:34.640\nwith my keen understanding of old-timey typewriters and dogs i have i have as a lot of the situation\n\n01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.800\neveryone gets it now dan have you still been playing death stranding ever have you stopped have you\n\n01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:49.920\ngiven up i stopped death stranding drove me back into woodwork um was it the problem that it was\n\n01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:57.840\njust that the game is walking and trying to balance and it's like that's the game i'm not sure\n\n01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:06.400\nthere's a here's an alternate theory i was i i had peaked with satisfactory and like whatever game\n\n01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:13.280\ni played next was going to be like just whatever wait what's satisfactory it's like minecraft but\n\n01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:21.600\nyou just make machines and factories it's really good oh it's the best it's really good satisfactory\n\n01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.240\nyou make like a mining machine that pulls iron out of the ground and you process\n\n01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:36.720\nwith the status factory yeah the name i you know yeah uh but um it's it's so great yeah it's just\n\n01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:44.400\nlike that's yeah we're playing hickman the new hit man it's really and we're doing lego we're\n\n01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.520\nputting lego stuff together yeah we've made it next to one and now we're making a batwing

complexes that are submerged it's like it's crazy how different it\n\n01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.320\nis from like really you know yeah i mean did they add anything like like would they just add to\n\n01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:28.480\nvanilla minecraft just add like a little bit of hopper functionality where you could like sort things\n\n01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.960\nthey still don't have that

--> 01:59:55.200\nit's a little cross from the drawing room that's behind i wasn't gonna say so Emily but yes it is\n\n01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:02.560\nthat's because they they kept expanding and they kept making it look more like a home but if you\n\n02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:07.200\nwalked in there which you can't because the door's never open but you look in the yes they do have\n\n02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.640\nthree or four tvs and it looks like maybe somebody in there is slightly interested in\n\n02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.120\nthe tv repair trade however call them on the phone and ask them uh for a quote and i think they really\n\n02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:25.360\nwant you to go fuck off and then ask whether you know they want to go look for their heroin\n\n02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:29.520\nheroin shipment or something i feel like a whole strip mall across from the drawing room\n\n02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:36.640\nincluding yield rustic like that entire strip mall is just like like ben afleck's character in the\n\n02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.240\naccountant like is just like keeping the whole thing going it's like oh there's like a apple repair\n\n02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:49.760\nstore that never has any any cables and then there's like a realty place that and then there's a\n\n02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.880\nyou know there's like an art also there's like an art studio that sells clothes on occasion i don't\n\n02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:01.200\nit doesn't make any sense well now those are all gone all there remains is these the strange uh\n\n02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:08.160\nuh like real estate like sotheby's or whatever the hell yes i guess right you've never seen anybody\n\n02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:14.880\ngo in or out of that building that is certainly a
