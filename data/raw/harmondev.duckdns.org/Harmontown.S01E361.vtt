02:22.480 --> 02:27.280
come on where are you going let's let's let's let's welcome out the mayor of Harmontown uh his

02:27.280 --> 02:32.400
his name is most of the title of the show and he is the most of the show's this let's bring out the

02:32.400 --> 02:51.920
mayor of Harmontown dan i'm sorry uh mr batman we were we were i somehow you got invited into our

02:51.920 --> 03:03.040
zoom green room we're looking for Dan Harmon oh sorry uh i am the night both with an n and a k

03:03.920 --> 03:09.760
it works both ways i am the night in both ways i just found this in my closet here

03:11.600 --> 03:19.040
oh shit it's me it was me the whole time why did you have that where'd you get that uh i

03:19.040 --> 03:26.240
my new assistant clara uh when she did this closet she was asking me what's your dream closet i was

03:26.240 --> 03:30.720
like i would want to i want to be like bruce wane when i you know when i go into my closet in the

03:30.720 --> 03:38.800
morning like i want to feel like like i'm getting ready you know to uh do important things and stuff

03:38.800 --> 03:45.600
and so you know she did a bunch of cool stuff to the closet but um then to kind of as a flourish

03:45.600 --> 03:52.560
she put a bat cowl up on one of the shelves and that's the first that's the first time it's been used

03:54.560 --> 03:58.480
so you're sitting in one of your several walk-in closets and that's that's probably a good idea

03:58.480 --> 04:05.440
you get nice audio in there probably yeah the the the clothes blocks the um stuff i can i can

04:05.440 --> 04:11.600
heat myself up a little bit if you want and that could be lighting wise oh i thought you

04:11.600 --> 04:14.640
meant like entertain i think you meant like entertainment wise like you're gonna you're

04:14.640 --> 04:22.080
gonna heat it up i can heat it give me heat it up too that way i will in a second um i just

04:22.080 --> 04:27.600
there's light that there's lights in this closet that uh they shoot straight down so when they're

04:27.600 --> 04:33.680
on everything becomes very shadowy so i hope this is appropriate you look great i like the

04:33.680 --> 04:38.640
fact that you're sitting you're sitting in a closet full of clothes and that you've you've

04:38.640 --> 04:42.960
gone with this vanguly t-shirt you just kept it simple even though all of the options are available

04:42.960 --> 04:48.640
to you well it's not yeah it's tragically it's one of the few shirts that fits me comfortably now

04:49.520 --> 04:55.840
um yeah yeah yeah that that's that's the same with my dress shirts and my suits i've bought

04:55.840 --> 05:03.200
suits and shirts over the years at very varying stages of beer belly so i've gone back to like

05:03.200 --> 05:10.400
like like early two like two thousands so i'm breaking up some old some old some old classics

05:10.400 --> 05:15.280
none of my pants fit basically i just have like a rotation of athletic shorts now and

05:15.280 --> 05:21.920
like nothing else that i have is bottom wear fits it's it's a real issue uh it's it's no good

05:21.920 --> 05:27.680
how has your pandemic been spent sir other than that you know what's been sad about the pandemic

05:27.680 --> 05:32.480
is how little i've been affected by it it's like well this was what my life was like

05:32.480 --> 05:38.080
and actually that is profoundly sad that's kind of like sadder than like it'd be like oh i can't

05:38.080 --> 05:43.360
go to the gym like i used to it's like no this is this is about normal have the same basic amount

05:43.360 --> 05:48.720
of contact with people you know and it's like man my life is just disgusting and empty and if it

05:48.720 --> 05:53.920
ever comes back i should you know turn away from that pathetic lifestyle and try and live lead a

05:53.920 --> 05:59.520
filling life going forward yeah that hit me for the first half of it when i was like oh i'm flourishing

05:59.520 --> 06:04.640
that's really bad and then i so then i kind of ironically stopped doing a lot of the stuff that

06:04.640 --> 06:10.400
i was doing pre-pandemic that would be totally pandemic compatible like working out on instagram

06:10.400 --> 06:16.240
and stuff like that like everything just fell away because i kind of i think i think yeah i just

06:16.240 --> 06:22.640
kind of went into a low energy mode or something but i've been feeling i've been feeling a comeback

06:22.640 --> 06:30.240
i think i just go in cycles and stuff yeah um yeah well this is the show folks i mean it's

06:30.240 --> 06:37.040
what it always was it's just people uh hanging out it's not really there's nothing nothing good about

06:37.040 --> 06:42.480
it do you have any big rants built up from years off or are you getting those out in like the

06:42.480 --> 06:46.880
writer's room or yeah what's what's what's what's what's got your hackles up over the over the last

06:46.880 --> 06:54.160
so what's in the news dan that that's that's that you've you've got bones to pick or i uh i don't

06:54.160 --> 06:58.400
really you know i don't really have anything i'm i'm really sorry to tell you that but that's good

06:58.400 --> 07:02.160
news for our guests because then we don't have to they don't have to wait through some kind of like

07:02.160 --> 07:09.680
supposed monologue that i had one thought about like uh you know uh i don't even think this is

07:09.680 --> 07:18.000
gonna track but i i i you know i i keep joking with Cody like what are you gonna do leave me you

07:18.000 --> 07:24.320
know like during the pandemic like it's it's kind of like and then i but it's a very real thing that

07:24.320 --> 07:29.360
i keep thinking like you know you gotta get out in front of the pandemic ending because there's

07:29.360 --> 07:35.680
gonna be there's gonna be like the i picture the street will be filled with pandemic suitors

07:35.680 --> 07:41.680
like it'll be kind of almost a reverse ulysses thing where there's just gonna be all these

07:41.680 --> 07:48.240
horny guys like flooding the streets and and kind of like call they're gonna know that they're

07:49.200 --> 07:56.880
they're they can call out to like a city full of mistreated women um they're gonna they're they're

07:56.880 --> 08:02.560
they're extroverts themselves and they've been like you know languishing indoors and not being

08:02.560 --> 08:07.360
able to go to bars and hit on people and stuff and all of those people are gonna like run into the

08:07.920 --> 08:14.640
streets like uh like milk and honey and then so it's like i think now is the time if you've been

08:14.640 --> 08:20.560
kind of taking your lover for granted you should probably start pretending the pandemics over in

08:20.560 --> 08:28.080
terms of how many times a week you shower and stuff like that yeah i i've i've i've let myself go i

08:28.080 --> 08:34.400
put a suit on when i do one of these shows but i'm generally i've been wearing the same pair of jeans

08:34.400 --> 08:40.560
i think since march and i put a suit on very very seldomly uh usually just for things like this

08:40.560 --> 08:45.920
and it's the first time since i was like a little boy that i actually blew one of the knees out in

08:45.920 --> 08:52.240
my jeans i have ripped jeans now apparently i've i've gone to scott bayo status uh during the

08:52.240 --> 09:02.960
pandemic and i and uh it's it's it's not good i i there's two uh liquor stores in town that i i

09:02.960 --> 09:06.960
don't even think they're happy to see me anymore i think they feel bad for me i walk in and keep

09:06.960 --> 09:12.480
getting more for net bronca and they're like yeah it's okay they're like oh a great customer they're

09:12.480 --> 09:19.120
like you need to fucking go to the gym and maybe you know see somebody i don't i don't go anywhere

09:19.120 --> 09:24.160
i even know that i i yeah i don't uh there's a there's lots of people out there that are just

09:24.160 --> 09:28.240
kind of splitting the difference i guess they're they're going places and doing stuff

09:29.600 --> 09:34.720
so you know i i think i think i was exposed to it very early on because laura my ex-girlfriend

09:34.720 --> 09:40.480
and uh and very good friend still uh we were in italy together and we thought that she got really

09:40.480 --> 09:47.440
sick and we thought that she had west nile fever not west nile virus or west nile fever

09:47.440 --> 09:54.320
and now looking back on it because it was i think december or january in uh january in italy

09:54.320 --> 10:00.080
which became an instant hotspot for for covid that her symptoms were absolutely covid symptoms

10:00.080 --> 10:05.840
and then i was with her the whole time so i think i was exposed to it and was asymptomatic and didn't

10:05.840 --> 10:11.520
ever you know didn't really ever have it so i'm fucking bulletproof i'm the real matman here

10:11.520 --> 10:17.760
here of course jeff's fucking immune to the coronavirus a fucking course yeah i've been

10:17.760 --> 10:23.600
i've been out banging elderly people that old folks um since about april i'm still confused

10:23.600 --> 10:31.600
about the rules though like for my understanding of it even pre-vaccine is well don't get it

10:32.560 --> 10:39.120
don't risk getting it like like when people are like well if i get it all just uh i don't care

10:39.120 --> 10:43.120
i should have a right to no it's not about you it's about you being an antenna for this thing

10:43.120 --> 10:50.000
is going to kill an old woman you don't know and uh but my big question is uh what what what what

10:50.000 --> 10:55.520
what's with the uh with the vaccine like if you get the vaccine i still i still don't understand

10:55.520 --> 11:02.080
if i get vaccinated tomorrow can i still give can i still carry the yeah the the virus and then

11:02.080 --> 11:06.400
give it to other people who are still gonna get sick because that that's that's that's pretty much

11:06.400 --> 11:11.920
identical to not getting a vaccine as far as the vaccine it supposedly just kind of prevent

11:11.920 --> 11:16.400
prevents a worse version of the illness so you could still get sick you could still be taken

11:16.400 --> 11:22.160
out for like months but you probably won't end up at the hospital and have death i don't even

11:22.160 --> 11:27.200
know how clear it is on like whether yourself or long-term effects like lung damage or whatever

11:27.200 --> 11:32.080
you might still even get that but yeah it's definitely not ideal but it's supposed to

11:32.080 --> 11:36.800
help prevent death which is the best you know the biggest thing but you can see guys i'm really

11:36.800 --> 11:41.920
sorry i know i shouldn't be butting in right now but uh i think spencer is wrong about the vaccine

11:41.920 --> 11:46.720
but i'll come in later and talk about it because i've read a lot about this okay i'd love to be

11:46.720 --> 11:52.480
long i think we should bring yeah i have a couple of things to say about that too so uh but when

11:52.480 --> 11:56.480

on the science of trans uh transmission after having the vaccination yes it's uh it's uh don't do it

12:52.240 --> 13:00.640
i'm just never uh leaving again i i i can't wait for people to try to tell me hey we really

13:00.640 --> 13:06.080

18:11.040 --> 18:27.520
hello wow oh my god hi everybody how exciting look at all these beautiful faces

18:29.440 --> 18:36.640
are you guys just emily you look like you just emerged from a very successful like 80s like uh

18:36.640 --> 18:42.720
uh rock video you look fantastic that's correct that is correct i i was on a motorcycle i was

18:42.720 --> 18:47.360
shaking around i did some stuff on a hood um i think it's gonna turn out well we'll see

18:48.560 --> 18:52.640
yeah your hair your hair is tremendous you got this gauzy lighting it's very it's working

18:53.200 --> 18:57.280
the gauzy lighting is because your camera lens is dirty probably watch this

18:58.880 --> 19:02.640
on gauzy it'll get dream lighting what are you are you cleaning with your hair

19:02.640 --> 19:11.440
yeah that was her shirt no they're animal print the top yeah it's not dream anymore dream lighting

19:11.440 --> 19:17.920
are you guys in the same time zone as us and each other yeah she's right over the break on harming

19:17.920 --> 19:25.680
town we want to we want to announce our divorce on the show i was gonna say like that we you know we

19:25.680 --> 19:32.800
were like uh there's like boxes in the background or chamele's shot and it's like the word dishes

19:32.800 --> 19:41.520
and it's written sarcastically they could just tell like you dumb dishes and we just occasionally

19:41.520 --> 19:46.400
get glimpses in emily's background of a very hot yoga instructor guy with no shirt on with like a

19:46.400 --> 19:53.840
man bun yeah he's bringing he's bringing her out like mango lassies and teas and stuff like that

19:53.840 --> 19:57.600
yeah and i just have faces drawn on my walls that are my new friend

20:00.400 --> 20:07.600
first of all i want to say uh sorry to butt in on the vaccine thing no i want to know i feel like

20:07.600 --> 20:15.280
there has been uh it's been communicated so badly so poorly so the vaccines are really really

20:15.280 --> 20:21.120
really really good people should take them they haven't like finished the studies yet but the

20:21.120 --> 20:28.240
science says that when you have the vaccine you likely will not uh spread it and um uh

20:28.240 --> 20:33.920
there was a thing came out today in israeli study that that 90 percent uh it reduces transmission

20:33.920 --> 20:40.720
by 90 percent and they're gonna peer review it but the scientists are pretty confident that once

20:40.720 --> 20:45.600
you get this vaccine you can't spread the virus either they neutralize it it's not just that you

20:45.600 --> 20:51.680
don't have the effects uh you don't it's not just that you don't get the symptoms of it you it kills

20:51.680 --> 20:57.920
the virus and when this is 95 effective that means the other five percent that get it have very

20:57.920 --> 21:04.000
mild cases and nobody ended up in the hospital out of like tens of thousands of people when this is

21:04.000 --> 21:08.720
serious case that was somebody who had like a fever for a week so these vaccines are amazing so i just

21:08.720 --> 21:12.720
i feel everything he's saying is true but also now you see why we had to get divorced

21:12.720 --> 21:21.120
he won't stop talking about this vaccine yes yes i always said camille was past the butter

21:21.120 --> 21:28.240
and then anyway these these vaccines are really good guys we we got to get it i'm specifically

21:28.240 --> 21:39.040
talking about Nanjianimax the vaccine it's my it's my go find me go to Nanjiani.tv.biz

21:39.040 --> 21:44.480
we'll come to you we will come to you i've got the formula i just need the infrastructure to

21:44.480 --> 21:50.880
produce millions of doses i've got five i took two bagel got three and we didn't deserve it

21:52.160 --> 21:57.840
well that's good news and it is interesting how i mean like obviously i sometimes i think it's

21:57.840 --> 22:05.920
kind of a fortunate thing that the disease dropped during the administration of the fake news guy

22:05.920 --> 22:14.480
and that the problematic portion of our little melting pot like the kinds of people that even

22:14.480 --> 22:20.640
before like way back in the way back we used to laugh at them because they were anti-vax

22:21.360 --> 22:28.720
um like it's kind of nice that they were put in a position uh where they had to be like

22:28.720 --> 22:36.160
what disease and then because now the vaccine rolling out which is going to inevitably be you

22:36.160 --> 22:40.080
know it's not going to work right for everybody it's because there's going to be like big time like

22:41.920 --> 22:46.400
like like you know it's a it's a life-saving vaccine that now has to be rolled out in a time

22:46.400 --> 22:53.680
of crisis and like it could have been a real political like uh like catastrophe if it weren't

22:53.680 --> 22:58.960
for the fact that it kind of got pre-lapped in i don't know sometimes i think it's nice how that

22:58.960 --> 23:05.360
stuff works well something like 50 of people eligible to get the vaccine are refusing it so

23:05.360 --> 23:10.400
it's not like this miracle rollout or everyone's buying into it right no i know i know i guess i

23:10.400 --> 23:14.880
guess i yeah i'm not discounting that fact i didn't mean to imply that because of the timing of all

23:14.880 --> 23:18.400
this all those people are going to be smart now or that they're going to take their vaccine

23:19.120 --> 23:22.880
i just think i don't i'm not even sure quite what i'm saying i was hoping maybe you guys would

23:22.880 --> 23:27.680
take it and turn it into a smarter thought i do think they should have they should have hired

23:27.680 --> 23:32.480
a pr firm to like do some sort of like an information campaign about it which they didn't

23:32.480 --> 23:39.440
even feel like there's been not enough yeah i do i feel optimistic that as more people get it and we

23:39.440 --> 23:44.160
don't have side effects and transmission goes down and people see it's effective that vaccine

23:44.160 --> 23:49.920
hesitancy will end but emily's right there should have been more work like hey these vaccines are

23:49.920 --> 23:54.240
really really good instead of when you get the vaccine you're still gonna have to wear a mask

23:54.240 --> 24:00.400
we've really queefed the back when it comes to like the pr on this rollout and the last place

24:00.400 --> 24:08.000
you want to queef is the bed well i mean where is the first place yeah where do you want to queef

24:08.000 --> 24:13.520
well in the renaissance they had those special like bird beak shaped things for the ladies that

24:13.520 --> 24:18.480
were like they were they were filled with lilac and other herbs that were supposedly filtering the

24:18.480 --> 24:24.320
water that's good i was going to say hot tub i think you want to queef the hot tub yeah it's

24:24.320 --> 24:30.240
the perfect crime there's no victims it's a victimless crime honestly you're just helping

24:30.240 --> 24:36.400
the hot tub do what it does yes you're basically like you're you're you're given a fist bump to

24:36.400 --> 24:44.560
the jets you're like keep keep it going i like i like your style i got you i got you i have i

24:44.560 --> 24:51.440
have another thought i was thinking today uh you know like 20 years from now even though 20 years

24:51.440 --> 24:55.840
from now there probably won't be movies and tv as we understand it there'll be holograms and

24:55.840 --> 25:00.960
pokemons and whatever but whatever the movies and tv of tomorrow whatever popular culture is and

25:00.960 --> 25:05.760
there'll be people telling stories and there'll be archetypes in those stories like an archetype

25:05.760 --> 25:14.320
20 years from now in certain stories will be the cancelled actor from the from the early 21st century

25:14.320 --> 25:20.480
like like there'll be like there'll be like these characters in like uh movies where like like

25:20.480 --> 25:26.160
there'll be like an older character and then there'll be like a kind of like fallen from grace

25:26.160 --> 25:30.800
mentor and the person will be like what who are you what happened to you and then the like the

25:30.800 --> 25:35.360
call to adventure or threshold will be somebody going like that's that's Olivia johnson she got

25:35.360 --> 25:42.240
cancelled um back back in the cancellation days and like like it won't like it'll be like being

25:42.240 --> 25:46.480
yeah it's like it won't the point won't be that she shouldn't have been or should have been but

25:46.480 --> 25:50.960
the point will be that she she didn't get to be who she was or whatever and that's why she's such a

25:50.960 --> 25:56.800
great acting teacher like whatever the roger rabbit reboot will be it's like instead of the dip

25:56.800 --> 26:07.360
it'll be like the cancel um barrel the cancel me and they'll put that shoe in yeah you did the

26:07.360 --> 26:14.640
squeaky shoes in the cancel barrel and oh fuck that prediction i disagree with but i can live with

26:14.640 --> 26:26.080
that what are you what the fuck is that is that sriracha what the fuck you got there baby

26:26.080 --> 26:34.240
are you drinking a baby that's like close to the camera or is it huge no no it's my water bottle

26:34.240 --> 26:39.600
oh it's giving me gentle encouragement it's giving me gentle encouragement i don't know

26:39.600 --> 26:45.040
if you could see it it's reverse on mine but it says only remember your goal that you got a lot

26:45.040 --> 26:50.960
of work to do keep i know i'm way behind but that's because i'm fucking around with you guys yes and

26:50.960 --> 26:58.480
and the very bottom the very bottom level says urinary tract infection you can drink too much

26:58.480 --> 27:05.920
water no that's not true it is my grandmother was hospitalized for drinking too much water

27:05.920 --> 27:11.040
i didn't even understand she was trying to win a switch for her kids and instead she died or a

27:11.040 --> 27:17.440
we a nintendo we oh that's it that that works because when you drink a lot of water you we

27:17.440 --> 27:26.480
right hello okay me man i hold it in quarantine's been tough no what you don't see on the bottom of

27:26.480 --> 27:31.600
the Schrab's giant tub of water is there's a catheter that pumps as you're in right back into it it's

27:31.600 --> 27:39.360
just a cyclical flow no that's not true keep chugging keep calling your goal feeling awesome

27:41.600 --> 27:49.280
yeah i get feeling awesome you guys are gonna be so jealous when i finish this when i finish this

27:49.280 --> 27:56.640
water when i get down to these mountains you guys are gonna be so jealous keep talking i'm

27:56.640 --> 28:04.160
gonna finish it before the end of this podcast place your bets oh my god i would love for that

28:04.160 --> 28:10.720
to happen okay but rob you rob you're you're not allowed just for you man Schrab you're i'll take

28:10.720 --> 28:14.400
that bet but you are not allowed to get up and leave your chair at any time you have to stay in

28:14.400 --> 28:24.000
the seat oh i'm 51 man this is gonna be awkward so do you guys open open question for the table

28:24.960 --> 28:31.280
who identifies as an introvert versus an extrovert like and and have you noticed like

28:31.280 --> 28:37.600
surely you've reconciled that with the pandemic have you ever have you gone like i i am languishing

28:37.600 --> 28:45.120
here because i get my batteries charged by other people and it sucks versus you know and i like

28:45.120 --> 28:49.120
spencer and i were talking about i had speaking for us two introverts i think like it's not like

28:49.120 --> 28:53.840
you talk to spencer a lot like like no i haven't seen him and we're we've been on the phone we're

28:53.840 --> 28:59.760
both introverts we haven't spoken a couple hours each day it's important to us to touch base you

28:59.760 --> 29:05.840
know when did you talk to him the only reason we've seen we're seeing each other now is because

29:05.840 --> 29:12.000
the one extrovert here decided we needed to do a reunion show because he's like a he's like a

29:12.000 --> 29:22.480
fern planted on a desert this is a fucking guy hey literally your best friend okay because i don't

29:22.480 --> 29:26.800
know if emily emily and kumail like i wouldn't know between the two of you like if one if either of

29:26.800 --> 29:33.520
you or you know like it wouldn't shock me if you went emily's on the right emily what do you say

29:33.520 --> 29:38.080
maybe for one of you i'm i'm definitely more of an introvert in that i like doing social stuff but

29:38.080 --> 29:43.600
it makes me very tired and so similarly to spencer my life and i do most of my work at home so my

29:43.600 --> 29:49.520
life did not change a lot when this started the only thing that changed was me being like i guess

29:49.520 --> 29:53.840
i should like schedule a lunch with some friends because i think of everything like the stems

29:53.840 --> 30:00.000
and i'm like regular contact that's how you keep your friends so you did so so i'd say you you

30:00.000 --> 30:04.560
get you kind of forced yourself to do that like like like had like play dates and stuff

30:04.560 --> 30:10.800
and i knew oh that's something you did before not during yeah no we haven't seen anybody yeah we

30:10.800 --> 30:16.400
don't see anybody but before i would have to like force myself and i would still enjoy it like i

30:16.400 --> 30:20.640
but like it would be like a it wasn't a thing that my heart was like i'm yearning for a lunch

30:20.640 --> 30:28.000
with a friend um but i would always like it when i did it i think i never i never realized how much

30:28.000 --> 30:38.400
of the part of me that would go out was doing it for fear of ostracization some kind of indirect

30:38.400 --> 30:43.440
like just thinking like i don't want to be the person that everyone stops inviting to things

30:43.440 --> 30:49.600
i don't want to it and it's not a case of whether or not that's good or bad or healthy or unhealthy

30:49.600 --> 30:54.880
but it's just amazing to take all of that out of the spreadsheet and how much it was like

30:54.880 --> 31:02.240
it didn't make me instantly happy um i don't wake up every day happier than i what yeah a little

31:02.240 --> 31:09.440
probably like five ten percent happier like fucking pandemic rules but um just as a baseline but um

31:10.000 --> 31:15.120
but but just like the amount of like it's just like weight off the shoulders like it's kind of

31:15.120 --> 31:21.040
amazing to me and i think that's a healthy thing because i don't think my extroverted friends

31:21.040 --> 31:25.520
would if i had ever told them that that was going on in my head the first thing they would have said

31:25.520 --> 31:31.760
is don't do that to us or yourself don't be thinking that stuff like uh like we don't want you

31:32.560 --> 31:38.480
making calculations about whether you should come join us at a bar and like you're thinking about

31:38.480 --> 31:45.920
whether if you do your life or this or that like god damn we do it because we're extroverts and we

31:45.920 --> 31:53.760
were extroverts and we have fun and now like if the pandemic has an end to it um like i can now

31:53.760 --> 31:59.520
think clearly i think about like a little more clearly about who i am and what i want um and

31:59.520 --> 32:04.560
not burden other people with my bullshit about like what what i'm trying to accomplish with them

32:05.520 --> 32:12.560
can i can i disagree with you on one thing there all i said was my feelings no no no you

32:12.560 --> 32:19.120
were saying that your that your friends probably are like no don't do it for us i'm not like that

32:19.120 --> 32:23.920
i'm like whatever math you have to do to like come out and hang out with me i'm happy with that

32:23.920 --> 32:27.760
same with Schrab you know like i would see Schrab at parties and then he would want to leave early

32:27.760 --> 32:32.400
and i would guilt him into trying to stay because i i wanted to hang out with you guys because that's

32:32.400 --> 32:41.440
how you go yeah i'll grab some guilt so come on are you are you an extrovert come on yeah if i had

32:41.440 --> 32:47.280
to guess if i had to like wager on this i would say that you would have tilted slightly toward

32:48.160 --> 32:53.200
introversion because that's most of my comedy friends tend like like especially stand-up

32:53.200 --> 32:57.440
friends of mine there's a there's a little bit of an introverted part of you but are you are you

32:57.440 --> 33:03.760
kind of both sides of that coin where do you follow that i would say you know uh if you define

33:03.760 --> 33:09.280
introvert by where you get energy from i get energy from being alone or with emily at home like

33:09.280 --> 33:15.200
watching movies and stuff and and hanging out at home but as emily said i do turn into captain

33:15.200 --> 33:20.640
parties so there are sometimes when i'm when i used to be out where i would be like really like

33:20.640 --> 33:26.800
emily was like oh no captain parties out and then i know i'm like gilting people into staying longer

33:26.800 --> 33:32.720
and that kind of stuff so so it was really it was sort of extremes right emily yeah i would say so

33:32.720 --> 33:37.200
but you i've at least taken like i'll take an outdoor walk with a friend every once in a while

33:37.200 --> 33:46.320
you don't see anybody you got you yeah i i'm fully terrified of this thing and i i i have not seen

33:46.320 --> 33:51.600
anybody really that's the thing i'm i'm really scared too but i think like dan i make those

33:51.600 --> 33:56.880
calculations too but i think that they're like i do it because i know it's beneficial to me like

33:56.880 --> 34:00.400
i'm not thinking like oh i should see friends because i don't want them to like think i'm not

34:00.400 --> 34:04.560
around i do it because i'm like i know i'm gonna feel better if i like hang out with someone i like

34:04.560 --> 34:09.120
i know i'm gonna and this isn't the before times and now i know i'm gonna feel better if i like

34:09.120 --> 34:13.360
have a social interaction with someone but i'll be damned if i'm like really tired and don't

34:13.360 --> 34:18.720
really feel like doing it but i i don't do the calculation that like it doesn't feel

34:18.720 --> 34:23.280
sciency to me or like manipulative it just feels like oh i know i'm gonna like this but i'm not

34:23.280 --> 34:27.600
gonna like it up until i get there yeah i mean we have the luxury of following our bliss and in

34:27.600 --> 34:34.080
autumn and it actually intersects with like doing the right thing during a pandemic i i i want to

34:34.080 --> 34:39.680
take this time to put some medals on some chests of some people that that are not in that category

34:39.680 --> 34:47.120
my fiance could you know she's she is a you know on the on that on that whatever enneagram

34:47.840 --> 34:52.480
test or whatever where you get your all your letters and stuff she's a campaigner i don't know

34:52.480 --> 34:57.680
if she's you know she's she's she she recharges with me we hang out in bed we do all these things

34:57.680 --> 35:07.360
but she definitely she she she gets she gets her energy charged by other people and she and uh and

35:07.360 --> 35:14.560
her friend anna kendrick who uh uh like both of them same boat where they're like they're not they

35:14.560 --> 35:18.720
probably don't even know who they are when they're not like hanging out with with with with people

35:18.720 --> 35:25.840
and they regularly get tested because they have a regular hangout and then they and then sometimes

35:25.840 --> 35:30.400
like one of them like their test doesn't come back because there's a windstorm or something and

35:30.400 --> 35:35.760
whatever and they're like they're so committed to it that's actual sacrifice they're like following

35:35.760 --> 35:42.480
their bliss and going like well we gotta we should hang out and but i'll as soon as i'm put up to

35:42.480 --> 35:48.000
you know as soon as there's any test of my will i'll probably falter i like i had my friends over

35:48.000 --> 35:55.200
for election night and like i stopped giving a fuck with i was like i i was wearing a mask when

35:55.200 --> 36:00.160
they came to the door and i had put bowls of chips six feet apart and then it's like by the end of the

36:00.160 --> 36:06.160
night we're just hanging out and like because i'm following my bliss really and it's easy to follow

36:06.160 --> 36:13.520
during a pandemic and there are people out there who are like this fucking sucks but i'm really

36:13.520 --> 36:18.800
going to do the right thing for other people and i'm there i really i'm really impressed by them

36:18.800 --> 36:25.200
yeah is following your bliss being introverted to being okay with it or is following your bliss

36:25.200 --> 36:33.120
being like fuck the pandemic put those chips together uh for well for and now i'm just well

36:33.120 --> 36:42.960
following my bliss is like like i'm i'm i'm like lazy i'm like i'm i like i can following my bliss

36:42.960 --> 36:48.320
will be like i was excited to set up for election night i was like dino and jeff are gonna come over

36:48.320 --> 36:53.680
and i'm gonna i'm gonna it's like a designing a spaceship i'm gonna put the chips over here

36:53.680 --> 36:57.680
and i'm gonna everybody will be able to not touch each other and the cups will be disposable and

36:57.680 --> 37:03.440
all these things but that's because they're only like like there was only like you only had like

37:03.440 --> 37:10.000
two other chairs like when you invited dino house is pretty small i don't know how many people he

37:10.000 --> 37:18.320
could fit dance places it's cozy i would call it cozy yeah cozy yeah i've been there it's uh Schrab you

37:18.320 --> 37:22.720
would never have left the house had you been asked yeah probably were asked yeah it's probably true

37:22.720 --> 37:28.480
i feel like some of my friends who are intro to our introverts that feel guilted into being social

37:28.480 --> 37:33.520
because they feel like that's the thing that you have to do just to not be ostracized or or

37:33.520 --> 37:42.000
eliminated forgotten forgotten forgotten forgotten that they've gotten forgotten it's somebody got

37:42.000 --> 37:48.400
forgotten that they've used they've used their their introversion and their their loved their

37:48.400 --> 37:53.760
love of staying at home as though they really really are it's like safety freaks they don't

37:53.760 --> 37:58.400
like it's like no no no no it's too dangerous to go outside and they're kind of wearing that like

37:58.400 --> 38:02.320
a feather in their hat like they're doing the right things like no you're loving it you don't

38:02.320 --> 38:08.880
never have to do shit yeah that's what i i i try yeah i try to police myself internally of like i

38:08.880 --> 38:14.240
try to like uh are you doing anything difficult that's i like like when i early on when i would

38:14.240 --> 38:22.400
see people on twitter like questioning the quarantine and all that stuff like like my initial reaction

38:22.400 --> 38:28.080
to be like you fucking dick like how dare you that's the problem with this blah blah blah but um

38:28.080 --> 38:34.080
you know and i like i have to remind myself like jesus christ like like like imagine this

38:34.080 --> 38:38.960
sucking for people like when have you ever done anything harmon that hasn't been a

38:38.960 --> 38:47.120
fucking blast for you uh if animation producer now it's a pandemic it's now you can abuse labor

38:47.120 --> 38:54.640
while while you do woodwork in your garage with a fucking tony stark camera system like i i it's fun

38:54.640 --> 39:01.520
like it's not i'm not it's it's it that doesn't mean that i'm not doing what i do for other people

39:01.520 --> 39:06.160
but i always like have to check myself and go like if there's if there's a person out there

39:06.160 --> 39:13.600
that's like i mean it's like i my mind is blown by like how how many people must be just absolutely

39:13.600 --> 39:23.600
fucked in the ear and and if they're getting on twitter and going like you know in the in the

39:23.600 --> 39:28.960
in a flurry of like people like shaming someone for not wearing a mask when they're jogging or

39:28.960 --> 39:32.880
whatever the whatever's happening on twitter because people are engaging in their thing and

39:32.880 --> 39:37.360
like you see some of these then these voices come up and the people that they're you know there's

39:37.360 --> 39:45.840
this agenda to it where they're like that's 99% survival rate and you you you if you parse it

39:45.840 --> 39:52.800
through just them wanting one thing or another to be true that you could get really mad at them

39:52.800 --> 40:00.080
but then i think about like oh what if the what if they're just not socialized to say

40:00.080 --> 40:06.640
this sucks for me like which the ironic thing is like if they would just say that and you see

40:06.640 --> 40:11.040
that all the time in social media when people get broken down into using their eye statements on

40:11.040 --> 40:17.680
accident they finally at the end of a big fight they start being personal and they say what their

40:17.680 --> 40:22.160
deal is oh i'm an electrician and i was in vietnam and i got one leg and i have a thing and it's

40:22.160 --> 40:26.960
like why didn't you just say that in the beginning and the answer is well because i was told that was

40:26.960 --> 40:32.560
weak they sometimes don't connect them they're like well yeah my dad died three weeks ago but

40:32.560 --> 40:36.640
that doesn't have anything to do with this and you're like oh it doesn't yeah does it not well

40:36.640 --> 40:42.480
this is what's really impressive about emily you know so i've like fully turtled up i am terrified

40:42.480 --> 40:47.680
like every night still i have dreams where i'm like i can't find my mask although now every now

40:47.680 --> 40:52.800
and then there's there's nightmares of like when am i going to get the vaccine so hey things are

40:52.800 --> 40:59.280
looking up but you know when we would go on a walk i am very guilty of like judging people and i'm

40:59.280 --> 41:04.960
not think there's a good thing who don't wear masks so i'm that guy but emily will always like be like

41:04.960 --> 41:09.040
well you don't know what their day is you don't know what's going on with them so emily's like this

41:09.040 --> 41:17.840
she her empathy it feels she has like weaponized empathy she's doing it on purpose that bitch

41:18.880 --> 41:24.560
it kind of feels like i'm like i wish you weren't so empathetic because then she's like i just want

41:24.560 --> 41:33.840
to be angry at that person let me let me have this have you ever confronted anyone i was going

41:33.840 --> 41:37.920
to get the postmates and Cody was like you never wear your mask and you're going to get the

41:37.920 --> 41:46.320
postmates and i'm like oh yeah shit and i like i was like grabbed a mask to go out to get the

41:46.320 --> 41:52.720
postmates and i i put the i didn't have a chance to put it on because like the postmates was already

41:52.720 --> 41:59.360
pulling up and i did this thing that i thought was amazing where the guy got out of the car with

41:59.360 --> 42:08.800
the food and as he was approaching me i waved my mask at him like it was a backstage pass

42:09.200 --> 42:16.960
it's okay and took it like block it i was like like blocking it like i was more like i'm i'm cool

42:16.960 --> 42:23.440
like i get it like it was like like i i i mean it was it was an unconscious move but it definitely

42:23.440 --> 42:29.120
wasn't an unconscious like attempt to block the virus particles it was an unconscious like

42:29.120 --> 42:38.400
don't worry about it i'm i'm i'm a mask guy like i'm i'm a you can trust me don't worry i own a

42:38.400 --> 42:43.440
mask i know i'm friends with Ace Frehley's manager let me take this food and make me laugh on you

42:44.320 --> 42:51.520
yeah no i spencer i have not yelled at anybody but i have gotten close and you can because you

42:51.520 --> 42:59.920
have a mask but my mask actually has the lower half of my face printed on it so i think but kumail

42:59.920 --> 43:07.440
this is interesting to me that you're are you so are you are you are you immunocompromised

43:07.440 --> 43:13.360
in a amelie i am and that is where this is coming from so it's all like it's all

43:14.640 --> 43:20.320
realizing i don't know this is really feels like Harmontown it does we're realizing you

43:20.320 --> 43:26.880
know obviously for a year now emily and i have really spent all our time together and i feel

43:26.880 --> 43:31.920
very very lucky that i'm with someone like emily and honestly a relationship has gotten stronger

43:31.920 --> 43:37.360
and for the first time i've gotten some sort of insight people know and you know 12 years ago

43:37.360 --> 43:41.360
emily had gotten really really sick she was in a coma all this stuff so she still has that condition

43:41.360 --> 43:47.920
right 14 years this year but that's okay 14 years and we're realizing that both of us have some sort

43:47.920 --> 43:53.600
of um ptsd from it like i don't want to like you know people who've been in wars and stuff i don't

43:53.600 --> 44:00.000
want to but there certainly is trauma associated with it and we're realizing in this that this

44:00.960 --> 44:09.200
virus is triggering certain things for me uh that make me it's kind of a bad thing it sounds like

44:09.200 --> 44:14.880
i'm like ultra protective of emily to the point where it's not healthy for either of us

44:14.880 --> 44:23.200
um and uh and so this pandemic has really like awoken awoken a lot of stuff and and i've realized

44:23.200 --> 44:31.360
we've realized that uh you know the work that needs to be done um yeah it's it's yeah i mean

44:31.360 --> 44:36.960
that's that's cody is the Kumail in the in this relationship because i'm i'm immuno compromised

44:36.960 --> 44:44.240
i i i i i don't have the i knew early on i knew that that word was going to be like

44:44.240 --> 44:49.120
the new autistic or whatever where it's like you're it's like people people self-applying it

44:49.120 --> 44:57.280
we're gonna be i don't know i was like i better not tell anybody but like i i'm in a category of

44:57.280 --> 45:03.120
person that if i get this thing like i could be one of those people that that you know that that

45:03.120 --> 45:08.800
eats it and i i'm not one of the diaries that's one of the diaries one of the that's exactly what

45:08.800 --> 45:13.760
i was thinking was like trying to move around his moving around um i could be one of the diaries

45:13.760 --> 45:18.640
like that's interestingly like what if he if that was a quote from him like i just realized like

45:18.640 --> 45:25.200
why he said that because it was like he the narcissism wants to get around things that are

45:25.200 --> 45:30.720
bigger than it like you have to like you have to be anything but absorbed by something so he's like

45:30.720 --> 45:40.880
i could be one of the and i was like i could uh be one of the people in the category that uh

45:40.880 --> 45:49.760
shall we say terminates um but uh what it's it's it's the truth i mean my per my doctor it's like

45:49.760 --> 45:57.360
i i can't get this thing and uh i don't have the same 99 percent whatever uh chance and i told that

45:57.360 --> 46:03.360
to Cody early on and she's been i mean that's just mar you know she's just living in this world

46:03.360 --> 46:09.760
she just put that in her head and is just living like that and the funny thing is like it's the

46:09.760 --> 46:15.520
same i think similar to you and emily because i now look at my behavior and i'm like you don't

46:15.520 --> 46:20.080
give a shit if you get this thing you're just hanging out but now i'm remembering like i was

46:20.080 --> 46:25.600
like researching bleaches and things i was like do i was i was genuinely terrified

46:27.280 --> 46:34.800
Cody Cody's like trying to keep me alive and then i cycled into this like you know what like

46:34.800 --> 46:41.280
what is life really yeah you're you're waving masks at post-made people it's exactly like i

46:41.280 --> 46:47.840
you get the vaccine do you do emily and dan do you get the vaccine before earlier because of your

46:47.840 --> 46:54.240
condition emily does i'm in the next year yeah she's in the next one i assume you would meet you dan

46:54.240 --> 47:00.560
yeah i i'm Cody keeps telling me like you can do this or that and i keep going going like i don't

47:00.560 --> 47:08.960
want the vaccine i just why don't you want i well because i keep thinking like i'm i'm not going

47:08.960 --> 47:14.800
anywhere anyway the bar's not open down the street fucking kumail left he's so disgusted with my

47:14.800 --> 47:21.680
behavior i'm sorry i was trying to light up um that's much better i truly it's so selfish like i

47:21.680 --> 47:28.080
just realized like i should be getting the vaccine for fucking Cody so she can relax yeah which is

47:28.080 --> 47:33.280
so dan dan you uh you're not getting the vaccine because if you got the vaccine people would have

47:33.280 --> 47:40.080
to say dan you have to come into work uh well not really it was more it's more because i honestly

47:40.080 --> 47:43.840
a little part of me is like i don't want to go stand in line with a bunch of people that probably

47:43.840 --> 47:50.240
have covid um i another part of it is like i i didn't i mean i'm glad kumail was a guest

47:50.240 --> 47:56.720
tonight and could fill us in and the fucking like actually just across the board vaccine is but

47:56.720 --> 48:01.120
like i was looking at the vaccine as being this confusing thing that was like i thought it was

48:01.120 --> 48:07.760
for baby boomers to like keep them from literally dying and that was basically it it was like a

48:07.760 --> 48:14.240
like a plug at the end of the herd immunity no it's for everybody i don't know i mean you know

48:14.240 --> 48:19.680
under a certain age like under like for teenagers and kids i don't know i don't know for like for

48:19.680 --> 48:26.320
people who are pregnant or or anything like that but but this is these vaccines are above and beyond

48:26.320 --> 48:35.120
what we had hoped for we had hoped for 70 efficacy these are 95 percent like and 95 doesn't mean that

48:35.120 --> 48:40.240
five percent of people get it what it means is you want this is oh i'm gonna go ahead this is

48:40.240 --> 48:50.320
divorce me again um yeah okay i'll just say that okay so 95 efficacy doesn't mean that five percent

48:50.320 --> 48:55.440
people are open what happens is if people are just like they're part of the study so half people get

48:55.440 --> 49:01.520
the vaccine half people don't the people who don't get the vaccine 20 percent of them get covid so

49:01.520 --> 49:08.080
then that's the baseline so 95 percent means it's not 95 percent of 100 it's 95 percent of 20 percent

49:08.080 --> 49:13.280
so the number of people who get it isn't five percent it's much smaller than that it's like one

49:13.280 --> 49:20.400
percent i think emily and uh and camille i mean i don't want to be like like a dick but uh i'm just

49:20.400 --> 49:26.080
saying if one of you does get it we got a sequel to big sick we got big sick too and that's going

49:26.080 --> 49:30.800
to be fucking you guys are easy yeah i think that's what camille's worried about i think that's the

49:30.800 --> 49:40.320
work jeff uh i don't take this the wrong way but go fuck yourself well hopefully we'll win that

49:40.320 --> 49:46.400
oscar if i get another coma all i gotta do is get another coma that's my nightmare now that's great i'll

49:46.400 --> 49:52.480
add that i i i've given camille a new nightmare now for me if emily does go into another coma

49:52.480 --> 49:58.880
camille you could play best fiends that's friends without an r best fiends it's a new game sorry i

49:58.880 --> 50:02.880
just i hear they have thousands of levels i've been addicted ever since i started they're always

50:02.880 --> 50:07.920
adding more i'm telling you trisha in marketing has been playing it and she loves taking care of

50:07.920 --> 50:13.360
her little worm baby i don't know if i'm gonna make it and it's easy enough for them to understand

50:13.360 --> 50:19.840
they're loving it more than i am is this okay rob you you may not leave the seats until that

50:19.840 --> 50:25.600
judge i'm feeling i'm feeling it coming i'm gonna start when i start doing the

50:28.880 --> 50:35.760
okay next topic uh so i finally started i used warby parker because there's a pandemic and i

50:35.760 --> 50:42.240
needed new uh glasses so i got my i need a far prescription and a close prescription so a pair

50:42.240 --> 50:48.560
of glasses came and i put them on and i everything in the distance was blurry and then i and everything

50:48.560 --> 50:57.600
up close was clear so i labeled them uh uh well it says grass i i labeled them close and and then

50:57.600 --> 51:05.680
i realized what are you doing because i don't know i don't have the words on it but i label

51:05.680 --> 51:12.480
mine because you because you can't see him sometimes so then so then you know warby parker

51:12.480 --> 51:17.120
like they don't they don't come all at the same time if you need multiples and then the next ones

51:17.120 --> 51:22.480
came and i put them on and everything was blurry and then i put my hand in front of my face and it

51:22.480 --> 51:29.360
was clear and i i had already lost these somewhere and i was like wait a minute the other ones are

51:29.360 --> 51:38.640
the far ones uh that's crazy that i labeled them close and uh oh my god i gotta find those and

51:38.640 --> 51:42.640
blah blah blah and then i finally found them and i put them on they're the same prescription warby

51:42.640 --> 51:49.520
parker sent the same prescription for both things warby parker so i said to my assistant i said

51:49.520 --> 51:55.520
claire they sent the same they sent two closest uh and she she texted me back and said they

51:55.520 --> 52:02.160
they admitted their mistake they looked at their records they said uh that uh yeah sorry we sent

52:02.160 --> 52:08.480
you the same ones but their records show them as sending you two of the far ones

52:10.560 --> 52:14.560
i just thought it was really funny sorry this is what you get pandemic Harmontown

52:16.000 --> 52:20.880
like they were almost gonna they're like oh sorry we fucked up we sent you two of the far ones no

52:20.880 --> 52:31.280
you sent me none of the far ones warby parker you bastards well the way that's what it reminded me of

52:31.280 --> 52:38.560
i did the best i wrote best fiends down that was a bit i was like people all like that that'll go

52:38.560 --> 52:45.280
and then that reminded me of warby parker and you guys you guys know i love cereal but i'm

52:45.280 --> 52:50.240
getting up in the years and i can't handle that sweet stuff that's why i love magic spoon you

52:50.240 --> 52:55.600
know they only have two net carbs and no grams of sugar but it tastes just like the cereal i knew

52:55.600 --> 53:01.200
and loved growing up in childhood they now have six flavors they have fruity blueberry

53:01.760 --> 53:08.240
cocoa frosted and now they have these new flavors cinnamon and peanut butter i like the peanut

53:08.240 --> 53:13.760
butter you know they actually ran out of peanut butter and but now it's back in print they print

53:13.760 --> 53:20.880
cereal now use my 3d printed with nutrient nutrient paste and so that is my favorite flavor

53:20.880 --> 53:27.440
of magic this is peanut butter so is this a real sponsorship or are you doing they have fruity

53:27.440 --> 53:37.040
and blueberry yeah they have fruity and blueberry so so they will i i kamell i think spence is trying

53:37.040 --> 53:43.360
to do a backdoor sponsorship here by being so good at doing a unsolicited ad that he's gonna get

53:43.360 --> 53:48.960
free magic we we love magic spoon by the way and we're very aware that they ran out of peanut

53:48.960 --> 53:54.240
butter it was the prices of this house yeah i haven't really problem is that peanut butter is the

53:54.240 --> 54:02.320
most exciting to me magic spoons early funding was all built on nazi gold so you gotta take

54:03.200 --> 54:07.680
you're gonna take the good with the bad on that one i don't believe magic spoons listening

54:07.680 --> 54:13.200
not nazi gold i don't know have you guys seen the instagram ads for the place because i we all

54:13.200 --> 54:17.440
know the blue aprons and the whatnot's like they deliver the meals and the meals are kind of like

54:17.440 --> 54:22.640
they're ready to go and but their ingredients and then you put them together but but but now it

54:22.640 --> 54:29.840
like evolved into this new thing that's like uh i'm so tired of and it's like it's like a program

54:29.840 --> 54:34.720
where it's always on my instagram it's being advertised and it's just like these young people

54:34.720 --> 54:40.960
are like i can't believe no one ever thought of this before and like it's literally just frozen

54:40.960 --> 54:46.560
dinners like coming to their house like and they it's because they're like who has time to cook

54:46.560 --> 54:51.920
with blue apron like like it's like it's like it's like george jettson like hitting the button and

54:51.920 --> 54:55.440
being like i can't believe i have to hit this button like it's like i can't believe i have to

54:56.320 --> 55:01.520
what what if blue apron came already prepared and it was just frozen and you could put it in

55:01.520 --> 55:06.640
your freezer and like they're advertising all of the merits of like imagine if they were already

55:06.640 --> 55:10.640
and you could just put them in your freezer and then you pull them out when you also also what

55:10.640 --> 55:14.480
if it also what if it wasn't even frozen and it tasted exactly like chipotle

55:16.960 --> 55:21.200
i always want to come but i'm like i don't want i'm 48 years old and i want to be some asshole

58:27.520 --> 58:34.160
did you go to an optometrist do you have like a new prescription yeah i did go that's the one

58:34.160 --> 58:38.160
that's the i left the house for that that's since election night that was my own like

58:39.200 --> 58:46.560
seeing amelisa one coming up and it's it's it's been a it's been controversial my eyes are

58:46.560 --> 58:51.040
fucked though i can tell they're bad like i'm just like oh constant headache probably need to

58:51.040 --> 58:57.440
get those eyes checked yeah we've really we've we've i've she's made an appointment and i've

58:57.440 --> 59:04.080
been a tyrant and made her reschedule it and then now it's happening next week and i just remembered

59:04.080 --> 59:13.040
that and uh big sick too is going to be a big hit i'm sorry what is the implication there love

59:14.160 --> 59:23.200
don't go don't go to the optometrist you guys know randall park right the yeah see you you

59:23.200 --> 59:27.680
you know he has a and i'm not i don't i don't want to i'm gonna i'm gonna leave out details so

59:27.680 --> 59:32.080
that he doesn't end up his personal life doesn't end up getting affected by this but i think it's

59:32.080 --> 59:39.920
like he's he has a twin brother that works at a optometry place are you sure they're twins

59:39.920 --> 59:45.440
are you sure he said they were twins yeah okay you think he just had the second job is that what

59:45.440 --> 59:52.160
you mean because the because the joke was that like he he was like he he was working at this

59:52.160 --> 59:58.640
place and then he was like and i was like god damn this dude looks and sounds like randall park

59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.280
and he just randomly saw him yeah that's where you were oh my god and then he was like are you

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:09.920
Dan Harmon and i was like wait a minute what the fuck is going on and and it was like i think you

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:15.680
know my my brother and it was like wait a minute he's like it's my twin brother and i blurred it out

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:23.200
it was like i thought i was racist and he was like you're not racist i go to the same optometrist

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:30.480
and he tells me that story every time i go in about how Dan Harmon was so relieved he wasn't

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.120
racist i thought to me that's like a funny thing that you couldn't even write that was it because

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.880
we were like i remember it as us like leaping up and down like like as if one of us won the lottery

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:48.000
and and and me going i thought i was racist he's like you're not racist and it was like funny

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.160
that's gonna be strange now that he's on one division and like everybody in the world is

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.440
watching it and they're just like are you researching for a role what's going on

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.680
sorry rock will be you think no i was gonna say something stupid but it has to do with

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:12.640
eyesight i was uh when i went there the last time dan did you do this not the last time but like a

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.440
couple times ago they put these drops in your eyes and i was like what's that for but that'll

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:26.080
make your you not blink for like an hour and i'm like so for an hour you're like yeah yeah okay

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.360
all right and i go home like that do you want tacos well because they did some kind of thing

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:38.160
and they're like pushing it up against your eye right because they want to like yeah yeah yeah it

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:43.440
makes you not want to blink or not be able to blink not be able to blink so your eyes are like this

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:51.200
and you're like hey not true rob this is amazing with that stuff yeah i'm kind of tired i think i'll

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:58.480
go to bed this is crazy to me that we're reading this book is making me sleepy we have these balls

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:06.240
of gelatin in our skulls and they're melting and from from birth until death and like because

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:12.400
they're melting they're they're becoming less than perfectly spherical and we go to these people and

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.640
they like oh all right what is that they look better than that is that like better than that

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.280
and now i noticed like uh now the human element is all just follow up it's like we're entering the

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:30.880
concierge phase is uh that that anthropology guy that wrote those books would say like pretty soon

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.600
i don't know if they're gonna need a human being there because they they're kind of like the computer

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.560
is zeroing in on what my prescription should be i don't even know how the fuck that's possible

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.760
but that's what's happening and because the guy that was there like running through the lenses was

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.280
like and i'll just make sure now it was like he's working it's like turner he's working for the

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.680
computer yeah he's like he's partners with a computer like and it's making it's making his

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.960
job more fun they're solving cases but it yeah i but the weirdest thing about it is that then he

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:14.880
said to me like uh well good news yeah your prescription could use a little tweaking um yes

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:22.800
your vision is deteriorating it's deteriorating the amount that it's supposed to in this amount of time

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.720
and given your age and all these other statistics like it'll plateau at a certain point but like

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.320
they just them knowing it's like your eyes are like ice cubes like like or like ice sculptures

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.640
at a party and they're just sort of like yeah the tips of the wings on the swan are like

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:45.120
like they should be pretty much flippers by now but you know the wedding reception's already

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.200
started it's like no one cares like like your your your your eyes are just melting in your head

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:58.480
it depreciates as soon as you drive it off the lot yeah there is no you can sell this to anybody

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:11.760
for sure not turn a profit no i went to one of those laser eye places where you go in there and

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.920
they're like they fix your they just to see because my eyes are getting it's fucked up you know like

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.440
but it used to be that i can't see what's in front of me but i could see really good far away but

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.840
but now i can't see far away or what's without my glasses so i went to this doctor and it's like

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:35.680
oh what they do is they slice the top of your eyelid your eye not your eyelid your eye open

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.760
and then they kind of clean that with a q-tip and then they melt it back on or whatever but people

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.320
have said oh it's great you should do it i go in there and the guy's like yeah your eyes are

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:57.360
are like it's the we could do like one far away and then the other would be for close up so you

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.800
would be like doing this all the time and i was like that doesn't seem like a real uh a good use

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.640
of my time and i got what wait wait so you'd have like a book reading i and then yeah i'd be like

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.320
like right now i'd be like hey guys what's up actually i like this for you i think this is

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:21.680
a game hey it's working it makes you ask you've got a slight 2g ask feel about you now yes i

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:28.320
loved you on searching for italy uh yeah exactly fantastic i used to i used to

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.920
isn't that why uh why the the the iconic pirate eye patch thing was not because they lost an eye

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.240
in battle but because if you keep one eye in darkness and you use that eye when you're above

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.720
deck but if you have to go below deck for any reason where it's dark you use that eye and you

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.320
have perfect vision with that eye just you know the most interesting useless shit always that's

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:56.320
the same thing with like it's called myth busters it's called myth busters like they give one leg

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:02.960
a peg and then yeah and then the other one is like normal so when they have to run

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.920
well it's because it turns out like if you're making people walk the plank and you have a peg

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.160
leg it's a lot easier to get them to walk the plank because they're like because you poke you

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.640
just poke them with a peg just poke them also if and that's the reason why they only have one

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.920
parrot they only wear one parrot on one shoulder and that's the other shoulder uh never needs

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.160
crackers i i mean i forget what the actual reason was but with pirates there was always a reason

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:38.880
always everything was efficient very the yeah the pirates actually always had a parrot on each

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.680
shoulder um the their skeletons when we dig them up uh it appears as though they only had one because

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:53.200
they you know people people die on their side people die on their side the upper parrot is exposed

01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.400
to oxidation no dan that that theory has been debunked the reason why the war is right oh

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:23.520
sure i'm trying to trick us with a steely touche he's taking a touchey pee everybody

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:52.640
freak out there's nazis there's lesbians there's menace toa um i about a year and a half ago

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:58.240
took acid by myself by the way a lot of musicals have nazis in them for some reason but sorry

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:11.120
for some reason spring time for hitler and you took you took i took a small dose of acid on

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.320
my own because somebody had given me some acid and i've only ever done acid in small quantities

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:22.480
i've never gone like on a huge trip i i won't say i recommend it because i don't want to push

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:29.600
you know drug use on the children as i know a lot of our viewers are our youngins um however

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.080
if you have the opportunity do a little acid and watch cabaret it's a freaking freak out

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:42.160
uh i had to hit pause after the opening number like um this movie lives inside my brain for

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:48.000
the rest of my life it's very very good i want that we we tried watching one last night that

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.640
rob uh mentioned a lot called all that jazz and it's a movie directed by Bob Fosse about the

01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:00.160
life of Bob Fosse and the whole movie is about women trying to fuck him and his biggest problem is

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.720
all women want to do is fuck him and he wrote when he's a kid when he's an adult doesn't matter

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.920
women want to yeah i was going to recommend that as an anti-musical and that's a real goodie and

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.400
ray shiter is tremendous in it and it's there's more drug use in that than most movies have

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:21.680
and also if you want to go also on a on a weird anti-musical trip uh pennies from heaven with

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.040
uh steve martin bernadette peters and christopher walken does a tap routine strip tease that is

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:33.760
worth watching uh it's a very dark musical it's like it's not supposed to be musicals are supposed

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.280
to be uplifting and upbeat and you know everybody wins these are depressing where everybody is

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:44.080
you know like but basically we're all decaying all dying pennies heaven heaven takes place

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:51.840
uh i'm gonna save that for post vaccine the fossey vernon uh mini series with sam rockwell

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:58.560
is really good i mean i guess if you were into like all that jazz or or or like cabaret or

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.800
anything like that he chose like the making of it and they're really really it's really great

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:07.440
it's really cool in in anchors away there is a scene that i've watched a million times uh

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:13.840
jean kelly dances with a peasant mexican girl in alvera streets and he thinks that he's lost

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.800
his girl to frank sanatra he doesn't know that it's not the case he thinks he's losing the girl

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.480
to his friend and he's like you know what good for him and he's heartbroken and he sees a little

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.640
peasant girl played not by a mexican girl it's actually a little white girl in dark makeup but

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.640
they do a dance where he says you know i can't have her so i'll i'll dance with this child

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:41.120
that song makes me cry that number makes me cry every time it's just good okay that's next then

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:46.960
yeah that's and also we've all anything between fred and ginger musicals are always good uh like

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:55.120
yeah get up on those get up on the swing time high hat we we watched a viva las vegas i don't

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:02.320
know if that's a musical but that was a ton of fun i don't know that elvis elvis and margaret

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:08.000
viva las vegas that movie's fucking weird that movie ends with a car crash where at least four

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.640
people are murdered and then people they just start singing and it's like no there's the race

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:23.040
absolute a blood there is in the car and and and margaret is in in short shorts and pantyhose

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.000
and elvis i think is too it's pretty hot uh i i gotta i gotta i gotta correct you there

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.680
she's not wearing short shorts she's just wearing pantyhose as fucking pants that's right

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:42.000
it's black opaque number yeah she's just hanging out in a sweater and pantyhose she had to get on

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.960
set they had a skirt but she was like i gotta go i gotta go it's starting and then she has like

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.840
crazy dancing style and like like like yeah she's just like on fire yeah like those those movies

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.880
are like i i mean well that movie anyway i think maybe it's not true of all i mean i haven't seen

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:06.800
clam bake but um i like do the clam do the clam it's interesting some of these movies are like

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:13.280
garbage but like how many other elements other than the things that make a movie garbage if they're

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:20.160
all slid up to ten can the movie be good like i've had that affection for zanadu because i'm like

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.160
like everything about zanadu like it seems determined to make this movie bad like it

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.120
doesn't have all these fundamental things that a movie's supposed to have but then it has all of

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.680
these like it's just like all these other dials have been turned up to ten uh uh uh it's it's yeah

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.400
i like that's what that's exactly what viva las vegas says you're like this is not a good movie but

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.200
i'm having a blast watch it's all the viva las vegas reminds me a lot of zanadu because they're

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.920
because and i i wouldn't doubt that there was like a lot of influence there because there's the there's

01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:01.120
the montage that represents and margaret and uh Elvis falling in love and it's like a montage of like

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:08.320
that involves teleportation time travel like they're just like they're they're just like cowboys and

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:15.840
yes oh well let's just spend the day together and like all of a sudden they're like shooting each

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:21.280
other in an old west town and there's no explanation for it and it's very much like in zanadu when

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.600
it's like they have a thin justification for it where it's like oh i'm getting to know you and

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.280
like let's roller skate through this place where records are made um which of course involves like

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.040
all of the you can hit a button and these things will come down and blow fog at you and then you'll

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:42.080
turn into a cartoon bird uh it just goes to show you it doesn't fucking matter um the kind of in

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.000
and out of like like we don't hold well wait a minute why are they falling in love like like like

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.120
like movies that movies that hold themselves to an internal logic only insult us by trying to make it

01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:01.440
about their playlists uh on spotify they're like the 90s version of that where they're like you like

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:08.240
the pixies i like the pixies and then it's like oh so that's supposed to make me believe that you'd

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.800
take a bullet for her that's your version and but then before that it was just like oh well

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.160
we're dancing you know and that's like i don't know we're not gonna bother trying to show you

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.640
logically why it is that you love this person um we're gonna actually just express the feelings

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:37.520
that you have um uh when you when you love that person um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:47.200
really important garbage just what happened what was that i think dan i i i mean this and with all

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.280
fondness this has taken me back to meltdown comics because there's that moment when like you would

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.000
have already had a couple kettle ones before the show but then there's that threshold where you get

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.240
into complete like uh downhill skiing mode where it's my favorite part of the show here's a

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.200
here's a topic this is this is the last topic that i wrote down it doesn't mean that this is a thing

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:17.520
but um uh my my beautiful niece i think she's four my niece to be whatever the niece of my fiance

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:24.560
um she's she's in this phase she's been in it for a while she loves dancing she loves singing

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.720
she just performs sometimes she steals her mom's camera and she makes like little videos of herself

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.440
sometimes mom is participating and mom's like filming the videos we'll get the videos um

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:47.040
and uh she'll be like dancing around and then um uh she'll say at the end of it like if things don't

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.520
go in her mind perfectly because you know she's four so she's she's got some kind of job to do

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.480
in her head and i guess that's the thing that's fascinating to me is that at the it like like

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:02.960
she'll do like there'll be this video of her like jumping around the living room

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.960
singing and dancing gibberish doing like this stuff that's just it's just joyful

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:16.480
and then at the end of it she'll like go toward the camera if her mom's holding it and be like

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:25.840
delete it she has this like impulse in her that's like and we were just puzzling over that

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.960
was just i was like what wait why delete it like what did she think she did wrong there she's four

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:38.080
like like and um i'm just kind of and i'm not like i was thinking about it today and it was like

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.920
it not being cynical about it i think it's an uplifting thing because i don't think that

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:50.000
that's congenital i don't think that human beings are born with shame i think that human beings are

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:00.480
born with a like a desire to get everything right and and then we're like constantly monitoring

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:06.320
the grown-ups around us for cues about because one thing kodi pointed out and kodi's 12 years

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:12.560
younger than me but she and i both agreed like delete it is not in your vocabulary like when

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:22.000
we were kids um there's nothing to delete like god uh you know uh god willing something that

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.480
you could do would be forever whether it's your little handprint in cement or when vhs camcorders

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.600
came out and it was just like we would watch three hours of ourselves like rolling around in the

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:40.400
grass there was no input there was never back then it was like erase that erase that and now

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:47.760
there is four four-year-olds which i think is so interesting and not in a cynical way again i think

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:55.360
they're picking up on this idea that like well they know that information is now there's a surplus

01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:03.360
of it and they're like no no no no delete that like they're curating it yeah she's like she's

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.400
like don't but i was just trying to figure out what she meant and so i think for her it might

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.560
am is like like i think she might have gotten a reaction from her mom that maybe because she

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:18.880
did like a little thing you know like four-year-olds will do she like she like put her sleeve off her

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.320
shoulder at the end of her dance and her mom had this reaction that was understandably it was a gas

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:33.120
because it was like yeah the fuck um what is that and i think that she interpreted that reaction

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:40.480
from her mom in the very moment was like you touched a hot stove you stood at the top of stairs

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.880
you didn't usually like delete it maybe because then there's another video that like like where

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:54.240
her older brother is like doing a performance and then the little sister comes in and interrupts it

01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:01.200
like she steals the spotlight and he goes delete it i understand that that's a tantrum that's orson

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:06.320
welles he's going like i'm trying to make something perfect here and now you may as well throw it away

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:12.560
uh that that was like delete it he was saying delete it like you know i hate my sister like

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.800
like i can't believe she came in and ruined my masterpiece that i and i was like oh i would get

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:25.200
that if i was like you would you would wield delete it the same way you would say like okay i

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:32.640
don't want a fire truck then or like you know like throwing it across the room but i like it just like

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:39.040
i don't think that we need to get over our shame i think that we need to accept it and realize that

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:45.040
we have it like and we're putting it into our children and like like like she doesn't know what's

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:50.800
right or wrong yet she but she already knows that there's such a thing is okay what's going on over

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:59.200
here what okay no i'm not i'm not you finished it but half of it's in the toilet it doesn't count

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.320
it's not it's not astounding gonna start over yeah i kind of feel like there's like the developmental

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:11.040
stage of a kid at that age kind of thinks oh everyone knows this routine i came up with so they

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.680
all realize that i fucked it up like everyone knows i fucked up this routine whereas to you

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.520
it looks like a random thing that she's like freeway right like so you think that she thought

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.640
that other kids i guess i don't know her i don't know yeah i don't i don't have enough information

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.240
about who she thinks is gonna see the video and or even just like yeah everyone knows like everyone

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.480
knows i messed up that one step so now we have to like do this again i have to delete it but really

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:44.160
like nobody knows you're just flailing you're a child part of me thinks though that like i truly

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:51.280
think that like the big that i think she's so young that i think that um and this is total

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:58.080
speculation but um i think that the the the primary way of her enjoying those videos is that she

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:05.120
watches them back with her mom and i think and i think she has an impulse embedded in her that's

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:11.520
like get rid of the bad one i don't want to watch that one with you again i don't want to witness

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:18.960
it with you kind of thing but that's just me simplifying something because from my view her

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.080
life is simple like you said she could have a whole fucking she's got a master plan she's

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.720
doing she's got a whole she's got a whole civilization in her world like she's got best friends and

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.240
yeah i didn't thought about that honestly like i don't know four year olds like do they i know

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:40.000
they don't have phones but do they do they do their videos get like circulated among their

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.560
are they probably oh god that's such a scary thought that's that's a horrifying thought

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.360
i don't like it like it's like i'm friends with your mom and your mom texted this video of me

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.480
belly we get dancing we get we get videos of like your friends like daughter singing and stuff

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:04.400
we do yeah but she's like eight nine like she's a little bit older yeah well now but we've been

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:10.400
getting them for years for many years that's right there was this great moment where so can i can i

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.600
talk about this yeah just don't use any games she was a lot younger she's five years old and she's

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:21.680
got like uh she's got how would you it's benicio del Toro sorry it's the cousin right so it's two

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.840
little girls right so they're both gonna improvise songs and then making a video and uh the first

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.800
girl sings and they're both five like we know these kids and she's singing she makes up a song

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:40.720
she's like a leaf a tree a horse and it's this beautiful song and then it goes to the and then

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:49.200
it goes to the other girl and she's four years old and she she gears up and she sings i am going

01:26:49.200 --> 01:27:07.840
to kill myself it's one of my favorite videos i watch it maybe

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.400
so many times because when you watch it it's a beautiful moment right before she sings where

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:20.400
that hasn't happened to the adults in the room yet like you see it and then the other kids

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.640
starts being like i didn't tell her to say that that was her song i had nothing to do with it

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.080
it's insane to me that our perception of children is that we're waiting for them to let us know like

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.280
what's going on in their heads and sort of like we do perceive them as like receiving instruction

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.560
from us but not on the level that we really are instructing them and not understanding that the

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:49.200
entire time that all they're doing is going they're monitoring us and going like i don't know what do

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:56.640
you want for dinner like it it's like and then they they're like we're all like we're just going like

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:02.000
where did you come up with that why did you just like come into the room and talk and say that like

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:08.640
weird frasiery thing that where you're it indicates that you're upset with us and you're being passive

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.960
aggressive like you're sending all these social cues but all they're doing is like studying our

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.800
eyebrows and our tone of voice and they're just they're just these like giant little spongy brains

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.520
that are like they're just throbbing and going like am i a spartan am i a greek am i am i an

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.120
eskimo like like you tell me what culture i'm living in and what set of behaviors is going to

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.640
impress you guys and i'll fucking do it and and they're just like mashing at buttons and then we

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:44.320
react to them we go like whoa and then sometimes us reacting like to that triggers shame for them

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.040
sometimes it makes them go oh i shouldn't have done that and sometimes it like hits their dopamine

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:58.240
spike and they go like oh i i'm gonna be a dj like i just did this thing right like i want to be a

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:04.960
superstar i want to blow minds i i feel like i can reach back in my memory and along those

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:11.040
behavioral patterns and go like i learned very quickly like my parents opinion of what i was

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:19.680
doing meant jack shit compared to company like if people are coming over if i can get them to

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:28.640
react in any way my parents are gonna be dragged along like like whether they like it or not they're

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:35.040
gonna be like sony and the company is the nielson's like it's just like well i don't get it and we told

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.360
them we don't get it in development but god damn it now it's a hit and like i i feel like i have

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:48.960
emotional memories of that experience and i think it's crazy that along with that comes like people

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.080
are saying delete it a four-year-old going delete it delete that one that one of me stumbling around

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.880
like a goofball something that when i'm 30 i would i would just drink like nectar because i'll only

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.320
have so much time and like i'll see baby videos of myself and i'll be like oh my god you deleted any

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:17.120
of them that four she's like going no burn it put it to send it to the incinerator cut print

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:24.480
that one no delete it like i won't have anyone see that one that's not what happened but i don't

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:30.880
even know if they have the same relationship with stuff being permanent like to me like i didn't i

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.200
never even saw a camcorder till i was a teenager so i didn't even like think about that being a

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.320
possibility but to grow up with the knowledge that like it could all just like exist forever or maybe

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.920
not maybe it doesn't even mean the same thing to them do you know what i mean like that's what i'm

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.680
kind of struggling with like it does you know by delete it does she mean um before it ends up on

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.760
facebook and gets me canceled or does she mean um i don't want that to be part of goodnight moon

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:04.640
i i i don't i don't want that to be canon uh yeah that's right i think it's the latter i

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.960
think that's what i think for them it's like i think the kids these days hate getting canceled

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:21.520
and they're super aware yeah four-year-olds hate cancel culture i want to i want to so you

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.880
know in this pandemic since in the beginning quarantine i was very very stressed out and

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:34.800
things were is it okay if i change the subject uh yeah no i mean i think we've yeah um and so i'm

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:41.200
like very grateful to the things that have like helped uh us get through it and one of them

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:48.720
rob knows this is found crap that you made brought us so much joy and i honestly would watch

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:54.960

01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:32.160
Harmon and i used to do at sinna family uh at the theater there and then and then we do an unpack

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:36.480
the crap where we talk about the clips because people want to go where's that clip from and

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:42.080
then we talk about like that it's so good people watch him whenever whenever i'm pretty much doing

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:50.800
it just for you to yeah we love it so much we're like whatever you can get get that text i'm like

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:57.200
so excited uh emily and camille because i don't watch a lot of stuff i watch i watch tcm i watch

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:02.720
old movies mostly uh and i watch them the same movies a hundred times over uh give me something

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:08.960
that i should be watching something new that you think that i might i might dig oh that's

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:17.280
that's we've watched so much stuff it's a little overwhelming uh something new emily what did we

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:24.320
watch it's it's hard well think think about it because i i just bored the audience to pieces

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.880
about my love of musicals so if you guys have a tp or uh that was very exciting to me also

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:36.160
documentaries i love it this documentary i haven't seen uh laid on me i feel like all

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:42.480
the documentaries are now is like murder it's probably the husband but maybe not but it is

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.040
always the husband yeah usually it's all true crime docs now i don't i don't i that's i haven't seen

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:52.240
any that are not true crime i think that michael jordan one was good and i don't like that was good

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.800
yeah yeah that i don't think you i don't think you have to like sports at all to like that

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:03.600
documentary because it's just it's just about like just a bunch of crazy circumstances and characters

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:11.200
i just started the girl in the dale what's that the lady in the veil the lady in the dale and

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:15.360
and it's fascinating have you made it all the way through that one i have not i've not watched that

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:21.600
one yet but i wanted to i i just watched the first one it's very interesting i yeah and what's the

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.440
purpose for those our audience at home uh it's best that you don't know what the premise is it's

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:35.280
it's i'll i'll try to it's a it's a con man who is kind of like a catch me if you can kind of a

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:42.480
person that just kind of goes down a row a row of just conning conning conning conning conning

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:48.320
and and gets like a moment in the sun in the 70s during like the gas crisis

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:55.920
and uh it's like delivering like a this is a new car that's going to save the world

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:05.520
oh and then and then you find out a lot oh it's so it's like someone trying to

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.200
sell an electric vehicle and it seems like it's some sort of elizabeth holmes thing where they

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.840
don't really have it i don't know if it's a little electric it's definitely like that elizabeth

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:19.200
holmes thing but it i don't think it's an electric car i think it's just it has it's a car with three

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:27.520
wheels so they thought it would use less gas that makes sense one less wheel yeah yeah that's what the

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:34.080
gas goes it goes to the wheels it keeps the wheels inflated so i figured with the elizabeth holmes

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:41.280
thing is amazing that she was like it's a box that tells you if you have anything um look just make

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.960
the box and then it was like other people are like the inside of the box is tricky because there's uh

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:52.240
we got it this uh it takes your blood and then it takes it inside the box and then showing these

01:35:52.240 --> 01:36:00.880
animations and this is blood the kebler elves take it they take it like drop a blood here

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:16.160
there's a bloody box and i don't like that netflix has created a new genre called this should have

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:27.440
been a 90 minute movie documentary or not and in any case is now a 10 episode series i am offended

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:36.160
i am made to feel old i don't like frankly i'm gonna get cancelled for saying it

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.240
here's the thing about one division i know it's not netflix i'm saying i'm talking about streaming

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:54.240
now what netflix has created you wouldn't be able to have a pilot like that in the days when that's

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.760
correct i like like and i i get it it's like like i understand it's because like oh appointment

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:06.560
viewing and all this stuff but there was a craft to it this makes me feel so old i'm like you can't

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:15.520
you can't just say that on episode three things are gonna start making sense that's not allowed

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.720
they're leading on the marvel name like the marvel name is like trust us yeah i don't like that either

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.360
i don't like i don't like that i don't like watching a tv show whose parent company is also

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:36.880
like like they're like oh here be confused something that would get Dan Harmon fired in 2006

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:44.080
which is just like using a genre to tell a story but like you know fuck you if you want details

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.520
go eat a dick we'll see you in episode two here's five minutes of credits episode two starts

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:54.320
hey here's a little more fuck you sideways fuck you at an angle oh here you go with a

01:37:54.320 --> 01:38:00.320
episode three like we'll give you 45 seconds at oh maybe the hulk farted i don't know here's cat

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.320
dining show explain it all now meeting with the goddess like this is a pilot it's a pilot

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:14.720
called one division it's a good pilot but here's the problem you'd have that shit in a half an

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.240
hour and your second episode fucking one division have to be fighting corrupt lumberjacks and it

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:28.480
had to be fucking good you see that they see the night stalker uh the nbc or not nbc the Netflix

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:35.600
thing you see that yeah kind of kind of a bum bummer i mean the whole thing was kind of like okay

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:43.680
we're going to buy guns like all of them now right oh because you're scared well for me the

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:50.160
weird thing was that the two cops that they follow don't do anything they never catch the night

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.800
stalker they got the shoe they got the shoe print kumail yeah all they do is over and over get the

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.360
same fucking shoe print and the the document presents them as like the heroes like these are

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:07.520
the two guys they did nothing there was another guy who got like in another town who got the bracelet

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.080
beat up a guy the guy was like this is who the night stalker is yeah yeah it was not like

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:17.280
detecting they were just like oh my god look at that guys i got i'm gonna beat the hell out of you

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.840
yeah some other person just beat up somebody and told him who the night stalker was there was no

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:28.640
like detective work going on yeah he killed like 40 people in the same shoe and these guys just

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:37.120
like collected the shoe prints over and over he killed 40 people in the same shoe a rare shoe

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:43.360
a rare that's our guy that's yeah like this one terrible crimes they're like serialization

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:51.440
serialization in television is like gravity it exists it will exist no matter what you do

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:59.360
your job as a tv crafts person is to fight it i feel the same way about serialization and

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:06.720
and killers if you want your television story to stay aloft it is by fighting my serialization

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:15.120
modularity episodic-ness that's why it's not a movie isn't it also true that now

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:22.000
when you're making a show for like NBC it's got a it's it's everybody's got that but if you've

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.360
bought the streaming service you're already in the pocket for whatever they're putting on so

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.320
that's what i don't like is that these kids now are going like here's my pitch for a show

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:38.400
in episode one there's a zombie and then you and then it's like whoa what's with the zombie but

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.840
also he has a wedding ring and then um he takes a shit and the toilet's like whoa give me the

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:50.000
wedding ring and you're like what's going on i'll skip over episode two tell you buy the show but

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.720
here's what happens in episode three here's my point the toilet makes rings that fight zombies

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:03.040
oh that's a pilot i that's my point is that you can't like that's now how shows are being pitched

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:08.560
like like the market has been inflated people are like now pitching streaming services they're

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:14.880
going i have a pitch for a show for you and they pitch a 10 episode story where they include and

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:21.200
i i'm not just farting out of my butthole here i'm that's what that's what streaming services want

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.640
though i think i've i've been developing well yeah i know because they keep buying this shit yeah but no

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:32.320
but they actually went well like can you add some some serialized ellen like they want it like they

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:38.880
wanted to see more more stuff yeah and they're like slow down whoa what do you mean morc and

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:52.400
Mindy slow down episode one is morc and then episode four season one is Mindy like and there's an egg

01:41:52.400 --> 01:42:00.480
in the yard and it's like what's with that egg like that's the problem is that i like like like

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:07.120
it's it's like there used to be this like for bad reasons there was good things happening which was

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:14.000
like we got to keep this audience we have to assume the customer is always right the customer in tv

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:23.360
is an asshole who has no shits to give tuning in at any moment in your half hour of derivative

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.720
garbage and they could leave it any second and you got to hook them you got to hook them with

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.200
fucking craft mama jamma and i think there's something i can't shake like the goodness of

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:41.040
that when i watch these shows where i'm like when i watch wandavision i go like this production

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.920
design is amazing there's genius happening here i've seen a lot of people homage

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:57.280
the 50s air of television this makeup and these sets and the cinematography this is like

01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:06.480
great and but i'm like god damn it um oh wait you did you cringe rub you disagree you're like

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.880
oh no oh you're cringing because you're like i can't believe he's going after wandavision

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:20.400
why no i haven't seen i don't i i was just i'm just saying man i'm bored a little i i'm sorry

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.600
i got you guys just a little bit more yeah i mean i haven't seen the show i mean i wasn't going to

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:33.520
watch it but the old chit chat since we're on the topic of like disney plus like anybody's

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.520
going doing the deep dive on uh the cat from outer space or the shaggy da or any any of that

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.360
shit like kate didn't know any of that stuff i said oh we gotta watch the cat from outer space

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:53.120
and i put it on in like two seconds in she's like going fuck this movie what about like do they have

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:59.120
like the computer war tennis shoes and all those things yeah they have that they have like escape

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:08.000
to which bar that is a weird time of of of disney where they were just like trying to figure it out

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.720
it's like you're like bunch of premises it was a lot of premises yeah it's really strange you see

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:22.640
like one of the cat from space yeah cat from outer space he's got a magic necklace that makes him

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.920
move shit around and his lips don't move when he talks and hey you know that was like a million

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:32.320
dollar something or the goose with the golden something like that there was one like that

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:39.840
yeah i watched all those yeah wasn't court rustling like 15 of them oh yeah they had actors in the

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:46.000
stable it's like kurt rustle was like friend jody foster too uh who else there was another guy that

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.960
was in like all those disney movies and like he and kurt rustle were buddies because frank johnson

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.080
another famous guy and it was like because they were just disney property and they would just be

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:03.440
in these movies i can't remember who the other that's like when carpenter was a million dollar duck

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:08.640
yeah that's what yeah it was a million dollar duck that's exactly the one i was trying to take

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.720
yeah yeah it's just like the love bug and stuff combine them yeah car that talks here you go cat

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:22.800
from space here you go guy got really smart here you go yeah make a movie come on make a new one

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:28.400
what's a new one right now go do it good oh my god a dog he is a serial killer

01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:38.320
that dog he's a serial killer it's not i mean that's it's not kujo because it's like the dog is

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.480
the dog has an m o the dog has a signature like the dog is doing it for a reason that's the day

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:50.480
it would be interesting like we found urine all over this body it's the third time with

01:45:50.480 --> 01:46:00.320
someone beat all over this guy i think it's called the best friend of sam that's that what

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:06.400
have you did like one in that style with that music and like the same like voice casting and

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:14.800
stuff like that and the the dog is walking around it's like wow what about her what about her that's

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:23.120
but right yeah do you guys think dogs understand the length of the walk because i feel like sometimes

01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:30.160
Cody and i are like i got too much going on yeah me too and like we'll take them on our what we call

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.000
the short walk which is we take them down you're tricking them you're tricking them into thinking

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.320
that they've done the full walk when they actually don't think that they their behavior to me seems

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:44.000
like they if they don't get the walk they start going out of their goddamn minds but then it

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:51.120
doesn't matter i think it's a human thing that it'd be like that walk was hardly anything like the

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:56.320
ritual of harnessing them up and taking them out like like i'll take them down to a cul-de-sac and

01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:05.840
we bring them back up cul-de-sac what am i fucking all of this um let it go uh the the but or we'll

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.640
take them around the block but the 85 000 blocks like they act the same when we bring them back

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.560
they're never like that's their television that's their tv yeah but they don't they if they get if

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:22.000
they get two minutes of night writer as opposed to 22 minutes to they act as if they've seen a whole

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.920
episode of night writer that's why they press where they're like this walk didn't have the full story

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:30.880
i don't want to go third walk it feels like you just like sniff shit and i'm like like like all

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:36.720
sometimes i'll let them sniff shit until they're done i always do Cody's like she'll she's not above

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.960
like come on and i'm like how whoa but like they'll sniff shit and then like you take them around

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.600
they're just sniffing shit they're barking at other dogs then they get back home and they're like

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:54.320
thank you like before that they're like you would think that you were killing them by not taking

01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:03.680
them for a walk they're like and then like you but you could take them for like a two second walk

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:10.640
and then they're like they're like combined it's a binary i'm exhausted like they don't it's like

01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.120
they have like a circadian rhythm or whatever you call it they they understand days but they

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.920
don't understand hours i think it's similar just sounds like dan go ahead emily i think it's similar

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:27.760
to like ladies like me for instance going out sometimes we're like getting ready to go out

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.360
it's like the most fun part of the night and then you get there and you're like this sucks why am i

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:36.000
here and then you're like i can just leave now so the putting on of the harness that like that

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.880
like anticipation that's the money shot the rest of it is like kind of useless maybe that makes sense

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:48.720
that i mean that that that makes me able to relate to it too i think i felt that way too about going

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:54.240
out where i'm like i don't need to be out for six hours just because i haven't been out for six months

01:48:54.240 --> 01:49:00.880
it's i do need to have gone out it's like a punctuation i need to have gone out that's that's

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.080
what it is i need to emily always says she's like the best part is having said that you went to the

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:12.480
party yeah it's like it's like that's the typewriter going like at the end of a otherwise you're just

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.640
like typing forever and it would the dog the dog is perceiving that the typewriter cylinder is

01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:24.480
is going out the door there i made it understandable with my metaphor

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:34.640
with my keen understanding of old-timey typewriters and dogs i have i have as a lot of the situation

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.800
everyone gets it now dan have you still been playing death stranding ever have you stopped have you

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:49.920
given up i stopped death stranding drove me back into woodwork um was it the problem that it was

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:57.840
just that the game is walking and trying to balance and it's like that's the game i'm not sure

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:06.400
there's a here's an alternate theory i was i i had peaked with satisfactory and like whatever game

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:13.280
i played next was going to be like just whatever wait what's satisfactory it's like minecraft but

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:21.600
you just make machines and factories it's really good oh it's the best it's really good satisfactory

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.240
you make like a mining machine that pulls iron out of the ground and you process

01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:36.720
with the status factory yeah the name i you know yeah uh but um it's it's so great yeah it's just

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:44.400
like that's yeah we're playing hickman the new hit man it's really and we're doing lego we're

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.520
putting lego stuff together yeah we've made it next to one and now we're making a batwing from

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:57.360
the 1989 great batman yeah i've been streaming i stream on twitch you guys and i'm plugging

01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:01.920
that twitch.tv slash the sixler but i've been playing minecraft again i don't know if you've

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:06.720

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:17.600
massive underground uh cave complexes that are submerged it's like it's crazy how different it

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.320
is from like really you know yeah i mean did they add anything like like would they just add to

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:28.480
vanilla minecraft just add like a little bit of hopper functionality where you could like sort things

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.960
they still don't have that they have a lot more but yeah it's it's a bum you really just want some

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:40.400

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:59.360

01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:03.600
it's i think it's really cool i've run it a bunch of times it's a lot of fun but you could get that so

god.com it sounds like a front like i think it's like money laundering like it's not a real practice

01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:19.920
like when you go into our median like uh alterations place and they're like oh we do alterations

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:27.680
and you're like you don't yeah there's a restaurant by us that we're like the food is not good enough

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:43.360
you're staying here huh okay one time we went and there were four tables and we were like can we

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:47.840
sit there like the food's gonna take two hours we were like what they're like i mean we're really

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:54.080
busy so it's gonna be a long time before we you can order it now it's a front well we will call

01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:59.280
that bluff look we're gonna sit here we're waiting for our food all right well we were like we just

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:06.560
want omelettes it takes no time at all we just want the omelettes i i called up a tv repair man

01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:12.400
that is in my neighborhood that's right near a place where i hang out and uh i never saw anybody

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:17.760
ever go in or out of the tv repair shop but i my tv was on the fritz years ago and i

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:23.200
called them up i'm like hey i got this tv and i think the light bulb has gone out that's how old

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:29.360
it was the tv had a light bulb everybody and uh the guy's like uh yeah okay let me call you back

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.640
and he called back and said yeah it's going to be like three thousand dollars i called somebody

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.600
else like yeah it's like a hundred dollars so that's a front they're saying uh you could come in there

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:42.880
we can we will find you a light bulb for your tv but it's going to cost you a lot of money

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:49.680
to to take time out of our busy uh money laundering and heroin dealing you know

01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:55.200
it's a little cross from the drawing room that's behind i wasn't gonna say so Emily but yes it is

01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:02.560
that's because they they kept expanding and they kept making it look more like a home but if you

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:07.200
walked in there which you can't because the door's never open but you look in the yes they do have

02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.640
three or four tvs and it looks like maybe somebody in there is slightly interested in

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.120
the tv repair trade however call them on the phone and ask them uh for a quote and i think they really

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:25.360
want you to go fuck off and then ask whether you know they want to go look for their heroin

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:29.520
heroin shipment or something i feel like a whole strip mall across from the drawing room

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:36.640
including yield rustic like that entire strip mall is just like like ben afleck's character in the

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.240
accountant like is just like keeping the whole thing going it's like oh there's like a apple repair

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:49.760
store that never has any any cables and then there's like a realty place that and then there's a

02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.880
you know there's like an art also there's like an art studio that sells clothes on occasion i don't

02:00:54.880 --> 02:01:01.200
it doesn't make any sense well now those are all gone all there remains is these the strange uh

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:08.160
uh like real estate like sotheby's or whatever the hell yes i guess right you've never seen anybody

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:14.880
