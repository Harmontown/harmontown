00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
Music

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Harmontown is now in session.

00:21.000 --> 00:36.000
Music

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
I'm Jeff Davis, Comptroller. Would you please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

00:41.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah. Thank you.

00:54.000 --> 01:03.000
Welcome to church. This place is gorgeous. This is a great theater. It's really, it's very, very weird here tonight.

01:03.000 --> 01:13.000
If you know me, then you're here. If you know me and you live in Pittsburgh, you're here.

01:13.000 --> 01:23.000
If you know me, then you know that I'm very, almost annoyingly obsessive about story structure and in relation even to my own physical activity,

01:23.000 --> 01:32.000
the course of my life and the course of my evenings and often doing obnoxious things like pointing out that we've reached the goddess point in this conversation

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
or something stupid, a little, little, little, little, little, candle, candle flashing.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
But this tour, I mean, we knew when we set out, like, okay, come on, this is going to be a story.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Like every physical process you do, if you plant a potato and then dig it up and then eat it and poop it out, you're telling a story.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
And also, if you zoom in on the process of digging up the potato, there's a story there.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
And if you zoom in on the process of the first shovel dig, whatever individual shovel dig is called, is that a scooch?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
A splorch.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Okay. You can buy in the lobby, Jeff's the new book of Sniglet's.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
That's the words that you didn't know existed.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
So, guys, we've embarked on this tour. We're almost, if not exactly, depending on where you define where the thresholds across the beginnings,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
which shows you can't, which ones you don't.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
We're right about smack in the middle. We're at the World Naval here.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
We are meeting with the goddess here tonight in Pittsburgh in this church.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
And I don't make the decision for these things to happen.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
I woke up this morning, like, I don't want to panic you. It's going to be a great show.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
I woke up this morning depleted.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't even know. We've been having a great time.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
It was just like, weird things that happen.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
When you sleep on a bus, I didn't even know this was a thing.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Your inner ear, I think, gets accustomed to the velocity.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
Like what you used to call sitting still is now getting adapted into 70 miles an hour.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Especially if you're sleeping during it.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
We have these little bunks on the bus.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I was in the hotel room this morning, and I swear the entire hotel was driving down the street.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
These waves of vertigo, because my inner ear is being ricocheted back and forth, blah, blah, blah.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
All kinds of physical reasons why we're meeting with the goddess tonight.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Like, I have been broken down as your hero.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Somebody went...

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And that was the straw that broke me down as your hero.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
Is that guy going... I have been broken down physically.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
We were achieving weightlessness here tonight.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
The steps beyond us are going to be painful and weird and awesome.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
They're going to involve God overtaking us.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I don't know if that happens here in this church, Jeff.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I think they have...

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Was it a church?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Wasn't it?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
What was this place?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
A public theater.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
A public theater. It was never a church.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, fuck it. Never mind.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Let's just do some rapping.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
No, no.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Everybody kept saying it's a church.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
I guess they're just commenting on the way it looks.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
It's not a church, yo. It's not a church, yo.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
It's not sanctified. It's not glorified.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
This ain't a pulpit, yo. This ain't a pulpit, yo.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm not chicken fried. I'm not chicken fried.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't have God behind me on an altar.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
I just want to talk, but now I'm starting to falter.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I fucked your mama in the front and in the back.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I fucked your mama until she had a heart attack.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
So you can sense I've been broken down.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
It's amazing that people clap for that.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, it's magical.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay, so that brings me to the bigger topic here.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It's like, okay, we're halfway through this journey.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
So we've been performing in all these different cities.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
We're meeting all these Armenians.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
All this stuff, if you listen to the show before we left,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Pat Noswell came out and warned us,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
like this Ian McKellen figure going,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
you have no idea what lies beyond,

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
and one does not simply walk into Phoenix.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
He was coming from a comic standpoint

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
and also almost a pre-podcast standpoint kind of.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
What we have is the same people from city to city.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I meet you guys after the shows.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I sign stuff. I shake your hands.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I interact with you. I cosmically intermingle.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And you're all, not in a bad way.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
You're all the same.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
We have achieved, we have data back.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
The results are in.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
We know what a Armenian is.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
A Armenian is a loving nerd.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
We have a definition now.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
That was one of the many things that...

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
So we've met with a goddess in that sense.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I know who you guys are.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I know that if you're being completely silent,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I'm not necessarily failing.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
If you are, fuck you.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I know that you'll give me time to get around to my point.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I know that I don't have to pull out a rubber chicken.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
I know who you guys are,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and I know where we stand with each other.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
But yet we don't know who these particular...

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Every audience I do, Jeff.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
This is a steel driving town.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
That's the only difference.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Steelers, baby.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Should we do a sports corner?

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Dan Harmon Sports Corner.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Dan Harmon Sports Corner.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
He knows all about sports.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
He's got a Pittsburgh Steeler.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Two-cut his hat.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
He's about to tell you about the Steelers' chances

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
in the big game tomorrow.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Dan, what do you think about the Steelers this season?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Jeff, if I've said it again,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I'll say it a thousand times.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Yardage, yardage, yardage.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
You've got Quintrow on the tight end,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
and he's doing great,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
but he needs to be paired with Hodgkins.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
What do you think that the...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We talk about tight ends versus this.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
What do you think the role of the tight end really is in an offense?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
First and foremost, people don't agree with this.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
It won't win me any popularity contests.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
He's got to back up the linebacker.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
He's got to be there for him,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
and he's got to keep icing his knee.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
He's got to be there to receive.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
If the receiver fails,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
he has to back up the linebacker.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
When the quarterback throws those missiles,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
as I call them, especially with the Steelers,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
you've got Hodgkins on the quarterbacker.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Either you're icing your knee,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
or you're catching that ball.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
What's your opinion about the Steelers' secondary?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I think it's a bunch of trumped-up stuff.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I think it's ruined the game for the fans.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
You think there should be no secondary?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I think it's a myth.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
We're familiar with the first quarter in football.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
We love the third quarter,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
but there's four quarters to a game.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Why do you need to say secondary?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
It's stupid. It's a foregone conclusion.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It's breaking into two halves.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
Who do you like between the Falcons and the 49ers?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Schmiddi.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Schmiddi, okay.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Stomply.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
The game was played today.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
What do you take away from the Falcons at the 49ers?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I hate to sound like a broken record. Yardage.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
You've got to keep that ball moving down the field.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Who did you favor going into tonight's game?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
At the top of the game, I would have told you Scrinfrop.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
No, I mean the team.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Falcons or Niners.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
I thought under Scrinfrop's leadership as a coach

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
that they would have gone against the 49ers

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
and taken away the Golden Sieg.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You had the Falcons' favorite going in.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Falcons and Niners.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Definitely Niners.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
You had the favorite going into the game.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
How do you feel about the outcome?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I think the Steelers did poorly.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
They certainly did.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
They proved that games ago.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Anyways, Jeff, people put too much emphasis on that.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Dan Harmon, the Game Corner.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
He loves sports.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I love sports. I love the Steelers.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
I love sports because it's physical.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm very, very physical as a person.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
You can tell from the sound of my voice.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Did you play a sport in school ever?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
All of them. I couldn't take my hands off of them.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Dan, you can only play one.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Please, sir, please let me play more sports.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
This is my kind of people.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I just want to judge myself by how far a fucking ball

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
I can hit with a stick or a club or my own hand.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Yes, I want to wrestle around in the dirt

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
and I want to feel bad if someone physically pins me down.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
In addition to the actual pain of being physically pinned down,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I want to actually feel emotional pain.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I want to feel like I let my father down

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
by not being able to lift a brick.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
What sport is that?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Pig skin.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
It doesn't matter.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I was on a little league, or what do you call it?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
They called it the Mighty Mites.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It was a YMCA basketball league.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
It was called the Mighty Mites.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I was on this basketball team.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I had no idea how to play basketball.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I would just walk around the court.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
No one ever threw me the ball.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It was like a Globetrotter's routine.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
The way that they would beat the other team

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
with only four players on the court,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I would just walk around like a rodeo clown.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Everyone said, I would accidentally catch the ball

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
and then I would go, here we go.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And I'd do something with it.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Immediately.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And I would just cry on the way home.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Like, dad, why did you make me do this?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
He's like, well, don't do it then.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I didn't ask you to do it.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, you did. No, I didn't.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Mighty Mite basketball.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
You ever play baseball?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I mean, I had to in gym.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I remember one time I hit the ball.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I actually hit it and it went out into the thing.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And I ran and I rounded first and I rounded second.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And I was like, holy shit, how far did I hit this ball?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I rounded third.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I came all the way back to home.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I got a home run.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
But Tim Kunkel, the catcher, was in tears.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I had thrown the bat.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because I was so excited that I hit the ball,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
I had whipped the bat over my shoulder

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
into his face or sternum or something.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
He was in tears.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Like, they banned me from baseball.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Everyone was booing me.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I just did to this victory lap

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
after clubbing a kid.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
So, the guy had caught the ball but he didn't throw it

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
because he was just like, holy fuck.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah, no, the game ended.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I ended baseball that day.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It was over.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
There's no more baseball.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, there's been a beating on the playground.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Was he wearing gear that he had a helmet on

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and a chest pad or anything like that?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
No, he's just a grade schooler.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
He's just sitting there behind the plate.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
He wasn't fucking nobody.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So you just maimed a fucker and then ran around

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
like a chair and he was crying.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And then he started hitting me with his glove

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
and no one stopped him because that was his right.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It's like, you know, you go to prison

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
and you're a pedophile.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
The guards just let you get raped and murdered.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I had hit the kid with the bat

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
and he was a baseball player and I wasn't.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So they just beat me.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I don't like sports.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I enjoy watching them.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I like watching baseball as I kept explaining

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
to these people.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I enjoy watching you do this.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
There's no internet yet.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I will watch you do this.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Can I just watch?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Isn't there...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
In the world of sports,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
isn't the role of spectator

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
like the most important?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Like if a tree falls on the forest

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and no one gives a shit?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
What's it called?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
PNC Park? What's it called?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Most of it is seats.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, most of it is seats.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Very little of it is green.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Most of it is green.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's mostly people watching.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Train us to get good at it.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Isn't that the whole point?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
To have the government indoctrinate you

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
into patriotism using little secret flags

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
instead of your own countries?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Practice loving something other than your individuality

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
and the people that you know are human.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Tweet, he did something good with his body

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and it's good because the flag won.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Oh, there's a flag.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Love the flag, flag, flag, flag.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Eat a hot dog. You're a fucking zombie.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
You're children or zombies.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You've been, you've been

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
borg'd without even knowing it.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Just by enjoying the beautiful ballet

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
of talented people jumping around,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
you have been inadvertently

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
hypnotized by the Pentagon.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I'm coming down a little too hard on them.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I want, I want to,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
speaking of things that I'm bad at,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I want to do an experiment tonight.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I, I, I, I...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
No, no, no, no.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Is there, is there anybody,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and this is just for, I'll explain in total

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
what it is I want to do,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and when people come up at Harmontown,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
we don't, we're not setting you up to fail.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
We don't bully you, but the,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
someone who has like a

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
decent kind of

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
street joke, you know,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
like the, you know, like, you know,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
there was a guy and he went into a bar

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
and the duck had AIDS, that whole thing.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
A joke joke. Yeah, like a joke that you've heard

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
in a big, fast aisle telling.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And I want someone to come up,

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
tell the joke, and that's, that's chapter one,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
and then we're going to give it some time.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I want to give it, because I want to create, like,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
a buffer there. Right.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I'll listen to the joke.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I want to, and then, and then later at some point

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
in the show, I'm going to try to tell the joke

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
as hard as I can. Which historically, you're terrible.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm a, I'm the worst joke teller in the world.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It's amazing, like, not just you, but Dino Stamatopoulos,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Jay Johnson, funny people, funny writers that I know,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
cannot tell a joke.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I get caught up in the details, and I...

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Yeah, I think when you tell a joke,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
it's, it's, you feel like the audience

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
has been left behind, or that there's flaws

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
in the joke structure, and that need to be,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
like, to be spackled.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And so you end up just completely destroying

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
what could really be a four-line joke.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
You make it a giant monologue of sadness.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
But it's not going to happen tonight.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm going to try, because the fun of it is

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm going to try as hard as I can to not do that.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
But the first step is first, we have to do it earlier

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
because then later I'll try to retell the joke.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Does anybody feel like they can tell a proper

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
to be the control group?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Do you want, like, a story joke? Like, not like a three-liner?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Not like a guy goes into bar, guy says this,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
the guy says blah?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of a story, yeah.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Like, the three things happen.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You come on up, sir.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
What's your name, sir? Justin.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Justin's coming to the stage. Let's support him and love him.

15:32.000 --> 15:41.000
MUSIC

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Justin, everybody.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Alright, Justin, I'm Jeff. Nice to meet you, man.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Where are you from?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Originally, I'm from Binghamton, New York, but now I live in Pittsburgh.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah? You enjoyed her?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I love it. I moved here with my wife, and she's from here,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
so from the north side.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
What do you do?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Actually, I own Improv Comedy Theater in Pittsburgh.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Alright, so this should be a pretty easy...

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah, we have a ringer.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
That's good. That's exactly what we want.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I felt like when you started describing what you wanted to do,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I was like, I know exactly which one I want to tell, which is...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Do you know a lot of jokes?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I know a lot, but this is my grandmother's favorite one I've ever done.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Okay, good. Grandma's favorite. Fantastic.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, and I think it's in part because I have to do it with an Irish,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
a bad Irish accent.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I love it.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
Okay, so I am opening my buffers, and I'm going to receive this,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
and I will tell this joke later, and I will be carried out on your shoulders.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Alright.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Okay, sorry.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
So far, so good. Yes, so far.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
I blinked for a second. I almost didn't realize all these people are looking at me.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Okay, so there's a guy in a pub, right?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And it's closing time.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Dan, don't make a drink. He's telling a joke.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Okay, alright, sorry.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
So there's a guy in a pub, right?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
And it's the closing time, and the bartender comes over.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
What do they call it? They don't call it a bartender.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
What do they call it? I can't remember.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
The publican?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Right.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
So the republican comes over.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It's not a republican, a publican.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh, it's a public house, but there's a name.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
A bartender?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
There's another name for it. It's like the...

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
What is it called?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Public house?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
The what?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
A waiter.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
It's like the landlord, I guess, that's what they say.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Is your grandma here?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
No.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
She's no longer with us.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Do you want a drink, Justin? Do you want a vodka on the rocks?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I put this for you.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Jeff was an asshole about me doing it.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
No, I wanted you to listen. You were very nice.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I'm listening.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm listening, and by the way, so far this is not going as planned.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
That's fine. That's fine.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
That is also fine.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
What I have done is I've brought another Dan Harmon up on stage.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Pretty much.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
But that's fine. This could be...

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
We talk about it all the time. Actually, in college, my nickname was tangent boy.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay, so take us...

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Okay, here we go. Sorry, let's start from the beginning.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
So there's a guy in a pub, right?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
And it's closing time, and the bartender comes over and says,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I'm sorry, you got to go. You got to go.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And the guy says, all right, I'll go. I'll go.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
And he gets off the ball stool, and he falls flat on his face, right?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
And the bartender says, oh, can I help you? Can I help you? No.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
If I just get outside, I'll be fine.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So he crawls outside.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
And he gets up, and he falls flat on his face, right?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
And everybody says, oh, can we help you? Can we help you?

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
I'll be fine. If I just get to me flat, I'll be fine.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
So he crawls to his flat. It's only a couple of doors down, you know?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Crawls to his flat, stands up, falls flat on his face, right?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
When he opens the door, and he falls flat on his face.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And he says, if I just get to me bed, he says to himself,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
if I just get to me bed, I'll be fine.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
So he crawls over to the bed, he stands up, falls flat on his face, falls right to sleep.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Next morning his wife wakes him up.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Come on, fucker, wake up, wake up.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
And she says, well, I see you went to the pub last night.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
He says, well, I had a few drinks,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
but how did you know I went to the pub last night?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You left your wheelchair there again.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
All right. Okay, good.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Justin, that's the control group for that.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That's the control. Very nice.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Thank you, Justin. I love it.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, what's your, I was just going to say, although now I hate you,

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
because you said it, but I wanted to be gracious and say, do you want to plug your improv?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I would like to. It's Steel City Improv Theater,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
SteelCityImprov.com.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, cool.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
And actually this month we just moved to Shadyside,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
so we have an awesome, bigger theater, so come on by and check it out.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
We have classes, fun stuff. Okay, cool.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Thank you, Justin.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Justin, good luck with that, man.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
All right, so just hit me later, like 10 minutes later.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Okay, let's move on.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I think I can nail that one. I think I'll, my new goal is,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I'm almost certain that you will not nail that job.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I will, I know.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
What you're going to do, because there are details, there's beats to that,

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
and you're going to, first of all, timing will go out the window.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Timing will be the first casualty.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And then you're going to, you're going to add,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
I will hold my predictions.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm going to say a couple other beats are added into it that are extraneous.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
It is, which is tit called here in Pittsburgh.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Pittsburgh invented the witch's tit.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
This is from the official Wikipedia entry.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
It's not as cold as Milwaukee and Minneapolis people,

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
they argue with each other.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
I've noticed them from Milwaukee.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Every time you meet someone from Minneapolis,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
you, the two, they all step right,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
it's colder in Milwaukee, it's colder in Minneapolis.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
That because they're the two coldest cities,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
like including Windchill.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
But Pittsburgh, here's my point.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Like, we are now, we're rounding this bend,

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
where we're getting closer and closer to, to the cold of my childhood.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
There's different textures, different kinds of cold.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
As I was explaining to my,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
largely equatorial girlfriend, Navy kid Erin McGathy,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
who spent, you know, went to high school in San Diego.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
She's never, she was playing with snow,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
like when we got to wherever it was,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
there was the first snow on the ground.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
She's like, do you want to touch it?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I'm like, we go way back.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
She actually got, we're on the bus.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
She's like, Jeff, have you ever seen snow before?

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
No, never saw it.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
She was amazed by it.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
She made a little tiny snowman, or Spencer did.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Anyways, as I was explaining to her,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
like, there's cold, and then there's like,

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
there's a cold where you shiver,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
because it's like cold under your body,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
it's cold, your skin's cold.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Oh, little, little things are happening to my body,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
because my skin's so cold.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
And then there's the, the, the cold of the,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
my soul is cold.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
My feelings are cold.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I remember moving from Milwaukee to Los Angeles

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
the day before that happened where I made my final decision.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I was chiseling my car out of ice,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and I reached over to open the door,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
and the metal hinge snapped off in my hand,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
because not only, not only did God not intend humans

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
to live in that climate,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
but Newton didn't design metal to...

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
That was Carnegie.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah, and I remember just laughing at the sky

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and going, I'm going to LA!

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
But anyways, it's starting, it's bringing back,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
this is another reason why it's meeting with the goddess tonight,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
is because it's reminding me of my childhood.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm bundled up, and I can't get warm enough.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I don't know if I have a fever, or chills,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
or something's happening to me, Jeff.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Did you take the medicine I gave you?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes, I did.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, that'll do it for you.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Well, I don't know, man.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I don't know what's happening to me.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Meta.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
Wait, it doesn't know us.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
I want to do an experiment.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
I want to tell you a story before...

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Is it about a guy that goes into a bar?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
No, I want to tell you something,

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
because I came out, I had tears in my eyes,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
right before I came out,

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
because I was thinking about sharing a thing with you guys

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
that happened to us in...

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Where the hell were we last? Jesus.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Arlington, thank you.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
The ghost of the phantom of the non-church

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
called out from the rafters.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
We're going to do Jesus Christ Superstar later.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
There's these cool platforms.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Really, we could do a scene from Rents.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Has anybody ever been in Rents,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
or possibly West Side Story?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
We could do all kinds of shit here.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I'm going to see if I can cry on stage, Jeff.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I want to see if I can cry on the podcast.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Like drop a tear?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Because I haven't shared this yet,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
because I keep telling people about it,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
and then I start crying.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
What do you mean as a party trick to actually make a tear

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
produce a tear for us?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You're saying, can you actually break down emotionally

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
and start crying?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Well, both. I mean, it's a party trick, isn't it?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Isn't that what emotions are?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Are you saying you want to prove to an audience

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
that you're capable, that you have that range,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
that you could do that,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
or that you want to prove that you're capable

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
of revealing yourself that way?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I want to see if it's possible, both.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I want to see if it happens.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Because I've told...

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Our friendship, Eston, can cry,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
can make a tear come out of his eye in 10 seconds,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
but I'm never going to be able to do that.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
But I just want to see if the lights and the microphone

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
and the idea that I'm doing a performance

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and a podcast actually get in the way

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
of what keeps happening every time I tell a story to an individual.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
What's the time limit on this?

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Or is there no time limit?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Time limit?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I don't know.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Okay, is there no time limit?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Such a crass, coarse man.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
No, I'm saying like...

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I want to make it interesting.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Vulcan.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
20 bucks says you can't cry in front of these people.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
All right, well, so this guy...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, but that's making it into a game,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and when you hear the story, you're going to go,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
oh, I'm an asshole for...

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I just wanted to...

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I'll take it back.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
All right.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
So we were in Arlington,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
and we went to this bar,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and we were sitting there drinking,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
and there was this guy sitting across the bar

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
that kept looking at us.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
He was wearing a suit,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and Aaron said,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I think I recognize that guy from Twitter or something like that.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Is he a fan?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
He keeps glancing over here.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
At one point, Aaron got up to go to the bathroom,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and he came over,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
and he handed me three napkins

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
with a letter written on them,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
and said,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Mr. Harmon, I can't make the show tonight,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
because it sold out faster than I could get a ticket,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
and I wrote this letter for you thanking you.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
I was hoping that if I drove out here,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I would be able to catch you

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
at some bar.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
He had a good chance.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
And I just wanted to give this to you

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
and thank you on the off chance that it was possible.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I can't get into the show.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm not asking for a ticket.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I just wanted to talk to you and thank you.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Three years ago,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
my fiance, my girlfriend,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
was killed by a drunk driver,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
and I was devastated by it,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
and then I saw a community,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
and it made me really happy,

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
and I just wanted to thank you for it.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
And so that's it.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And I said,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Buddy, read the marquee.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It says sold out.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
No, look at my face, Jeff.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Look, I'm crying.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
See?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
You got into the show.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
That's the part that makes you cry.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
That part that makes you cry is that someone died.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I cried, I cried.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
We don't have to applaud it.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Next thing.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Can you get a full erection

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
in front of that guy right there?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Three feet from that guy,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
can you get a full erection

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
without using your hands?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Can you produce a full erection

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
in front of this guy?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
He leaned forward like he's ready to go.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Full erection looking at him?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Just making eye contact with him?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
You can say what you want,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
but you may not physically

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
arise yourself with your hands.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I didn't say it was going to be easy.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
What is it?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Wait, what's on your sweatshirt, sir?

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It says property of Harmon XXL

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
High School D&D Club.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Did you make that sweatshirt?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Oh, that's cool. Thank you.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
What's your name? Aaron.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Moses' brother's name.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
You have 30 seconds on the clock.

27:04.000 --> 27:14.000
Get a boner for that guy right now.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
It moves all the time.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
It moves all the time.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So the guy or girl?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Somebody just boned out.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
With a confident stride.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I hope they're going,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
they're going to go to the bathroom.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Or maybe it's like one of those old-timey reporters.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
He has to get out and get to a pay phone.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
It's comedy gold.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I kind of want to know the story.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I want to know what that guy interviewed.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
He'll be back. Or maybe he won't.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Was he with you?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
The guy who left?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Oh, so is he probably going to the bathroom?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Or was he leaning over to you guys

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
going like this is fucking bull.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
You guys told me Rob Schneider was going to be here.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So he's probably going to the bathroom.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Okay.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
What if he came back with a huge boner?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
And it was like...

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
All right. I don't know.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I have to talk to myself.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I'm a high school gym coach.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I already have a partial.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
There's a

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
red-headed captain

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
of the volleyball team.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Girls volleyball team

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
needs to speak with me in her office.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
In fact, I need to speak to her

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
because she's

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
been very inappropriate

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
with her flirtations

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
with me privately.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And for all intents and purposes,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
she's legal.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
She's...

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I'll just say that.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But I think you know I mean she's 17.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
She has a red ponytail.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Volleyball.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Shorts.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Oh wait, I wasn't looking at him.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Okay, I'm looking at him.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Natalie,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
your behavior is so inappropriate.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
What do you mean?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
There's a decorum.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
You're not allowed to talk to teachers

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
in a certain way.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
It can be very distracting and it's not.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
There's a professional boundary between us.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I am a gatekeeper of education.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
You're a young girl

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
and you need to dress more appropriately

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
when you're not playing volleyball.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
She

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
kicks off her tennis shoes

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
while she's listening.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Plants one

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
clean athletic sock

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
clad foot

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
in the crotch of my crotch.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I can't do it.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Wait.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I have a couple of questions.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I have a couple of questions.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
That's how you get a boner

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
as you write stories.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
No, that's how I get a boner

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
when I'm staring at a guy named Aaron

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
in a shirt with my name on it.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
In front of

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
200 people

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
including young girls

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
and there are several

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
people over 40 in the audience

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
that I've noticed tonight.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Which is great. It's about time.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I'm sick of being this

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Messiah to hipsters.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
It's about time a couple of my

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
colleagues and peers showed up.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Thank you. Good to see

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
librarians and

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
self-actualized chefs

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
and stuff here.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
These skateboarders always showing up.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Dude, you're amazing. I'm going to be a writer.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
You don't know that.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You don't know that, Todd.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
You don't know how hard it is.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
You lock yourself in a prison cell

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
with God and let him have his way with you.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
You try to have words that aren't your own

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
move through you and have people

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
festoon you with credit for them.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
You live with that shame, Todd.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And then you go back

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
for more, for the people.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
You think you could do that, Todd?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Or maybe you want to do another ollie.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Maybe you want to go home

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
and play Red Dead Redemption.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
All right.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So I want to tell you a joke, Jeff.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And I have to use an Irish accent to do it.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
So it seems there was

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
this man

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
in a pub

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
sitting and drinking

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
the night away.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And at one point he gets up

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
and he falls

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
flat on his face.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Everyone goes, ohhh...

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
oh my gosh, Gura...

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Are you all right?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Can we get you assistants

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
beyond us saying

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
are you all right?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
He says, I'll be fine.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
He gets up

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
he

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
walks, walks to the door.

32:30.000 --> 32:42.000
the door. He opens the door, his legs give out, and it just falls down again. Oh, oh,

32:42.000 --> 32:47.040
we asked you the first time. How many times is this going to happen? Probably three. I

32:47.040 --> 33:00.800
bet three. He says, I'll be fine. He gets up again. I just need to get home. He's walking,

33:00.800 --> 33:10.800
oh shit, he's crawling, isn't he? He can't walk, can he? I can pull this through. He

33:10.800 --> 33:16.080
gets up, he walks, he gets to his porch, falls down again, flat on his face, his neighbors

33:16.080 --> 33:23.040
are cooling a pie in the window, so he sees it and says, are you okay, Seamus? I'll be

33:23.040 --> 33:35.320
fine. I just got to get to my bed, goes upstairs, goes to bed, falls asleep, wakes up the next

33:35.320 --> 33:39.400
morning, his wife says, you've been out drinking again, haven't you? Well, how do you know

33:39.400 --> 33:50.160
that, Natalie? She says, because you're normally in a wheelchair, which you left at the bar

33:50.160 --> 34:03.080
and you're so drunk you were able to walk, which is physically inspiring, but spiritually

34:03.080 --> 34:10.520
and psychologically troubling, because you have to get pretty darn drunk to mitigate the

34:10.520 --> 34:16.760
effects of a neurological condition. The reason you can't walk is not psychological, it's

34:16.760 --> 34:24.400
not a Disney movie, it's not Downton Abbey, this is a real thing, it won't heal, the doctor

34:24.400 --> 34:33.880
showed us, you were injured in an NRA explosion, Schrab.el cleaved your spinal cord, it's physical,

34:33.880 --> 34:38.160
I can show you the x-ray, she got it out of the drawers, look, there's a disconnection

34:38.160 --> 34:44.680
between the brain that makes things happen and the limbs that enact the desires, there's

34:44.680 --> 34:52.560
no way for it to get through, you got so drunk, your thoughts leapt across your spine and

34:52.560 --> 34:59.080
landed in the right place like a tron cycle and raced to your drunken feet and you propelled

34:59.080 --> 35:05.240
yourself, though not 100% effectively, but still astonishingly so, until you got home

35:05.240 --> 35:08.400
and passed out, now try to walk again and he does and he can't, he's like, I can't even

35:08.400 --> 35:16.560
move my legs, I'm crippled, she says, you mean physically challenged, and he says, what

35:16.560 --> 35:25.280
are you, the word police, she says, well someone has to be, filthy mouthed old cow, she made

35:25.280 --> 35:37.200
him some tea and he apologized, but at this point it's a cycle, I don't know, that didn't

35:37.200 --> 35:47.040
turn out its plan, did it? Oh, did Jason really leave, is our bus driver here? I believe he's

35:47.040 --> 35:53.600
still here. Okay, if he's willing to, wait, no, he left, okay, alright, he got nervous

35:53.600 --> 35:56.760
about it, tonight was one of the few nights that we might have been able to bring our

35:56.760 --> 36:03.240
bus driver on, we're traveling, we missed a good, is he really gone? Wait, is he out

36:03.240 --> 36:10.240
in the parking lot? He got like a car service. Yeah, he got in the car. He got in the car

36:10.240 --> 36:15.040
with a girl cell phone. Well, wait, what, he absconded with one of your staff? He got

36:15.040 --> 36:20.320
in the car with the girl that sells tickets. He really is. Well, there's bad news and there's

36:20.320 --> 36:27.520
worse news, the bad news is that our very charismatic and complicated bus driver, Jason,

36:27.520 --> 36:32.720
couldn't be here tonight, I really wanted you guys to meet him, the worst news is that

36:32.720 --> 36:43.880
he's our driver and he's drunk. You know, he'll be fine. He just needs to summon the

36:43.880 --> 36:49.000
neurological miracles necessary to. Hey, what was the name of that place we walked by today

36:49.000 --> 36:53.880
when it was like, there's funny his last name you ever saw? Stimulis. Stimulis. The place

36:53.880 --> 36:56.960
called Stimulis. What's the place that's called, like the strip where all the like the ethnic

36:56.960 --> 37:03.320
markets are? I don't even know what Stimulis sells. I didn't know, Stimulis is the funniest

37:03.320 --> 37:11.920
name in the world. Stimulis, like made it up. Hey, welcome to Stimulis. Stimulis, if

37:11.920 --> 37:24.720
we don't got it. Oh. He sounds excited. That's just me. Stimulis, come on. It's hilarious.

37:24.720 --> 37:28.680
All right. I also in the back, the director was interviewing me. He asked me all kinds

37:28.680 --> 37:33.520
of weird questions about my brain and how it works and why people keep forgiving me for

37:33.520 --> 37:37.920
being a bad person. By the way, last night's show, which I don't think is podcast yet,

37:37.920 --> 37:44.560
like it got weird again. It'll get weird here too. I cried. I've never done that yet. But

37:44.560 --> 37:48.640
he asked me a question. He said, do you think there's anything you could tell people that

37:48.640 --> 37:54.200
would make them not like you? Like they seem so forgiving of you. And I'm like, yeah, because

37:54.200 --> 38:00.760
I play this honesty stick where I'm like, hey, high five for telling you. And I don't

38:00.760 --> 38:06.320
really have any hatred in my heart or anything like that. Like last night, he thought was

38:06.320 --> 38:10.320
going to be an exception because we brought Erin McGathy, my beautiful, wonderful, genius

38:10.320 --> 38:17.240
girlfriend up who does nothing but unconditionally support me, unless she's had a couple. At

38:17.240 --> 38:20.960
which point, sometimes if I have also had a couple, we get in an old good old fashioned

38:20.960 --> 38:28.160
Irish Polish white trash verbal, verbal sparring match at which point I become Kevin Spacey

38:28.160 --> 38:35.880
and seven Hannibal Lecter, you know, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the master. Like I get,

38:35.880 --> 38:40.680
I do this thing where I don't necessarily say anything worse than you've ever said to

38:40.680 --> 38:47.320
your significant other in a fight when you're trying to kind of hurt each other's feelings.

38:47.320 --> 38:55.280
But you know, I, I, I shift into this persona that is sociopathically kind of gleeful at

38:55.280 --> 39:01.440
the, at the kind of like, this passionate, like, disconnection that I feel, you know

39:01.440 --> 39:08.640
what I mean? Like I regard her as if she is an insect and explain things to her in a way

39:08.640 --> 39:14.920
she can understand. Let me lay it on the line for you. You know, I kind of like getting,

39:14.920 --> 39:18.640
turning into this villain because I've had, it's, it's like, that's when I've passed

39:18.640 --> 39:24.680
the threshold of acceptable human behavior with the, with the booze and stuff. She always,

39:24.680 --> 39:30.560
always deserves it. No kidding. I'm kidding. I brought, we brought her up and we kind of

39:30.560 --> 39:35.400
talked about it a little bit and she mentioned that I called her the C word at which point

39:35.400 --> 39:42.040
the audience did that absolute requirement. I back you up a hundred percent. You don't

39:42.040 --> 39:47.920
trust me. He said, I trust you. Oh, you trust me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's,

39:47.920 --> 39:52.960
it's bad. But, but, yeah. So brought it up and the director was interviewing me and

39:52.960 --> 39:56.520
he's going, and then they lined up and they wanted your autograph. He was a little disappointed.

39:56.520 --> 40:01.040
He was bummed out. He thought he would see the final turning point. So then he, he asked

40:01.040 --> 40:04.800
the question that I thought was very interesting. Is there anything I can tell you that I haven't

40:04.800 --> 40:11.120
told you yet that about me, that would make you like, like turn on me? I don't, I think

40:11.120 --> 40:15.600
the answer is no for the same reason. I, I, it's because what we have going for us is

40:15.600 --> 40:19.640
like, like, like, like, like, we, we don't want anyone to be unhappy. Sometimes, I mean,

40:19.640 --> 40:23.480
I, I, that's a story about me getting too drunk and I have a horrible, like, like, like,

40:23.480 --> 40:28.200
dysfunctional, like neurotic, like behavior I engage in in a cyclical way that I've begged

40:28.200 --> 40:33.240
therapists to, to, to, to, to, to defuse and then they can't do it and I, I get mad and

40:33.240 --> 40:37.680
I stop going to them. So I try to talk into a microphone and try to, to, to do self maintenance

40:37.680 --> 40:40.640
and things like that. And it's part of that involves confession. He said, what could you

40:40.640 --> 40:45.080
tell them that would make them not like you? I don't think I've ever said into a microphone

40:45.080 --> 40:49.920
into the recording. I think I've blogged about this fact. I use drugs recreationally. I'm,

40:49.920 --> 40:55.640
I'm a prescription marijuana user. I don't get high when I work. It doesn't, because

40:55.640 --> 41:01.280
I can't. If it, if it helped, I'd do it. I've, I've, I've done Adderall illegally, but I'm

41:01.280 --> 41:04.440
not ashamed of that because you're welcome for season two of community.

41:04.440 --> 41:12.520
You know, you don't, you don't get eight hours of sleep at night and, and, and, and do some

41:12.520 --> 41:16.520
of that stuff. Like, like, like so, I'm not, that sounded horribly self aggrandizing. That's

41:16.520 --> 41:21.320
not what I meant. I meant, I meant it takes a long time to, to piss off the network and

41:21.320 --> 41:24.560
studio. Like you have to be, you have to get up earlier than them and go to bed later than

41:24.560 --> 41:30.760
them. The, the, I don't think I've ever said precisely because it's uncharismatic that I've

41:30.760 --> 41:36.920
done cocaine. I, I, I, I've ever said, I mean, even since my early 20s, when I discovered

41:36.920 --> 41:41.080
it doing improv in Milwaukee, I have, you know, I've, I've, I've experimented with it

41:41.080 --> 41:45.520
and here, not here in Los Angeles. Like if I'm on a party and somebody's got some of

41:45.520 --> 41:51.080
those, sometimes if I, like now that I'm 40, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's more of

41:51.080 --> 41:54.760
a, like, I want to stay up and keep drinking. So someone's got this stuff and I'm not going

41:54.760 --> 41:58.720
to say no to it. So now I just wanted to say that because now I'm fucking perfect.

41:58.720 --> 42:04.640
Like I, I, I, there's nothing that I haven't said. Like I, I, I, I'm, I'm done, you know,

42:04.640 --> 42:09.360
if you, if you, like, I can't think of any secrets I have left and I, I don't recommend

42:09.360 --> 42:14.040
that as behavior for you. You can keep secrets, secrets are healthy, secrets are fine. The

42:14.040 --> 42:18.560
reason I never say this, because it's a grody drug, it's synthetic and it's like Don Johnsony

42:18.560 --> 42:23.120
and like, like, like it's not, like it doesn't, it wouldn't make anyone like me anymore, nor

42:23.120 --> 42:28.960
is it like, it's not like a, an addict would say this, but there's no addiction because

42:28.960 --> 42:32.800
I've been, you know, it's like, it's been in my life on and off for whenever. Like it's

42:32.800 --> 42:36.600
just, it's a party thing that happens sometimes in our, in big Hollywood.

42:36.600 --> 42:41.880
It probably happens all over the country. Yeah. Well, yeah. Dishwashers do it if they,

42:41.880 --> 42:46.960
you know, if they can't get a hold of some Adderall, but the, the season two of those

42:46.960 --> 42:56.240
plates last night at, at Stambulli's. Stambulli. But so that's it. I don't know. I just, it's,

42:56.240 --> 42:59.320
there's no reaction I expect. I just want, now, now I'm like.

42:59.320 --> 43:02.920
You always talk about yourself and kind of self-flagellate yourself about being a terrible

43:02.920 --> 43:06.160
person that you're a bad person. I don't think it's because of behavior. It would be more

43:06.160 --> 43:11.000
about the way that you're, you know, you're, when you get upset with somebody, whether

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
you mean to or not, because you're a good writer and the way your mind works, you have

43:18.000 --> 43:21.840
the ability to really hurt somebody with kind of the flick of a wrist.

43:21.840 --> 43:25.560
Thank you.

43:25.560 --> 43:30.640
And you said backstage something about the idea that like, like, like you like the tears

43:30.640 --> 43:32.480
as a part when you, when you're, when you're in that mode.

43:32.480 --> 43:37.000
When I, when I'm way overboard. Yeah. Like, like, like when I, with my significant others,

43:37.000 --> 43:41.720
there have been moments when if, if, if, if, if the significant other is, is, is going

43:41.720 --> 43:47.240
toe to toe with me, like, and it's someone's, yeah, like, and it's too much to drink. Like

43:47.240 --> 43:52.960
it gets white trashy drunk where it's like blackout or almost blackout. Like, yeah, there

43:52.960 --> 43:57.120
are, there, most of the time, like, not 85% of the time, would you hear my little Milwaukee

43:57.120 --> 44:03.120
accent? Most of the time, Pittsburgh's bringing it out of me. The, most of the time, 85%

44:03.120 --> 44:08.880
of the time, like if I, if I, if I, if I get too drunk and I have a fight with someone

44:08.880 --> 44:13.880
I love and I, and they start to cry, that's the end of it because of the tears signify

44:13.880 --> 44:18.960
like, oh shit, I, I, this reality comes in. I was in a different mode. I was a, I was

44:18.960 --> 44:24.000
a, I was a battle, battle bot of some kind. And I was like, trying to win a fight. Like

44:24.000 --> 44:27.960
I go, I go, I can like, I don't know what it is, you know, whatever dysfunction I have,

44:27.960 --> 44:31.440
whatever disorder like enables me to pull the plug on the emotional connection between

44:31.440 --> 44:35.760
me and another human being. And then, so then it's like, there's no, there's no conscientiousness

44:35.760 --> 44:41.440
like standing between me and saying something, uh, with the direct intent of like, like humbling

44:41.440 --> 44:45.840
someone. And then, and then if they start to cry most of the time, then I'm like, oh shit,

44:45.840 --> 44:49.760
that's what I'm doing. Holy crap, stop, stop, stop. But then there's like that 15% of the

44:49.760 --> 44:54.080
time, if it's really grody drunk, like, like, and the, and the, uh, and the other person's

44:54.080 --> 44:57.360
drunk and there's just fighting, fighting, fighting and back and forth only when you're

44:57.360 --> 45:03.920
drunk. Yeah, yeah, I don't, I, I, I, yeah, I don't, it's, yeah, only, yeah, I'm making

45:03.920 --> 45:08.160
sure that's the case in my head. Yeah, it's, it's a thing. It's a, it's an alcohol thing.

45:08.160 --> 45:12.280
Like it's a, it lowers your inhibitions, it makes you looser, maybe it makes you charming

45:12.280 --> 45:15.200
up to a certain point. And then there's, you know, you can go through a curtain where you,

45:15.200 --> 45:20.640
uh, your behavior becomes bad, checkle and hide. Um, so kids pay attention to that. Don't

45:20.640 --> 45:25.200
look up to a drunk writers. Um, it's not, it's not, it's not what makes you good. Um,

45:25.200 --> 45:30.880
the, uh, uh, uh, your parents have to beat you. So if that didn't happen, you're going

45:30.880 --> 45:36.240
to write shitty stuff. You're probably like a, just a bad dream journal. And I guess you

45:36.240 --> 45:42.200
got too much love. I'm sorry. Um, the, uh, uh, yeah, then I was, I was saying to the

45:42.200 --> 45:46.560
director was, uh, yeah, there's a, like the tears I actually go, okay, good. I think in

45:46.560 --> 45:56.360
my head, like good cry, delicious tears, put them on a cupcake, cry until you can't any

45:56.360 --> 46:03.920
more than you actually experience like physical like, like an erection. No, no, no, no, like,

46:03.920 --> 46:08.480
like, you, you, you actually enjoy it or like, did you actually feel, no, no, no, it's all

46:08.480 --> 46:12.800
about defensiveness. It's about, it's about being threatened because I, if I'm a child

46:12.800 --> 46:19.200
and I feel like my mommy is trying to get away with something coming at me. Like I, I

46:19.200 --> 46:26.840
need to win. I need to defeat. I need to defend myself. Not noticing that I'm a 40 year old

46:26.840 --> 46:29.480
man with his full faculties.

46:29.480 --> 46:33.160
Yeah. I think, I think the superpower, like we've all, like everyone in this room, there's

46:33.160 --> 46:37.200
certain things about us that make us who we are and make us cool. And there's, there's

46:37.200 --> 46:41.120
things that draw people to you. And also there's things, the same thing, the, the, the flip

46:41.120 --> 46:45.840
side of that coin is, is the same thing that repels people from you. Like people when they

46:45.840 --> 46:50.560
meet Dan, or first of all, like Rob Schrab, our friend, he's a, he's an artist. He's

46:50.560 --> 46:54.240
a great, he's an awesome, like, you know, he's a visual thinker. When people meet Rob, it's

46:54.240 --> 46:57.720
very like, there's people that come up to him and like, Rob's opinion of them is so

46:57.720 --> 47:01.400
important and he can really make or break their night. And what they want from Rob

47:01.400 --> 47:06.400
is to find out, am I creative? And if Rob doesn't, like doesn't think you're creative,

47:06.400 --> 47:09.400
it hurts them, you know? Who the fuck is this guy?

47:09.400 --> 47:17.440
Okay. Welcome back. For Dan, you know that you don't have the right to do what you just

47:17.440 --> 47:24.080
did. This is my third glass of kettle. I want to talk to this fucker. Do you understand?

47:24.080 --> 47:31.360
Let me put things in perspective for you. The thing about you is that people, oh no,

47:31.360 --> 47:36.040
that's, no, obviously I was kidding. Yeah. But the thing about you is he said, he said

47:36.040 --> 47:41.360
he would have peed his pants. People come up to you and, and, and the, the, the, the

47:41.360 --> 47:43.960
people that come up to you need something from you. It's important for certain people

47:43.960 --> 47:48.960
to think that, that you think that they are smart. I think smart is the key word. I, I,

47:48.960 --> 47:53.800
I, yeah. So when you diminish somebody's intellectual ability, like, or like intelligence,

47:53.800 --> 47:56.720
which I, which by the way, I don't, when I, when I get into a fight with Erin, I never

47:56.720 --> 47:59.880
call her stupid. I know she can correct me if she, if she wants to, but you said you

47:59.880 --> 48:04.280
talked to her like, like, let me explain this to you, like a, like a baby, applying

48:04.280 --> 48:07.840
that she doesn't, yeah, like, like a chimpanzee, applying that she doesn't have perspective

48:07.840 --> 48:14.160
on how, how like devastating I can be as a robot. Like, like, like I, don't you understand

48:14.160 --> 48:19.000
the faculties of this operational death star? You know, like you don't, you don't know how

48:19.000 --> 48:22.920
powerful I am. It's more like that. So you're just, you're just Emperor Palpatine.

48:22.920 --> 48:27.040
It's not, it's not, it's not your stupid because I pet myself on the back for that.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.600
Like, I don't, I don't, I don't, yeah, I don't know. Well, whatever, let's get off

48:29.600 --> 48:35.600
of that. It's getting, it's getting narcissistic. That lady's leaving. Just going pee, right?

48:35.600 --> 48:40.600
Okay. Let's fall over. I think, I think it's, I think it's number two.

48:40.600 --> 48:49.600
She's got to take a big old shit in the bathroom. Lady in the head and the jeans. She's got

48:49.600 --> 48:55.520
to take a diamond of a turd. Since, since we've taken the show to that, to that place,

48:55.520 --> 48:59.960
I just wanted to say how satisfying it was to fart in Pittsburgh today. That the, the,

48:59.960 --> 49:03.600
the coldness, like that brisk coldness, like, okay, now that guy's leaving. Okay.

49:03.600 --> 49:08.240
Look, I mean, there's, there's intellectuals in the audience. I can sense it. I'm sorry,

49:08.240 --> 49:13.760
but I, I, I, I did coke now and then and an Adderall and I, today I farted in Pittsburgh

49:13.760 --> 49:18.080
out on the sidewalk and I just, I had this extreme pleasure imagining like this, this,

49:18.080 --> 49:23.960
this, this 98.6 degree thing. Like, like, like getting out of, of, of the outer rim of my,

49:23.960 --> 49:26.920
of, of, of its, of its comfort zone and, and, and, you know,

49:26.920 --> 49:30.080
even your dynamic is the word you're looking for. What's that?

49:30.080 --> 49:32.640
Anus is the word you're looking for. No, I'm not, I'm not looking for it.

49:32.640 --> 49:40.920
Last night you were this. Okay. There's one more secret I have left. I was looking for

49:40.920 --> 49:46.360
anus last night. Season three of community was written largely on anus. The, I just

49:46.360 --> 49:49.880
imagined this little puff of like, you know, like, like this thing coming out and going,

49:49.880 --> 49:55.400
wow. Like I just, just like leaving, just like dispersing like, like at the speed of

49:55.400 --> 49:59.400
light. Like I'm sure that's not how it works, but from my understanding of thermodynamics,

49:59.400 --> 50:03.200
like hot things want to go to cold things. And like, so I was like, I just like, I was

50:03.200 --> 50:05.280
talking to a bunch of people and there are people walking everywhere and I was like,

50:05.280 --> 50:08.800
I bet you could fart here and just like, no one, no one even smell it because it's just

50:08.800 --> 50:13.240
like the fart, it's probably just goes, just like, it's halfway across town and, and on

50:13.240 --> 50:16.720
both sides. It's like, you know, it's just like becoming merges with the cosmos.

50:16.720 --> 50:21.000
All right. Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest, so to speak. Dan, I would say

50:21.000 --> 50:24.640
right now, whatever you're about to say, just because it's better to have them up earlier

50:24.640 --> 50:27.520
than later, because it always is. Can we bring Spencer up?

50:27.520 --> 50:29.640
Spencer? Okay.

50:29.640 --> 50:40.360
Judgent master extraordinaire. Story teller and extremist. You, you haven't heard the,

50:40.360 --> 50:44.000
you haven't heard the show from last night. One of the most amazing things about it.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.160
Yeah. Out in front of the, of the Pirates baseball stadium, whatever that's called.

50:49.160 --> 50:52.680
Oh, the PNC Park. We already discussed this. There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a

50:52.680 --> 50:56.240
giant statue of Honest Wagner, like, like, like, like, you're after having, you know,

50:56.240 --> 51:04.240
like, hit a tater. And it's Honest, look it up. Great, great groups, my friend insists

51:04.240 --> 51:08.640
that it's Honest and not Honest. And I defer to Greg on this. I've always called him Honest

51:08.640 --> 51:14.280
Wagner, but he says Honest and he's, he's like, he will not be moved. Greg's pretty particular.

51:14.280 --> 51:20.720
He is. Very airy day. I am a pseudo intellectual. Greg is an intellectual. H. Wagner. He's

51:20.720 --> 51:26.240
a, he's a, he's a famed ball player. Last night, Spencer, if he could be compared to

51:26.240 --> 51:34.200
baseball terms, hit 900 last night on, on, we kept throwing things out of, just, we would

51:34.200 --> 51:38.320
make up new monsters and he would just describe new monsters. Yeah. We landed on this game

51:38.320 --> 51:43.560
where we'd just make up like monster names and throw them at Spencer and he describes

51:43.560 --> 51:49.320
them as he would in a game. And it's not fair to do that again tonight because last night

51:49.320 --> 51:52.960
he was so, like he hit like five home runs and one triple off the wall, basically.

51:52.960 --> 51:57.040
Yeah. It was pretty. He got on base a lot and then, and then it was, it was good stuff.

51:57.040 --> 52:01.240
I wouldn't want to do it to you again, Spencer, because I hate to, you know. Also, I can't

52:01.240 --> 52:05.000
think, I can't remember which ones we threw at him. So like we were doing like Spencer,

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
alcoholism.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.440
Do you want me? Yeah.

52:08.440 --> 52:14.360
Well, I got, did we do that one? No, I don't think so. Spencer, alcoholism is attacking

52:14.360 --> 52:19.680
me. Opening the door to the bathroom. You felt, you smell the reek of risky. You hear

52:19.680 --> 52:25.080
the splash of liquid into the bathroom and then you feel a figure rising. Opening the

52:25.080 --> 52:36.760
door to the stall. You see a hobo drenched in vomit and liquor. That's a double. That's

52:36.760 --> 52:40.520
a double. Yeah. No, that's definitely bad. That's a double. Yeah. He's, he's, he's

52:40.520 --> 52:44.440
freaking freestyle dungeon master. I mean, just judging mastering is freestyling. Yeah.

52:44.440 --> 52:51.920
What's that? What'd you say? Oh, no, I saw, I thought I saw your mouth moving. Oh, wait,

52:51.920 --> 52:58.080
what have you got? That's Mike and Jen. Yeah. Jen and Mike. Yeah. Jen and Mike, come to

52:58.080 --> 53:03.800
the stage. We were warned about you in advance. Okay. Now I just, I think I realized why Aaron

53:03.800 --> 53:07.280
came backstage and said, you should probably bring Jen and Mike up tonight. All right.

53:07.280 --> 53:09.880
So I think we're getting an indication. Hello, Mike. Mike has a yellow shirt on. It says

53:09.880 --> 53:18.200
Harmontown, Harmon, Harmonon. Oh, are you a yinzer? Is that what that is? Yeah. Yeah.

53:18.200 --> 53:23.400
Are you, are you from here? Um, from West Mullen County originally. So how, how would

53:23.400 --> 53:29.640
you say that in your phonetics? About Harmontown, Harmontown. Anybody else? Come on.

53:29.640 --> 53:34.800
Nobody? All right. And Jen, let's see, let's get a look at you. Yours says, oh, Harmon

53:34.800 --> 53:39.520
Town the same, but yeah, they have the black and yellow Pittsburgh colors and you have

53:39.520 --> 53:44.640
a little like foam number one thingies. Yeah, this is Dan's Ray of Frost. You're not giving

53:44.640 --> 53:56.400
this to me. Are you? No, really? Oh, no. This is my flaming sword. They made authentic

53:56.400 --> 54:02.080
foam, an authentic foam number one kind of sports fan hand, like the number one thing

54:02.080 --> 54:08.200
and it's blue, like icy blue and has a screaming frosty skull and, and, and sparkles coming

54:08.200 --> 54:13.200
out of the index finger. And on the back of it, it says Ray of Frost. And I have a flaming

54:13.200 --> 54:17.720
sword that is just, I mean, it's really just a sword that's on fire. It's fucking amazing.

54:17.720 --> 54:21.160
I said, well, that's all me. I feel like a foam and stuff. Guy Thierry shirts just came

54:21.160 --> 54:29.080
in here and this is, this is amazing. That is good. Did you hear the Brooklyn show by

54:29.080 --> 54:33.040
any chance? Oh, with Sudeikis? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We found out at Brooklyn

54:33.040 --> 54:36.720
that, I don't know if you were halfway done making this or not, that, that Ray of Frost

54:36.720 --> 54:41.200
is a level zero spell that does a maximum of three damage after, and we found that out

54:41.200 --> 54:45.480
after singing the Ray of Frost theme song and really celebrating that I was casting

54:45.480 --> 54:50.080
it like I was a professional wrestler. We then found out Ray of Frost does from zero

54:50.080 --> 54:51.080
to three damage.

54:51.080 --> 54:55.440
Am I right or wrong in saying that the little, the little frosty stars on the Ray of Frost

54:55.440 --> 54:57.120
are those the Pittsburgh logo?

54:57.120 --> 54:59.120
Oh, yeah, conveniently enough.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.120
Little Pittsburgh.

55:00.120 --> 55:05.000
What do they call them? Like hyper-cycloids? Or what are they? Hypo-cycloids. Yeah. Well,

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
that's a shape. A little diamondy, little sparkle nuggets on the, on the, on the, on

55:10.000 --> 55:12.240
the. Are you guys an item, Mike and Jen?

55:12.240 --> 55:13.240
Yes, we are.

55:13.240 --> 55:22.240
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss. Dan, get a boner. Dan, get a boner. Dan, get

55:22.240 --> 55:23.240
a boner.

55:23.240 --> 55:27.760
Married or just dating?

55:27.760 --> 55:29.640
No, just, yeah, living together.

55:29.640 --> 55:30.640
How long?

55:30.640 --> 55:31.640
Living in sin?

55:31.640 --> 55:32.640
How long?

55:32.640 --> 55:33.640
For how long?

55:33.640 --> 55:35.640
Around a year and a half.

55:35.640 --> 55:38.640
And how long were you going up before you moved in?

55:38.640 --> 55:41.560
Okay. Are you guys, are you guys in love?

55:41.560 --> 55:42.560
Yeah.

55:42.560 --> 55:45.560
You are.

55:45.560 --> 55:49.360
They have a thing to unite them. They have like this great. So, Mike, I know the answer

55:49.360 --> 55:54.200
to this is no. Do you ever get really drunk and become incredibly weirdly sociopathically

55:54.200 --> 55:56.200
abusive to Jen?

55:56.200 --> 56:03.720
Yeah, unfortunately, she did lean over and say that's you whenever you were describing

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
yourself.

56:04.720 --> 56:11.920
All right. See, once again, I'm bulletproof. Ladies, I know that there's something wrong

56:11.920 --> 56:17.160
with me that I want to change. It's not good behavior. It's not part of my creative process.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.160
It's not good.

56:18.160 --> 56:23.080
Jen, would you have any advice to give Dan? I mean, not that you would presume to give

56:23.080 --> 56:26.200
anybody advice, but if you, like any, because you guys are clearly very happy together. You've

56:26.200 --> 56:29.000
been together longer than Dan and Aaron have been together, basically.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.120
I have no advice. I have my own psychoses and neuroses, like.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.600
What's your hang up? What's your bag?

56:34.600 --> 56:36.600
I don't even know.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.600
Mike, what's wrong with Jen?

56:38.600 --> 56:41.600
Yeah, I asked the source, man.

56:41.600 --> 56:48.600
Jen, stop listening for a second. Mike, we won't tell her.

56:48.600 --> 56:57.240
No, I think the problem is Jen and I are pretty much the same age, but she has developed

56:57.240 --> 57:02.520
a wealth of knowledge beyond my own. And so there's insecurities of not being able to

57:02.520 --> 57:07.520
compete with that and feel like I'm getting my side of the argument across.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.520
I'm not sure if I'm just being stupid or not.

57:10.520 --> 57:15.560
Does that manifest itself in you going, just because you're smart doesn't mean it can become

57:15.560 --> 57:16.560
Stanley Kowalski?

57:16.560 --> 57:17.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:17.560 --> 57:23.160
I mean, that happens to me with Aaron, too. I get intimidated by how smart she is, and

57:23.160 --> 57:28.760
then I try to deflect and trick her into thinking that that's not what we're talking about.

57:28.760 --> 57:29.760
That's not even the point.

57:29.760 --> 57:36.760
Yeah, it is. I'm stupid. But, all right, well, that makes me feel a little better, because

57:36.760 --> 57:45.200
if you can't, for those in podcast land, Mike is an adorable, lithe, bespectacled, knit cap,

57:45.200 --> 57:47.200
adorned, bearded...

57:47.200 --> 57:50.200
He's kind of like what Zach Galifianakis thinks he is.

57:50.200 --> 57:54.200
He's the sexy Zach Galifianakis.

57:54.200 --> 58:01.840
He's like Zach Galifianakis' avatar in heaven when we wake up in heaven and you can just

58:01.840 --> 58:02.840
look how you...

58:02.840 --> 58:06.800
All right, well, thank you, Jen and Mike. Unless there's anything, while you have the

58:06.800 --> 58:08.800
conch, do you want to...?

58:08.800 --> 58:10.800
I think I'm good.

58:10.800 --> 58:11.800
Oh, no.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.200
Oh, yeah, I mean, look, let me let it go.

58:13.200 --> 58:16.920
No, I would like to be able to make Pittsburgh proud, but that's not going to happen tonight.

58:16.920 --> 58:19.360
Where should we go drinking if we go drinking in Pittsburgh?

58:19.360 --> 58:21.360
I was saying Gooskies. Anyone else?

58:21.360 --> 58:22.360
Gooskies?

58:22.360 --> 58:23.360
Gooskies.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.360
Where's that at?

58:24.360 --> 58:25.360
Oh, it's out on Polish Hill.

58:25.360 --> 58:26.360
Polish Hill?

58:26.360 --> 58:27.360
Damn, you're Polish.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.360
Yeah, I sure am.

58:28.360 --> 58:29.360
Is that near Stamulli's?

58:29.360 --> 58:35.120
You know, I mean, look, you don't have to. I can play you off with this beat, but if

58:35.120 --> 58:39.360
you guys want to rap with Dan as a, you know, as you give it a whirl, we can edit it out

58:39.360 --> 58:41.360
of the podcast if you want.

58:41.360 --> 59:07.360
No, you go too fast for me. Like I said, I'm not smart enough to argue with her. I can't

59:07.360 --> 59:08.360
rap at all.

59:08.360 --> 59:11.360
Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Right here. Here we go.

59:11.360 --> 59:18.360
Once upon a time, I needed to eat a loaf of bread. I didn't get it soon enough, so I

59:18.360 --> 59:26.360
starved now I'm dead. I put on a pair of shoes and walked down the street. I didn't get my

59:26.360 --> 59:32.360
bread, but saw your mama and got my meat slower. So it's like slower tempo. You can do it

59:32.360 --> 59:33.360
like that.

59:33.360 --> 59:44.360
Take a mic. I don't think I can as hard as I try to think. And that's it. I've hit a

59:44.360 --> 59:45.360
wall.

59:45.360 --> 59:46.360
All right.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.360
All right.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.360
I'm with Jen.

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
Jen, you're smart.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.360
Jen, you're smart.

59:50.360 --> 59:51.360
Shame him, Jen.

59:51.360 --> 59:52.360
Shame him like the Pee-Bee and he is.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.360
All right.

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
Well, that's right.

59:54.360 --> 59:55.360
She's dancing.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.360
She's dancing.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.360
All right.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.360
She's dancing.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:05.360
Jen's got the moves. Jen's got the moves. Jen's got the moves.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.360
Let's hear it for Jen and Mike, everybody.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.360
Are you sure you're giving these up, right?

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360
These are ours?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360
Thank you.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.360
That's really incredible.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360
These are wonderful.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360
Look at that fucking thing.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360
We should have them sign them after the show.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.360
Speaking of Rob Schrab, this isn't very Schrabby and stuff here. He'd be very proud of that.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.360
You can still see the hot glue strings on it, which makes it nice that I love that.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:40.360
Yeah, they did a great job of simulating a kind of like sword with embers on it and flames

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
trailing.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:50.360
Spencer, mediocre zookeeper attacks.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.360
Hold on. I got the music.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.360
Oh.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:01.360
The cage opens up with a creek. You see two legs holding a pile of what seems to be backs

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360
of feed.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.360
Several spill to the floor with a clumsy clatter.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:15.360
Dropping to his knees, a short, portly man crouches before you, apologizing profusely.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:24.360
Mediocre zookeeper.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.360
He's got a zoo to keep.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:34.360
But he's not great at it. He doesn't work in San Diego. He's in LA County.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.360
I just keep the pelicans alive. That's all I do. I lost three last week.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.360
I like that the feces fell to the ground with a clatter.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360
Sometimes they clatter.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.360
What sort of animal has pooped that clatter, Spencer?

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360
Bags of feed, dude.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360
Bags of feed, he said.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.360
But to answer your question, penguins, clearly.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.360
All right.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.360
Dan, Spencer came to me earlier today and kind of out of fashion for Spencer, he approached

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.360
me with a bit for tonight's show.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360
Really?

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360
Has he talked to you about this?

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360
No.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.360
Dan and I have been making up stupid songs on the bus.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360
There's Pringles Dick, there's Chicken Noodle Dick.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.360
Has anybody heard the Chicken Noodle Dick song?

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.360
I got drunk last night in Arlington and I sang it twice.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.360
I forgot the audience had already heard it.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.360
Yeah, we did like an anchor and Jeff taught them the Chicken Noodle song and the anchor

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360
that we had already sang.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Did anybody heard the Chicken Noodle Dick song?

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360
Here's how it goes.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360
There was silence.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360
I took that silence for no, we haven't heard it.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.360
The silence was, you're drunk.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.360
You sang this 45 minutes ago.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.360
So Chicken Noodle Dick is Dan on a bus.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360
I'll explain it to you people.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.360
Dan on a bus holding a Chicken Noodle, a can of progressive light Chicken Noodle soup

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.360
in his lap as though it were his dick and we cobbled together this song.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360
Here I am.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.360
You got a dick, you got a Chicken Noodle can.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.360
All my life, I've been put in this can since I'm a Chicken Noodle wife.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.360
Chicken Noodle got a comb down from the mountain saying Chicken Noodle Man, you got to work

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360
all day.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.360
Chicken Noodle Man, you got to cross the river Jordan, feed the devil's soup and take his

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.360
troubles away.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.360
All right, so that's the song.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:20.360
Now soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon, spoon to the mouth you're going to get well soon.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360
I'm trying to build.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.360
Yeah, see I got a building off of that.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.360
So Spencer's worked on some lyrics to add to it.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.360
So it'd be like a verse and then it'd go back to the chorus which is, you know, the Chicken

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.360
Noodle Man and then it's another verse and then back to the chorus.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360
Jesus.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.360
A flash of inspiration in the shower or maybe a curse.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.360
I mean, we'll see how it goes.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:46.360
Can you explain to me how flashes of lyrics come to you in the shower?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.360
Cascading over you in a warm flurry.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.360
The water rains down.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360
Then it hits you.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.360
A good idea, maybe.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.360
That's all.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.360
He's fucking the best.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.360
He's the best.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.360
Spencer, I fucking love you so much.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.360
But so yeah, if I could do the verse and then we could come back together for the chorus

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360
maybe and then try it.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360
I mean, we'll see how it goes.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Okay.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.360
Okay, so it starts with the soup to the bowl, right?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360
Do you want me to sing that?

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.360
Yeah, let's do that.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360
All right.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.360
Soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon, spoon to the mouth you're going to get well soon.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.360
You better get a little bed rest, sleep until noon.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.360
Grab a cup of coffee, then hit the saloon singing Chicken Noodle Man coming down from the mountain.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360
Chicken Noodle Man gotta work all day.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.360
Chicken Noodle Man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.360
Be a devil, stupid, take your travels, go away.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.360
Blue South and come what may.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.360
My Chicken Noodle wife left me just the other day.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.360
I don't know what I can do but pray.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.360
Singing Chicken Noodle Man, you gotta work all day.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360
Chicken Noodle Man, come down from the mountain.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.360
Chicken Noodle Man, you gotta work all day.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.360
Chicken Noodle Man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.360
Be a devil, stupid, take your travels, go away.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.360
Write those down.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.360
Spencer, when we get on the bus tonight, when we get on the bus, I want lyrics,

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.360
pull it up on your iPad, we're going to learn those.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360
Yeah, let's workshop it.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.360
For you podcast listeners, in the closest we'll ever come to the Tom Jones effect,

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:29.360
a man just threw his hipster beanie hat on the stage at Spencer's feet.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.360
You have this, take it.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.360
Nice.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.360
And inside that beanie, there's panties.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.360
If it was the 80s, that would be a pocket protector or something, right?

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.360
Spencer, you're going above and beyond the call of Dungeon Master Duties.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360
And of Road Companion too.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:00.360
You could have been cranky and become a drag by now, but he's become an inspiration and a good friend.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360
I just want to help.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.360
Spencer, we went to Permanent Brothers today, we walked around a bit.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.360
What do you feel about Pittsburgh so far? Have you been here before?

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.360
I've never been here before. I love your guys' architecture.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.360
I love your weather. It's, I love it. It's brisk.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.360
It's good walking around weather.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360
I don't sweat.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.360
I think you noticed I disagreed.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360
Yeah, definitely disagreed with you.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360
Where did you grow up?

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.360
I grew up in Alaska.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360
Oh.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.360
No, I grew up in Northern California.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.360
So it's just fun for you, huh?

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360
Yeah, I don't know.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.360
So weird. It really is the mythology that I'm from Milwaukee, so I'm going to be walking around with my shirt off out there.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.360
There's a reason I moved to California.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.360
I am a pussy.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.360
Do not, I don't, but it's a great city and stuff.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.360
I just, I'm just saying, like, that weather, man, I don't know how you guys do it.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.360
I applaud you.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.360
It's not even that cold yet.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.360
No, no, it'll get, yeah, February, it'll get colder, right?

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.360
It'll get 80 below, probably.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360
Well, 80 below with Wind Show is the Milwaukee thing.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.360
It gets to be 80 below with Wind Show.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.360
And the weathermen tell you as part of their weather report how many seconds in which human skin freezes.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.360
It's a regular part.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.360
It's like they're telling you the dew point.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:26.360
Don't forget, human skin freezes 28 seconds of this weather, so bundle up.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360
Buckle up your skin?

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360
Bundle up.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360
Oh, bundle up, okay.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.360
So buckle up.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:39.360
Is anybody here, like, it's been, it's probably like seven years since I've been here,

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:45.360
and I found out what a yinzer was, and I went to, I asked this girl at a bar,

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.360
is there like a real, like, straight up yinzer bar?

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.360
She's like, you don't really want to go to one.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.360
I was like, no, I do, I do.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.360
And I went there, and people really do say yinz want to go down and eat and buy some eggs and that,

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.360
and they're like, people say anat, and they say yinz.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.360
Is anybody here have a really good, like, proper yinzer accent, or can somebody do one?

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360
Huh?

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360
We already have Mike up here.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360
Mike's pretty good.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.360
You in the back, sir.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.360
Come on up.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360
Let's bring that guy up.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.360
All right.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.360
I want to hear a good and proper yinzer.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.360
Good and proper yinzer.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.360
Tried to catch the moon, but only caught it.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:24.360
Next thing you know, yinzer accents being done.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:25.360
My name's Ian.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360
Hello, Ian.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.360
Ian, I take it you're from here, right?

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360
Yeah, basically.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.360
Johnstown.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.360
Two hours away.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.360
Yeah.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360
All right.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360
So are you going to put on an accent for us, or are you going to give us yours?

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Oh, yeah.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.360
I don't talk like a yinzer normally, but so, hey, yinzer guys won't go downtown.

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.360
Permanent brothers, go over there.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.360
Get some hall sausage sandwich.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360
How's that for a sandwich?

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.360
I have been worshiped no clothes.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.360
I have been worshiped.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.360
You say I've been worshiped.

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360
The girls say I've been worshiped.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.360
I have been worshiped.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360
Nothing.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360
Wait, wait, what?

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360
Earth?

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360
Say what you just said to me.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.360
So, in English.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.360
In English, I haven't been washing.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.360
I've been washing anything.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.360
I ain't been worshiped.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360
I ain't been worshiped.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360
Nothing.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.360
This is my upstairs neighbor in college.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.360
So do it again for me.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.360
I ain't been worshiped.

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.360
The girl, the girl, she say I've been worshiped.

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360
I ain't been worshiped.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.360
Nothing.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.360
Awesome.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.360
All right.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.360
Yinzer accent.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.360
What does that come from?

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360
Is that like an old, like hangover from Scottish?

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.360
Irish?

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.360
Like what is it from?

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.360
I have no idea.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.360
Polish?

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360
Yins?

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360
It's Scotch Irish.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.360
Scotch Irish.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.360
It's really good.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.360
Get up here.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:35.360
Yins are challenged.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Yins are challenged.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Yins are battle.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.360
This guy might be a native.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.360
He might be better than me.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360
Yeah.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.360
Let's hear your Yinser.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360
Hi, my name is Dean.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
I grew up in Tratton, Pennsylvania.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:55.360
It's right up 28.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:03.360
And I, like I can't even tell I have an accent.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.360
Essentially on a normal day on Sunday, I watch the stillers.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.360
I go down to Permanis.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360
I don't go to Pramantes.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360
I don't like it.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360
No.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360
Permanis.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360
Yeah.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360
How about this?

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360
I'm a vegetarian.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360
I was out of fucking place in there, man.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.360
Still liked it though.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.360
I had a tie on and I ate the double egg and cheese and it was fucking delicious.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360
That's right.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:30.360
Well, usually in Pittsburgh, you get the, what the fuck is it called?

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.360
The steak and cheese.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.360
But a steak and cheese isn't like a Philadelphia steak and cheese.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.360
It's got, well, it doesn't go cap corn.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360
It's steak and cheese.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.360
It's got sauerkraut.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.360
It's got fries.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.360
It's got Italian bread.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.360
It's good.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.360
Yeah, it's amazing.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360
I had that today.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360
Now, do you and your day-to-day life say an act?

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360
Yeah, every day.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.360
That means et cetera and so forth and whatnot, right?

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360
Right.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.360
So if I'm talking to my buddies and I want to go down to Gooskies and I want to do something

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.360
before Gooskies, well, you say, you want to go do Gooskies and that or you want to do,

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.360
what are you going to do?

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.360
You want to go eat and that and then go to Gooskies?

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.360
Or G yet and go to Gooskies?

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.360
Yeah.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360
I love that.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360
Okay.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.360
So I like to think and I'm almost certain that this is the case.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360
Your name again was what?

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360
My name is Dean.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.360
Dean, Dan gives, what's your name over there?

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360
I'm sorry?

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360
Ian.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360
Ian.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360
Ian.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360
Ian and Ian are the first Yenzer rap battle.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Oh.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:43.360
And I want to see who can be the most Yenzerie during the rap.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.360
I went downtown yesterday.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:55.360
I got a pop, Randy's in.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360
Shit.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.360
Perfect.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.360
Ian, you're a battle.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.360
For many broaders, it's here for Yenzers.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.360
Oh no.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360
Go, go over there.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.360
Yen's guys watching in Pittsburgh stillers.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.360
All in all, I'm from Pittsburgh.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.360
I ain't got no rhythm.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360
I can't watch nothing.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.360
Dan joined in and tried to be a Yenzerie rapper.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360
You tried to mimic the accent.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360
Yo.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360
Yo.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360
Yo.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.360
When you watch the stillers at the bowl, I talked to your mama and said, what the

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360
fuck?

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360
Yo.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360
From Pittsburgh.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360
You're all equally terrible.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.360
It's here for the Yenzer rap, everybody.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360
Have a good night, Matt.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360
Fantastic.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.360
Thank you, sir.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.360
For me, it's too similar to the Milwaukee thing.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.360
It's very, we're cousins, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360
No, that one's pretty specific.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.360
Milwaukee's all about the long vowel sounds talking through your nose and ending everything

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.360
with ya and hey and ena.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360
Ena.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360
Ena.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360
Hey.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.360
Some time.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.360
I mean, that's extreme shit.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360
That's like, cut a haste out in Milwaukee.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.360
All these accents have fascinating little trees, little branches of an accent tree.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360
It's pretty cool.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.360
Should we start Dungeons & Dragons?

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.360
Well, one more thing.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360
I wanted to...

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360
Oh, well, come on.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
Take it easy, Jen.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:30.360
You know, I've been drinking and I will make Mike look like Mr. Rogers.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.360
What's that?

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360
Oh, is he from Pittsburgh?

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.360
Is Mr. Rogers from Pittsburgh?

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.360
Oh, that's why he was on the wall at...

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360
Fuck it.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360
Everybody's on that wall.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.360
Gene Kelly's up there?

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.360
Is he from Pittsburgh?

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.360
Oh, I was wondering whether random celebrities interspersed with Terry Bradshaw and stuff.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.360
The sports guys I get, but...

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360
It's everybody.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360
Everybody's...

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360
Wow, Pittsburgh.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360
Say what?

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360
We're an actual city.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360
Nobody said you weren't.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360
He said we're an actual city.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360
That was a little defensive, sir.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.360
I think the last thing anyone would say is that Pittsburgh's not a city.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.360
You literally build fucking buildings out of the stuff that you do here.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360
It's like...

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360
Of course Pittsburgh's a city.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360
It's steel.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.360
It's fortress.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:22.360
It's full of whipping winds and coleslaw.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.360
I like that the coleslaw's not that sweet KFC shit, but it's like that vinegary kind of tart stuff.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.360
That's how it should be, right?

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.360
I just wanted to say when we were walking through those whipping winds, this conversation happened

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360
between Aaron and Spencer.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.360
Aaron said, well, my face is getting used to the cold.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:47.360
And Spencer went, you mean numb?

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.360
He slices through artifice.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.360
He seems to be either villains or monsters.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.360
There's magic or there's curses.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360
Is there one more thing?

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.360
Jeff, do your eyes keep going to the guy in the white shirt right back there?

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.360
He's very...

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.360
Don't move.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.360
You're very well lit.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.360
Very well lit and very distinct.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.360
No chops, give everybody.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360
No chops, give everybody tonight.

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.360
Are you a theater person?

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360
Because you really found your lighting.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360
He is a theater person.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360
He instinctively found his light.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360
That's a Saturday Night Live.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.360
You would be Elvis Costello and they would cut to you.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
What do you think?

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.360
Even if he wasn't well lit, he is lit by his dignity.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.360
He's got his arms folded, but not in the...

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360
His arms folded in the kind of...

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360
I'm trying to describe for listeners.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.360
You know how you fold your arms if you are pouting?

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.360
It kind of closed off.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.360
Then there's the intellectual holding one elbow with another hand.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360
It's contemplative.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.360
My eyes keep darting over to him because he's so not a typical harm-on-town audience.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.360
What is your name, by the way?

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360
Joel.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360
Do you know harm-on-town?

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360
Have you heard of this?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360
Do you just wander in tonight?

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.360
No, I'm not sure.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.360
You're an usher.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.360
Would you be willing to come up and talk to us?

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.360
I've been looking at him all night.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360
Joel.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:12.360
I can honestly say this is the first guy that's ever been this specific physical archetype

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.360
that I've ever seen out there in the crowd.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.360
There's an actor that he looks like.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.360
Is it E.G. Marshall?

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.360
What is it?

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.360
I can't...

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.360
Jack Lemon.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.360
Jack Lemon.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.360
Hal Holbrook?

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360
A little Hal Holbrook?

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.360
All right.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360
Hello, Joel.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:33.360
Your name's Joel.

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.360
And you're an usher here at the theater.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360
I'm an usher at the theater, yes.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360
You've been...

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.360
It could have gone worse because my eyes can't keep off of you.

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.360
I always play to the person in the back of the room that I'm most terrified of, that

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360
I'm, oh, this person is going to hate me.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.360
I'm talking about cocaine and booze and being stupid and I'm farting.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.360
And so my eyes keep going to you to check in.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360
And you've never...

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.360
You know, you're not pumping your fists or anything.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.360
But you've been very supportive.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360
I would define you as...

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.360
You've been smiling now and then when it passed muster with you.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360
Yeah.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360
Didn't give you the finger.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360
No, no, yeah.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360
You didn't get up and leave.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360
You didn't...

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.360
Yeah, moon us or anything.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360
Yeah, Joel.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360
Well, Joel, what do you think so far about the show?

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360
Be honest.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.360
Well, HIP, what do you think about this?

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360
I find it very strange.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.360
I really don't understand it.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360
It's very nice of you to say that.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360
All right.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360
Well, I don't know what...

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360
I just...

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360
I had to like...

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360
I wanted to personify him.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360
I didn't want him to be this like, you know...

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360
Dan, we all have our own wants.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360
You want to personify him.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.360
I want him to rap a little bit.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.360
Oh, no, no, no.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360
Come on, Joel.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
I don't want to rap.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360
Joel's not going to rap.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.360
Me neither.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360
We have that in common.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:57.360
How long have you been an usher here, Joel?

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360
Actually, about nine years.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360
Yeah.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360
Are you...

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360
You must be a patron of the arts.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360
Like, you want to be close to it.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.360
That's why you took the job, maybe?

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360
Yeah.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360
I mean, I ushered a bunch of theaters.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.360
This is a beautiful, beautiful theater.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360
Oh, this is not the only one that you ushered.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.360
I was walking downtown.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.360
It used to be the public theater before they moved downtown.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.360
This was the public theater.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360
And you get to see all the stuff for free?

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360
Yes.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360
Because you ushered?

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360
Right.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360
Are you married?

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.360
No.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.360
Okay.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360
And you...

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360
What's your...

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360
I don't know.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.360
What's the best play that's been here in this theater this year?

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:36.360
What's the best thing you've seen in this venue here?

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:43.360
Oh, the second city used to come here before they went downtown.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360
Oh, okay.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.360
So you like the improv comedy?

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Yes.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360
I'm sorry.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:57.360
I'm sorry that people spontaneously coming up with humorous things to say is your forte,

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.360
because I must have let you down.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.360
I do a different brand of thing here.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:09.360
I'm sort of a low rent, spaulding gray, I guess, but I haven't written anything of it.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.360
Okay.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.360
Thank you, Joel.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.360
Is there anything you want to plug or...

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.360
Is there a sports drink you manufacture that you want people to know about?

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.360
I mean, you have the mic if there's anything you want to say.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360
No, I kind of hide away.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.360
Okay.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360
He's an usher.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360
He's got the usher spirit.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360
He wants to get back to the shadows with Joel.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.360
And yet he found the most well-lit seat in the house.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.360
It's like God is your flashlight.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360
God is ushering you.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360
I see.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.360
You're right.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.360
I'm writing the light there.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360
But you look good in it.

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.360
I mean, it's great.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.360
Like I said, you could have really played a mind game on me from that seat.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:55.360
Every time I looked over, you could have just gone.

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360
Well, now I can't.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360
Now you can.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.360
You can do whatever you want, Joel.

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.360
That's what Harmontown...

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360
That's the only thing we have going for us, is your freedom.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.360
Thank you, Joel.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.360
Joel, everybody.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:11.360
Thank you so much, sir.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360
All right.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360
Let's bring Erin McGathy to the stage for D&D.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360
Erin.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:23.360
Erin McGathy.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.360
Erin steps to the igloo cooler, refreshing her ice to the...

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360
I'm no Spencer.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.360
I can't do it.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360
You can't do it.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360
No one can.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360
Hello.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360
Hello, Erin.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360
Hello.

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.360
Erin McGathy.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360
Everybody?

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360
Did I miss anything?

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:48.360
I just want to say, while Joel was up, I think someone's trying to date rape me.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360
What do you mean by that?

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360
I'm a very mysterious drink.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.360
Somebody came and brought what seems to be a yingling beer to you.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.360
And there's definitely like a pill fizzing around in the bottom.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.360
Are you kidding me?

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.360
Let me see this.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360
Yeah, no, I'm kidding.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360
Careful.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.360
I swear to God, it's hetero love.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
Okay, so that's you?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.360
Yes.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360
You, I trust.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.360
Okay.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.360
Is there a pill?

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.360
Is that an optical illusion, Spencer?

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.360
No, I was joking.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.360
I was joking.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360
Oh, God, I thought...

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.360
Really affecting it.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360
I don't know.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360
Yeah, I'm a little jealous.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:28.360
Oh, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.360
Wait, Spencer, you don't even drink, really, do you?

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360
I know how.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360
But Spencer...

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.360
Dungeon Snap.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360
All right.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360
Spencer, sorry, Erin, go ahead.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360
Oh, nothing.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.360
I just said wireless.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.360
Is there anything, Erin?

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360
Wireless mic.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360
Because it's kind of not fair when I talk about our relationship and whether or not

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360
I'm a dick within it.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.360
And then you don't have, and now that you have the mic, is there anything that I said that

01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.360
you need to counter or clarify or...?

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360
Sad woo from the audience.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.360
Like, did I lie? Did I lie about anything that you need to correct me on or...?

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360
No.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360
I don't think so.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360
I feel...

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.360
I mean, at Harmonetown, I guess we're honest about our feelings.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.360
I feel a little raw.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.360
Oh, well, by the two-way channel.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.360
I did...

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:23.360
My cheeks weren't totally dry backstage.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360
I made you cry tonight?

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360
Oh, I don't know.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360
During the show?

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360
No, it's fine.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360
I don't want to be...

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.360
I don't know.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:39.360
It's kind of a bummer listening to you talk about jerking off to a 17-year-old with a

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360
ponytail.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360
Ladies?

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360
It's fine.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:49.360
I don't want it to be a thing, because Dan and I have had this conversation a million

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360
times over, but...

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.360
Are you saying you cried during that backstage?

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360
Look, man, I'm just being honest.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.360
I'm not saying it's the way to be.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.360
I don't know if anyone listens to my podcast, but I don't start it by saying, hey, I'm

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360
perfect.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360
Here goes.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.360
So, I don't know.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360
I...

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.360
It will bum me out a little bit.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360
Given our...

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.360
The sexual activity we had this afternoon, I felt a little...

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360
Made me feel a little sad.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.360
Because it was unreciprocated.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.360
Because it was one-sided, and...

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360
I was...

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.360
I have a fever.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360
It's...

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360
Hey, man.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360
It's all about...

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360
It's fine.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360
It's fine.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.360
It was all about me this afternoon.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360
Were you saying it was unreciprocated sex that went on today?

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.280
Like, Dan was being selfish in bed today?

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.080
We had two hours to get some rest.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.080
I had a fever.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.080
I was...

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.080
I had chills.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080
Like, she asked me...

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080
Is there...

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.080
Is there...

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.080
Can I...

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.080
Can I help you out?

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.080
Like, kind of...

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080
I can't remember how she put it.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080
I do not say, can I help you out?

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.360
I can't remember how you put it, but my response was, is it okay if I just lay here?

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360
It's fine.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.360
I'm really not upset about it.

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:59.360
I mean, it probably speaks more to my own insecurity, but when...

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360
You know, when...

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.360
Well, it speaks to your desire to have sex.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.360
Like, it speaks to your...

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.360
On the tour, yeah.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.360
On the tour, things are slower sexually, so when I watch you on stage fantasize about

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.360
a volleyball playing 72-year-old, I want to kill myself because I'm like, well, I'm not

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360
that, and I wish I was.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360
I have red hair.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360
I wish I were.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360
No, I was...

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360
Yes.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360
I wish I was.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360
Okay.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360
Well, I understand that.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.360
That wasn't supposed to be a black horse.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.360
That was the start.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360
And yet it was.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360
Yeah, and yet it was.

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360
And yet it was.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360
And yet it was.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360
I...

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360
No, I don't know.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360
I just...

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.160
I guess after last night and the last couple of days, I feel a little low.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.360
I feel a little defeated.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.960
I don't feel super...

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.240
I guess maybe I don't feel...

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:51.360
I love you, but I don't feel super hyped on our relationship right now.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360
But...

01:24:52.360 --> 01:25:02.360
Well, I'll see what I can do about that before Minneapolis.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.360
But I...

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.360
Guys, I'm not saying I want to break up or anything.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.360
I just feel a little...

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360
I just feel...

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360
My heart's a little chafed.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.360
I used to be really fat, and when I would go to a water park, my thighs would get all red

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.360
and bloody, and that's what my heart feels like.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.360
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360
Hey, Joel.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360
Look like Jim D.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.360
Joel, take it easy back there, won't you?

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.360
Joel's now pumping his fists.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360
But I think the show is going great.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360
I think Pittsburgh's awesome.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360
Everyone here is super...

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360
It's one of the great...

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.360
It's one of the top three towns in the nation to break up, and did you guys know that?

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360
Your dream...

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.360
Everyone at the merch table was so cool and so nice, and it was great.

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.360
Spencer, I hate to call an audible, because you've prepared this stuff and also, but you're

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.360
very willing to adapt on the fly to stuff that we do.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:05.360
Maybe is there a way during this little fantasy segment that we do in D&D for Dan and Aaron's

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.360
characters to maybe find some sort of connection, maybe patch up some of these wounds?

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.360
Is that possible?

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.360
Yeah.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360
All right.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.360
Spencer, if you would, catch us up to date.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:25.360
When we last met, our heroes had just hijacked a flying airship piloted by Dave.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.360
The airship seemed to be damaged, and the gang raced around trying to fix it, and just after

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.360
they thought they had it all under control, a shake rattled the hole.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:42.360
The gang awoke in the wreckage of their ship, and in the midst of a deep dark red cave.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:49.360
Just by seven humans and a halfling, a chorus of people approached our heroes in the deep

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.360
of this cave.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:58.360
As our heroes met the tribesmen, they realized that they had been swallowed by a great beast,

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360
known only as the Infinifish.

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.360
There was this weird point in the show where, for some reason, I don't know how.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.360
It wasn't my idea.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.360
We brought all the black people in the audience onto the stage.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360
So there were eight black people.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.360
They both were on stage.

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.360
I said, the way how is that you said it.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.360
Let's bring all the black people on stage.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.360
Right.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.360
I don't know how we got to that point.

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.360
There was a Greek chorus of all of our black audience members up there, and they were kind

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.360
of our guides through the fowls of the Infinifish.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.360
They took you through some neat curtains.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:36.360
They did a dance that opened the way forward, and you got to their village, which is where

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360
you are now.

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360
Perfect.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.360
Again, nine seconds left on the track, and he knows exactly how to end it.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360
He's amazing.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.360
All right.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360
So let's examine our surroundings.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360
You're in this red cave-ish area.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.360
The walls are fleshy and pustules of glowing golden fluid line the walls, casting light

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.360
over the area.

01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.360
Several scrap hovels have been shored together from various pits of pieces of ship and or

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.360
crates and or other items.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:11.360
There's about 17 or 18 of these dwellings, and they seem quite modest, but workable.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360
Cozy.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.360
Yeah, cozy for inside of an animal.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.360
The people are just hanging around now.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.360
They're just going back to their business.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.360
So are you going to play all these people, Spencer?

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:29.360
I can play all of them, any of them, none of them, whatever has to happen.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.360
Okay.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.360
Did you want to get the black people in Pittsburgh to come up?

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360
No.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360
Let's bring them out.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.360
Let's bring the black people.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360
It was a joke.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.360
I don't know how I felt about having done it.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360
It was an organic thing.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360
Halfway through it, I was like, what are we doing?

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360
We're dehumanizing black people.

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:54.360
It started as a thing that was supposed to re-humanize and express ironic white guilt,

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:59.360
and then when you arrange people in a big, long line and give them one microphone for

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.360
them, it's like the opposite effect for me emotionally, I think they had a good time,

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:08.360
but I can't really access them emotionally, so I don't know.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.360
I seek out the elder or leader of this group of people.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.360
That's the female chieftain that you met in Arlington.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360
I approach her.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360
You approach her.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360
I say, what's up?

01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.360
I hope you find our village to your liking.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.360
It's not much, but it's all we have.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.360
We don't get very much stuff down here, but my friend Phil owns this shop down the lane.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.360
There's also an end to your right if you need to sleep.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360
We got some stuff.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.360
I'm sorry we don't have much, but it's the inside of a friggin' beast.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.360
We probably definitely need some sleep at this point, I imagine.

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:49.360
I'm bushed, and I notice some strange tension between Mulray and Sedona, and Sharpie Buttsalot.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:57.360
I find the nearest humble dwelling that a gnome barbarian might find, and I hit the hang.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360
That happens.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.360
You take your leave gracefully.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:09.360
I find a reflective surface on a wall, and I walk over to it, and I brush my hair.

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.360
You find no reflective surface?

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.360
No.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:23.360
I walk over to some sort of wall, and I imagine that there's something there, and I stare at it, and I brush my hair.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:31.360
You look beautiful since becoming a woman.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360
Thank you, Sharpie.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:41.360
Okay, said some things back in the epiglottis.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360
I regret, I guess.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360
You guess?

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.360
You guess you regret them, or you actually regret them?

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.360
Well, I regret making you feel bad.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.360
I don't want to do that. I like you.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:58.360
But if I hadn't felt bad, everything you said would have been fine?

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.360
I don't know.

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:05.360
I mean, it's like...

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:12.360
How much tap dancing do you want done for your sake?

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.360
Very little.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:23.360
All I have to do is just not say certain stuff during a show that I'm doing. All I have to do is think about you.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.360
All right, pause. D&D pause.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.360
Oh, it was on pause.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:37.360
I was just being open about my feelings, and I qualified it by saying that I think it's just about my insecurity.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:41.360
After the show, I wouldn't give you a note saying I don't think you should have done that bit, because I think it was fine.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.360
Artistically, I think it was totally cool, because I'm feeling insecure.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360
I said it's sorry that you were hurt, which is the truth.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360
Okay, that's fine.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:54.360
And your question was, you're sorry that I was hurt, but if I wasn't hurt, you would have thought that was okay.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.360
So, here we go. Now, that's a note. That's a behavioral adjustment.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.360
Well, I mean, Dan, I was being Mulrainee.

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360
What?

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:09.360
Well, I just... Let's back up a little for actually going to talk about this in front of all of our best friends.

01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:14.360
Can I get you guys a couple drinks?

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:22.360
When we had that fight the other night, you apologized, and then in the morning, I was still feeling sad.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:28.360
And I said to you, I still feel sad about this, and your response was, so what?

01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.360
Yeah, because we had a fucking drunken fight the previous night, and it's not...

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:36.360
Right, but you saw him slung a lot of arrows.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:41.360
Arrows!

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.360
So, it was a lot. It was a lot. It was more than usual.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:53.360
But after talking about it on stage last night, I was fine.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:59.360
And hypothetically, I'm fine now. I guess I'm feeling a little insecure.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.360
I feel a little undesirable.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.360
Well, you're the hottest girlfriend I've ever had.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360
Oh, thank you.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:25.360
Is that the... I mean, because it seems... I realize that we all have kind of fundamental needs to feel sexy and stuff,

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:32.360
but there's a certain point at which... I love you. I'm in love with you.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:39.360
I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and the idea that a piece of pornography,

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.360
or a primal urge, somehow a threat to you...

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:50.360
No, it's not that. It's when you're...

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:56.360
When you show me less that you're attracted to me than those things creep into my brain,

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:02.360
but when you are in a mode where you show me that you care about me, and ladies...

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.360
It doesn't take a lot, right? It takes very little.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:11.360
It takes... You look nice today, or...

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.360
Gosh, I'm so busy. I wish I could have sex with you right now, but I gotta go to work.

01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:25.360
Just very little... Women are so much lower maintenance than men think.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:34.360
So when we're on tour, so everything's fucked up, and it's hard for you to...

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:41.360
It's a slash impossible for you to pay me the attention that I need because I am just as broken as you.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:49.360
Hence why I'm in this relationship with you. I don't think that someone super healthy would fall in love with you.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.360
And that's not a diss. That's love.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:35:03.360
So in the same way that you flipped out at my high school reunion, because some douchebag was hitting on me,

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:14.360
I need... I just need a pat on the head, and I don't know, I'll get you later.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.360
It's all fine. And I'm not mad at you.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:25.360
I'm not... You did. You pat me on the head tonight. I'm not mad about the 17-year-old thing.

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:35.360
I'm just feeling insecure, that's all. And after last night, or two nights ago, things are a little raw. Everything's fine.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.360
I think feeling insecure is awesome. I stand up here and talk about what makes me feel insecure.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.360
All the people in this audience come up to me after the show and shake my hand and tell me about the things that make them feel insecure.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:54.360
That listens to this podcast instead of Rob Schneiders agrees that expressing insecurity is worth something.

01:35:54.360 --> 01:36:03.360
However, then there's this line between expressing insecurity and what? What's my thing?

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.360
You think that I'm trying to get you to do something?

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360
Right.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:16.360
So you feel insecure when something happens, and then I say to someone that loves you, oh my God, I'm so sorry that you got splashed by things that made you feel bad.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:23.360
Let me help you. I am so sorry you feel bad. And then you say...

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.360
But you think that that's acceptable behavior, or like you're not going to do that anymore, right?

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360
Or whatever the hell, how have you phrased it before?

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:43.360
You express the fact that the things that I do are the things that make you feel insecure and you imply that in order for you to feel good about yourself,

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.360
my behavior has to shift and change.

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.360
And then I go into defense mode.

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.360
Right. I think that's mostly in your head. I think that's in your head.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:37:02.360
Okay. Well, it's been recorded. It's not in my head now. It's over a sound system and it's on tape.

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.360
We can rewind it. We can play it on the bus and let's talk about it.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.360
Maybe it's when someone apologizes for certain behavior they assume that the other person is saying,

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.360
I'm sorry for this and I'll try to do something different.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:18.360
But are you telling me that when you apologize for something you say, I'm sorry I dropped the vase.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.360
I'm not going to try to not drop it anymore.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.360
Yes, yes. Uncharismatic as it sounds because now we're not in a comedy mode.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.360
So now the joke is gone. We're outside of it.

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.360
So just as when they bring Eminem on CNN and have him read his rap lyrics,

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:37.360
do you think this is appropriate? I'm not going to sound very charismatic when I say,

01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:47.360
yes, I don't think it was that bad to do the joke of having a weird petty fantasy that's out of a hustler video.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.360
I don't think it was either. I was just saying that I felt insecure.

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.360
You asked me how I felt.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:58.360
And I said, I'm sorry that you feel insecure. And then you implied, then you went into that territory.

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.360
So you're going to change, right? And the answer is not in that specific context.

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360
No, I don't think so.

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360
I don't think I...

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.360
Well, then I was misunderstood or I misspoke.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.360
I didn't mean to imply that I thought that you should do something differently in that way.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.360
Well, Aaron's fault.

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.360
We will rewind it in the bus and we'll update people.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.360
Spencer, I...

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.360
Oh, that Aaron. Oh, the Aaron and the other Aaron.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360
Aaron, A, A, R, O, A.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360
Aaron, A, A, R, O, A.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.360
When you...

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.360
Oh, wow, yeah.

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.360
What's your name?

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.360
My name is Brad.

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360
When Brad said it's all Aaron's fault, I was really just like, okay.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360
Yeah.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360
Yeah, it's okay.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.360
What's amazing is the guy that Dan was pretend fantasizing about and trying to get a hard-on for,

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360
his name was Aaron. I didn't even put that together.

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.360
Look, I...

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360
I was...

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.360
This was my process backstage.

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.360
I heard that bit and I was like, God damn it.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.360
And then I was like, look, Aaron, if you were doing a show and your bit was that you needed to get wet for somebody,

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:02.360
everyone would think it was stupid and gay and retarded, not gay homosexual.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.360
And not retarded disabled.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360
And I'm thinking about...

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360
She's gay.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360
She made retarded gay and gay retarded.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360
Yeah.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360
She said...

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:13.360
Just to clarify, I hate retarded people.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360
Take care, you guys.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.360
But I...

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360
It would be really stupid and not funny if I got up and in that bit said, oh, I'm imagining Dan Harmon.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.360
Exactly.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360
And he said, yes, I agree.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360
I was only speaking to my insecurity.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360
I don't think that you should stop.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.360
I was just speaking without a filter about how I feel.

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.360
And I said, I'm sorry.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360
Feelings are complicated.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360
No one told you not to express your feelings.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360
And then I said, I'm sorry.

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360
Okay, so what did I do wrong?

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.360
So what did I do wrong?

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.360
Brad, what did I do wrong?

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.360
What is happening?

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.360
Please tell me what happened.

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:52.360
I think you need to stare at Aaron and do the same thing to Dan.

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.360
I think it's the only way to save it.

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360
An eye for an eye?

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360
Well...

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:08.360
Aaron, male Aaron said, or you can stare at my wife.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.360
And oddly enough, that's when the show rounded a bend.

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.360
Okay.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360
All right.

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.360
No one wanted to do it.

01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:23.360
Spencer, I take my flaming sword and attack the tension in the room.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360
Critical hit.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:34.360
Interesting enough, this is a lot like...

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.360
Dan, for reals me, I wasn't telling you to stop doing that.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360
Okay, okay.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360
Well, good.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360
I'm sorry I misinterpreted it.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.360
Then I'm very sorry I misinterpreted that because that is exactly the message I received.

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.360
And I love you.

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.360
And I would never do this with anyone.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.360
I've never...

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.360
Critical hit.

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.360
Been in a relationship with this.

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.360
Reminding a corner.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360
I'm leaving the tension.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.360
I critically hit the tension.

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.360
That's why I'm saying to her, I love you.

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.360
I don't want anything to ever hurt you.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.360
I want to be with you forever.

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:07.360
I'm perfectly capable of saying that.

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360
It's not...

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:16.360
Everything else is cosmetic, like weird behavioral adjustment that I don't cotton to, you know?

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.360
I love you too.

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:22.360
I'm perfect and sometimes I will feel bad.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.360
Sometimes I'll feel bad about things and I'm just telling you how I feel about something

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360
and I'm not giving you a note.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.360
Okay.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360
You don't want to change me.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360
I don't want to change you.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.360
I don't want to change you.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.360
There would be too many changes.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.360
Hypothetically.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360
I mean, I don't.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.360
I think you're perfect in your imperfection.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.360
Okay.

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.360
So where's Gooskies at you guys?

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.360
Where do we go?

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.360
I love you very much.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.360
I'm sorry.

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.360
You two should keep going.

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.360
Let's all just quietly sneak out and go to Gooskies.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360
Dan.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.360
Dan, can I ask you something?

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.360
Yeah.

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.360
Can I move in with you after the tour?

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.360
Wow.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360
That hairpin.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.360
A hairpin turn.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.360
Do you think...

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.360
Can I answer that question with a question?

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.360
Do you think these are healthy circumstances under which to get a yes?

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:26.360
No, I just think they're good for the show.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.360
Okay.

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360
I wait for my sleep, Spencer.

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.360
And I walk into the hut where Sharpie and Mulrainee are talking and I enter the hut and

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.360
I go, oh boy, I had a really healthy night's sleep.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360
Holy moly, what did you guys do?

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.360
What did you talk about?

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.360
It was the upshot.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.360
I don't want to go through a big thing.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.360
What's the headlines?

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:56.360
We dreamt of a futuristic world where our voices were louder than they should be and

01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:04.360
a chorus of angels watched us argue about things that only made sense in that world.

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360
So welcome.

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.360
Cool sword.

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.360
Thank you.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.360
Mike and Jen got this for me, isn't it?

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.360
Gorgeous.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:16.360
Mike sculpted all this, all the foam on this.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.360
He didn't just buy it this way, he sculpted it.

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.360
Why don't you fuck him?

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.360
And we're back.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:33.360
The greatest adventure.

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.360
Oh, a reset.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.360
All right.

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.360
We'll edit it out.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.360
No, the fuck you will, that stays in, baby.

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.360
All of it stays in.

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:49.360
Do you think the director of the documentary is like...

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:55.360
He's backstage like the guy from the Highlander like...

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.360
He's having the opposite experience of the audience.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.360
It's inversely proportionate.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:08.360
They're like, oh my god, the babysitter is going to make $90 tonight and Neil's like...

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.360
For the power of Grayskull.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.360
Oh man.

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.360
Has there ever been a podcast where a boyfriend and girlfriend got into it that much?

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.360
I don't listen to a lot of podcasts, that's pretty wild, right?

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.360
Let's not congratulate ourselves too much.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.360
Let's take the time they gave us.

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.360
I was saying there's a reason why there isn't a lot of those.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360
I don't know.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.360
Yeah, it's a ratings disaster.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:42.360
I don't know if anybody's sadness or uncomfortability, but it's very fascinating to sit this close to that kind of conversation.

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.360
And the fact that you're so absolutely comfortable doing that with a lot of people.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.360
There's 17 farmers in here and there's 200 people.

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.360
And you guys just bear your souls as if we're not even here.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.360
Which makes me believe that you don't think we're here.

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.360
Which is the definition of sociopathic.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:06.360
It's so narcissistic that you don't know I am sitting over here and going to the camera.

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:13.360
Can't we both join forces and fail to consider the entire world's feelings?

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.360
Wait, how about this then?

01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:23.360
You guys just cast Ray of Frost on other people's knowledge of your existence.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.360
I don't know what that means, it's a level zero spell.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.360
I think it's fascinating that you guys are...

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.360
I'm not easily embarrassed.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:36.360
I don't know that I could sit in front of this group of people and turn this into Sally Jesse Raphael.

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.360
Spencer, we're attacked by monogamy. Go.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:48.360
Creeping into the room, you hear the dull monotonous thuds of your significant other.

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:54.360
You roll over and pretend you're not awake.

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:57.360
He's a goddamn genius. What kind of pressure do you think I'm under?

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.360
I have a better writer sitting next to me who's half my age.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360
I took him on this tour. I was inviting a homeless person to Thanksgiving.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.360
I'm being a big charitable guy.

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.360
Let's take the Dungeon Master on the rock bus. He's a fucking genius.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:13.360
I was supposed to be riding my Fox pilot. I fucking blew it.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.360
I turned the CBS one in, but my career is dying back home.

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.360
And this guy is ascending to stardom.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:23.360
You're empowering somebody, that's more important.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.360
It is. That's why I'm a great person.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.360
A lesser man would be really, really sabotaging you. You're a very threatening person.

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.360
I love you. God damn it.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.360
What's that?

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360
He's not from Alaska.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.360
The last thing I'm going to do is go, why would you say that?

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:50.360
We just talked for 90 minutes about something where you could have asked that every 30 seconds.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:56.360
Let's get back to the game and let's just bring this thing into the station on a dime.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.360
A Pittsburgh steel dime.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:03.360
You're on track to live in the belly of this fish for the rest of your life right now.

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.360
Right, it's an infinite fish. What did my mom say that nursery rhyme about the infinite fish?

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.360
It'll eat you.

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.360
She was right.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.360
All right, so clearly these people, they couldn't get out of here for a reason.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:22.360
Did they lack some sort of knowledge or tool that we have to get out of the infinite fish?

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.360
Maybe.

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.360
I approach the wall with the yellow pustules on it and examine those.

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:34.360
You examine the pustules. They seem to secrete a vicious odor, as well as light casting light into the room.

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:41.360
I take a throwing knife and stand back 12 paces and throw a throwing knife into one of the pustules and see what happens.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:48.360
The pustule pops with a sickening burst, sickly fluid pours forth.

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:55.360
Well, he's doing that. I want to ask around to see if I can find the person that they acknowledge as being in charge, like their leader.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.360
Yeah, you meet up with the person Quark was talking to.

01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:59.360
That lady.

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.360
Okay.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.360
The chieftain lady.

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.360
Okay.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.360
Yeah, how can I help you? You know, do you want a house?

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:11.360
There was a shop. Her friend owns a shop. Her friend Phil, right?

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.360
Yep. Phil the shopkeep.

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.360
I run down to Phil's shop.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:23.360
Hey, I'm Phil. I sell stuff. I don't got much, but sometimes cargo vessels get ate and I sell them things.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.360
Do you want any things? I got healing potions.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:33.360
I got these syringes full of some sort of paralyzing goop.

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:39.360
Goods for calming down the monster, and we don't get cable down here, so it's fine.

01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:48.360
It seems to me, Jeff, that what we need to do, and don't ask me where I got this idea, is we need to make this giant monster that we're inside puke.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360
Monster house, 2009.

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.360
Wait, I have smoke sticks. Should I light a bunch of my smoke sticks?

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.360
I can hit the fish's uvula with an arrow.

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:09.360
I say because the show is getting to the point where we're going long, that we buy all the good stuff that we need.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:16.360
I'll buy those healing potions. Let's go shopping and let's embark on the adventure next time, probably, right?

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.360
I can part with some potions, 50 apiece. The syringes are going to run you 250.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.360
I'll take the potions. You guys get the syringes.

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.360
You guys got a fair amount of money.

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.360
Syringes. Is there anything else?

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:39.360
Do you guys want any? I got a rope. I got a signed picture of Derek Jeter.

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.360
Holy shit, Derek Jeter?

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.360
Yeah, he's a great cleric of renown.

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360
I'm a Pirates fan.

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.360
I'll take some rope.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.360
You get 40 feet of rope. It only costs a meager amount of silver.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.360
Basically, D&D, people came and brought us awesome swords and ray of frost thingies.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:04.360
All we did was talk about relationships and go shopping.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.360
Spencer, everybody!

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.360
Yay!

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.360
Erin McAfee.

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.360
Yeah. Thank you, everyone, for indulging that conversation. Sorry if it became weird.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.360
Thank you, Spencer. Thank you, Erin.

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.360
Wow.

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.360
You're in for it.

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:34.360
One more time for the beautifully awkward relationship between Dan Harmon and Erin McAfee.

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.360
I'm going to start my own podcast called That Felt Terrible.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:46.360
I think that's why Joel's not married. Remember when Joel came up?

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.360
Yeah. The well-lit Joel back there?

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.360
Joel escapes the hero of this whole story.

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.360
So, after all that, she walks on stage and you deify being a bachelor.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.360
I'm an entertainer, Jeff. It's in my blood.

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.360
I go for the laugh.

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.360
I didn't get it, but I go for it.

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:15.360
As an entertainer, Dan, the burden is on you right now to tie this little package, whatever we did here tonight,

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.360
in the Hazelette Theater in Pittsburgh.

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.360
I think we really take advantage of these wireless mics.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.360
Yeah. You can really walk around like, you know, use the space.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.360
What are you doing for? You want to wrap this up in song right now?

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:31.360
Or do you want to go talk to people? What do you want to do?

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:38.360
No, no. Let's wrap it up and meet people at the same time with a beautiful song about everyone in this beautiful city.

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.360
Yeah.

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.360
It's a beautiful citadel of steel, rivets.

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.360
They're cold, but your hearts aren't.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.360
I met a guy named Stephen today

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:11.360
and I said he was gay, but it's okay if you are in Harmontown.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.360
You've made yourself hysterical.

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.360
This is the idea that that's entertainment.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:27.360
It's funny to me. I guess that's pretty meta.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:33.360
Oh, like your hat. What's your name?

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.360
Whoa.

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360
Wow.

01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360
Harmontown.

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.360
Magical things happen in Harmontown.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.360
What's your name?

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.360
Stephen again.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360
Stephen again.

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.360
I fucked your mama nine times and ten

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:53.360
and the Steelers didn't go to the division of championships

01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.360
because Harmontown and everything involved in football is stupid.

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:06.360
Everything's dumb because it's stupid to throw a ball when you don't have to hit anything with it.

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:12.360
It's all a bunch of shitty crap, but it's okay to enjoy it.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:20.360
Every little Pittsburgh boy and girl went to Harmontown.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.360
Beautiful theater.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.360
I see a guy that looks like Tom Baker.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.360
I see a guy with a check shirt maker.

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.360
This isn't working.

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.360
I'm not that talented.

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.360
Striped shirt.

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:35.360
Regular shirt.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.360
Black shirt.

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.360
Scarf on a bra.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.360
Sweat shirt bra.

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.360
Crooked cotton hat.

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.360
Oh, is that shake orvis?

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360
Holy shit.

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.360
Hey buddy, how you doing?

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.360
I knew this guy when I was 19 years old in Milwaukee

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:56.360
when we did comedy sports together.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.360
Holy shit.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.360
Wow.

01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.360
Wow.

01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:04.360
He's the son of my original mentor in Harmontown.

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360
Wow.

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.360
Who taught me how to be funny and obviously he failed.

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:13.360
He doesn't make that much money because his job was to make me able to do

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:18.360
what that one guy did with the Irish joke in Harmontown.

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:24.360
Wait, Harmontown, everybody sing Harmontown

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.360
where he is yellow and the poop is brown.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.360
I play guitar on your mama's titties that ground round.

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:36.360
I put your mama on a sled in a kite and I flew her in the air and said,

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:39.360
I'll take a bite and I think I fit a chip of chocolate

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.360
because she's a cookie.

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.360
What a bitch.

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.360
She's a cookie to me.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.360
I objectify women like that.

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.360
I'm so sorry.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:55.360
I should compensate, tip my hat to all the ladies in the Harmontown.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.360
I put your mama, but I love the ladies in Harmontown.

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360
Harmontown.

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.360
Horrible, horrible stage.

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.360
Harmontown.

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.360
Good call.

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.360
No, no, it's never going to work out.

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.360
Harmontown.

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.360
Harmontown.

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.360
Uh-oh, just this.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.360
It's got a stage that's just you reclining on people.

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360
It's gonna work.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360
All right, okay.

01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.360
All right, Daddy needs his medicine.

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.360
Harmontown.

01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.360
Go to Joel.

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.360
Go to Joel.

01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.360
Joel.

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:30.360
Joel is an usher and he leads people in and he sits in the shadows

01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.360
and requires no sin.

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.360
He just watches other people take the spotlight but don't deserve it.

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:39.360
But tonight, Joel is the hero.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.360
Say a word.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.360
A word.

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:46.360
He's as free as a bird.

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.360
Joel's a white-shirted angel in Pittsburgh.

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.360
It's a city that makes all the cities.

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.360
And I sucked your mama's titties.

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.360
Harmontown.

01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360
Thank you all for coming to Harmontown tonight.

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.360
Harmontown.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.360
I just did this.

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:05.360
Thank you so much.

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.360
I deserve my time.

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.360
Suspension Clinton.

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.360
And McCarthy.

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.360
I think Jen, the beautiful artwork.

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:21.360
Are you into rap battle?

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.360
Joel, the usher.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:27.360
Thank you so much, sir.

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:29.360
We're all going to Gorskies, right?

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.360
Gorskies?

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.360
We're all going to Gorskies.

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.360
If you bought anything, I'll sign anything.

01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.360
It'll take hours, but whatever.

01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.360
You guys were very patient.

01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.360
We'll be right outside, you guys.

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:40.360
I fucking love Pittsburgh.

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360
You guys are the best, you know.

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:44.360
Everybody else.

01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.360
God bless you, Pittsburgh.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:57:15.360
Stay Steel.

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.360
Thank you so much.
