{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:17.000\nMusic\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:21.000\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:36.000\nMusic\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:41.000\nI'm Jeff Davis, Comptroller. Would you please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:54.000\nYeah. Thank you.\n\n00:54.000 --> 01:03.000\nWelcome to church. This place is gorgeous. This is a great theater. It's really, it's very, very weird here tonight.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:13.000\nIf you know me, then you're here. If you know me and you live in Pittsburgh, you're here.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:23.000\nIf you know me, then you know that I'm very, almost annoyingly obsessive about story structure and in relation even to my own physical activity,\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:32.000\nthe course of my life and the course of my evenings and often doing obnoxious things like pointing out that we've reached the goddess point in this conversation\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:38.000\nor something stupid, a little, little, little, little, little, candle, candle flashing.\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:43.000\nBut this tour, I mean, we knew when we set out, like, okay, come on, this is going to be a story.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:49.000\nLike every physical process you do, if you plant a potato and then dig it up and then eat it and poop it out, you're telling a story.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:53.000\nAnd also, if you zoom in on the process of digging up the potato, there's a story there.\n\n01:53.000 --> 02:01.000\nAnd if you zoom in on the process of the first shovel dig, whatever individual shovel dig is called, is that a scooch?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:03.000\nA splorch.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:08.000\nOkay. You can buy in the lobby, Jeff's the new book of Sniglet's.\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:11.000\nThat's the words that you didn't know existed.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:20.000\nSo, guys, we've embarked on this tour. We're almost, if not exactly, depending on where you define where the thresholds across the beginnings,\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nwhich shows you can't, which ones you don't.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\nWe're right about smack in the middle. We're at the World Naval here.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\nWe are meeting with the goddess here tonight in Pittsburgh in this church.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:33.000\nAnd I don't make the decision for these things to happen.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:39.000\nI woke up this morning, like, I don't want to panic you. It's going to be a great show.\n\n02:39.000 --> 02:42.000\nI woke up this morning depleted.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nI don't even know. We've been having a great time.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nIt was just like, weird things that happen.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nWhen you sleep on a bus, I didn't even know this was a thing.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nYour inner ear, I think, gets accustomed to the velocity.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:02.000\nLike what you used to call sitting still is now getting adapted into 70 miles an hour.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nEspecially if you're sleeping during it.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nWe have these little bunks on the bus.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:11.000\nI was in the hotel room this morning, and I swear the entire hotel was driving down the street.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:18.000\nThese waves of vertigo, because my inner ear is being ricocheted back and forth, blah, blah, blah.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nAll kinds of physical reasons why we're meeting with the goddess tonight.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:25.000\nLike, I have been broken down as your hero.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nSomebody went...\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:32.000\nAnd that was the straw that broke me down as your hero.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:39.000\nIs that guy going... I have been broken down physically.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nWe were achieving weightlessness here tonight.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:45.000\nThe steps beyond us are going to be painful and weird and awesome.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nThey're going to involve God overtaking us.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nI don't know if that happens here in this church, Jeff.\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nI think they have...\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.000\nWas it a church?\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:53.000\nWasn't it?\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:55.000\nWhat was this place?\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.000\nA public theater.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nA public theater. It was never a church.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nOh, fuck it. Never mind.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\nLet's just do some rapping.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\nNo, no.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nEverybody kept saying it's a church.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:09.000\nI guess they're just commenting on the way it looks.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nIt's not a church, yo. It's not a church, yo.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:15.000\nIt's not sanctified. It's not glorified.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nThis ain't a pulpit, yo. This ain't a pulpit, yo.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:22.000\nI'm not chicken fried. I'm not chicken fried.\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\nI don't have God behind me on an altar.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\nI just want to talk, but now I'm starting to falter.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:31.000\nI fucked your mama in the front and in the back.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nI fucked your mama until she had a heart attack.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\nSo you can sense I've been broken down.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nIt's amazing that people clap for that.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.000\nYeah, it's magical.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.000\nOkay, so that brings me to the bigger topic here.\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\nIt's like, okay, we're halfway through this journey.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nSo we've been performing in all these different cities.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nWe're meeting all these Armenians.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\nAll this stuff, if you listen to the show before we left,\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.000\nPat Noswell came out and warned us,\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.000\nlike this Ian McKellen figure going,\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:04.000\nyou have no idea what lies beyond,\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:08.000\nand one does not simply walk into Phoenix.\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:11.000\nHe was coming from a comic standpoint\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nand also almost a pre-podcast standpoint kind of.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:18.000\nWhat we have is the same people from city to city.\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.000\nI meet you guys after the shows.\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.000\nI sign stuff. I shake your hands.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:24.000\nI interact with you. I cosmically intermingle.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nAnd you're all, not in a bad way.\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:28.000\nYou're all the same.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\nWe have achieved, we have data back.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nThe results are in.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nWe know what a Armenian is.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nA Armenian is a loving nerd.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nWe have a definition now.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nThat was one of the many things that...\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nSo we've met with a goddess in that sense.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nI know who you guys are.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nI know that if you're being completely silent,\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nI'm not necessarily failing.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nIf you are, fuck you.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nI know that you'll give me time to get around to my point.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nI know that I don't have to pull out a rubber chicken.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nI know who you guys are,\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:04.000\nand I know where we stand with each other.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nBut yet we don't know who these particular...\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:08.000\nEvery audience I do, Jeff.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nThis is a steel driving town.\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.000\nThat's the only difference.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nSteelers, baby.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nShould we do a sports corner?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:22.000\nDan Harmon Sports Corner.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nDan Harmon Sports Corner.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nHe knows all about sports.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:28.000\nHe's got a Pittsburgh Steeler.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nTwo-cut his hat.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nHe's about to tell you about the Steelers' chances\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:37.000\nin the big game tomorrow.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:40.000\nDan, what do you think about the Steelers this season?\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.000\nJeff, if I've said it again,\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:44.000\nI'll say it a thousand times.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nYardage, yardage, yardage.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.000\nYou've got Quintrow on the tight end,\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nand he's doing great,\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nbut he needs to be paired with Hodgkins.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:56.000\nWhat do you think that the...\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.000\nWe talk about tight ends versus this.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nWhat do you think the role of the tight end really is in an offense?\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nFirst and foremost, people don't agree with this.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nIt won't win me any popularity contests.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nHe's got to back up the linebacker.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nHe's got to be there for him,\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nand he's got to keep icing his knee.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nHe's got to be there to receive.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nIf the receiver fails,\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nhe has to back up the linebacker.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nWhen the quarterback throws those missiles,\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nas I call them, especially with the Steelers,\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nyou've got Hodgkins on the quarterbacker.\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:27.000\nEither you're icing your knee,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nor you're catching that ball.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:34.000\nWhat's your opinion about the Steelers' secondary?\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:37.000\nI think it's a bunch of trumped-up stuff.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nI think it's ruined the game for the fans.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nYou think there should be no secondary?\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:44.000\nI think it's a myth.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:47.000\nWe're familiar with the first quarter in football.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:50.000\nWe love the third quarter,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:53.000\nbut there's four quarters to a game.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nWhy do you need to say secondary?\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nIt's stupid. It's a foregone conclusion.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nIt's breaking into two halves.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nWho do you like between the Falcons and the 49ers?\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:06.000\nSchmiddi.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nSchmiddi, okay.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nStomply.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nThe game was played today.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:14.000\nWhat do you take away from the Falcons at the 49ers?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nI hate to sound like a broken record. Yardage.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nYou've got to keep that ball moving down the field.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nWho did you favor going into tonight's game?\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nAt the top of the game, I would have told you Scrinfrop.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nNo, I mean the team.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:30.000\nFalcons or Niners.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nI thought under Scrinfrop's leadership as a coach\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nthat they would have gone against the 49ers\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nand taken away the Golden Sieg.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.000\nYou had the Falcons' favorite going in.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nFalcons and Niners.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nDefinitely Niners.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nYou had the favorite going into the game.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nHow do you feel about the outcome?\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nI think the Steelers did poorly.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:52.000\nThey certainly did.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nThey proved that games ago.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\nAnyways, Jeff, people put too much emphasis on that.\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nDan Harmon, the Game Corner.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:06.000\nHe loves sports.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nI love sports.

You were very nice.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nI'm listening.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nI'm listening, and by the way, so far this is not going as planned.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nThat's fine. That's fine.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nThat is also fine.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:47.000\nWhat I have done is I've brought another Dan Harmon up on stage.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nPretty much.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nBut that's fine. This could be...\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nWe talk about it all the time. Actually, in college, my nickname was tangent boy.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nOkay, so take us...\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:58.000\nOkay, here we go. Sorry, let's start from the beginning.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nSo there's a guy in a pub, right?\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nAnd it's closing time, and the bartender comes over and says,\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nI'm sorry, you got to go. You got to go.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nAnd the guy says, all right, I'll go. I'll go.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nAnd he gets off the ball stool, and he falls flat on his face, right?\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nAnd the bartender says, oh, can I help you? Can I help you? No.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nI'll be fine. I'll be fine.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nIf I just get outside, I'll be fine.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:19.000\nSo he crawls outside.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nAnd he gets up, and he falls flat on his face, right?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:25.000\nAnd everybody says, oh, can we help you? Can we help you?\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nI'll be fine. If I just get to me flat, I'll be fine.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:32.000\nSo he crawls to his flat. It's only a couple of doors down, you know?\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:35.000\nCrawls to his flat, stands up, falls flat on his face, right?\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nWhen he opens the door, and he falls flat on his face.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nAnd he says, if I just get to me bed, he says to himself,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nif I just get to me bed, I'll be fine.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:47.000\nSo he crawls over to the bed, he stands up, falls flat on his face, falls right to sleep.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.000\nNext morning his wife wakes him up.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nCome on, fucker, wake up, wake up.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:55.000\nAnd she says, well, I see you went to the pub last night.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nHe says, well, I had a few drinks,\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nbut how did you know I went to the pub last night?\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nYou left your wheelchair there again.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nAll right. Okay, good.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nJustin, that's the control group for that.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nThat's the control. Very nice.\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nThank you, Justin. I love it.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nYeah, what's your, I was just going to say, although now I hate you,\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nbecause you said it, but I wanted to be gracious and say, do you want to plug your improv?\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:20.000\nI would like to. It's Steel City Improv Theater,\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.000\nSteelCityImprov.com.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nOh, cool.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nAnd actually this month we just moved to Shadyside,\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:29.000\nso we have an awesome, bigger theater, so come on by and check it out.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nWe have classes, fun stuff. Okay, cool.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nThank you, Justin.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nJustin, good luck with that, man.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:37.000\nAll right, so just hit me later, like 10 minutes later.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nOkay, let's move on.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nI think I can nail that one. I think I'll, my new goal is,\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nI'm almost certain that you will not nail that job.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nI will, I know.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nWhat you're going to do, because there are details, there's beats to that,\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:53.000\nand you're going to, first of all, timing will go out the window.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nTiming will be the first casualty.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.000\nAnd then you're going to, you're going to add,\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:01.000\nI will hold my predictions.\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:05.000\nI'm going to say a couple other beats are added into it that are extraneous.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:09.000\nIt is, which is tit called here in Pittsburgh.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nPittsburgh invented the witch's tit.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:14.000\nThis is from the official Wikipedia entry.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nIt's not as cold as Milwaukee and Minneapolis people,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nthey argue with each other.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.000\nI've noticed them from Milwaukee.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nEvery time you meet someone from Minneapolis,\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nyou, the two, they all step right,\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nit's colder in Milwaukee, it's colder in Minneapolis.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:28.000\nThat because they're the two coldest cities,\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nlike including Windchill.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:34.000\nBut Pittsburgh, here's my point.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nLike, we are now, we're rounding this bend,\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nwhere we're getting closer and closer to, to the cold of my childhood.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nThere's different textures, different kinds of cold.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nAs I was explaining to my,\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:49.000\nlargely equatorial girlfriend, Navy kid Erin McGathy,\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nwho spent, you know, went to high school in San Diego.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nShe's never, she was playing with snow,\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nlike when we got to wherever it was,\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nthere was the first snow on the ground.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nShe's like, do you want to touch it?\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nI'm like, we go way back.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nShe actually got, we're on the bus.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nShe's like, Jeff, have you ever seen snow before?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.000\nNo, never saw it.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nShe was amazed by it.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nShe made a little tiny snowman, or Spencer did.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nAnyways, as I was explaining to her,\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nlike, there's cold, and then there's like,\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nthere's a cold where you shiver,\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nbecause it's like cold under your body,\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:19.000\nit's cold, your skin's cold.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nOh, little, little things are happening to my body,\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:22.000\nbecause my skin's so cold.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:25.000\nAnd then there's the, the, the cold of the,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nmy soul is cold.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:30.000\nMy feelings are cold.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nI remember moving from Milwaukee to Los Angeles\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:35.000\nthe day before that happened where I made my final decision.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nI was chiseling my car out of ice,\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nand I reached over to open the door,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:42.000\nand the metal hinge snapped off in my hand,\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:46.000\nbecause not only, not only did God not intend humans\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nto live in that climate,\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:52.000\nbut Newton didn't design metal to...\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:56.000\nThat was Carnegie.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:58.000\nYeah, and I remember just laughing at the sky\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nand going, I'm going to LA!\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nBut anyways, it's starting, it's bringing back,\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nthis is another reason why it's meeting with the goddess tonight,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nis because it's reminding me of my childhood.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:10.000\nI'm bundled up, and I can't get warm enough.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nI don't know if I have a fever, or chills,\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nor something's happening to me, Jeff.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nDid you take the medicine I gave you?\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nYes, I did.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:17.000\nYeah, that'll do it for you.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:18.000\nWell, I don't know, man.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:21.000\nI don't know what's happening to me.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nMeta.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:27.000\nWait, it doesn't know us.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:30.000\nI want to do an experiment.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nI want to tell you a story before...\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nIs it about a guy that goes into a bar?\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nNo, I want to tell you something,\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:40.000\nbecause I came out, I had tears in my eyes,\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nright before I came out,\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nbecause I was thinking about sharing a thing with you guys\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:50.000\nthat happened to us in...\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nWhere the hell were we last? Jesus.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nArlington, thank you.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:59.000\nThe ghost of the phantom of the non-church\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\ncalled out from the rafters.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nWe're going to do Jesus Christ Superstar later.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nThere's these cool platforms.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nReally, we could do a scene from Rents.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nHas anybody ever been in Rents,\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nor possibly West Side Story?\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nWe could do all kinds of shit here.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nI'm going to see if I can cry on stage, Jeff.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nI want to see if I can cry on the podcast.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nLike drop a tear?\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nBecause I haven't shared this yet,\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nbecause I keep telling people about it,\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nand then I start crying.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nWhat do you mean as a party trick to actually make a tear\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nproduce a tear for us?\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nYou're saying, can you actually break down emotionally\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nand start crying?\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nWell, both. I mean, it's a party trick, isn't it?\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nIsn't that what emotions are?\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nAre you saying you want to prove to an audience\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nthat you're capable, that you have that range,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nthat you could do that,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nor that you want to prove that you're capable\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nof revealing yourself that way?\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nI want to see if it's possible, both.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nI want to see if it happens.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nBecause I've told...\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nOur friendship, Eston, can cry,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\ncan make a tear come out of his eye in 10 seconds,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nbut I'm never going to be able to do that.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nBut I just want to see if the lights and the microphone\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nand the idea that I'm doing a performance\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nand a podcast actually get in the way\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.000\nof what keeps happening every time I tell a story to an individual.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\nWhat's the time limit on this?\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nOr is there no time limit?\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nTime limit?\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nYeah.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nOkay, is there no time limit?\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nSuch a crass, coarse man.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nNo, I'm saying like...\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nI want to make it interesting.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nVulcan.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\n20 bucks says you can't cry in front of these people.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nAll right, well, so this guy...\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nYeah, but that's making it into a game,\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nand when you hear the story, you're going to go,\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\noh, I'm an asshole for...\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nI just wanted to...\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nI'll take it back.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nAll right.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nSo we were in Arlington,\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nand we went to this bar,\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:40.000\nand we were sitting there drinking,\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nand there was this guy sitting across the bar\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nthat kept looking at us.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nHe was wearing a suit,\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nand Aaron said,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nI think I recognize that guy from Twitter or something like that.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.000\nIs he a fan?\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nHe keeps glancing over here.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nAt one point, Aaron got up to go to the bathroom,\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nand he came over,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nand he handed me three napkins\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nwith a letter written on them,\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nand said,\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nMr. Harmon, I can't make the show tonight,\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:10.000\nbecause it sold out faster than I could get a ticket,\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nand I wrote this letter for you thanking you.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nI was hoping that if I drove out here,\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:19.000\nI would be able to catch you\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nat some bar.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nHe had a good chance.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:26.000\nAnd I just wanted to give this to you\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nand thank you on the off chance that it was possible.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nI can't get into the show.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nI'm not asking for a ticket.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nI just wanted to talk to you and thank

The reason you can't walk is not psychological, it's\n\n34:16.760 --> 34:24.400\nnot a Disney movie, it's not Downton Abbey, this is a real thing, it won't heal, the doctor\n\n34:24.400 --> 34:33.880\nshowed us, you were injured in an NRA explosion, Schrab.el cleaved your spinal cord, it's physical,\n\n34:33.880 --> 34:38.160\nI can show you the x-ray, she got it out of the drawers, look, there's a disconnection\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:44.680\nbetween the brain that makes things happen and the limbs that enact the desires, there's\n\n34:44.680 --> 34:52.560\nno way for it to get through, you got so drunk, your thoughts leapt across your spine and\n\n34:52.560 --> 34:59.080\nlanded in the right place like a tron cycle and raced to your drunken feet and you propelled\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:05.240\nyourself, though not 100% effectively, but still astonishingly so, until you got home\n\n35:05.240 --> 35:08.400\nand passed out, now try to walk again and he does and he can't, he's like, I can't even\n\n35:08.400 --> 35:16.560\nmove my legs, I'm crippled, she says, you mean physically challenged, and he says, what\n\n35:16.560 --> 35:25.280\nare you, the word police, she says, well someone has to be, filthy mouthed old cow, she made\n\n35:25.280 --> 35:37.200\nhim some tea and he apologized, but at this point it's a cycle, I don't know, that didn't\n\n35:37.200 --> 35:47.040\nturn out its plan, did it? Oh, did Jason really leave, is our bus driver here? I believe he's\n\n35:47.040 --> 35:53.600\nstill here. Okay, if he's willing to, wait, no, he left, okay, alright, he got nervous\n\n35:53.600 --> 35:56.760\nabout it, tonight was one of the few nights that we might have been able to bring our\n\n35:56.760 --> 36:03.240\nbus driver on, we're traveling, we missed a good, is he really gone? Wait, is he out\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:10.240\nin the parking lot? He got like a car service. Yeah, he got in the car. He got in the car\n\n36:10.240 --> 36:15.040\nwith a girl cell phone. Well, wait, what, he absconded with one of your staff? He got\n\n36:15.040 --> 36:20.320\nin the car with the girl that sells tickets. He really is. Well, there's bad news and there's\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:27.520\nworse news, the bad news is that our very charismatic and complicated bus driver, Jason,\n\n36:27.520 --> 36:32.720\ncouldn't be here tonight, I really wanted you guys to meet him, the worst news is that\n\n36:32.720 --> 36:43.880\nhe's our driver and he's drunk. You know, he'll be fine. He just needs to summon the\n\n36:43.880 --> 36:49.000\nneurological miracles necessary to. Hey, what was the name of that place we walked by today\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:53.880\nwhen it was like, there's funny his last name you ever saw? Stimulis. Stimulis. The place\n\n36:53.880 --> 36:56.960\ncalled Stimulis. What's the place that's called, like the strip where all the like the ethnic\n\n36:56.960 --> 37:03.320\nmarkets are? I don't even know what Stimulis sells. I didn't know, Stimulis is the funniest\n\n37:03.320 --> 37:11.920\nname in the world. Stimulis, like made it up. Hey, welcome to Stimulis. Stimulis, if\n\n37:11.920 --> 37:24.720\nwe don't got it. Oh. He sounds excited. That's just me. Stimulis, come on. It's hilarious.\n\n37:24.720 --> 37:28.680\nAll right. I also in the back, the director was interviewing me. He asked me all kinds\n\n37:28.680 --> 37:33.520\nof weird questions about my brain and how it works and why people keep forgiving me for\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:37.920\nbeing a bad person. By the way, last night's show, which I don't think is podcast yet,\n\n37:37.920 --> 37:44.560\nlike it got weird again. It'll get weird here too. I cried. I've never done that yet. But\n\n37:44.560 --> 37:48.640\nhe asked me a question. He said, do you think there's anything you could tell people that\n\n37:48.640 --> 37:54.200\nwould make them not like you? Like they seem so forgiving of you. And I'm like, yeah, because\n\n37:54.200 --> 38:00.760\nI play this honesty stick where I'm like, hey, high five for telling you. And I don't\n\n38:00.760 --> 38:06.320\nreally have any hatred in my heart or anything like that. Like last night, he thought was\n\n38:06.320 --> 38:10.320\ngoing to be an exception because we brought Erin McGathy, my beautiful, wonderful, genius\n\n38:10.320 --> 38:17.240\ngirlfriend up who does nothing but unconditionally support me, unless she's had a couple. At\n\n38:17.240 --> 38:20.960\nwhich point, sometimes if I have also had a couple, we get in an old good old fashioned\n\n38:20.960 --> 38:28.160\nIrish Polish white trash verbal, verbal sparring match at which point I become Kevin Spacey\n\n38:28.160 --> 38:35.880\nand seven Hannibal Lecter, you know, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the master. Like I get,\n\n38:35.880 --> 38:40.680\nI do this thing where I don't necessarily say anything worse than you've ever said to\n\n38:40.680 --> 38:47.320\nyour significant other in a fight when you're trying to kind of hurt each other's feelings.\n\n38:47.320 --> 38:55.280\nBut you know, I, I, I shift into this persona that is sociopathically kind of gleeful at\n\n38:55.280 --> 39:01.440\nthe, at the kind of like, this passionate, like, disconnection that I feel, you know\n\n39:01.440 --> 39:08.640\nwhat I mean? Like I regard her as if she is an insect and explain things to her in a way\n\n39:08.640 --> 39:14.920\nshe can understand. Let me lay it on the line for you. You know, I kind of like getting,\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:18.640\nturning into this villain because I've had, it's, it's like, that's when I've passed\n\n39:18.640 --> 39:24.680\nthe threshold of acceptable human behavior with the, with the booze and stuff. She always,\n\n39:24.680 --> 39:30.560\nalways deserves it. No kidding. I'm kidding. I brought, we brought her up and we kind of\n\n39:30.560 --> 39:35.400\ntalked about it a little bit and she mentioned that I called her the C word at which point\n\n39:35.400 --> 39:42.040\nthe audience did that absolute requirement. I back you up a hundred percent. You don't\n\n39:42.040 --> 39:47.920\ntrust me. He said, I trust you. Oh, you trust me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's,\n\n39:47.920 --> 39:52.960\nit's bad. But, but, yeah. So brought it up and the director was interviewing me and\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:56.520\nhe's going, and then they lined up and they wanted your autograph. He was a little disappointed.\n\n39:56.520 --> 40:01.040\nHe was bummed out. He thought he would see the final turning point. So then he, he asked\n\n40:01.040 --> 40:04.800\nthe question that I thought was very interesting. Is there anything I can tell you that I haven't\n\n40:04.800 --> 40:11.120\ntold you yet that about me, that would make you like, like turn on me? I don't, I think\n\n40:11.120 --> 40:15.600\nthe answer is no for the same reason. I, I, it's because what we have going for us is\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:19.640\nlike, like, like, like, like, we, we don't want anyone to be unhappy. Sometimes, I mean,\n\n40:19.640 --> 40:23.480\nI, I, that's a story about me getting too drunk and I have a horrible, like, like, like,\n\n40:23.480 --> 40:28.200\ndysfunctional, like neurotic, like behavior I engage in in a cyclical way that I've begged\n\n40:28.200 --> 40:33.240\ntherapists to, to, to, to, to, to defuse and then they can't do it and I, I get mad and\n\n40:33.240 --> 40:37.680\nI stop going to them. So I try to talk into a microphone and try to, to, to do self maintenance\n\n40:37.680 --> 40:40.640\nand things like that. And it's part of that involves confession. He said, what could you\n\n40:40.640 --> 40:45.080\ntell them that would make them not like you? I don't think I've ever said into a microphone\n\n40:45.080 --> 40:49.920\ninto the recording. I think I've blogged about this fact. I use drugs recreationally. I'm,\n\n40:49.920 --> 40:55.640\nI'm a prescription marijuana user. I don't get high when I work. It doesn't, because\n\n40:55.640 --> 41:01.280\nI can't. If it, if it helped, I'd do it. I've, I've, I've done Adderall illegally, but I'm\n\n41:01.280 --> 41:04.440\nnot ashamed of that because you're welcome for season two of community.\n\n41:04.440 --> 41:12.520\nYou know, you don't, you don't get eight hours of sleep at night and, and, and, and do some\n\n41:12.520 --> 41:16.520\nof that stuff. Like, like, like so, I'm not, that sounded horribly self aggrandizing. That's\n\n41:16.520 --> 41:21.320\nnot what I meant. I meant, I meant it takes a long time to, to piss off the network and\n\n41:21.320 --> 41:24.560\nstudio. Like you have to be, you have to get up earlier than them and go to bed later than\n\n41:24.560 --> 41:30.760\nthem. The, the, I don't think I've ever said precisely because it's uncharismatic that I've\n\n41:30.760 --> 41:36.920\ndone cocaine. I, I, I, I've ever said, I mean, even since my early 20s, when I discovered\n\n41:36.920 --> 41:41.080\nit doing improv in Milwaukee, I have, you know, I've, I've, I've experimented with it\n\n41:41.080 --> 41:45.520\nand here, not here in Los Angeles. Like if I'm on a party and somebody's got some of\n\n41:45.520 --> 41:51.080\nthose, sometimes if I, like now that I'm 40, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's more of\n\n41:51.080 --> 41:54.760\na, like, I want to stay up and keep drinking. So someone's got this stuff and I'm not going\n\n41:54.760 --> 41:58.720\nto say no to it. So now I just wanted to say that because now I'm fucking perfect.\n\n41:58.720 --> 42:04.640\nLike I, I, I, there's nothing that I haven't said. Like I, I, I, I'm, I'm done, you know,\n\n42:04.640 --> 42:09.360\nif you, if you, like, I can't think of any secrets I have left and I, I don't recommend\n\n42:09.360 --> 42:14.040\nthat as behavior for you. You can keep secrets, secrets are healthy, secrets are fine. The\n\n42:14.040 --> 42:18.560\nreason I never say this, because it's a grody drug, it's synthetic and it's like Don Johnsony\n\n42:18.560 --> 42:23.120\nand like, like, like it's not, like it doesn't, it wouldn't make anyone like me anymore, nor\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:28.960\nis it like, it's not like a, an addict would say this, but there's no addiction because\n\n42:28.960 --> 42:32.800\nI've been, you know, it's like, it's been in my life on and off for whenever. Like it's\n\n42:32.800 --> 42:36.600\njust, it's a party thing that happens sometimes in our, in big Hollywood.\n\n42:36.600 --> 42:41.880\nIt probably happens all over the country. Yeah. Well, yeah. Dishwashers do it if they,\n\n42:41.880 --> 42:46.960\nyou know, if they can't get a hold of some Adderall, but the, the season two of those\n\n42:46.960 --> 42:56.240\nplates last night at, at Stambulli's. Stambulli. But so that's it. I don't know. I just, it's,\n\n42:56.240 --> 42:59.320\nthere's no reaction I expect. I just want, now, now I'm like.\n\n42:59.320 --> 43:02.920\nYou always talk about yourself and kind of self-flagellate yourself about being a terrible\n\n43:02.920 --> 43:06.160\nperson that you're a bad person. I don't think it's because of behavior. It would be more\n\n43:06.160 --> 43:11.000\nabout the way that you're, you know, you're, when you get upset with somebody, whether\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:18.000\nyou mean to or not, because you're a good writer and the way your mind works, you have\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:21.840\nthe ability to really hurt somebody with kind of the flick of a wrist.\n\n43:21.840 --> 43:25.560\nThank you.\n\n43:25.560 --> 43:30.640\nAnd you said backstage something about the idea that like, like, like you like the tears\n\n43:30.640 --> 43:32.480\nas a part when you, when you're, when you're in that mode.\n\n43:32.480 --> 43:37.000\nWhen I, when I'm way overboard. Yeah. Like, like, like when I, with my significant others,\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:41.720\nthere have been moments when if, if, if, if, if the significant other is, is, is going\n\n43:41.720 --> 43:47.240\ntoe to toe with me, like, and it's someone's, yeah, like, and it's too much to drink. Like\n\n43:47.240 --> 43:52.960\nit gets white trashy drunk where it's like blackout or almost blackout. Like, yeah, there\n\n43:52.960 --> 43:57.120\nare, there, most of the time, like, not 85% of the time, would you hear my little Milwaukee\n\n43:57.120 --> 44:03.120\naccent? Most of the time, Pittsburgh's bringing it out of me. The, most of the time, 85%\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:08.880\nof the time, like if I, if I, if I, if I get too drunk and I have a fight with someone\n\n44:08.880 --> 44:13.880\nI love and I, and they start to cry, that's the end of it because of the tears signify\n\n44:13.880 --> 44:18.960\nlike, oh shit, I, I, this reality comes in. I was in a different mode. I was a, I was\n\n44:18.960 --> 44:24.000\na, I was a battle, battle bot of some kind. And I was like, trying to win a fight. Like\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.960\nI go, I go, I can like, I don't know what it is, you know, whatever dysfunction I have,\n\n44:27.960 --> 44:31.440\nwhatever disorder like enables me to pull the plug on the emotional connection between\n\n44:31.440 --> 44:35.760\nme and another human being. And then, so then it's like, there's no, there's no conscientiousness\n\n44:35.760 --> 44:41.440\nlike standing between me and saying something, uh, with the direct intent of like, like humbling\n\n44:41.440 --> 44:45.840\nsomeone. And then, and then if they start to cry most of the time, then I'm like, oh shit,\n\n44:45.840 --> 44:49.760\nthat's what I'm doing. Holy crap, stop, stop, stop. But then there's like that 15% of the\n\n44:49.760 --> 44:54.080\ntime, if it's really grody drunk, like, like, and the, and the, uh, and the other person's\n\n44:54.080 --> 44:57.360\ndrunk and there's just fighting, fighting, fighting and back and forth only when you're\n\n44:57.360 --> 45:03.920\ndrunk. Yeah, yeah, I don't, I, I, I, yeah, I don't, it's, yeah, only, yeah, I'm making\n\n45:03.920 --> 45:08.160\nsure that's the case in my head. Yeah, it's, it's a thing. It's a, it's an alcohol thing.\n\n45:08.160 --> 45:12.280\nLike it's a, it lowers your inhibitions, it makes you looser, maybe it makes you charming\n\n45:12.280 --> 45:15.200\nup to a certain point. And then there's, you know, you can go through a curtain where you,\n\n45:15.200 --> 45:20.640\nuh, your behavior becomes bad, checkle and hide. Um, so kids pay attention to that. Don't\n\n45:20.640 --> 45:25.200\nlook up to a drunk writers. Um, it's not, it's not, it's not what makes you good. Um,\n\n45:25.200 --> 45:30.880\nthe, uh, uh, uh, your parents have to beat you. So if that didn't happen, you're going\n\n45:30.880 --> 45:36.240\nto write shitty stuff. You're probably like a, just a bad dream journal. And I guess you\n\n45:36.240 --> 45:42.200\ngot too much love. I'm sorry. Um, the, uh, uh, yeah, then I was, I was saying to the\n\n45:42.200 --> 45:46.560\ndirector was, uh, yeah, there's a, like the tears I actually go, okay, good. I think in\n\n45:46.560 --> 45:56.360\nmy head, like good cry, delicious tears, put them on a cupcake, cry until you can't any\n\n45:56.360 --> 46:03.920\nmore than you actually experience like physical like, like an erection. No, no, no, no, like,\n\n46:03.920 --> 46:08.480\nlike, you, you, you actually enjoy it or like, did you actually feel, no, no, no, it's all\n\n46:08.480 --> 46:12.800\nabout defensiveness. It's about, it's about being threatened because I, if I'm a child\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:19.200\nand I feel like my mommy is trying to get away with something coming at me. Like I, I\n\n46:19.200 --> 46:26.840\nneed to win. I need to defeat. I need to defend myself. Not noticing that I'm a 40 year old\n\n46:26.840 --> 46:29.480\nman with his full faculties.\n\n46:29.480 --> 46:33.160\nYeah. I think, I think the superpower, like we've all, like everyone in this room, there's\n\n46:33.160 --> 46:37.200\ncertain things about us that make us who we are and make us cool. And there's, there's\n\n46:37.200 --> 46:41.120\nthings that draw people to you. And also there's things, the same thing, the, the, the flip\n\n46:41.120 --> 46:45.840\nside of that coin is, is the same thing that repels people from you. Like people when they\n\n46:45.840 --> 46:50.560\nmeet Dan, or first of all, like Rob Schrab, our friend, he's a, he's an artist. He's\n\n46:50.560 --> 46:54.240\na great, he's an awesome, like, you know, he's a visual thinker. When people meet Rob, it's\n\n46:54.240 --> 46:57.720\nvery like, there's people that come up to him and like, Rob's opinion of them is so\n\n46:57.720 --> 47:01.400\nimportant and he can really make or break their night. And what they want from Rob\n\n47:01.400 --> 47:06.400\nis to find out, am I creative? And if Rob doesn't, like doesn't think you're creative,\n\n47:06.400 --> 47:09.400\nit hurts them, you know? Who the fuck is this guy?\n\n47:09.400 --> 47:17.440\nOkay. Welcome back. For Dan, you know that you don't have the right to do what you just\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:24.080\ndid. This is my third glass of kettle. I want to talk to this fucker. Do you understand?\n\n47:24.080 --> 47:31.360\nLet me put things in perspective for you. The thing about you is that people, oh no,\n\n47:31.360 --> 47:36.040\nthat's, no, obviously I was kidding. Yeah. But the thing about you is he said, he said\n\n47:36.040 --> 47:41.360\nhe would have peed his pants. People come up to you and, and, and the, the, the, the\n\n47:41.360 --> 47:43.960\npeople that come up to you need something from you. It's important for certain people\n\n47:43.960 --> 47:48.960\nto think that, that you think that they are smart. I think smart is the key word. I, I,\n\n47:48.960 --> 47:53.800\nI, yeah. So when you diminish somebody's intellectual ability, like, or like intelligence,\n\n47:53.800 --> 47:56.720\nwhich I, which by the way, I don't, when I, when I get into a fight with Erin, I never\n\n47:56.720 --> 47:59.880\ncall her stupid. I know she can correct me if she, if she wants to, but you said you\n\n47:59.880 --> 48:04.280\ntalked to her like, like, let me explain this to you, like a, like a baby, applying\n\n48:04.280 --> 48:07.840\nthat she doesn't, yeah, like, like a chimpanzee, applying that she doesn't have perspective\n\n48:07.840 --> 48:14.160\non how, how like devastating I can be as a robot. Like, like, like I, don't you understand\n\n48:14.160 --> 48:19.000\nthe faculties of this operational death star? You know, like you don't, you don't know how\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:22.920\npowerful I am. It's more like that. So you're just, you're just Emperor Palpatine.\n\n48:22.920 --> 48:27.040\nIt's not, it's not, it's not your stupid because I pet myself on the back for that.\n\n48:27.040 --> 48:29.600\nLike, I don't, I don't, I don't, yeah, I don't know. Well, whatever, let's get off\n\n48:29.600 --> 48:35.600\nof that. It's getting, it's getting narcissistic. That lady's leaving. Just going pee, right?\n\n48:35.600 --> 48:40.600\nOkay. Let's fall over. I think, I think it's, I think it's number two.\n\n48:40.600 --> 48:49.600\nShe's got to take a big old shit in the bathroom. Lady in the head and the jeans. She's got\n\n48:49.600 --> 48:55.520\nto take a diamond of a turd. Since, since we've taken the show to that, to that place,\n\n48:55.520 --> 48:59.960\nI just wanted to say how satisfying it was to fart in Pittsburgh today. That the, the,\n\n48:59.960 --> 49:03.600\nthe coldness, like that brisk coldness, like, okay, now that guy's leaving. Okay.\n\n49:03.600 --> 49:08.240\nLook, I mean, there's, there's intellectuals in the audience. I can sense it. I'm sorry,\n\n49:08.240 --> 49:13.760\nbut I, I, I, I did coke now and then and an Adderall and I, today I farted in Pittsburgh\n\n49:13.760 --> 49:18.080\nout on the sidewalk and I just, I had this extreme pleasure imagining like this, this,\n\n49:18.080 --> 49:23.960\nthis, this 98.6 degree thing. Like, like, like getting out of, of, of the outer rim of my,\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:26.920\nof, of, of its, of its comfort zone and, and, and, you know,\n\n49:26.920 --> 49:30.080\neven your dynamic is the word you're looking for. What's that?\n\n49:30.080 --> 49:32.640\nAnus is the word you're looking for. No, I'm not, I'm not looking for it.\n\n49:32.640 --> 49:40.920\nLast night you were this. Okay. There's one more secret I have left. I was looking for\n\n49:40.920 --> 49:46.360\nanus last night. Season three of community was written largely on anus. The, I just\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:49.880\nimagined this little puff of like, you know, like, like this thing coming out and going,\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:55.400\nwow. Like I just, just like leaving, just like dispersing like, like at the speed of\n\n49:55.400 --> 49:59.400\nlight. Like I'm sure that's not how it works, but from my understanding of thermodynamics,\n\n49:59.400 --> 50:03.200\nlike hot things want to go to cold things. And like, so I was like, I just like, I was\n\n50:03.200 --> 50:05.280\ntalking to a bunch of people and there are people walking everywhere and I was like,\n\n50:05.280 --> 50:08.800\nI bet you could fart here and just like, no one, no one even smell it because it's just\n\n50:08.800 --> 50:13.240\nlike the fart, it's probably just goes, just like, it's halfway across town and, and on\n\n50:13.240 --> 50:16.720\nboth sides. It's like, you know, it's just like becoming merges with the cosmos.\n\n50:16.720 --> 50:21.000\nAll right. Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest, so to speak. Dan, I would say\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:24.640\nright now, whatever you're about to say, just because it's better to have them up earlier\n\n50:24.640 --> 50:27.520\nthan later, because it always is. Can we bring Spencer up?\n\n50:27.520 --> 50:29.640\nSpencer? Okay.\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:40.360\nJudgent master extraordinaire. Story teller and extremist. You, you haven't heard the,\n\n50:40.360 --> 50:44.000\nyou haven't heard the show from last night. One of the most amazing things about it.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:49.160\nYeah. Out in front of the, of the Pirates baseball stadium, whatever that's called.\n\n50:49.160 --> 50:52.680\nOh, the PNC Park. We already discussed this. There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a\n\n50:52.680 --> 50:56.240\ngiant statue of Honest Wagner, like, like, like, like, you're after having, you know,\n\n50:56.240 --> 51:04.240\nlike, hit a tater. And it's Honest, look it up. Great, great groups, my friend insists\n\n51:04.240 --> 51:08.640\nthat it's Honest and not Honest. And I defer to Greg on this. I've always called him Honest\n\n51:08.640 --> 51:14.280\nWagner, but he says Honest and he's, he's like, he will not be moved. Greg's pretty particular.\n\n51:14.280 --> 51:20.720\nHe is. Very airy day. I am a pseudo intellectual. Greg is an intellectual. H. Wagner. He's\n\n51:20.720 --> 51:26.240\na, he's a, he's a famed ball player. Last night, Spencer, if he could be compared to\n\n51:26.240 --> 51:34.200\nbaseball terms, hit 900 last night on, on, we kept throwing things out of, just, we would\n\n51:34.200 --> 51:38.320\nmake up new monsters and he would just describe new monsters. Yeah. We landed on this game\n\n51:38.320 --> 51:43.560\nwhere we'd just make up like monster names and throw them at Spencer and he describes\n\n51:43.560 --> 51:49.320\nthem as he would in a game. And it's not fair to do that again tonight because last night\n\n51:49.320 --> 51:52.960\nhe was so, like he hit like five home runs and one triple off the wall, basically.\n\n51:52.960 --> 51:57.040\nYeah. It was pretty. He got on base a lot and then, and then it was, it was good stuff.\n\n51:57.040 --> 52:01.240\nI wouldn't want to do it to you again, Spencer, because I hate to, you know. Also, I can't\n\n52:01.240 --> 52:05.000\nthink, I can't remember which ones we threw at him. So like we were doing like Spencer,\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:06.000\nalcoholism.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.440\nDo you want me? Yeah.\n\n52:08.440 --> 52:14.360\nWell, I got, did we do that one? No, I don't think so. Spencer, alcoholism is attacking\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:19.680\nme. Opening the door to the bathroom. You felt, you smell the reek of risky. You hear\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:25.080\nthe splash of liquid into the bathroom and then you feel a figure rising. Opening the\n\n52:25.080 --> 52:36.760\ndoor to the stall. You see a hobo drenched in vomit and liquor. That's a double. That's\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:40.520\na double. Yeah. No, that's definitely bad. That's a double. Yeah. He's, he's, he's\n\n52:40.520 --> 52:44.440\nfreaking freestyle dungeon master. I mean, just judging mastering is freestyling. Yeah.\n\n52:44.440 --> 52:51.920\nWhat's that? What'd you say? Oh, no, I saw, I thought I saw your mouth moving. Oh, wait,\n\n52:51.920 --> 52:58.080\nwhat have you got? That's Mike and Jen. Yeah. Jen and Mike. Yeah. Jen and Mike, come to\n\n52:58.080 --> 53:03.800\nthe stage. We were warned about you in advance. Okay. Now I just, I think I realized why Aaron\n\n53:03.800 --> 53:07.280\ncame backstage and said, you should probably bring Jen and Mike up tonight. All right.\n\n53:07.280 --> 53:09.880\nSo I think we're getting an indication. Hello, Mike. Mike has a yellow shirt on. It says\n\n53:09.880 --> 53:18.200\nHarmontown, Harmon, Harmonon. Oh, are you a yinzer? Is that what that is? Yeah. Yeah.\n\n53:18.200 --> 53:23.400\nAre you, are you from here? Um, from West Mullen County originally. So how, how would\n\n53:23.400 --> 53:29.640\nyou say that in your phonetics? About Harmontown, Harmontown. Anybody else? Come on.\n\n53:29.640 --> 53:34.800\nNobody? All right. And Jen, let's see, let's get a look at you. Yours says, oh, Harmon\n\n53:34.800 --> 53:39.520\nTown the same, but yeah, they have the black and yellow Pittsburgh colors and you have\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:44.640\na little like foam number one thingies. Yeah, this is Dan's Ray of Frost. You're not giving\n\n53:44.640 --> 53:56.400\nthis to me. Are you? No, really? Oh, no. This is my flaming sword. They made authentic\n\n53:56.400 --> 54:02.080\nfoam, an authentic foam number one kind of sports fan hand, like the number one thing\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:08.200\nand it's blue, like icy blue and has a screaming frosty skull and, and, and sparkles coming\n\n54:08.200 --> 54:13.200\nout of the index finger. And on the back of it, it says Ray of Frost. And I have a flaming\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:17.720\nsword that is just, I mean, it's really just a sword that's on fire. It's fucking amazing.\n\n54:17.720 --> 54:21.160\nI said, well, that's all me. I feel like a foam and stuff. Guy Thierry shirts just came\n\n54:21.160 --> 54:29.080\nin here and this is, this is amazing. That is good. Did you hear the Brooklyn show by\n\n54:29.080 --> 54:33.040\nany chance? Oh, with Sudeikis? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We found out at Brooklyn\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:36.720\nthat, I don't know if you were halfway done making this or not, that, that Ray of Frost\n\n54:36.720 --> 54:41.200\nis a level zero spell that does a maximum of three damage after, and we found that out\n\n54:41.200 --> 54:45.480\nafter singing the Ray of Frost theme song and really celebrating that I was casting\n\n54:45.480 --> 54:50.080\nit like I was a professional wrestler. We then found out Ray of Frost does from zero\n\n54:50.080 --> 54:51.080\nto three damage.\n\n54:51.080 --> 54:55.440\nAm I right or wrong in saying that the little, the little frosty stars on the Ray of Frost\n\n54:55.440 --> 54:57.120\nare those the Pittsburgh logo?\n\n54:57.120 --> 54:59.120\nOh, yeah, conveniently enough.\n\n54:59.120 --> 55:00.120\nLittle Pittsburgh.\n\n55:00.120 --> 55:05.000\nWhat do they call them? Like hyper-cycloids? Or what are they? Hypo-cycloids. Yeah. Well,\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:10.000\nthat's a shape. A little diamondy, little sparkle nuggets on the, on the, on the, on\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.240\nthe. Are you guys an item, Mike and Jen?\n\n55:12.240 --> 55:13.240\nYes, we are.\n\n55:13.240 --> 55:22.240\nKiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss. Dan, get a boner. Dan, get a boner. Dan, get\n\n55:22.240 --> 55:23.240\na boner.\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:27.760\nMarried or just dating?\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:29.640\nNo, just, yeah, living together.\n\n55:29.640 --> 55:30.640\nHow long?\n\n55:30.640 --> 55:31.640\nLiving in sin?\n\n55:31.640 --> 55:32.640\nHow long?\n\n55:32.640 --> 55:33.640\nFor how long?\n\n55:33.640 --> 55:35.640\nAround a year and a half.\n\n55:35.640 --> 55:38.640\nAnd how long were you going up before you moved in?\n\n55:38.640 --> 55:41.560\nOkay. Are you guys, are you guys in love?\n\n55:41.560 --> 55:42.560\nYeah.\n\n55:42.560 --> 55:45.560\nYou are.\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:49.360\nThey have a thing to unite them. They have like this great. So, Mike, I know the answer\n\n55:49.360 --> 55:54.200\nto this is no. Do you ever get really drunk and become incredibly weirdly sociopathically\n\n55:54.200 --> 55:56.200\nabusive to Jen?\n\n55:56.200 --> 56:03.720\nYeah, unfortunately, she did lean over and say that's you whenever you were describing\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:04.720\nyourself.\n\n56:04.720 --> 56:11.920\nAll right. See, once again, I'm bulletproof. Ladies, I know that there's something wrong\n\n56:11.920 --> 56:17.160\nwith me that I want to change. It's not good behavior. It's not part of my creative process.\n\n56:17.160 --> 56:18.160\nIt's not good.\n\n56:18.160 --> 56:23.080\nJen, would you have any advice to give Dan? I mean, not that you would presume to give\n\n56:23.080 --> 56:26.200\nanybody advice, but if you, like any, because you guys are clearly very happy together. You've\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:29.000\nbeen together longer than Dan and Aaron have been together, basically.\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:33.120\nI have no advice. I have my own psychoses and neuroses, like.\n\n56:33.120 --> 56:34.600\nWhat's your hang up? What's your bag?\n\n56:34.600 --> 56:36.600\nI don't even know.\n\n56:36.600 --> 56:38.600\nMike, what's wrong with Jen?\n\n56:38.600 --> 56:41.600\nYeah, I asked the source, man.\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:48.600\nJen, stop listening for a second. Mike, we won't tell her.\n\n56:48.600 --> 56:57.240\nNo, I think the problem is Jen and I are pretty much the same age, but she has developed\n\n56:57.240 --> 57:02.520\na wealth of knowledge beyond my own. And so there's insecurities of not being able to\n\n57:02.520 --> 57:07.520\ncompete with that and feel like I'm getting my side of the argument across.\n\n57:07.520 --> 57:10.520\nI'm not sure if I'm just being stupid or not.\n\n57:10.520 --> 57:15.560\nDoes that manifest itself in you going, just because you're smart doesn't mean it can become\n\n57:15.560 --> 57:16.560\nStanley Kowalski?\n\n57:16.560 --> 57:17.560\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n57:17.560 --> 57:23.160\nI mean, that happens to me with Aaron, too. I get intimidated by how smart she is, and\n\n57:23.160 --> 57:28.760\nthen I try to deflect and trick her into thinking that that's not what we're talking about.\n\n57:28.760 --> 57:29.760\nThat's not even the point.\n\n57:29.760 --> 57:36.760\nYeah, it is. I'm stupid. But, all right, well, that makes me feel a little better, because\n\n57:36.760 --> 57:45.200\nif you can't, for those in podcast land, Mike is an adorable, lithe, bespectacled, knit cap,\n\n57:45.200 --> 57:47.200\nadorned, bearded...\n\n57:47.200 --> 57:50.200\nHe's kind of like what Zach Galifianakis thinks he is.\n\n57:50.200 --> 57:54.200\nHe's the sexy Zach Galifianakis.\n\n57:54.200 --> 58:01.840\nHe's like Zach Galifianakis' avatar in heaven when we wake up in heaven and you can just\n\n58:01.840 --> 58:02.840\nlook how you...\n\n58:02.840 --> 58:06.800\nAll right, well, thank you, Jen and Mike. Unless there's anything, while you have the\n\n58:06.800 --> 58:08.800\nconch, do you want to...?\n\n58:08.800 --> 58:10.800\nI think I'm good.\n\n58:10.800 --> 58:11.800\nOh, no.\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:13.200\nOh, yeah, I mean, look, let me let it go.\n\n58:13.200 --> 58:16.920\nNo, I would like to be able to make Pittsburgh proud, but that's not going to happen tonight.\n\n58:16.920 --> 58:19.360\nWhere should we go drinking if we go drinking in Pittsburgh?\n\n58:19.360 --> 58:21.360\nI was saying Gooskies. Anyone else?\n\n58:21.360 --> 58:22.360\nGooskies?\n\n58:22.360 --> 58:23.360\nGooskies.\n\n58:23.360 --> 58:24.360\nWhere's that at?\n\n58:24.360 --> 58:25.360\nOh, it's out on Polish Hill.\n\n58:25.360 --> 58:26.360\nPolish Hill?\n\n58:26.360 --> 58:27.360\nDamn, you're Polish.\n\n58:27.360 --> 58:28.360\nYeah, I sure am.\n\n58:28.360 --> 58:29.360\nIs that near Stamulli's?\n\n58:29.360 --> 58:35.120\nYou know, I mean, look, you don't have to. I can play you off with this beat, but if\n\n58:35.120 --> 58:39.360\nyou guys want to rap with Dan as a, you know, as you give it a whirl, we can edit it out\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:41.360\nof the podcast if you want.\n\n58:41.360 --> 59:07.360\nNo, you go too fast for me. Like I said, I'm not smart enough to argue with her. I can't\n\n59:07.360 --> 59:08.360\nrap at all.\n\n59:08.360 --> 59:11.360\nWait, wait, wait. Okay. Right here. Here we go.\n\n59:11.360 --> 59:18.360\nOnce upon a time, I needed to eat a loaf of bread. I didn't get it soon enough, so I\n\n59:18.360 --> 59:26.360\nstarved now I'm dead. I put on a pair of shoes and walked down the street. I didn't get my\n\n59:26.360 --> 59:32.360\nbread, but saw your mama and got my meat slower. So it's like slower tempo. You can do it\n\n59:32.360 --> 59:33.360\nlike that.\n\n59:33.360 --> 59:44.360\nTake a mic. I don't think I can as hard as I try to think. And that's it. I've hit a\n\n59:44.360 --> 59:45.360\nwall.\n\n59:45.360 --> 59:46.360\nAll right.\n\n59:46.360 --> 59:47.360\nAll right.\n\n59:47.360 --> 59:48.360\nI'm with Jen.\n\n59:48.360 --> 59:49.360\nJen, you're smart.\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:50.360\nJen, you're smart.\n\n59:50.360 --> 59:51.360\nShame him, Jen.\n\n59:51.360 --> 59:52.360\nShame him like the Pee-Bee and he is.\n\n59:52.360 --> 59:53.360\nAll right.\n\n59:53.360 --> 59:54.360\nWell, that's right.\n\n59:54.360 --> 59:55.360\nShe's dancing.\n\n59:55.360 --> 59:56.360\nShe's dancing.\n\n59:56.360 --> 59:57.360\nAll right.\n\n59:57.360 --> 59:58.360\nShe's dancing.\n\n59:58.360 --> 01:00:05.360\nJen's got the moves. Jen's got the moves. Jen's got the moves.\n\n01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.360\nLet's hear it for Jen and Mike, everybody.\n\n01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.360\nAre you sure you're giving these up, right?\n\n01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360\nThese are ours?\n\n01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360\nThank you.\n\n01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.360\nThat's really incredible.\n\n01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.360\nThese are wonderful.\n\n01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360\nLook at that fucking thing.\n\n01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360\nWe should have them sign them after the show.\n\n01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.360\nSpeaking of Rob Schrab, this isn't very Schrabby and stuff here. He'd be very proud of that.\n\n01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.360\nYou can still see the hot glue strings on it, which makes it nice that I love that.\n\n01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:40.360\nYeah, they did a great job of simulating a kind of like sword with embers on it and flames\n\n01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360\ntrailing.\n\n01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:50.360\nSpencer, mediocre zookeeper attacks.\n\n01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.360\nHold on. I got the music.\n\n01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.360\nOh.\n\n01:00:53.360 --> 01:01:01.360\nThe cage opens up with a creek. You see two legs holding a pile of what seems to be backs\n\n01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360\nof feed.\n\n01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.360\nSeveral spill to the floor with a clumsy clatter.\n\n01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:15.360\nDropping to his knees, a short, portly man crouches before you, apologizing profusely.\n\n01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:24.360\nMediocre zookeeper.\n\n01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.360\nHe's got a zoo to keep.\n\n01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:34.360\nBut he's not great at it. He doesn't work in San Diego. He's in LA County.\n\n01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.360\nI just keep the pelicans alive. That's all I do. I lost three last week.\n\n01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.360\nI like that the feces fell to the ground with a clatter.\n\n01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360\nSometimes they clatter.\n\n01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.360\nWhat sort of animal has pooped that clatter, Spencer?\n\n01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360\nBags of feed, dude.\n\n01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.360\nBags of feed, he said.\n\n01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360\nOh, shit. I'm sorry.\n\n01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.360\nBut to answer your question, penguins, clearly.\n\n01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.360\nAll right.\n\n01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:05.360\nDan, Spencer came to me earlier today and kind of out of fashion for Spencer, he approached\n\n01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.360\nme with a bit for tonight's show.\n\n01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.360\nReally?\n\n01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360\nHas he talked to you about this?\n\n01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360\nNo.\n\n01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.360\nDan and I have been making up stupid songs on the bus.\n\n01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360\nThere's Pringles Dick, there's Chicken Noodle Dick.\n\n01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.360\nHas anybody heard the Chicken Noodle Dick song?\n\n01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.360\nI got drunk last night in Arlington and I sang it twice.\n\n01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.360\nI forgot the audience had already heard it.\n\n01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.360\nYeah, we did like an anchor and Jeff taught them the Chicken Noodle song and the anchor\n\n01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.360\nthat we had already sang.\n\n01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360\nDid anybody heard the Chicken Noodle Dick song?\n\n01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360\nHere's how it goes.\n\n01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360\nThere was silence.\n\n01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360\nI took that silence for no, we haven't heard it.\n\n01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.360\nThe silence was, you're drunk.\n\n01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.360\nYou sang this 45 minutes ago.\n\n01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.360\nSo Chicken Noodle Dick is Dan on a bus.\n\n01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360\nI'll explain it to you people.\n\n01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.360\nDan on a bus holding a Chicken Noodle, a can of progressive light Chicken Noodle soup\n\n01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.360\nin his lap as though it were his dick and we cobbled together this song.\n\n01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360\nHere I am.\n\n01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.360\nYou got a dick, you got a Chicken Noodle can.\n\n01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.360\nAll my life, I've been put in this can since I'm a Chicken Noodle wife.\n\n01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.360\nChicken Noodle got a comb down from the mountain saying Chicken Noodle Man, you got to work\n\n01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.360\nall day.\n\n01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.360\nChicken Noodle Man, you got to cross the river Jordan, feed the devil's soup and take his\n\n01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.360\ntroubles away.\n\n01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.360\nAll right, so that's the song.\n\n01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:20.360\nNow soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon, spoon to the mouth you're going to get well soon.\n\n01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.360\nI'm trying to build.\n\n01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.360\nYeah, see I got a building off of that.\n\n01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.360\nSo Spencer's worked on some lyrics to add to it.\n\n01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.360\nSo it'd be like a verse and then it'd go back to the chorus which is, you know, the Chicken\n\n01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.360\nNoodle Man and then it's another verse and then back to the chorus.\n\n01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.360\nJesus.\n\n01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.360\nA flash of inspiration in the shower or maybe a curse.\n\n01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.360\nI mean, we'll see how it goes.\n\n01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:46.360\nCan you explain to me how flashes of lyrics come to you in the shower?\n\n01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.360\nCascading over you in a warm flurry.\n\n01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.360\nThe water rains down.\n\n01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360\nThen it hits you.\n\n01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.360\nA good idea, maybe.\n\n01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.360\nThat's all.\n\n01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.360\nHe's fucking the best.\n\n01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.360\nHe's the best.\n\n01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:08.360\nSpencer, I fucking love you so much.\n\n01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.360\nBut so yeah, if I could do the verse and then we could come back together for the chorus\n\n01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360\nmaybe and then try it.\n\n01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360\nI mean, we'll see how it goes.\n\n01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360\nOkay.\n\n01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.360\nOkay, so it starts with the soup to the bowl, right?\n\n01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360\nDo you want me to sing that?\n\n01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.360\nYeah, let's do that.\n\n01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360\nAll right.\n\n01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.360\nSoup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon, spoon to the mouth you're going to get well soon.\n\n01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.360\nYou better get a little bed rest, sleep until noon.\n\n01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.360\nGrab a cup of coffee, then hit the saloon singing Chicken Noodle Man coming down from the mountain.\n\n01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360\nChicken Noodle Man gotta work all day.\n\n01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.360\nChicken Noodle Man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.\n\n01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.360\nBe a devil, stupid, take your travels, go away.\n\n01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.360\nBlue South and come what may.\n\n01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.360\nMy Chicken Noodle wife left me just the other day.\n\n01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.360\nI don't know what I can do but pray.\n\n01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.360\nSinging Chicken Noodle Man, you gotta work all day.\n\n01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360\nChicken Noodle Man, come down from the mountain.\n\n01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.360\nChicken Noodle Man, you gotta work all day.\n\n01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.360\nChicken Noodle Man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.\n\n01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.360\nBe a devil, stupid, take your travels, go away.\n\n01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360\nYeah, that's right.\n\n01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.360\nWrite those down.\n\n01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.360\nSpencer, when we get on the bus tonight, when we get on the bus, I want lyrics,\n\n01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.360\npull it up on your iPad, we're going to learn those.\n\n01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360\nYeah, let's workshop it.\n\n01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.360\nFor you podcast listeners, in the closest we'll ever come to the Tom Jones effect,\n\n01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:29.360\na man just threw his hipster beanie hat on the stage at Spencer's feet.\n\n01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.360\nYou have this, take it.\n\n01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.360\nNice.\n\n01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.360\nAnd inside that beanie, there's panties.\n\n01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.360\nIf it was the 80s, that would be a pocket protector or something, right?\n\n01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.360\nSpencer, you're going above and beyond the call of Dungeon Master Duties.\n\n01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.360\nAnd of Road Companion too.\n\n01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:00.360\nYou could have been cranky and become a drag by now, but he's become an inspiration and a good friend.\n\n01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.360\nI just want to help.\n\n01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.360\nSpencer, we went to Permanent Brothers today, we walked around a bit.\n\n01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.360\nWhat do you feel about Pittsburgh so far? Have you been here before?\n\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.360\nI've never been here before. I love your guys' architecture.\n\n01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.360\nI love your weather. It's, I love it. It's brisk.\n\n01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.360\nIt's good walking around weather.\n\n01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360\nI don't sweat.\n\n01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.360\nI think you noticed I disagreed.\n\n01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360\nYeah, definitely disagreed with you.\n\n01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.360\nWhere did you grow up?\n\n01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.360\nI grew up in Alaska.\n\n01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360\nOh.\n\n01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.360\nNo, I grew up in Northern California.\n\n01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.360\nSo it's just fun for you, huh?\n\n01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.360\nSo weird. It really is the mythology that I'm from Milwaukee, so I'm going to be walking around with my shirt off out there.\n\n01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.360\nThere's a reason I moved to California.\n\n01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.360\nI am a pussy.\n\n01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.360\nDo not, I don't, but it's a great city and stuff.\n\n01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.360\nI just, I'm just saying, like, that weather, man, I don't know how you guys do it.\n\n01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.360\nI applaud you.\n\n01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.360\nIt's not even that cold yet.\n\n01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.360\nNo, no, it'll get, yeah, February, it'll get colder, right?\n\n01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.360\nIt'll get 80 below, probably.\n\n01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360\nWell, 80 below with Wind Show is the Milwaukee thing.\n\n01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.360\nIt gets to be 80 below with Wind Show.\n\n01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.360\nAnd the weathermen tell you as part of their weather report how many seconds in which human skin freezes.\n\n01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.360\nIt's a regular part.\n\n01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.360\nIt's like they're telling you the dew point.\n\n01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:26.360\nDon't forget, human skin freezes 28 seconds of this weather, so bundle up.\n\n01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360\nBuckle up your skin?\n\n01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360\nBundle

Dean.\n\n01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360\nI grew up in Tratton, Pennsylvania.\n\n01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:55.360\nIt's right up 28.\n\n01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:03.360\nAnd I, like I can't even tell I have an accent.\n\n01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.360\nEssentially on a normal day on Sunday, I watch the stillers.\n\n01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.360\nI go down to Permanis.\n\n01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360\nI don't go to Pramantes.\n\n01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360\nI don't like it.\n\n01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360\nNo.\n\n01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.360\nPermanis.\n\n01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360\nYeah.\n\n01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360\nHow about this?\n\n01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360\nI'm a vegetarian.\n\n01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360\nI was out of fucking place in there, man.\n\n01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.360\nStill liked it though.\n\n01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.360\nI had a tie on and I ate the double egg and cheese and it was fucking delicious.\n\n01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360\nThat's right.\n\n01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:30.360\nWell, usually in Pittsburgh, you get the, what the fuck is it called?\n\n01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.360\nThe steak and cheese.\n\n01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.360\nBut a steak and cheese isn't like a Philadelphia steak and cheese.\n\n01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.360\nIt's got, well, it doesn't go cap corn.\n\n01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360\nIt's steak and cheese.\n\n01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.360\nIt's got sauerkraut.\n\n01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.360\nIt's got fries.\n\n01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.360\nIt's got Italian bread.\n\n01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.360\nIt's good.\n\n01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.360\nYeah, it's amazing.\n\n01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360\nI had that today.\n\n01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.360\nNow, do you and your day-to-day life say an act?\n\n01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360\nYeah, every day.\n\n01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.360\nThat means et cetera and so forth and whatnot, right?\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360\nRight.\n\n01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.360\nSo if I'm talking to my buddies and I want to go down to Gooskies and I want to do something\n\n01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.360\nbefore Gooskies, well, you say, you want to go do Gooskies and that or you want to do,\n\n01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.360\nwhat are you going to do?\n\n01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.360\nYou want to go eat and that and then go to Gooskies?\n\n01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.360\nOr G yet and go to Gooskies?\n\n01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.360\nYeah.\n\n01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360\nI love that.\n\n01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360\nOkay.\n\n01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.360\nSo I like to think and I'm almost certain that this is the case.\n\n01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360\nYour name again was what?\n\n01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360\nMy name is Dean.\n\n01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.360\nDean, Dan gives, what's your name over there?\n\n01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360\nI'm sorry?\n\n01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360\nIan.\n\n01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360\nIan.\n\n01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.360\nIan.\n\n01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360\nIan and Ian are the first Yenzer rap battle.\n\n01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360\nOh.\n\n01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:43.360\nAnd I want to see who can be the most Yenzerie during the rap.\n\n01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.360\nI went downtown yesterday.\n\n01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:55.360\nI got a pop, Randy's in.\n\n01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360\nShit.\n\n01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.360\nPerfect.\n\n01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.360\nIan, you're a battle.\n\n01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.360\nFor many broaders, it's here for Yenzers.\n\n01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.360\nOh no.\n\n01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.360\nGo, go over there.\n\n01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.360\nYen's guys watching in Pittsburgh stillers.\n\n01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.360\nAll in all, I'm from Pittsburgh.\n\n01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.360\nI ain't got no rhythm.\n\n01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360\nI can't watch nothing.\n\n01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.360\nDan joined in and tried to be a Yenzerie rapper.\n\n01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360\nYou tried to mimic the accent.\n\n01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360\nYo.\n\n01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360\nYo.\n\n01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360\nYo.\n\n01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.360\nWhen you watch the stillers at the bowl, I talked to your mama and said, what the\n\n01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.360\nfuck?\n\n01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360\nYo.\n\n01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360\nFrom Pittsburgh.\n\n01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360\nYou're all equally terrible.\n\n01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.360\nIt's here for the Yenzer rap, everybody.\n\n01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360\nHave a good night, Matt.\n\n01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360\nFantastic.\n\n01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.360\nThank you, sir.\n\n01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.360\nFor me, it's too similar to the Milwaukee thing.\n\n01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.360\nIt's very, we're cousins, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.\n\n01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360\nNo, that one's pretty specific.\n\n01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.360\nMilwaukee's all about the long vowel sounds talking through your nose and ending everything\n\n01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.360\nwith ya and hey and ena.\n\n01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360\nEna.\n\n01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360\nEna.\n\n01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360\nHey.\n\n01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.360\nSome time.\n\n01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.360\nI mean, that's extreme shit.\n\n01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360\nThat's like, cut a haste out in Milwaukee.\n\n01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.360\nAll these accents have fascinating little trees, little branches of an accent tree.\n\n01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.360\nShould we start Dungeons & Dragons?\n\n01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.360\nWell, one more thing.\n\n01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360\nI wanted to...\n\n01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360\nOh, well, come on.\n\n01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360\nTake it easy, Jen.\n\n01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:30.360\nYou know, I've been drinking and I will make Mike look like Mr. Rogers.\n\n01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.360\nWhat's that?\n\n01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360\nOh, is he from Pittsburgh?\n\n01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.360\nIs Mr. Rogers from Pittsburgh?\n\n01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.360\nOh, that's why he was on the wall at...\n\n01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360\nFuck it.\n\n01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360\nEverybody's on that wall.\n\n01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.360\nGene Kelly's up there?\n\n01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.360\nIs he from Pittsburgh?\n\n01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.360\nOh, I was wondering whether random celebrities interspersed with Terry Bradshaw and stuff.\n\n01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.360\nThe sports guys I get, but...\n\n01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360\nIt's everybody.\n\n01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360\nEverybody's...\n\n01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360\nWow, Pittsburgh.\n\n01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360\nSay what?\n\n01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360\nWe're an actual city.\n\n01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360\nNobody said you weren't.\n\n01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360\nHe said we're an actual city.\n\n01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360\nThat was a little defensive, sir.\n\n01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.360\nI think the last thing anyone would say is that Pittsburgh's not a city.\n\n01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.360\nYou literally build fucking buildings out of the stuff that you do here.\n\n01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360\nIt's like...\n\n01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360\nOf course Pittsburgh's a city.\n\n01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.360\nIt's steel.\n\n01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.360\nIt's fortress.\n\n01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:22.360\nIt's full of whipping winds and coleslaw.\n\n01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:28.360\nI like that the coleslaw's not that sweet KFC shit, but it's like that vinegary kind of tart stuff.\n\n01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.360\nThat's how it should be, right?\n\n01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.360\nI just wanted to say when we were walking through those whipping winds, this conversation happened\n\n01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360\nbetween Aaron and Spencer.\n\n01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.360\nAaron said, well, my face is getting used to the cold.\n\n01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:47.360\nAnd Spencer went, you mean numb?\n\n01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.360\nHe slices through artifice.\n\n01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.360\nHe seems to be either villains or monsters.\n\n01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.360\nThere's magic or there's curses.\n\n01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360\nIs there one more thing?\n\n01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.360\nJeff, do your eyes keep going to the guy in the white shirt right back there?\n\n01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.360\nHe's very...\n\n01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.360\nDon't move.\n\n01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.360\nYou're very well lit.\n\n01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.360\nVery well lit and very distinct.\n\n01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.360\nNo chops, give everybody.\n\n01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360\nNo chops, give everybody tonight.\n\n01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.360\nAre you a theater person?\n\n01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.360\nBecause you really found your lighting.\n\n01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360\nHe is a theater person.\n\n01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360\nHe instinctively found his light.\n\n01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360\nThat's a Saturday Night Live.\n\n01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.360\nYou would be Elvis Costello and they would cut to you.\n\n01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360\nWhat do you think?\n\n01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.360\nEven if he wasn't well lit, he is lit by his dignity.\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.360\nHe's got his arms folded, but not in the...\n\n01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360\nHis arms folded in the kind of...\n\n01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360\nI'm trying to describe for listeners.\n\n01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.360\nYou know how you fold your arms if you are pouting?\n\n01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.360\nIt kind of closed off.\n\n01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.360\nThen there's the intellectual holding one elbow with another hand.\n\n01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360\nIt's contemplative.\n\n01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.360\nMy eyes keep darting over to him because he's so not a typical harm-on-town audience.\n\n01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.360\nWhat is your name, by the way?\n\n01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360\nJoel.\n\n01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.360\nDo you know harm-on-town?\n\n01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.360\nHave you heard of this?\n\n01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360\nDo you just wander in tonight?\n\n01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.360\nNo, I'm not sure.\n\n01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.360\nYou're an usher.\n\n01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.360\nWould you be willing to come up and talk to us?\n\n01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.360\nI've been looking at him all night.\n\n01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360\nJoel.\n\n01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:12.360\nI can honestly say this is the first guy that's ever been this specific physical archetype\n\n01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:15.360\nthat I've ever seen out there in the crowd.\n\n01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.360\nThere's an actor that he looks like.\n\n01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.360\nIs it E.G. Marshall?\n\n01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.360\nWhat is it?\n\n01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.360\nI can't...\n\n01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.360\nJack Lemon.\n\n01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.360\nJack Lemon.\n\n01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.360\nHal Holbrook?\n\n01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360\nA little Hal Holbrook?\n\n01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.360\nAll right.\n\n01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360\nHello, Joel.\n\n01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:33.360\nYour name's Joel.\n\n01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.360\nAnd you're an usher here at the theater.\n\n01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.360\nI'm an usher at the theater, yes.\n\n01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.360\nYou've been...\n\n01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.360\nIt could have gone worse because my eyes can't keep off of you.\n\n01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:49.360\nI always play to the person in the back of the room that I'm most terrified of, that\n\n01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360\nI'm, oh, this person is going to hate me.\n\n01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.360\nI'm talking about cocaine and booze and being stupid and I'm farting.\n\n01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.360\nAnd so my eyes keep going to you to check in.\n\n01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360\nAnd you've never...\n\n01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.360\nYou know, you're not pumping your fists or anything.\n\n01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.360\nBut you've been very supportive.\n\n01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360\nI would define you as...\n\n01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.360\nYou've been smiling now and then when it passed muster with you.\n\n01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360\nYeah.\n\n01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360\nDidn't give you the finger.\n\n01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360\nNo, no, yeah.\n\n01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360\nYou didn't get up and leave.\n\n01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360\nYou didn't...\n\n01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.360\nYeah, moon us or anything.\n\n01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360\nYeah, Joel.\n\n01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360\nWell, Joel, what do you think so far about the show?\n\n01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360\nBe honest.\n\n01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.360\nWell, HIP, what do you think about this?\n\n01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.360\nI find it very strange.\n\n01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.360\nI really don't understand it.\n\n01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360\nIt's very nice of you to say that.\n\n01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360\nAll right.\n\n01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.360\nWell, I don't know what...\n\n01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.360\nI just...\n\n01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360\nI had to like...\n\n01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360\nI wanted to personify him.\n\n01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360\nI didn't want him to be this like, you know...\n\n01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360\nDan, we all have our own wants.\n\n01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.360\nYou want to personify him.\n\n01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.360\nI want him to rap a little bit.\n\n01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.360\nOh, no, no, no.\n\n01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360\nCome on, Joel.\n\n01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360\nI don't want to rap.\n\n01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360\nJoel's not going to rap.\n\n01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.360\nMe neither.\n\n01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360\nWe have that in common.\n\n01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:57.360\nHow long have you been an usher here, Joel?\n\n01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360\nActually, about nine years.\n\n01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.360\nYeah.\n\n01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360\nAre you...\n\n01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360\nYou must be a patron of the arts.\n\n01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360\nLike, you want to be close to it.\n\n01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.360\nThat's why you took the job, maybe?\n\n01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.360\nYeah.\n\n01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360\nI mean, I ushered a bunch of theaters.\n\n01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.360\nThis is a beautiful, beautiful theater.\n\n01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360\nOh, this is not the only one that you ushered.\n\n01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.360\nI was walking downtown.\n\n01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.360\nIt used to be the public theater before they moved downtown.\n\n01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.360\nThis was the public theater.\n\n01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360\nAnd you get to see all the stuff for free?\n\n01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360\nYes.\n\n01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360\nBecause you ushered?\n\n01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.360\nRight.\n\n01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360\nAre you married?\n\n01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.360\nNo.\n\n01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.360\nOkay.\n\n01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360\nAnd you...\n\n01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360\nWhat's your...\n\n01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.360\nWhat's the best play that's been here in this theater this year?\n\n01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:36.360\nWhat's the best thing you've seen in this venue here?\n\n01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:43.360\nOh, the second city used to come here before they went downtown.\n\n01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360\nOh, okay.\n\n01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.360\nSo you like the improv comedy?\n\n01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360\nYes.\n\n01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:57.360\nI'm sorry that people spontaneously coming up with humorous things to say is your forte,\n\n01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.360\nbecause I must have let you down.\n\n01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:04.360\nI do a different brand of thing here.\n\n01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:09.360\nI'm sort of a low rent, spaulding gray, I guess, but I haven't written anything of it.\n\n01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.360\nOkay.\n\n01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.360\nThank you, Joel.\n\n01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.360\nIs there anything you want to plug or...\n\n01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.360\nIs there a sports drink you manufacture that you want people to know about?\n\n01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.360\nI mean, you have the mic if there's anything you want to say.\n\n01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360\nNo, I kind of hide away.\n\n01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.360\nOkay.\n\n01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.360\nHe's an usher.\n\n01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.360\nHe's got the usher spirit.\n\n01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360\nHe wants to get back to the shadows with Joel.\n\n01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.360\nAnd yet he found the most well-lit seat in the house.\n\n01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.360\nIt's like God is your flashlight.\n\n01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360\nGod is ushering you.\n\n01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360\nI see.\n\n01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.360\nYou're right.\n\n01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.360\nI'm writing the light there.\n\n01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360\nBut you look good in it.\n\n01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.360\nI mean, it's great.\n\n01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.360\nLike I said, you could have really played a mind game on me from that seat.\n\n01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:55.360\nEvery time I looked over, you could have just gone.\n\n01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360\nWell, now I can't.\n\n01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.360\nNow you can.\n\n01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.360\nYou can do whatever you want, Joel.\n\n01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.360\nThat's what Harmontown...\n\n01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360\nThat's the only thing we have going for us, is your freedom.\n\n01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.360\nThank you, Joel.\n\n01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.360\nJoel, everybody.\n\n01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:11.360\nThank you so much, sir.\n\n01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360\nAll right.\n\n01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360\nLet's bring Erin McGathy to the stage for D&D.\n\n01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360\nErin.\n\n01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:23.360\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.360\nErin steps to the igloo cooler, refreshing her ice to the...\n\n01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360\nI'm no Spencer.\n\n01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.360\nI can't do it.\n\n01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360\nYou can't do it.\n\n01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360\nNo one can.\n\n01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360\nHello.\n\n01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360\nHello, Erin.\n\n01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.360\nHello.\n\n01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.360\nErin McGathy.\n\n01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.360\nEverybody?\n\n01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360\nDid I miss anything?\n\n01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:48.360\nI just want to say, while Joel was up, I think someone's trying to date rape me.\n\n01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360\nI'm a very mysterious drink.\n\n01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.360\nSomebody came and brought what seems to be a yingling beer to you.\n\n01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.360\nAnd there's definitely like a pill fizzing around in the bottom.\n\n01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.360\nAre you kidding me?\n\n01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.360\nLet me see this.\n\n01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360\nYeah, no, I'm kidding.\n\n01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360\nCareful.\n\n01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.360\nI swear to God, it's hetero love.\n\n01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360\nOkay, so that's you?\n\n01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.360\nYes.\n\n01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360\nYou, I trust.\n\n01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.360\nOkay.\n\n01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.360\nIs there a pill?\n\n01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.360\nIs that an optical illusion, Spencer?\n\n01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.360\nNo, I was joking.\n\n01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.360\nI was joking.\n\n01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360\nOh, God, I thought...\n\n01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.360\nReally affecting it.\n\n01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360\nYeah, I'm a little jealous.\n\n01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:28.360\nOh, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.\n\n01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.360\nWait, Spencer, you don't even drink, really, do you?\n\n01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360\nI know how.\n\n01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360\nBut Spencer...\n\n01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.360\nDungeon Snap.\n\n01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360\nAll right.\n\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360\nSpencer, sorry, Erin, go ahead.\n\n01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.360\nOh, nothing.\n\n01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.360\nI just said wireless.\n\n01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.360\nIs there anything, Erin?\n\n01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360\nWireless mic.\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360\nBecause it's kind of not fair when I talk about our relationship and whether or not\n\n01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:51.360\nI'm a dick within it.\n\n01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.360\nAnd then you don't have, and now that you have the mic, is there anything that I said that\n\n01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:01.360\nyou need to counter or clarify or...?\n\n01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.360\nSad woo from the audience.\n\n01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.360\nLike, did I lie? Did I lie about anything that you need to correct me on or...?\n\n01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360\nNo.\n\n01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360\nI don't think so.\n\n01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360\nI feel...\n\n01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.360\nI mean, at Harmonetown, I guess we're honest about our feelings.\n\n01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.360\nI feel a little raw.\n\n01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:19.360\nOh, well, by the two-way channel.\n\n01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.360\nI did...\n\n01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:23.360\nMy cheeks weren't totally dry backstage.\n\n01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360\nI made you cry tonight?\n\n01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360\nOh, I don't know.\n\n01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360\nDuring the show?\n\n01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360\nNo, it's fine.\n\n01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360\nI don't want to be...\n\n01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:39.360\nIt's kind of a bummer listening to you talk about jerking off to a 17-year-old with a\n\n01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360\nponytail.\n\n01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360\nLadies?\n\n01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360\nIt's fine.\n\n01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:49.360\nI don't want it to be a thing, because Dan and I have had this conversation a million\n\n01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360\ntimes over, but...\n\n01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.360\nAre you saying you cried during that backstage?\n\n01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360\nLook, man, I'm just being honest.\n\n01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.360\nI'm not saying it's the way to be.\n\n01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.360\nI don't know if anyone listens to my podcast, but I don't start it by saying, hey, I'm\n\n01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360\nperfect.\n\n01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360\nHere goes.\n\n01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.360\nSo, I don't know.\n\n01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.360\nI...\n\n01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.360\nIt will bum me out a little bit.\n\n01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.360\nGiven our...\n\n01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.360\nThe sexual activity we had this afternoon, I felt a little...\n\n01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360\nMade me feel a little sad.\n\n01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.360\nBecause it was unreciprocated.\n\n01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.360\nBecause it was one-sided, and...\n\n01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.360\nI was...\n\n01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.360\nI have a fever.\n\n01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.360\nIt's...\n\n01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360\nHey, man.\n\n01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360\nIt's all about...\n\n01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360\nIt's fine.\n\n01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360\nIt's fine.\n\n01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.360\nIt was all about me this afternoon.\n\n01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.360\nWere you saying it was unreciprocated sex that went on today?\n\n01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.280\nLike, Dan was being selfish in bed today?\n\n01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.080\nWe had two hours to get some rest.\n\n01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.080\nI had a fever.\n\n01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.080\nI was...\n\n01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.080\nI had chills.\n\n01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080\nLike, she asked me...\n\n01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080\nIs there...\n\n01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.080\nIs there...\n\n01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.080\nCan I...\n\n01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.080\nCan I help you out?\n\n01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.080\nLike, kind of...\n\n01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080\nI can't remember how she put it.\n\n01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080\nI do not say, can I help you out?\n\n01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.360\nI can't remember how you put it, but my response was, is it okay if I just lay here?\n\n01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360\nIt's fine.\n\n01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.360\nI'm really not upset about it.\n\n01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:59.360\nI mean, it probably speaks more to my own insecurity, but when...\n\n01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.360\nYou know, when...\n\n01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.360\nWell, it speaks to your desire to have sex.\n\n01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.360\nLike, it speaks to your...\n\n01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.360\nOn the tour, yeah.\n\n01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.360\nOn the tour, things are slower sexually, so when I watch you on stage fantasize about\n\n01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:15.360\na volleyball playing 72-year-old, I want to kill myself because I'm like, well, I'm not\n\n01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360\nthat, and I wish I was.\n\n01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360\nI have red hair.\n\n01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360\nI wish I were.\n\n01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.360\nNo, I was...\n\n01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360\nYes.\n\n01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360\nI wish I was.\n\n01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360\nOkay.\n\n01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360\nWell, I understand that.\n\n01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.360\nThat wasn't supposed to be a black horse.\n\n01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.360\nThat was the start.\n\n01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360\nAnd yet it was.\n\n01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360\nYeah, and yet it was.\n\n01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360\nAnd yet it was.\n\n01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360\nAnd yet it was.\n\n01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360\nI...\n\n01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360\nNo, I don't know.\n\n01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360\nI just...\n\n01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.160\nI guess after last night and the last couple of days, I feel a little low.\n\n01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.360\nI feel a little defeated.\n\n01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.960\nI don't feel super...\n\n01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.240\nI guess maybe I don't feel...\n\n01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:51.360\nI love you, but I don't feel super hyped on our relationship right now.\n\n01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360\nBut...\n\n01:24:52.360 --> 01:25:02.360\nWell, I'll see what I can do about that before Minneapolis.\n\n01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:03.360\nBut I...\n\n01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.360\nGuys, I'm not saying I want to break up or anything.\n\n01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.360\nI just feel a little...\n\n01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360\nI just feel...\n\n01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360\nMy heart's a little chafed.\n\n01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.360\nI used to be really fat, and when I would go to a water park, my thighs would get all red\n\n01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.360\nand bloody, and that's what my heart feels like.\n\n01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.360\nOh, God, I'm so sorry.\n\n01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360\nHey, Joel.\n\n01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360\nLook like Jim D.\n\n01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.360\nJoel, take it easy back there, won't you?\n\n01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.360\nJoel's now pumping his fists.\n\n01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360\nBut I think the show is going great.\n\n01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360\nI think Pittsburgh's awesome.\n\n01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360\nEveryone here is super...\n\n01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360\nIt's one of the great...\n\n01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.360\nIt's one of the top three towns in the nation to break up, and did you guys know that?\n\n01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:41.360\nYour dream...\n\n01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:47.360\nEveryone at the merch table was so cool and so nice, and it was great.\n\n01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.360\nSpencer, I hate to call an audible, because you've prepared this stuff and also, but you're\n\n01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.360\nvery willing to adapt on the fly to stuff that we do.\n\n01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:05.360\nMaybe is there a way during this little fantasy segment that we do in D&D for Dan and Aaron's\n\n01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.360\ncharacters to maybe find some sort of connection, maybe patch up some of these wounds?\n\n01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.360\nIs that possible?\n\n01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.360\nYeah.\n\n01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360\nAll right.\n\n01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.360\nSpencer, if you would, catch us up to date.\n\n01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:25.360\nWhen we last met, our heroes had just hijacked a flying airship piloted by Dave.\n\n01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:30.360\nThe airship seemed to be damaged, and the gang raced around trying to fix it, and just after\n\n01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.360\nthey thought they had it all under control, a shake rattled the hole.\n\n01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:42.360\nThe gang awoke in the wreckage of their ship, and in the midst of a deep dark red cave.\n\n01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:49.360\nJust by seven humans and a halfling, a chorus of people approached our heroes in the deep\n\n01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:52.360\nof this cave.\n\n01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:58.360\nAs our heroes met the tribesmen, they realized that they had been swallowed by a great beast,\n\n01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360\nknown only as the Infinifish.\n\n01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.360\nThere was this weird point in the show where, for some reason, I don't know how.\n\n01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.360\nIt wasn't my idea.\n\n01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.360\nWe brought all the black people in the audience onto the stage.\n\n01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360\nSo there were eight black people.\n\n01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.360\nThey both were on stage.\n\n01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.360\nI said, the way how is that you said it.\n\n01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.360\nLet's bring all the black people on stage.\n\n01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.360\nRight.\n\n01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.360\nI don't know how we got to that point.\n\n01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.360\nThere was a Greek chorus of all of our black audience members up there, and they were kind\n\n01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.360\nof our guides through the fowls of the Infinifish.\n\n01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.360\nThey took you through some neat curtains.\n\n01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:36.360\nThey did a dance that opened the way forward, and you got to their village, which is where\n\n01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360\nyou are now.\n\n01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360\nPerfect.\n\n01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.360\nAgain, nine seconds left on the track, and he knows exactly how to end it.\n\n01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360\nHe's amazing.\n\n01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.360\nAll right.\n\n01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360\nSo let's examine our surroundings.\n\n01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.360\nYou're in this red cave-ish area.\n\n01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.360\nThe walls are fleshy and pustules of glowing golden fluid line the walls, casting light\n\n01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:56.360\nover the area.\n\n01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:02.360\nSeveral scrap hovels have been shored together from various pits of pieces of ship and or\n\n01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.360\ncrates and or other items.\n\n01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:11.360\nThere's about 17 or 18 of these dwellings, and they seem quite modest, but workable.\n\n01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360\nCozy.\n\n01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:16.360\nYeah, cozy for inside of an animal.\n\n01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.360\nThe people are just hanging around now.\n\n01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:22.360\nThey're just going back to their business.\n\n01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.360\nSo are you going to play all these people, Spencer?\n\n01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:29.360\nI can play all of them, any of them, none of them, whatever has to happen.\n\n01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.360\nOkay.\n\n01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.360\nDid you want to get the black people in Pittsburgh to come up?\n\n01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.360\nNo.\n\n01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.360\nLet's bring them out.\n\n01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:37.360\nLet's bring the black people.\n\n01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.360\nIt was a joke.\n\n01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.360\nI don't know how I felt about having done it.\n\n01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.360\nIt was an organic thing.\n\n01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.360\nHalfway through it, I was like, what are we doing?\n\n01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.360\nWe're dehumanizing black people.\n\n01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:54.360\nIt started as a thing that was supposed to re-humanize and express ironic white guilt,\n\n01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:59.360\nand then when you arrange people in a big, long line and give them one microphone for\n\n01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:04.360\nthem, it's like the opposite effect for me emotionally, I think they had a good time,\n\n01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:08.360\nbut I can't really access them emotionally, so I don't know.\n\n01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.360\nI seek out the elder or leader of this group of people.\n\n01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.360\nThat's the female chieftain that you met in Arlington.\n\n01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360\nI approach her.\n\n01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360\nYou approach her.\n\n01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.360\nI say, what's up?\n\n01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.360\nI hope you find our village to your liking.\n\n01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.360\nIt's not much, but it's all we have.\n\n01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:28.360\nWe don't get very much stuff down here, but my friend Phil owns this shop down the lane.\n\n01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.360\nThere's also an end to your right if you need to sleep.\n\n01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.360\nWe got some stuff.\n\n01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.360\nI'm sorry we don't have much, but it's the inside of a friggin' beast.\n\n01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.360\nWe probably definitely need some sleep at this point, I imagine.\n\n01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:49.360\nI'm bushed, and I notice some strange tension between Mulray and Sedona, and Sharpie Buttsalot.\n\n01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:57.360\nI find the nearest humble dwelling that a gnome barbarian might find, and I hit the hang.\n\n01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.360\nThat happens.\n\n01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.360\nYou take your leave gracefully.\n\n01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:09.360\nI find a reflective surface on a wall, and I walk over to it, and I brush my hair.\n\n01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.360\nYou find no reflective surface?\n\n01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.360\nNo.\n\n01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:23.360\nI walk over to some sort of wall, and I imagine that there's something there, and I stare at it, and I brush my hair.\n\n01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:31.360\nYou look beautiful since becoming a woman.\n\n01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.360\nThank you, Sharpie.\n\n01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:41.360\nOkay, said some things back in the epiglottis.\n\n01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360\nI regret, I guess.\n\n01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360\nYou guess?\n\n01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.360\nYou guess you regret them, or you actually regret them?\n\n01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.360\nWell, I regret making you feel bad.\n\n01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.360\nI don't want to do that. I like you.\n\n01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:58.360\nBut if I hadn't felt bad, everything you said would have been fine?\n\n01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:05.360\nI mean, it's like...\n\n01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:12.360\nHow much tap dancing do you want done for your sake?\n\n01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.360\nVery little.\n\n01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:23.360\nAll I have to do is just not say certain stuff during a show that I'm doing. All I have to do is think about you.\n\n01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.360\nAll right, pause. D&D pause.\n\n01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.360\nOh, it was on pause.\n\n01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:37.360\nI was just being open about my feelings, and I qualified it by saying that I think it's just about my insecurity.\n\n01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:41.360\nAfter the show, I wouldn't give you a note saying I don't think you should have done that bit, because I think it was fine.\n\n01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.360\nArtistically, I think it was totally cool, because I'm feeling insecure.\n\n01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.360\nI said it's sorry that you were hurt, which is the truth.\n\n01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360\nOkay, that's fine.\n\n01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:54.360\nAnd your question was, you're sorry that I was hurt, but if I wasn't hurt, you would have thought that was okay.\n\n01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.360\nSo, here we go. Now, that's a note. That's a behavioral adjustment.\n\n01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.360\nWell, I mean, Dan, I was being Mulrainee.\n\n01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360\nWhat?\n\n01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:09.360\nWell, I just... Let's back up a little for actually going to talk about this in front of all of our best friends.\n\n01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:14.360\nCan I get you guys a couple drinks?\n\n01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:22.360\nWhen we had that fight the other night, you apologized, and then in the morning, I was still feeling sad.\n\n01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:28.360\nAnd I said to you, I still feel sad about this, and your response was, so what?\n\n01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.360\nYeah, because we had a fucking drunken fight the previous night, and it's not...\n\n01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:36.360\nRight, but you saw him slung a lot of arrows.\n\n01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:41.360\nArrows!\n\n01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:47.360\nSo, it was a lot. It was a lot. It was more than usual.\n\n01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:53.360\nBut after talking about it on stage last night, I was fine.\n\n01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:59.360\nAnd hypothetically, I'm fine now. I guess I'm feeling a little insecure.\n\n01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:05.360\nI feel a little undesirable.\n\n01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:09.360\nWell, you're the hottest girlfriend I've ever had.\n\n01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.360\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:25.360\nIs that the... I mean, because it seems... I realize that we all have kind of fundamental needs to feel sexy and stuff,\n\n01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:32.360\nbut there's a certain point at which... I love you. I'm in love with you.\n\n01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:39.360\nI want to spend the rest of my life with you, and the idea that a piece of pornography,\n\n01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.360\nor a primal urge, somehow a threat to you...\n\n01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:50.360\nNo, it's not that. It's when you're...\n\n01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:56.360\nWhen you show me less that you're attracted to me than those things creep into my brain,\n\n01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:02.360\nbut when you are in a mode where you show me that you care about me, and ladies...\n\n01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.360\nIt doesn't take a lot, right? It takes very little.\n\n01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:11.360\nIt takes... You look nice today, or...\n\n01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.360\nGosh, I'm so busy. I wish I could have sex with you right now, but I gotta go to work.\n\n01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:25.360\nJust very little... Women are so much lower maintenance than men think.\n\n01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:34.360\nSo when we're on tour, so everything's fucked up, and it's hard for you to...\n\n01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:41.360\nIt's a slash impossible for you to pay me the attention that I need because I am just as broken as you.\n\n01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:49.360\nHence why I'm in this relationship with you. I don't think that someone super healthy would fall in love with you.\n\n01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.360\nAnd that's not a diss. That's love.\n\n01:34:52.360 --> 01:35:03.360\nSo in the same way that you flipped out at my high school reunion, because some douchebag was hitting on me,\n\n01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:14.360\nI need... I just need a pat on the head, and I don't know, I'll get you later.\n\n01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.360\nIt's all fine. And I'm not mad at you.\n\n01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:25.360\nI'm not... You did. You pat me on the head tonight. I'm not mad about the 17-year-old thing.\n\n01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:35.360\nI'm just feeling insecure, that's all. And after last night, or two nights ago, things are a little raw. Everything's fine.\n\n01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.360\nI think feeling insecure is awesome. I stand up here and talk about what makes me feel insecure.\n\n01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.360\nAll the people in this audience come up to me after the show and shake my hand and tell me about the things that make them feel insecure.\n\n01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:54.360\nThat listens to this podcast instead of Rob Schneiders agrees that expressing insecurity is worth something.\n\n01:35:54.360 --> 01:36:03.360\nHowever, then there's this line between expressing insecurity and what? What's my thing?\n\n01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.360\nYou think that I'm trying to get you to do something?\n\n01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360\nRight.\n\n01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:16.360\nSo you feel insecure when something happens, and then I say to someone that loves you, oh my God, I'm so sorry that you got splashed by things that made you feel bad.\n\n01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:23.360\nLet me help you. I am so sorry you feel bad. And then you say...\n\n01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.360\nBut you think that that's acceptable behavior, or like you're not going to do that anymore, right?\n\n01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360\nOr whatever the hell, how have you phrased it before?\n\n01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:43.360\nYou express the fact that the things that I do are the things that make you feel insecure and you imply that in order for you to feel good about yourself,\n\n01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.360\nmy behavior has to shift and change.\n\n01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.360\nAnd then I go into defense mode.\n\n01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.360\nRight. I think that's mostly in your head. I think that's in your head.\n\n01:36:52.360 --> 01:37:02.360\nOkay. Well, it's been recorded. It's not in my head now. It's over a sound system and it's on tape.\n\n01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.360\nWe can rewind it. We can play it on the bus and let's talk about it.\n\n01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.360\nMaybe it's when someone apologizes for certain behavior they assume that the other person is saying,\n\n01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.360\nI'm sorry for this and I'll try to do something different.\n\n01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:18.360\nBut are you telling me that when you apologize for something you say, I'm sorry I dropped the vase.\n\n01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.360\nI'm not going to try to not drop it anymore.\n\n01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.360\nYes, yes. Uncharismatic as it sounds because now we're not in a comedy mode.\n\n01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.360\nSo now the joke is gone. We're outside of it.\n\n01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.360\nSo just as when they bring Eminem on CNN and have him read his rap lyrics,\n\n01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:37.360\ndo you think this is appropriate? I'm not going to sound very charismatic when I say,\n\n01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:47.360\nyes, I don't think it was that bad to do the joke of having a weird petty fantasy that's out of a hustler video.\n\n01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.360\nI don't think it was either. I was just saying that I felt insecure.\n\n01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.360\nYou asked me how I felt.\n\n01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:58.360\nAnd I said, I'm sorry that you feel insecure. And then you implied, then you went into that territory.\n\n01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.360\nSo you're going to change, right? And the answer is not in that specific context.\n\n01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360\nNo, I don't think so.\n\n01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360\nI don't think I...\n\n01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:10.360\nWell, then I was misunderstood or I misspoke.\n\n01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.360\nI didn't mean to imply that I thought that you should do something differently in that way.\n\n01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.360\nWell, Aaron's fault.\n\n01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.360\nWe will rewind it in the bus and we'll update people.\n\n01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.360\nSpencer, I...\n\n01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.360\nOh, that Aaron. Oh, the Aaron and the other Aaron.\n\n01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360\nAaron, A, A, R, O, A.\n\n01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360\nAaron, A, A, R, O, A.\n\n01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:30.360\nWhen you...\n\n01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.360\nOh, wow, yeah.\n\n01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:32.360\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.360\nMy name is Brad.\n\n01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360\nWhen Brad said it's all Aaron's fault, I was really just like, okay.\n\n01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360\nYeah.\n\n01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.360\nYeah, it's okay.\n\n01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.360\nWhat's amazing is the guy that Dan was pretend fantasizing about and trying to get a hard-on for,\n\n01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:45.360\nhis name was Aaron. I didn't even put that together.\n\n01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.360\nLook, I...\n\n01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.360\nI was...\n\n01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.360\nThis was my process backstage.\n\n01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:51.360\nI heard that bit and I was like, God damn it.\n\n01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.360\nAnd then I was like, look, Aaron, if you were doing a show and your bit was that you needed to get wet for somebody,\n\n01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:02.360\neveryone would think it was stupid and gay and retarded, not gay homosexual.\n\n01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.360\nAnd not retarded disabled.\n\n01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360\nAnd I'm thinking about...\n\n01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360\nShe's gay.\n\n01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360\nShe made retarded gay and gay retarded.\n\n01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360\nYeah.\n\n01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360\nShe said...\n\n01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:13.360\nJust to clarify, I hate retarded people.\n\n01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.360\nTake care, you guys.\n\n01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:16.360\nBut I...\n\n01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360\nIt would be really stupid and not funny if I got up and in that bit said, oh, I'm imagining Dan Harmon.\n\n01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:23.360\nExactly.\n\n01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360\nAnd he said, yes, I agree.\n\n01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360\nI was only speaking to my insecurity.\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360\nI don't think that you should stop.\n\n01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.360\nI was just speaking without a filter about how I feel.\n\n01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.360\nAnd I said, I'm sorry.\n\n01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360\nFeelings are complicated.\n\n01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360\nNo one told you not to express your feelings.\n\n01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360\nAnd then I said, I'm sorry.\n\n01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360\nOkay, so what did I do wrong?\n\n01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.360\nSo what did I do wrong?\n\n01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.360\nBrad, what did I do wrong?\n\n01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.360\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.360\nPlease tell me what happened.\n\n01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:52.360\nI think you need to stare at Aaron and do the same thing to Dan.\n\n01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.360\nI think it's the only way to save it.\n\n01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.360\nAn eye for an eye?\n\n01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.360\nWell...\n\n01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:08.360\nAaron, male Aaron said, or you can stare at my wife.\n\n01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.360\nAnd oddly enough, that's when the show rounded a bend.\n\n01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:13.360\nOkay.\n\n01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360\nAll right.\n\n01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.360\nNo one wanted to do it.\n\n01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:23.360\nSpencer, I take my flaming sword and attack the tension in the room.\n\n01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360\nCritical hit.\n\n01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:34.360\nInteresting enough, this is a lot like...\n\n01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.360\nDan, for reals me, I wasn't telling you to stop doing that.\n\n01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360\nWell, good.\n\n01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360\nI'm sorry I misinterpreted it.\n\n01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.360\nThen I'm very sorry I misinterpreted that because that is exactly the message I received.\n\n01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.360\nAnd I love you.\n\n01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.360\nAnd I would never do this with anyone.\n\n01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.360\nI've never...\n\n01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.360\nCritical hit.\n\n01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.360\nBeen in a relationship with this.\n\n01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.360\nReminding a corner.\n\n01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360\nI'm leaving the tension.\n\n01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:56.360\nI critically hit the tension.\n\n01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.360\nThat's why I'm saying to her, I love you.\n\n01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:00.360\nI don't want anything to ever hurt you.\n\n01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.360\nI want to be with you forever.\n\n01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:07.360\nI'm perfectly capable of saying that.\n\n01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360\nIt's not...\n\n01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:16.360\nEverything else is cosmetic, like weird behavioral adjustment that I don't cotton to, you know?\n\n01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.360\nI love you too.\n\n01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:22.360\nI'm perfect and sometimes I will feel bad.\n\n01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.360\nSometimes I'll feel bad about things and I'm just telling you how I feel about something\n\n01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.360\nand I'm not giving you a note.\n\n01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.360\nOkay.\n\n01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360\nYou don't want to change me.\n\n01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.360\nI don't want to change you.\n\n01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.360\nI don't want to change you.\n\n01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.360\nThere would be too many changes.\n\n01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.360\nHypothetically.\n\n01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.360\nI mean, I don't.\n\n01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.360\nI think you're perfect in your imperfection.\n\n01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.360\nOkay.\n\n01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.360\nSo where's Gooskies at you guys?\n\n01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.360\nWhere do we go?\n\n01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.360\nI love you very much.\n\n01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.360\nYou two should keep going.\n\n01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.360\nLet's all just quietly sneak out and go to Gooskies.\n\n01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360\nDan.\n\n01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.360\nDan, can I ask you something?\n\n01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.360\nYeah.\n\n01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.360\nCan I move in with you after the tour?\n\n01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.360\nWow.\n\n01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.360\nThat hairpin.\n\n01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:12.360\nA hairpin turn.\n\n01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.360\nDo you think...\n\n01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.360\nCan I answer that question with a question?\n\n01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.360\nDo you think these are healthy circumstances under which to get a yes?\n\n01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:26.360\nNo, I just think they're good for the show.\n\n01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.360\nOkay.\n\n01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.360\nI wait for my sleep, Spencer.\n\n01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.360\nAnd I walk into the hut where Sharpie and Mulrainee are talking and I enter the hut and\n\n01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.360\nI go, oh boy, I had a really healthy night's sleep.\n\n01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360\nHoly moly, what did you guys do?\n\n01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.360\nWhat did you talk about?\n\n01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.360\nIt was the upshot.\n\n01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:46.360\nI don't want to go through a big thing.\n\n01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.360\nWhat's the headlines?\n\n01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:56.360\nWe dreamt of a futuristic world where our voices were louder than they should be and\n\n01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:04.360\na chorus of angels watched us argue about things that only made sense in that world.\n\n01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360\nSo welcome.\n\n01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.360\nCool sword.\n\n01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.360\nThank you.\n\n01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.360\nMike and Jen got this for me, isn't it?\n\n01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.360\nGorgeous.\n\n01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:16.360\nMike sculpted all this, all the foam on this.\n\n01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.360\nHe didn't just buy it this way, he sculpted it.\n\n01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:22.360\nWhy don't you fuck him?\n\n01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.360\nAnd we're back.\n\n01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:33.360\nThe greatest adventure.\n\n01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.360\nOh, a reset.\n\n01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:37.360\nAll right.\n\n01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.360\nWe'll edit it out.\n\n01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.360\nNo, the fuck you will, that stays in, baby.\n\n01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.360\nAll of it stays in.\n\n01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:49.360\nDo you think the director of the documentary is like...\n\n01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:55.360\nHe's backstage like the guy from the Highlander like...\n\n01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.360\nHe's having the opposite experience of the audience.\n\n01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.360\nIt's inversely proportionate.\n\n01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:08.360\nThey're like, oh my god, the babysitter is going to make $90 tonight and Neil's like...\n\n01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.360\nFor the power of Grayskull.\n\n01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.360\nOh man.\n\n01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.360\nHas there ever been a podcast where a boyfriend and girlfriend got into it that much?\n\n01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.360\nI don't listen to a lot of podcasts, that's pretty wild, right?\n\n01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.360\nLet's not congratulate ourselves too much.\n\n01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.360\nLet's take the time they gave us.\n\n01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.360\nI was saying there's a reason why there isn't a lot of those.\n\n01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.360\nI don't know.\n\n01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.360\nYeah, it's a ratings disaster.\n\n01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:42.360\nI don't know if anybody's sadness or uncomfortability, but it's very fascinating to sit this close to that kind of conversation.\n\n01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.360\nAnd the fact that you're so absolutely comfortable doing that with a lot of people.\n\n01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.360\nThere's 17 farmers in here and there's 200 people.\n\n01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.360\nAnd you guys just bear your souls as if we're not even here.\n\n01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.360\nWhich makes me believe that you don't think we're here.\n\n01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.360\nWhich is the definition of sociopathic.\n\n01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:06.360\nIt's so narcissistic that you don't know I am sitting over here and going to the camera.\n\n01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:13.360\nCan't we both join forces and fail to consider the entire world's feelings?\n\n01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.360\nWait, how about this then?\n\n01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:23.360\nYou guys just cast Ray of Frost on other people's knowledge of your existence.\n\n01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.360\nI don't know what that means, it's a level zero spell.\n\n01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.360\nI think it's fascinating that you guys are...\n\n01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.360\nI'm not easily embarrassed.\n\n01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:36.360\nI don't know that I could sit in front of this group of people and turn this into Sally Jesse Raphael.\n\n01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.360\nSpencer, we're attacked by monogamy. Go.\n\n01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:48.360\nCreeping into the room, you hear the dull monotonous thuds of your significant other.\n\n01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:54.360\nYou roll over and pretend you're not awake.\n\n01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:57.360\nHe's a goddamn genius. What kind of pressure do you think I'm under?\n\n01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.360\nI have a better writer sitting next to me who's half my age.\n\n01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.360\nI took him on this tour. I was inviting a homeless person to Thanksgiving.\n\n01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.360\nI'm being a big charitable guy.\n\n01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.360\nLet's take the Dungeon Master on the rock bus. He's a fucking genius.\n\n01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:13.360\nI was supposed to be riding my Fox pilot. I fucking blew it.\n\n01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.360\nI turned the CBS one in, but my career is dying back home.\n\n01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.360\nAnd this guy is ascending to stardom.\n\n01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:23.360\nYou're empowering somebody, that's more important.\n\n01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.360\nIt is. That's why I'm a great person.\n\n01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:33.360\nA lesser man would be really, really sabotaging you. You're a very threatening person.\n\n01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.360\nI love you. God damn it.\n\n01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.360\nWhat's that?\n\n01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.360\nHe's not from Alaska.\n\n01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.360\nThe last thing I'm going to do is go, why would you say that?\n\n01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:50.360\nWe just talked for 90 minutes about something where you could have asked that every 30 seconds.\n\n01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:56.360\nLet's get back to the game and let's just bring this thing into the station on a dime.\n\n01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.360\nA Pittsburgh steel dime.\n\n01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:03.360\nYou're on track to live in the belly of this fish for the rest of your life right now.\n\n01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:07.360\nRight, it's an infinite fish. What did my mom say that nursery rhyme about the infinite fish?\n\n01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.360\nIt'll eat you.\n\n01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.360\nShe was right.\n\n01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:15.360\nAll right, so clearly these people, they couldn't get out of here for a reason.\n\n01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:22.360\nDid they lack some sort of knowledge or tool that we have to get out of the infinite fish?\n\n01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.360\nMaybe.\n\n01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.360\nI approach the wall with the yellow pustules on it and examine those.\n\n01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:34.360\nYou examine the pustules. They seem to secrete a vicious odor, as well as light casting light into the room.\n\n01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:41.360\nI take a throwing knife and stand back 12 paces and throw a throwing knife into one of the pustules and see what happens.\n\n01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:48.360\nThe pustule pops with a sickening burst, sickly fluid pours forth.\n\n01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:55.360\nWell, he's doing that. I want to ask around to see if I can find the person that they acknowledge as being in charge, like their leader.\n\n01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.360\nYeah, you meet up with the person Quark was talking to.\n\n01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:59.360\nThat lady.\n\n01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.360\nOkay.\n\n01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.360\nThe chieftain lady.\n\n01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.360\nOkay.\n\n01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.360\nYeah, how can I help you? You know, do you want a house?\n\n01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:11.360\nThere was a shop. Her friend owns a shop. Her friend Phil, right?\n\n01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.360\nYep. Phil the shopkeep.\n\n01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.360\nI run down to Phil's shop.\n\n01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:23.360\nHey, I'm Phil. I sell stuff. I don't got much, but sometimes cargo vessels get ate and I sell them things.\n\n01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.360\nDo you want any things? I got healing potions.\n\n01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:33.360\nI got these syringes full of some sort of paralyzing goop.\n\n01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:39.360\nGoods for calming down the monster, and we don't get cable down here, so it's fine.\n\n01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:48.360\nIt seems to me, Jeff, that what we need to do, and don't ask me where I got this idea, is we need to make this giant monster that we're inside puke.\n\n01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.360\nMonster house, 2009.\n\n01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:57.360\nWait, I have smoke sticks. Should I light a bunch of my smoke sticks?\n\n01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.360\nI can hit the fish's uvula with an arrow.\n\n01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:09.360\nI say because the show is getting to the point where we're going long, that we buy all the good stuff that we need.\n\n01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:16.360\nI'll buy those healing potions. Let's go shopping and let's embark on the adventure next time, probably, right?\n\n01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360\nYeah, that sounds good.\n\n01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.360\nI can part with some potions, 50 apiece. The syringes are going to run you 250.\n\n01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.360\nI'll take the potions. You guys get the syringes.\n\n01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.360\nYou guys got a fair amount of money.\n\n01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.360\nSyringes. Is there anything else?\n\n01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:39.360\nDo you guys want any? I got a rope. I got a signed picture of Derek Jeter.\n\n01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.360\nHoly shit, Derek Jeter?\n\n01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.360\nYeah, he's a great cleric of renown.\n\n01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360\nI'm a Pirates fan.\n\n01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.360\nI'll take some rope.\n\n01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.360\nYou get 40 feet of rope. It only costs a meager amount of silver.\n\n01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.360\nBasically, D&D, people came and brought us awesome swords and ray of frost thingies.\n\n01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:04.360\nAll we did was talk about relationships and go shopping.\n\n01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.360\nSpencer, everybody!\n\n01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.360\nYay!\n\n01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.360\nErin McAfee.\n\n01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.360\nYeah. Thank you, everyone, for indulging that conversation. Sorry if it became weird.\n\n01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.360\nThank you, Spencer. Thank you, Erin.\n\n01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:24.360\nWow.\n\n01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.360\nYou're in for it.\n\n01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:34.360\nOne more time for the beautifully awkward relationship between Dan Harmon and Erin McAfee.\n\n01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.360\nI'm going to start my own podcast called That Felt Terrible.\n\n01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:46.360\nI think that's why Joel's not married. Remember when Joel came up?\n\n01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.360\nYeah. The well-lit Joel back there?\n\n01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.360\nJoel escapes the hero of this whole story.\n\n01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.360\nSo, after all that, she walks on stage and you deify being a bachelor.\n\n01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:02.360\nI'm an entertainer, Jeff. It's in my blood.\n\n01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.360\nI go for the laugh.\n\n01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.360\nI didn't get it, but I go for it.\n\n01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:15.360\nAs an entertainer, Dan, the burden is on you right now to tie this little package, whatever we did here tonight,\n\n01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.360\nin the Hazelette Theater in Pittsburgh.\n\n01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:19.360\nI think we really take advantage of these wireless mics.\n\n01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.360\nYeah. You can really walk around like, you know, use the space.\n\n01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:28.360\nWhat are you doing for? You want to wrap this up in song right now?\n\n01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:31.360\nOr do you want to go talk to people? What do you want to do?\n\n01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:38.360\nNo, no. Let's wrap it up and meet people at the same time with a beautiful song about everyone in this beautiful city.\n\n01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.360\nYeah.\n\n01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.360\nIt's a beautiful citadel of steel, rivets.\n\n01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:56.360\nThey're cold, but your hearts aren't.\n\n01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.360\nI met a guy named Stephen today\n\n01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:11.360\nand I said he was gay, but it's okay if you are in Harmontown.\n\n01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.360\nYou've made yourself hysterical.\n\n01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.360\nThis is the idea that that's entertainment.\n\n01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:27.360\nIt's funny to me. I guess that's pretty meta.\n\n01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:33.360\nOh, like your hat. What's your name?\n\n01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.360\nWhoa.\n\n01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:36.360\nWow.\n\n01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.360\nMagical things happen in Harmontown.\n\n01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.360\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.360\nStephen again.\n\n01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360\nStephen again.\n\n01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.360\nI fucked your mama nine times and ten\n\n01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:53.360\nand the Steelers didn't go to the division of championships\n\n01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.360\nbecause Harmontown and everything involved in football is stupid.\n\n01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:06.360\nEverything's dumb because it's stupid to throw a ball when you don't have to hit anything with it.\n\n01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:12.360\nIt's all a bunch of shitty crap, but it's okay to enjoy it.\n\n01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:20.360\nEvery little Pittsburgh boy and girl went to Harmontown.\n\n01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.360\nBeautiful theater.\n\n01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.360\nI see a guy that looks like Tom Baker.\n\n01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.360\nI see a guy with a check shirt maker.\n\n01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.360\nThis isn't working.\n\n01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.360\nI'm not that talented.\n\n01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.360\nStriped shirt.\n\n01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:35.360\nRegular shirt.\n\n01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:36.360\nBlack shirt.\n\n01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.360\nScarf on a bra.\n\n01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.360\nSweat shirt bra.\n\n01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.360\nCrooked cotton hat.\n\n01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:47.360\nOh, is that shake orvis?\n\n01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.360\nHoly shit.\n\n01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.360\nHey buddy, how you doing?\n\n01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.360\nI knew this guy when I was 19 years old in Milwaukee\n\n01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:56.360\nwhen we did comedy sports together.\n\n01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.360\nHoly shit.\n\n01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.360\nWow.\n\n01:53:58.360 --> 01:53:59.360\nWow.\n\n01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:04.360\nHe's the son of my original mentor in Harmontown.\n\n01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:05.360\nWow.\n\n01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:08.360\nWho taught me how to be funny and obviously he failed.\n\n01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:13.360\nHe doesn't make that much money because his job was to make me able to do\n\n01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:18.360\nwhat that one guy did with the Irish joke in Harmontown.\n\n01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:24.360\nWait, Harmontown, everybody sing Harmontown\n\n01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.360\nwhere he is yellow and the poop is brown.\n\n01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.360\nI play guitar on your mama's titties that ground round.\n\n01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:36.360\nI put your mama on a sled in a kite and I flew her in the air and said,\n\n01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:39.360\nI'll take a bite and I think I fit a chip of chocolate\n\n01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:41.360\nbecause she's a cookie.\n\n01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.360\nWhat a bitch.\n\n01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:45.360\nShe's a cookie to me.\n\n01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.360\nI objectify women like that.\n\n01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.360\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:55.360\nI should compensate, tip my hat to all the ladies in the Harmontown.\n\n01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.360\nI put your mama, but I love the ladies in Harmontown.\n\n01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.360\nHorrible, horrible stage.\n\n01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.360\nGood call.\n\n01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.360\nNo, no, it's never going to work out.\n\n01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.360\nUh-oh, just this.\n\n01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.360\nIt's got a stage that's just you reclining on people.\n\n01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360\nIt's gonna work.\n\n01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360\nAll right, okay.\n\n01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.360\nAll right, Daddy needs his medicine.\n\n01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.360\nGo to Joel.\n\n01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.360\nGo to Joel.\n\n01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.360\nJoel.\n\n01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:30.360\nJoel is an usher and he leads people in and he sits in the shadows\n\n01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.360\nand requires no sin.\n\n01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.360\nHe just watches other people take the spotlight but don't deserve it.\n\n01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:39.360\nBut tonight, Joel is the hero.\n\n01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.360\nSay a word.\n\n01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.360\nA word.\n\n01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:46.360\nHe's as free as a bird.\n\n01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.360\nJoel's a white-shirted angel in Pittsburgh.\n\n01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.360\nIt's a city that makes all the cities.\n\n01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:58.360\nAnd I sucked your mama's titties.\n\n01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360\nThank you all for coming to Harmontown tonight.\n\n01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.360\nHarmontown.\n\n01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.360\nI just did this.\n\n01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:05.360\nThank you so much.\n\n01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.360\nI deserve my time.\n\n01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:11.360\nSuspension Clinton.\n\n01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.360\nAnd McCarthy.\n\n01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.360\nI think Jen, the beautiful
