WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, geniuses of Harmontown.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Woo!

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Please, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
I already screwed up the music.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Alright, alright, it's cool.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Take it easy.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Yay!

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Alright, please welcome back guest comptroller Erin McGathy.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Hey guys.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
See, they like you.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
They're okay with you.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Alright, thanks guys.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I feel okay.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Full disclosure, I had two drinks before the show and I feel too drunk for two drinks.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
But I'm fine.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That's unacceptable here.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
We've explained it before, we've run a tight ship.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Just don't let it get us off on too many tangents because we don't like to do that.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
We like to focus.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
What are your guys' favorite drinks?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
The theme of tonight is, I guess we decided on the car because I was trying to explain

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Night Rider to Erin.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
So I thought maybe if we made the theme the 80s and we'll just get some stuff from you guys about the 80s

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
and I'll try to find out what she knows about them.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
I was trying to explain Night Rider to her and I realized it sounds like a pretty sloppy show.

01:35.000 --> 01:43.000
Well, he was a cop that he got, I think he got targeted by the mob so he got killed

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
but they erased him and changed his face and gave him a new name.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Why did they do that?

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, I don't know.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Instead of putting him in the witness protection program, they're like,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I think you could also just keep on being a cop.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, well, they wanted to fight more crime.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Isn't the car talk?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
The car has a spirit in it, right?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
It doesn't have a spirit in it.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
It's just a very sophisticated automobile.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
This was a time in pop culture when computers were very exciting to people and magical.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
It was enough that it was a computer.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That's what made it talk.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
But it had a personality.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah, that of William Daniels from St. Elsewhere.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Erin, let me ask you something.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
What do you know about Alph?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
I saw some episodes of Alph as a child.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I didn't.

02:33.000 --> 02:45.000
I remember that he was kind of like a sexual puppet and he couldn't tell that guy what to do.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
He had a lot of advice.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
He also always stayed on a couch.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
He never got up from the couch.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
But sometimes he got up from the couch.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Stayed behind the couch, probably.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
He's a puppet, right?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
But a lot of times he was on the couch, right?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm just telling you about my memories.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
No, I don't know.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
You saw it more than me.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
I never watched that.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Right.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But he was an alien and a family took him in.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
And boy, did they learn a lot about who they were.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Were there people trying to catch him?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Was there ever a danger?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Because I used to watch My Favorite Martian and More Convenient, there was always a...

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Who was your favorite Martian?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Just kidding.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Sorry, I don't...

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Ray Walston.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I don't remember.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
There's usually like an FBI guy or somebody with a cop or somebody that, boy, oh boy, if we find out, oh god.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Because in addition to being younger than you...

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm sorry, stop everything.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Adam Goldberg is getting fidgety.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I just saw him in the audience.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
He's raising his hand.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
No, that's normal.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Stop the show when he's seizureing.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Adam, I have a pad of paper.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Whenever you have an idea, write it down on the paper.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We'll talk about it.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
The elf was constantly menaced by the government.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
And they still lighted out a cliffhanger where they caught him and they never made part two.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
He fucking wanted to eat a cat.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
That's all.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Right, right.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Cats, you like cats.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yes.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
You're gonna have to call on me.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I'm sorry I have to ask for yours.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
All right.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Let's hear for Adam.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
Here's everything that Adam just said.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
According to Adam, elf was wanted by the government and wanted to eat cats.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Then he said, I'm sorry I have ass burgers.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
Which he insists on pronouncing that way because he has ass burgers.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's like a tick.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I just wanted to say, I feel like this is important.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I am 12 years younger than you.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
Because I'm a Navy kid, when I was a kid, the television, was anyone else a child in

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
the Navy and grew up on Navy bases?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So we watched a channel called AFRTS.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
So you watched like a weird selection of shows.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
So I may have seen elf, but I saw like three episodes of elf.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm sorry.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Because the soldiers aren't allowed to watch current things.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
They might incite them to be non-solideric.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Wait a minute.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Who is the boss?

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Kill the general.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
That car is talking.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I can talk.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Talk my way out of this war.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Who am I fighting?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm disappearing.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
They do the same thing with the juries.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Because they have to sequester them.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
The same thing in all of China.

05:27.000 --> 05:37.000
You have to keep people from looking at Bloomingdale's catalogs if you want to fight a way of life.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Elf, we have to talk.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
That's my impression of elf's dad.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Max Wright.

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
Elf, are you trying to get chased by the government and eat cats?

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
I want to get serious tonight because it's obviously a quiet, either intimidated or bored crowd.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I'm not blaming you guys.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
That's not what I meant.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Please don't ever let me slip into that.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I will never abuse you just because I'm doing a shitty show.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
No.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I don't think they're doing anything wrong.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
No, they're not.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm being nervous.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Let her good cop it.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm not good copping and I'm saying you can blame me.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I wouldn't do that either.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You were talking about anxiety.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
It's not a quiet night at Harmontown.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
It's okay.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
You don't have to be uproarious.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
There's absolutely nothing funny happening or entertaining.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
There's nothing.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
There's no one coming at me with a knife.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
Your heart rate can be down here by sleeping.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
You can be relaxed, like a person in a commercial for a bed.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
It's fine.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
Because ultimately there is no sponsor and there is nothing at stake except your $10,

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
which is now gone.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
But I will give you $10 worth of an experience.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
If I have to slash my wrists up here, you won't react to it.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
You'll cringe and it'll make you sad.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Tonight we are sponsored by humanity.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
That's correct.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Thank you, baby.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You were talking about anxiety.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
I want to talk about my newly found mental disorder.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The fact that I'm losing my fucking mind.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
The fact that I'm falling apart.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
I started doing this diet where you eat.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
It's the four-hour body diet and hold for applause.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
I didn't mean it.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
The four-hour body diet in a nutshell.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
I didn't read the book.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Erin did.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
She imparted it to me.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
You eat beans, meat, and veggies for six days a week.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
Then every cheat day, Saturday, in our case, you eat 18,000 cupcakes, 20 pretzels,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
cars, fire hydrants, whatever you want.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Because you're spiking your blood sugar and then you're...

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Certainly not doing the diet right by supplementing it with quarts of vodka.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
There's all kinds of variables there.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Started doing the diet, lost a bunch of weight.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
Then for you avid podcasties, you know that there was a point where I called an ambulance

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
because I got so light-headed.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I had no idea what was going on.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
I had a sensation that I had never experienced before, which was just vague, light-headedness.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
I didn't faint and there was no pain and my heart wasn't going fast.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
There was nothing other than it was just like cloudy, but it was so persistent and so odd.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I never experienced it before.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
This means I'm dying and I gave it like 45 minutes to an hour to go away,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
thinking, well, in drinking water, maybe it's a thing, a bowl of beans,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
maybe it's blood sugar because of this diet.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
It just keeps going.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I'll lay down.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I don't want to lay down because that's what dead people do.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I lay down and then I get up.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Now I'm even more light-headed.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Okay, call an ambulance.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
The ambulance comes over full of all these Jake Gyllenhaal's and they said,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
you're in fine condition.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I went to the doctor.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
The doctor took my blood.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Blood came back.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
He said, again, as I talked about on the podcast, cholesterol is perfect.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Liver is perfect.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Kidneys are perfect.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Blood sugar is very, very low, but not in a bad way.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Your triglycerides are high, but not in a bad way.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Just a sign of you being on this diet.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm like, okay.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
That didn't show anything.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
They keep having these light-headed spells and I'm like, what the fuck is going on?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And Aaron keeps going, it's probably anxiety.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Probably like, I'm like, that's retarded stuff.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm sorry for the retarded people that just heard me say that.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Like my sister.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
My sister's retarded.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
I get one every podcast because of her and the sacrifices I made growing up with her.

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
The next thing I call retarded will be valuable and capable.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
Then I had this breakthrough during this beach trip with my friends.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm like, somebody said, maybe it's a vitamin D deficiency.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm like, God damn it, that's it.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
They said I had a vitamin D deficiency.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So I go out in the sun and I'm like, I'm like Birdman.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I get power.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
That's what it is.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Of course, I never go out.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I figured it out.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I figured it out.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
And then a half hour later, I'm like, ugh.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
And then I have a root beer and I go, no, it's blood sugar because now I feel great.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I take some potassium.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I eat a banana and I go, no, it's potassium.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
It's potassium.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
And every time I get on the internet and I Google whatever it is I'm doing and I go,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
potassium deficiency.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
And it pulls up the symptoms and I search for light-headedness and I go, okay, there it

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
is.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
I clinched it.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I got it.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And I'm like doing all these experiments on myself, trying to figure this out.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.640
And basically all the experiments result in just further and further panic.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.500
Like I just keep, like, these things don't go away.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.500
So we went to San Diego.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.000
We went to the San Diego Zoo.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm walking around.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
She's in heaven.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
She's always wanted to go there.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
It's a bunch of fucking animals.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.120
I love it too.

11:09.120 --> 11:12.760
But I'm preoccupied by, I just keep having these spells.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.000
I'm like, there it is again.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Okay, I'll drink a Sprite.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
I think it's blood sugar.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm back around to that.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
No.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
And now I feel better.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Okay.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.480
So after I drink a Sprite, my head clears up perfectly, but then that starts not being

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
the case.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.720
Then that science goes out the window.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.880
Now, no matter what I do, maybe I drank too much Sprite.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.000
Maybe I'm hyperglycemic.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.560
I don't know what's happening.

11:33.560 --> 11:37.040
And Erin, who's been saying for weeks, like, it's probably anxiety, so we're standing

11:37.040 --> 11:38.040
in line.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.680
She goes like, let's go on the bucket that takes you over the whole San Diego Zoo and

11:41.680 --> 11:44.040
dangles you from 5,000 feet.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.040
That'll relax you.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.680
And I'm standing in line and it's like, this is probably not a good idea, but I don't want

11:49.680 --> 11:56.680
to be a pussy, because God knows I've done nothing but show her what a man I am so far.

11:56.680 --> 12:03.320
I want to find out now that I am a complete pussy.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.320
So I'm just kind of standing there going, this is not a good idea.

12:05.320 --> 12:10.160
I'm going to be in a bucket dangling over people and we get to the front of the line

12:10.160 --> 12:13.960
and I'm just like still talking about it and like, I just don't get it.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
It's not the Sprite.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
It's not the bananas.

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
It's not the pretzels.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.960
It's not the fire hydrants.

12:17.960 --> 12:18.960
It's not the drafts.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.280
It's like, what the fuck is wrong with me?

12:20.280 --> 12:21.280
What's happening to me?

12:21.280 --> 12:25.080
And earlier that day, I'd been like in tears, there's something wrong with you and you don't

12:25.080 --> 12:26.080
know what it is.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.920
Like I just, I'm spoiled rotten.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.960
Like 20% of you in the audience have something, like some of you have diabetes, some of you

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
have this.

12:32.960 --> 12:38.720
Like there's a guy here that's an aneurysm survivor, he came here tonight in spite of

12:38.720 --> 12:39.720
his symptoms.

12:39.720 --> 12:44.240
He's like, the doctors are giving him horrible news and he's, I'm just going like, oh, why

12:44.240 --> 12:45.240
am I lightheaded?

12:45.240 --> 12:50.600
I can't do it, like crying in hotel rooms and then going to the zoo and going, I think

12:50.600 --> 12:51.720
we need to go home.

12:51.720 --> 12:57.560
We're standing in front of the line at the, at the bucket and Aaron goes, Dan, Dan, you've

12:57.560 --> 13:02.680
eliminated every possibility sooner or later, you have to accept the fact that you're going

13:02.680 --> 13:04.280
to be fine.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.280
It's anxiety.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.280
No, it's not.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
No, it's not.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.280
It's not anxiety.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.280
I don't have anxiety.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.280
I'm at a zoo.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.920
Everything is going fine for me.

13:11.920 --> 13:17.840
No, you've gone, you, you, you've spent the last six months to a year going through enormous

13:17.840 --> 13:23.000
changes that no one, you're the only one that hasn't acknowledged.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.200
You're the only one that hasn't accepted or acknowledged or expressed or felt any of it.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.960
You've acted completely normal while your entire life has completely changed.

13:32.960 --> 13:37.000
And it doesn't matter if you're at a zoo or eating spaghetti or drinking Sprite or dancing

13:37.000 --> 13:41.900
or drinking or drinking water or not drinking water, they, they're coming and going at random

13:41.900 --> 13:42.900
intervals.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.120
You're having panic attacks.

13:45.120 --> 13:51.720
And the way that they go away is when you accept the fact that you're going to be fine.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.760
And I, and I was like, I was just thinking in my head, like, this is fucking bitch keeps

13:54.760 --> 13:55.760
going on.

13:55.760 --> 14:02.240
I, this is just making me panic and I, and I had experimented in the past like looking

14:02.240 --> 14:04.600
in the mirror and going, you're fine.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.920
That's stressful.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.440
That's what Norman Bates does.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.440
You're fine.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
You're fine.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.960
You're in there.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.280
You're going to get out there and take the world by storm.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.680
Get out there, Norman.

14:18.680 --> 14:24.360
But because I was in a line for a bucket that goes over a thing, and I had to just internalize

14:24.360 --> 14:29.280
it really for the first time I said it in my head, okay, I'm going to be fucking fine.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.200
There is nothing left to do.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.200
Either I'm going to die.

14:32.200 --> 14:37.200
Either I have a tumor or I like, like, like, like I'm a ghost or like, like I'm a Twilight

14:37.200 --> 14:42.200
Zone episode, somebody erased me in the past or, or it's, or it's a new form of pretzel

14:42.200 --> 14:44.320
I haven't narrowed down.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.440
I can do nothing about it.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.360
I'm probably going to be fine.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.800
And then my, it vanished.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.000
My head completely cleared up.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.200
I got completely normal, like I am now.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.160
And then we got in the bucket and dangled over the zoo and I was fine.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
It was like even more relaxed.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.160
I was like, whee.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.160
It was a bucket over the zoo.

15:03.160 --> 15:09.200
And I started crying because my girlfriend cured me of my insanity and saved me from

15:09.200 --> 15:11.600
what I thought was something that was killing me.

15:11.600 --> 15:20.480
And it wasn't a funny story, but it was, it was, it, it, it made me like you more.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.960
I hate, I hate inflating her head, but maybe that has something to do with it.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.680
Maybe I'm in a relationship where I'm like, ah, it's, you know, this is it.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.760
And I'm, I don't know.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.760
Maybe that's it.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.280
I'm like writing a CBS sitcom.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.280
Wait, did you say that I am causing your anxiety?

15:35.280 --> 15:41.480
No, no, my, my idea that you're, let me put this in terms that you'll accept.

15:41.480 --> 15:50.880
Maybe you're so awesome that I'm having anxiety attacks that I'm going to, I'm not trying

15:50.880 --> 15:51.880
to stress you out.

15:51.880 --> 15:52.880
I'm just trying to understand.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.680
I would like to, as an experiment, try to cause an anxiety attack because here's the

15:55.680 --> 15:56.680
other thing.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.480
Then I, I, I, I, I, I, then I was fine.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
And then I was fine.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.480
I was like, oh shit, we cured it.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.480
We cured it.

16:02.480 --> 16:07.240
Uh, and then like today I was in this writer's room and I, I, and then I started having one.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.600
And then this time I was like, I just noted on my stopwatch, like, okay, let's see how

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
long these things last.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.600
What's going on?

16:12.600 --> 16:17.240
It lasted a half hour and, uh, and then it went, and then it was gone.

16:17.240 --> 16:22.920
And then right before the show, I went out with you, we went across the street to a pikey

16:22.920 --> 16:26.560
and I had one for like an hour, like a general unease.

16:26.560 --> 16:30.240
They have, they, they have different classes, like the ghost, ghost and ghostbusters.

16:30.240 --> 16:35.360
Like there's, there's the kind that are so small, like waves that I can, they're so small

16:35.360 --> 16:36.680
that I can just jump over them.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.840
I can feel them coming in and then I just go, they're not happening.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.200
And then they go away.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.560
And then there's ones that are so big that, that, uh, me saying they're not happening

16:46.560 --> 16:49.200
and them not going away makes them bigger.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.840
And then, and those are basically the two categories and then they last anywhere from

16:53.840 --> 16:57.240
30 minutes to an hour and a half.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.240
Right.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.920
And, uh, and so now I'm like, and then we have this argument about, well, I shouldn't

17:02.920 --> 17:03.920
be cataloging them.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.280
I'm going to the, I'm going to the doctor tomorrow cause I probably have a fucking

17:07.280 --> 17:09.160
meatball in my brain or something.

17:09.160 --> 17:14.320
There's like a baby skull, like I have a, I have an absorbed twin that's like trying

17:14.320 --> 17:17.640
to get out of my brain and it just keeps moving every once in a while.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.880
Like it kicks and then I have a spell and then it's like stops kicking and then I go,

17:21.880 --> 17:24.120
oh, the sprite worked.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.520
I don't fucking know.

17:25.520 --> 17:26.520
I've tried not drinking.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.520
I've tried not drinking.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.880
You would have mixed emotions if you found out that you had a really special tumor.

17:31.880 --> 17:32.880
I know.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.720
Well, I'm pretty psyched about having anxiety disorder.

17:36.720 --> 17:41.520
Like on the level of Tony Soprano, like I'm like, I am an interesting guy.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.520
I'm kind of into it.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.280
I'm like, oh, do I get to be like Linus?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
Do I get a blanket?

17:45.280 --> 17:50.160
I said, uh, I think that makes me pretty interesting.

17:50.160 --> 17:55.160
Maybe add a little side order, Asperger's, I don't know.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.160
You want it so bad.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.160
And glasses.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.160
Why is my vision 2020?

17:59.160 --> 18:01.160
I want sexy glasses.

18:01.160 --> 18:06.320
Well, like I said, and why is it too hot to wear a cool other jacket?

18:06.320 --> 18:12.520
Like Neil Gaiman, he just dresses like Ford Prefect all day.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.480
So lucky to be from London.

18:15.480 --> 18:20.240
When we went into the Hugo Awards because Neil Gaiman was nominated in the same category

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
when we walked in.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
And you know why?

18:22.240 --> 18:24.720
Because he grew up with the name Gaiman.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
That's why he won.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.200
You're not going to beat a sci-fi guy in a sci-fi contest who grew up with the name Gaiman

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
on the playground.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
Erin, what?

18:32.200 --> 18:33.200
Yeah.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.200
I know.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.200
I know I'm not winning.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.720
Well, Jesus, I was going to ask, I was going to pull another thing.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.720
Oh, yeah.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.720
I'm sorry.

18:40.720 --> 18:48.360
It's like milking a cobra, like if I just go, Erin, so go, I know, I'm sorry, I raped

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
your brother.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
I didn't know.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.360
It's like a tuning fork.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.360
It's so weird.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
I'm sorry.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.800
I don't know why I'm feeling so anxious.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.360
I apologize.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.360
Do what I do.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.360
Blame the audience.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.120
They're mellow tonight.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.240
The audience's job is to sit and absorb.

19:06.240 --> 19:11.080
Their mood is a nuanced, organic thing that no one can predict or control.

19:11.080 --> 19:15.480
They're like a gelatinous mass made of little people-shaped particles that are just like

19:15.480 --> 19:22.000
play-doh or goo, you know, they can't, and the only thing that they respond to is total

19:22.000 --> 19:26.440
like kind of balance between acknowledging them and ignoring them.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
Right.

19:27.440 --> 19:33.920
Like a guy who spins plates has to like spin his plates and he has to, if he pretended that

19:33.920 --> 19:37.440
the audience wasn't there, he'd be a shitty plate spinner, but also if he kept asking

19:37.440 --> 19:40.800
them which plate to spin, all the plates would crash to the floor.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.960
And so they sit there like this ooze and then the performer kind of wades into the ooze

19:45.960 --> 19:51.160
and the air conditioning and the whatever's happened on the evening news and whatever

19:51.160 --> 19:55.560
collection of sandwiches they've all been eating, like they all add up to some random

19:55.560 --> 19:57.520
number and we just accept it.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.480
Guys, I just want to ooze with you.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.600
Just ooze together.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.680
Ooze is like dark and heavy, like gravy.

20:05.680 --> 20:11.280
Just like want to take a nap after Thanksgiving, just hang out, watch a football game, whizz

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
it around.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.800
This isn't me blaming you, but I think all of our talk about anxiety made me feel very

20:15.800 --> 20:16.800
anxious.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.800
Yeah, that's what you always say.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.840
I don't know what to do with that.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.840
That makes me more anxious.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.720
No, no, don't feel anxious, don't feel anxious.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.720
Let's forget it.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
Hey!

20:27.720 --> 20:30.640
Forget that I'm having anxiety attacks.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.760
Forget that me talking about them gives air and anxiety attacks.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.960
Everyone please forget that you affect us.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.320
Forget you're watching a show.

20:40.320 --> 20:47.440
Get up in an orderly fashion, go to your cars and forget that you came here.

20:47.440 --> 20:51.760
I didn't want to say really quick about anxiety attacks, that just because you identified it

20:51.760 --> 20:54.440
doesn't mean that it's going to end.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.440
It also doesn't mean that I don't have cancer.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.000
Like the symptoms could still be the same.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.120
I'm going to go back into the doctor and I'll go seriously, you can't just take some blood

21:04.120 --> 21:07.200
out of a guy's arm and tell him he's fine.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.200
Something's happening to me.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.080
I don't want to think that you have cancer.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.320
No, you're not dying.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.760
Erin, I'm dying.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.440
You are in love with a dying man.

21:16.440 --> 21:23.120
It's just like how I love my mom before she died of cancer.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.920
Maybe I want that kind of love.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.360
Maybe I'm sick of hearing about this woman.

21:28.360 --> 21:38.080
I gave you so much, why don't you marry her or let go of her and marry me?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.640
You were going to go to the bucket?

21:39.640 --> 21:45.680
I don't know what I was doing, hey, Max Headroom, what do you think?

21:45.680 --> 21:51.920
We went to my 10-year high school reunion this last weekend and Dan was a hit.

21:51.920 --> 21:56.560
He started the whole, like he started everyone dancing, like he just decided that he would

21:56.560 --> 22:02.080
start dancing and the band geeks from my class came up to me and were telling me that they

22:02.080 --> 22:06.920
all knew who Dan was and how, they were telling me how cool it was, all the, all the band

22:06.920 --> 22:08.920
could have predicted that.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.560
Well, that was his reaction.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.560
I thought it was really cool.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.560
I was like, Dan, they know who you are.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.720
I was like, yeah, pretty much.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.960
And I know who they are.

22:17.960 --> 22:25.440
Their names are bread and butter and I have known them for my entire 20-year career.

22:25.440 --> 22:30.800
And I am peaking right now, I knew that your high school class would have like five guys

22:30.800 --> 22:36.960
in it who played tuba or, or a track team too, like I, you know, I knew, I knew there'd

22:36.960 --> 22:41.720
be a couple guys who would like slip up to me at the urinal and go, hey man, good job.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.720
I go like, hey, thank you.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.720
Did you have people slip up to you at the urinal?

22:45.720 --> 22:46.720
Good job going to high school with my girlfriend.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.720
You had guys slip up to you at the urinal?

22:49.720 --> 22:50.720
No.

22:50.720 --> 23:04.400
And I spent, I spent like an hour there because of my prostate and my desperation.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.640
I was, I, I tried to take Aaron through all of the Friday the 13th movies.

23:08.640 --> 23:13.600
I just, what I like about trying to explain 80s things to Aaron is, is for the first time

23:13.600 --> 23:18.680
in my life having to explain them and realizing how dumb they are and like how confusing like

23:18.680 --> 23:24.880
I was trying to like, like go from Friday the 13th part one all the way to, to the end

23:24.880 --> 23:28.920
even though they stopped numbering them and started rebooting and, and all this stuff

23:28.920 --> 23:30.920
and it got very convoluted.

23:30.920 --> 23:36.520
Same with Knight Rider, same with Phil Collins, all of my, my, my whole life becomes a, just

23:36.520 --> 23:40.800
becomes rubble in the eyes of my 27 year old girlfriend.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.800
No.

23:41.800 --> 23:46.320
Well, you, you like dumb shit too.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.440
I don't care about no neutral milk hotel.

23:49.440 --> 23:53.120
I don't know why is there, why is there a hotel neutral?

23:53.120 --> 23:55.480
Sounds, answer that.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
Stupid.

23:56.480 --> 24:01.480
Can we talk about the fact that you don't know how Smurfs talk, which I found out.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.600
I know how Smurfs talk.

24:02.600 --> 24:07.800
I called Aaron a Smurf for, I can't even remember for what reason we were in a hotel room, but

24:07.800 --> 24:11.440
I wrote this down because I can't remember why I called her a Smurf.

24:11.440 --> 24:15.160
I was like, well, she was brushing her teeth and she was like, come on, let's go.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.800
I was like, yeah, you sound like a Smurf.

24:16.800 --> 24:21.800
It was just, it was just a riff, but then her response was, she said, well, stop being

24:21.800 --> 24:26.520
Smurf lazy and Smurf brush your teeth.

24:26.520 --> 24:31.520
That's not.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.440
I can't believe you don't know how Smurfs talk.

24:34.440 --> 24:39.840
Smurfs, all their adjectives, all their adjectives, all their adjectives are Smurf.

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
Okay.

24:40.840 --> 24:41.840
So tell me.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.240
So you say I'm going to go park the car in Smurf ease.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.240
Okay.

24:46.240 --> 24:50.520
I'm going to go Smurf park my Smurf car.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.520
Amazing.

24:51.520 --> 24:55.200
You're wrong.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.600
I'm going to go Smurf my Smurf.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
Oh.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.600
Yeah.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
Well, that's stupid.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.600
Yeah.

25:02.600 --> 25:08.320
Well, they're Smurfs, they're fucking idiots and they're all dead now.

25:08.320 --> 25:12.000
You don't even, it's not an adjective, it's a noun.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
You can't tell what the fuck they're talking about.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
That's the whole point of Smurfs.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.440
They make no Smurf when they talk.

25:20.440 --> 25:26.360
They lean, they ask the question, how strong is context?

25:26.360 --> 25:29.880
And they go over the line to the point where they're like, what are you talking about?

25:29.880 --> 25:33.000
Honey, the boss gave me a Smurf today.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.680
No, fuck you or let's get married.

25:36.680 --> 25:40.280
Depending on what I find out later, Smurf is.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.280
Yes, exactly.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
That's the whole thing.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.480
I'm going to go Smurf brush your Smurf teeth.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.480
So adorable.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.760
I can't believe that's the extent of my power.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.360
That's what 12 years buys me.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.960
I'm lording that over here.

25:53.960 --> 25:59.280
You'd think I'd have bigger arms or something or, I don't know, 12 years, like I should

25:59.280 --> 26:03.880
have a unicorn or something instead of just some trivial knowledge about Smurfs.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.480
I don't know, I wonder, I have anxiety attacks.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.680
I'm feeling better.

26:08.680 --> 26:09.680
Okay.

26:09.680 --> 26:13.880
Well, let's change that by playing Dungeons and Dragons.

26:13.880 --> 26:24.320
All right, Spencer, you want to take your position at the Dungeon Master table.

26:24.320 --> 26:27.520
So for those of you who have never been here before and never listened before, a couple

26:27.520 --> 26:31.160
weeks ago, we started playing Dungeons and Dragons on this podcast.

26:31.160 --> 26:37.280
I've since then learned that there are several podcasts that play Dungeons and Dragons, and

26:37.280 --> 26:41.760
that Brian Posein just launched one where that's all he's going to do.

26:41.760 --> 26:45.600
And I'm not going to let that stop me.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.920
I don't think you guys are having a terrible time.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.320
You guys all seem very nice.

26:49.320 --> 26:54.520
Can we give it up for Spencer, who's really wonderful.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.520
Thank you.

26:55.520 --> 27:05.800
And also, can you give it up for yourselves, we're going to a live show, that's exciting.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.560
That counts as an accomplishment these days.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.720
That's the new thing.

27:10.720 --> 27:15.160
We were at the San Diego Zoo, and we came up with an idea that I thought was pretty cool,

27:15.160 --> 27:17.640
because I heard a baby crying, and you're walking around, you're so used to looking

27:17.640 --> 27:21.960
at animals, and you're seeing these signs with animals on them, and then I heard a

27:21.960 --> 27:25.680
baby crying, and I couldn't tell where it was coming from, and I was like, that'd be

27:25.680 --> 27:28.840
weird if you walked around the corner, and there was a cage, and it was just a baby.

27:28.840 --> 27:38.080
And there's just a baby in there, and then I realized, baby zoo, like ingenious, because

27:38.080 --> 27:43.760
practically no overhead, because we're overpopulated, and they're everywhere.

27:43.760 --> 27:48.680
But people like them, they like looking at them, women love them, and the cages are

27:48.680 --> 27:57.360
cheap, because they can't go anywhere, and then when they get old enough that they're

27:57.360 --> 28:03.360
not fun to look at for women, you send them to an idiot zoo, because they haven't learned

28:03.360 --> 28:10.200
to do anything, because they've just been babies in a zoo, and guys would love that.

28:10.200 --> 28:16.720
That's when you get the men money, because it's like three stooges, you just go through,

28:16.720 --> 28:21.000
and going through cage after cage of guys that were raised in captivity with no exposure

28:21.000 --> 28:26.120
to any alphabet or math, and they're just eating bricks, and guys would be high-fiving

28:26.120 --> 28:30.240
each other.

28:30.240 --> 28:35.000
People call me crazy, but I know how to save the economy.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Baby zoo.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.600
Or if you don't have money for idiot zoo, you get a giant take of water, and you drop

28:39.600 --> 28:46.920
all the babies in the water, and then you flash-freeze it, and you look crazy.

28:46.920 --> 28:54.560
They'd all be in different positions, and they're soft-faced, and then you slice it

28:54.560 --> 29:02.600
into different sections, and you'd ship it off to different places, like New York, and

29:02.600 --> 29:06.600
my parents would pay for it, if I'm Eli Roth.

29:06.600 --> 29:12.880
Geez, I'm talking about a beautiful baby rolling around in some grass, or whatever

29:12.880 --> 29:13.880
baby's like.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.880
Me too, man.

29:14.880 --> 29:20.640
You burn them, you use the fertilizer for a field, and you take people on a tour through

29:20.640 --> 29:26.000
the field, but you use baby's breath and stuff, and everyone's like, haha, I got it.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.240
All right, I got it.

29:28.240 --> 29:31.240
Or hats.

29:31.240 --> 29:35.640
Erin Anastasia McGathey, how dare you.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.640
Baby zoo.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.640
Baby zoo.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.640
Don't look it up.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
There won't be anything.

29:39.640 --> 29:43.640
No, there may be something, and you might get in a lot of trouble for it, so don't look

29:43.640 --> 29:44.640
up anything.

29:44.640 --> 29:50.200
There was another thing I thought I wanted to talk about.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.920
You also had puppy zoo, and cooties.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.920
Puppy zoo.

29:54.920 --> 29:59.680
But there's always that moment in the zoo where you, like any zoo you go to, you're

29:59.680 --> 30:05.840
looking at a Bengal tiger, or a marmoset, or a taper, and then there's like a raccoon.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.840
And you can't figure out whether you're supposed to feel bad for it or good for it.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.920
Like, I remember taking a pee at the San Diego Zoo, and there was a spider on top of the

30:13.920 --> 30:19.440
urinal, and I came out, and I said, hey, Erin, there was a spider on the urinal, and I bet

30:19.440 --> 30:23.120
he was trying to say to me like, hey, how do I get in on this?

30:23.120 --> 30:29.640
And Erin laughed, but ironically, and said, that is such a dad joke.

30:29.640 --> 30:35.480
Not to throw her into the bus, but just saying, maybe there should be a bad girlfriend zoo.

30:35.480 --> 30:36.480
Unsupportive.

30:36.480 --> 30:43.280
That raccoon is right after the polar bear exhibit, so there's this beautiful thing called

30:43.280 --> 30:47.640
the polar bear plunge, and you're seeing them underwater, and like on the ice, and they're

30:47.640 --> 30:53.120
tearing apart things, and they're having meetings in front of you, it's amazing.

30:53.120 --> 30:57.600
And then there's a raccoon right next to it, and you can't see him, he's hiding, of course

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
he's hiding.

30:58.600 --> 31:04.000
And he's like, yeah, I could be right outside the cage, and I would do nothing different,

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
fuck you guys.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.800
I'm cool hand-luking this, and I will be inside if you need me.

31:08.800 --> 31:14.720
Speaking of people zoos, I'm sorry, Spencer, have you ever worked at a haunted house?

31:14.720 --> 31:17.120
Oh, are you talking to me?

31:17.120 --> 31:21.520
You said, I'm sorry, Spencer, have you ever worked at a haunted house, so I thought you

31:21.520 --> 31:22.520
were insulting me.

31:22.520 --> 31:26.920
I'm sorry, Spencer, but you just look like you're really creepy.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.920
I'm sorry, Spencer, but should you be being paid to scare people right now for the March

31:30.920 --> 31:31.920
of Dimes?

31:31.920 --> 31:35.720
Has anyone ever volunteered or worked at a haunted house here?

31:35.720 --> 31:36.720
Clap your hands.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.720
Yeah.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.360
It's kind of like being at a zoo.

31:39.360 --> 31:45.360
You sit in one little station, and all day long you do one thing, like jump out of a coffin

31:45.360 --> 31:49.240
or be afraid by a hanger, or...

31:49.240 --> 31:52.560
Yeah, afraid by a hanger.

31:52.560 --> 31:57.200
I would say that's the mommy dearest exhibit, but there's no 40-year-olds here that would

31:57.200 --> 31:59.280
laugh at it.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.280
The...

32:00.280 --> 32:01.520
Goddamn it.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.320
Stop being smurf-lazy and smurf brush your teeth.

32:05.320 --> 32:06.720
I just kept seeing that.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.000
Sorry, I got my little file.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.520
And then one last thing.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.680
This is the last thing.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.040
After this, we're off-roading.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.040
Okay.

32:16.040 --> 32:21.320
Until now, it's been a Ruby on Rails.

32:21.320 --> 32:26.800
I was just having drinks with Erin before the show, and at Pikey, across the street.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
Thanks, guys.

32:27.800 --> 32:34.440
And we split a little burger patty because of our stupid diet, and then they brought

32:34.440 --> 32:39.240
the check and they put two little meringues on it, which we can't eat, but Erin took

32:39.240 --> 32:43.800
the meringues and put them in her purse and said, I'm hiding these because I don't want

32:43.800 --> 32:44.800
to hurt her feelings.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.800
That's it.

32:45.800 --> 32:49.360
I wrote it down.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.800
Like the waitress has a relationship with the meringues.

32:52.800 --> 32:57.040
When I was eight, I went to dinner with my mom and her childhood best friend, and her

32:57.040 --> 33:01.520
childhood best friend made steak and put it down on the table, and I took a bite of it

33:01.520 --> 33:04.240
and I said to my mom, this tastes like rubber.

33:04.240 --> 33:07.760
And my mom took it and threw it in her purse, and she was like, shut up.

33:07.760 --> 33:13.280
And I sat there, and her best friend Denise came back in the room and she was like, whoa,

33:13.280 --> 33:14.280
big appetite.

33:14.280 --> 33:20.800
And I was like, big appetite, and I was like, big appetite.

33:20.800 --> 33:25.560
And my mom had to throw away her purse, like she had meat in her purse.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.560
RIP.

33:26.560 --> 33:31.440
I'm pulling you to the chair, like Bill Cosby, because it's so fucking low-key tonight.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.480
Let's talk about a trip to the dentist for 45 minutes.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.480
I don't care.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.480
No, because we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and I'm going to nail it tonight.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.480
Am I playing Jeff's character?

33:39.480 --> 33:40.480
I guess we should just transition.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.480
I have a little surprise for you.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.480
Okay.

33:44.480 --> 33:50.480
You just sit tight and let me play Dungeons and Dragons by myself.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.480
Surprise!

33:51.480 --> 33:56.880
Do I need my character sheet?

33:56.880 --> 33:58.880
Spencer, how are you tonight?

33:58.880 --> 34:01.400
I'm doing pretty good, are you?

34:01.400 --> 34:03.400
I'm good.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.400
Good.

34:04.400 --> 34:08.880
This is engaging podcast talk.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.880
Thank you, Sarkasmos.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.880
All right, Spencer, you look very healthy.

34:13.880 --> 34:14.880
What?

34:14.880 --> 34:15.880
That's so funny.

34:15.880 --> 34:20.880
That's the first time that that's ever been said to me.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.880
You look spry, or your cheeks are rosy.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.880
You look healthy.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.880
Oh, okay.

34:25.880 --> 34:29.880
I'm sorry, I'm possessed by a dying Jewish woman, I guess.

34:29.880 --> 34:30.880
I'm sorry.

34:30.880 --> 34:31.880
Well, thank you.

34:31.880 --> 34:32.880
All right.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.400
To recap as quickly as possible, I am Sharpie Buttsalot.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.960
I am a first level wizard.

34:38.960 --> 34:47.000
I have recently become friends with my previous rival, Quark, played by Jeff Davis.

34:47.000 --> 34:58.160
We fought a giant piggy bank and beat it, and then we got some treasure, and now I refuse

34:58.160 --> 35:02.320
just because Jeff's not here to not play the game, so, Spencer, tell me where I am

35:02.320 --> 35:03.320
and what's going on.

35:03.320 --> 35:07.320
Well, you're still in the cave, and after putting most of your treasure away, you notice

35:07.320 --> 35:10.840
a strange wooden box.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.320
For the podcast listeners, I have this physical box.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.320
Come and take it, please.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.320
Oh, my God.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.320
Wow.

35:16.320 --> 35:23.320
This wooden box is stained purple with engraved stars and celestial bodies on its surface.

35:23.320 --> 35:27.320
Oh, my God, Spencer's proposing to Dan.

35:27.320 --> 35:33.320
Oh, my God.

35:33.320 --> 35:38.320
You know, Dan, it's been great on this podcast in the past few weeks.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.320
I hope this campaign never ends.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.320
I know we took it to the next level in our relationship last week with that hug.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.320
It meant a lot to me.

35:48.320 --> 35:52.320
Will you please level up with me forever and become immortal?

35:52.320 --> 35:54.320
All right.

35:54.320 --> 35:59.320
Well, wait, so if I open it in real life, Spencer handed me a real box.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.320
This is a little weird.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.320
Sharpie Buttsalot found in his treasure.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.320
So if I open it in real life, I'm opening it in the game, right?

36:07.320 --> 36:10.320
Yeah, and if you open it in real life and it's a trap, you're going to die.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.320
Oh, my God.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.320
Someone tape it.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.320
All right.

36:14.320 --> 36:20.320
Well, I'm not going to open it because I don't know if you know this about my character,

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
but I'm a pussy.

36:21.320 --> 36:26.320
I have a lot of anxiety.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.320
What happens if I cast Detect Magic on it?

36:29.320 --> 36:33.320
You detect a small trace of unearthly magic coming from inside the box,

36:33.320 --> 36:35.320
but the box itself does not seem magical.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.320
All right.

36:36.320 --> 36:45.320
I examine it as much as I can for any kind of mechanisms like strings that lead to guns that are pointing at my face.

36:45.320 --> 36:51.320
You look it over thoroughly and find that it doesn't appear to be trapped or mechanized in any way.

36:51.320 --> 36:54.320
I very carefully open the box.

36:54.320 --> 36:58.320
Opening the box very carefully, you see a small stone inside.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.320
I do.

36:59.320 --> 37:02.320
In real life, I do, too.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.320
That's the beauty of it.

37:04.320 --> 37:08.320
Oh, well, I touched the stone in real life, but I'm not doing that in the game.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.320
You can.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.320
I mean, it's not going to kill you.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.320
Oh, all right.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.320
Maybe I just gave you a clue.

37:13.320 --> 37:15.320
Spencer, I'm right here.

37:15.320 --> 37:19.320
Right here.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.320
What?

37:20.320 --> 37:23.320
Side lay a small, iridescent stone.

37:23.320 --> 37:29.320
Its surface shines in many colors and shape is confusing, full of squared spirals and tiny ridges.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.320
Yes.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.320
Kind of like your relationship.

37:32.320 --> 37:42.320
This is all an integrated marketing campaign for Spencer's girlfriend who owns a surf shop where she makes shitty jewelry.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.320
That's beads on Pacific Avenue.

37:45.320 --> 37:52.320
You find yourself enamored with this unique design, which can be ordered online.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
It's called a quiggle.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.320
It's supposed to bring you luck in finance.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.320
Sorry.

37:57.320 --> 38:04.320
Grasping the stone in your hand, you feel its surface warm up and your surroundings fade to white, and you lose consciousness.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.320
What?

38:05.320 --> 38:07.320
The next thing you know, you're outside the trove again.

38:07.320 --> 38:10.320
The stone glows brightly than fades to dimness.

38:10.320 --> 38:14.320
This must be the fragment of greatness that Derevon sent to you.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.320
Oh, that's right.

38:15.320 --> 38:22.320
The scrier who sent me and my friend of Quirk to the trove said that there was a fragment of greatness.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.320
Did you say I teleported?

38:24.320 --> 38:25.320
Yeah.

38:25.320 --> 38:29.320
You lost consciousness, and when you came to, you were outside the trove.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.320
And it wasn't anxiety.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.320
It might have been.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.320
All right.

38:33.320 --> 38:35.320
But I teleported, so that doesn't happen.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
Sharpie has his demons.

38:36.320 --> 38:41.320
All right, well, then I'm done with that trove, so I'm going back to town.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.320
All right.

38:42.320 --> 38:48.320
The road back to Thornvale is wrong, well, is long, but you are confident after finding the fragment of greatness.

38:48.320 --> 38:54.320
You see the familiar green rows of fields surrounding Thornvale, and it fills you with a sense of comfort and calm.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.320
That's true.

38:55.320 --> 38:59.320
On your left, you see a stables, and just pass it, the local tavern.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.320
Now, I didn't come up with a tavern name.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.320
I thought the audience might want to name the tavern, maybe.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.320
All right.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.320
What's your name, sir?

39:05.320 --> 39:06.320
David.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.320
Uh, uh, what?

39:08.320 --> 39:09.320
Madlib style.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.320
Do you want to name a tavern?

39:11.320 --> 39:12.320
Uh, sure.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.320
Take your time.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.320
I'm going to make a drink, and we can edit out the pause.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.320
So just take your time.

39:17.320 --> 39:24.320
You're not under any pressure to be as magnificently witty and quick as I have been tonight.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
You can take...

39:26.320 --> 39:30.320
Just listen to this music, and think of a tavern name.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.320
Erin, you can talk about pantyhose or something, will you?

39:33.320 --> 39:43.320
Pantyhose, for times when you feel like your legs are a little too pale, or for when you

39:43.320 --> 39:50.320
are dating someone who says that he likes pantyhose.

39:50.320 --> 39:56.320
Pantyhose, for ladies who want to feel like Sigourney Weaver in the 80s.

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
But have varicose veins.

39:58.320 --> 40:04.320
Okay, pantyhose, for when you have a meeting in the morning and a burglary at night.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.320
Pantyhose.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.320
Thanks.

40:06.320 --> 40:17.320
For the record, I wore tights and pantyhose before we dated.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.320
I know.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.320
That's important to me.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.320
I know.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
Yeah.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.320
I know you know.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.320
This isn't awkward at all.

40:24.320 --> 40:29.320
Yeah, what do you think I like to?

40:29.320 --> 40:31.320
Because of your personality.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.320
My hands of your brain.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.320
Alright.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
I love you.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.320
I love you too.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.320
Thank you for taking my anxiety attack away at the San Diego Zoo.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.320
Well, I care about you.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.320
I want you to feel better.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.320
What was your name again?

40:48.320 --> 40:49.320
David.

40:49.320 --> 40:53.320
Alright, David, what's the tavern name?

40:53.320 --> 40:55.320
Chacha's Tavern.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.320
Chacha's Tavern, alright.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.320
I think that's in Silver Lake, isn't it?

40:59.320 --> 41:02.320
It's not a tavern in Silver Lake, it's a bar.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.320
Chacha's Tavern.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
Chacha's Tavern.

41:06.320 --> 41:09.320
The tavern is a welcoming place.

41:09.320 --> 41:14.320
It has a large lounge with polished tables and a puffy chairs and a long bar.

41:14.320 --> 41:17.320
Several humans, gnomes, elves and halflings are mingling.

41:17.320 --> 41:22.320
And a gnome is standing on the counter pouring steins of beer from a large keg.

41:22.320 --> 41:25.320
I assume that Quark and I kind of...

41:25.320 --> 41:28.320
Quark's a bit tired after his rage.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.320
He's not saying much.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.320
He's kind of...

41:30.320 --> 41:31.320
Oh, is he with me?

41:31.320 --> 41:32.320
Yeah, he's just hanging out.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.320
Oh, okay.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.320
Hey, Quark.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.320
He's doing a show in Chicago, right?

41:35.320 --> 41:37.320
Well, why don't we get our...

41:37.320 --> 41:41.320
I'm going to talk to the tavern keep about getting a room.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.320
Do they have rooms to let at this tavern?

41:43.320 --> 41:46.320
Yeah, this tavern has an upper floor with some rooms.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.320
Alright.

41:47.320 --> 41:48.320
Alright.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.320
So you head up to the tavern keeper.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.320
Yeah.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.320
He's this gnome standing on the counter.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.320
His name is Chacha.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.320
Alright.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.320
He's the bartender and the keeper of the tavern.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.320
He's a white-haired gnome with thin beard and he says...

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
He sees you coming up and he's like,

42:04.320 --> 42:06.320
What'll you drink?

42:06.320 --> 42:09.320
I'll have a flagon of ale.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.320
A flagon of ale?

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
That'll be three copper.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.320
Oh, alright.

42:13.320 --> 42:16.320
What a bargain at twice the price, me thinks.

42:16.320 --> 42:23.320
What say you for two rooms, a tuppence or a shilling for Wayne's cutting?

42:23.320 --> 42:28.320
I could part with two rooms for only three silvers.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.320
Alright.

42:29.320 --> 42:32.320
Here, I assume I have three silvers.

42:32.320 --> 42:35.320
Actually, you only got gold pieces from the treasure.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.320
You don't even...

42:36.320 --> 42:38.320
I'm so sorry.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.320
Accident.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
They hate gold.

42:42.320 --> 42:47.320
I'm very sorry.

42:47.320 --> 42:49.320
There's an accident.

42:49.320 --> 42:54.320
Erin just put her elbow on her soundboard iPad app.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.320
I thought it was a boing.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.320
It doesn't make as much noise.

43:00.320 --> 43:03.320
No, I thought that was a hooray.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.320
Sorry.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.320
It's mixed pretty high.

43:06.320 --> 43:13.320
All right.

43:13.320 --> 43:14.320
Here's a gold piece.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.320
Keep the change.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.320
Oh, wow.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.320
A high rule.

43:18.320 --> 43:22.320
Are you an adventurer?

43:22.320 --> 43:23.320
Yes.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.320
And I'm new to Maine.

43:25.320 --> 43:30.320
I've never been in the lighthouse district.

43:30.320 --> 43:31.320
Yes.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.320
I'm an adventurer.

43:32.320 --> 43:36.320
And I'd like to make sure our rooms are particularly safe.

43:36.320 --> 43:40.320
So keep the change in exchange for your constant vigilance.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.320
Much obliged, sir.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.320
But have you seen this?

43:43.320 --> 43:45.320
Emotions to a poster on the wall.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.320
It's a wanted poster.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.320
It says, Wanted the Embermaller.

43:50.320 --> 43:54.320
There's a picture that looks like a lion with a flaming mane

43:54.320 --> 43:58.320
and some two tails it's made with pastel crayons.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.320
There you go.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.320
That's good.

44:01.320 --> 44:04.320
The charred dismembered corpses of cats, dogs,

44:04.320 --> 44:07.320
and most recently a thorn veil mare have been found

44:07.320 --> 44:11.320
and reports of a black burnt crops have been made in the fields.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.320
Thirty silver pieces for any information on this beast

44:14.320 --> 44:18.320
or fourteen hundred gold pieces for its head.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.320
Interesting.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.320
Thanks for the tip.

44:20.320 --> 44:24.320
As you read the sign, you notice someone seems to be staring at you

44:24.320 --> 44:27.320
and seeing you look at the sign.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.320
Am I noticing them peripherally?

44:29.320 --> 44:32.320
You just feel the sense of being watched.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.320
I look at them.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.320
You see a tall, thin, is it an elf?

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
No, it's a half elf.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.320
Loved by all.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.320
Loved by all.

44:43.320 --> 44:49.320
Standing with a bow and a sheath sword in the corner of the room.

44:49.320 --> 44:54.320
He seems to be interested in your looking at the poster.

44:54.320 --> 44:59.320
All right, so for the podcast listeners, this is Erin's character.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.320
Thank you.

45:02.320 --> 45:03.320
Thank you.

45:03.320 --> 45:04.320
Thank you.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.320
I have a sheet.

45:06.320 --> 45:07.320
Thank you.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.320
How could this go wrong?

45:09.320 --> 45:12.320
Good morrow, sir Batsalot.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.320
Batsalot.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.320
Sharpie.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.320
You know my name.

45:16.320 --> 45:21.320
I have heard of you.

45:21.320 --> 45:24.320
You have me at a disadvantage, Mr.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.320
Sedana.

45:26.320 --> 45:30.320
Morrain.

45:30.320 --> 45:36.320
May I bow to you?

45:36.320 --> 45:40.320
I can't stop you?

45:40.320 --> 45:47.320
Well, regard me bowing for it is a great honor to witness the bow of an elf human.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.320
Bow.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
I'm also a ranger.

45:50.320 --> 45:54.320
Your bow is so loud.

45:54.320 --> 46:01.320
I will I have put on my loud robes today.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.320
Tell me what you know of this lion.

46:03.320 --> 46:08.320
I know that I just started looking at it on a sign.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.320
And that then you started staring at me.

46:11.320 --> 46:15.320
And that now you say you know me and are bowing loudly.

46:15.320 --> 46:20.320
You and I are on the same page now across the board, we're all caught up.

46:20.320 --> 46:24.320
Well, I could sense your energy across the room, dear sir.

46:24.320 --> 46:37.320
I feel like you and I shall be friends forever and I shall be involved in every adventure that you have from here on out.

46:37.320 --> 46:40.320
Interesting.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.320
Well, regard my bow.

46:43.320 --> 46:51.320
It's so cloying and invasive, like its owner.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.320
May I join your team?

46:53.320 --> 46:54.320
What's up?

46:54.320 --> 46:55.320
May I join your team?

46:55.320 --> 46:59.320
I recognize that you and your lover are on a long journey.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.320
All right, hold on a second.

47:01.320 --> 47:04.320
I just want to stop you there.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.320
He's a very good friend of mine.

47:06.320 --> 47:08.320
We met in the howling mines.

47:08.320 --> 47:12.320
It seems that his face is at dick height, yes?

47:12.320 --> 47:21.320
I don't wish to be disrespectful, sir.

47:21.320 --> 47:23.320
Only understanding.

47:23.320 --> 47:27.320
Can I inquire as to your specialties, what you're bringing to the table?

47:27.320 --> 47:29.320
Should we go on an adventure together?

47:29.320 --> 47:33.320
For now, I shall let you know one of one of my special abilities.

47:33.320 --> 47:39.320
For I am full of mystery and that makes people like me more.

47:39.320 --> 47:43.320
I am immune to sleep.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.320
Let us adventure.

47:45.320 --> 47:47.320
Do you like cookies?

47:47.320 --> 47:49.320
I also have cookies.

47:49.320 --> 47:53.320
You got cookies, yeah.

47:53.320 --> 47:58.320
Yeah, I like the cut of your jib.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.320
Thank you, sir.

48:00.320 --> 48:05.320
I think that I just have to make sure that you're not going to murder us in our sleep.

48:05.320 --> 48:07.320
Oh, of course not, sir.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.320
I've never been known to murder.

48:09.320 --> 48:12.320
In fact, I'm kneeling.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.320
I'm taking my hand and I'm crossing it across my chest.

48:15.320 --> 48:26.320
Sir, all of the sedanas have been onerous since the beginning.

48:26.320 --> 48:35.320
We existed with the dinosaurs and the fungi and the rocks and the storms.

48:35.320 --> 48:45.320
I've always been here bringing goodness to the world and no harm has been inflicted on part by part.

48:45.320 --> 48:50.320
We haven't done anything wrong.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.320
I accept your oath.

48:52.320 --> 48:57.320
I grew up in a family without honor and I appreciate people who have it.

48:57.320 --> 49:07.320
I've always dreamed of being part of a family that had some kind of tether to the realm of good things.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.320
We'll speak no more!

49:09.320 --> 49:10.320
Adventure!

49:10.320 --> 49:18.320
Yes, let's bound out of the tavern and into adventure while my gnome friend sleeps.

49:18.320 --> 49:23.320
If you would like to be alone with your sleeping gnome friend, I understand.

49:23.320 --> 49:28.320
Listen, man, you got the wrong idea about that.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.320
Like, I barely know the guy.

49:30.320 --> 49:33.320
We go on adventures together, okay?

49:33.320 --> 49:38.320
And I'm not saying there'd be anything wrong with it if we were partners in that sense.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320
I'm just saying it's not the way it is.

49:40.320 --> 49:43.320
You got the wrong idea, man.

49:43.320 --> 49:48.320
As the earth is unashamed of his rivers,

49:48.320 --> 49:53.320
honesty is like water, let your water flow and be happy.

49:53.320 --> 49:56.320
Adventure!

49:56.320 --> 50:02.320
Alright, well, I feel like an adventure would take too long at this point.

50:02.320 --> 50:08.320
I've come a long way and we need to sleep.

50:08.320 --> 50:17.320
Fine, well, I am immune to sleep, so enjoy your sleep, I shall dance and plan and dream and sing.

50:17.320 --> 50:21.320
Are you staying here in the tavern?

50:21.320 --> 50:24.320
Yes, I am not leaving you.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.320
Ever.

50:26.320 --> 50:30.320
I am part of this.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.320
Haha!

50:31.320 --> 50:39.320
I should go up to Quark's room and ask him if he's willing to have a Solomon Goldberg?

50:39.320 --> 50:41.320
What's your name?

50:41.320 --> 50:43.320
Quite alright.

50:43.320 --> 50:45.320
Lorraine Sedona.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
I got the stairs to Quark's room.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.320
You open the door.

50:49.320 --> 50:53.320
Quark is trying to get to sleep, but he hasn't quite got to sleep.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.320
He seems kind of bothered.

50:55.320 --> 50:58.320
I nudge him gently.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.320
What?

51:00.320 --> 51:10.320
Quark, this is Solana Gomez.

51:10.320 --> 51:17.320
Do you want to get the quick verification that she will be involved permanently in all her adventures forever?

51:17.320 --> 51:19.320
Well, does she have a bow?

51:19.320 --> 51:27.320
Do I have a bow? Does the earth have dirt? Do the oceans have water? Yes, I have a bow! Adventure!

51:27.320 --> 51:29.320
Well, you guys let me sleep.

51:29.320 --> 51:36.320
Yes, I know that you're metaphorically out of town by being in bed.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.320
And your butt is full of cum.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.320
That's not true.

51:41.320 --> 51:44.320
I don't know where you got that impression.

51:44.320 --> 51:49.320
There's a giant mythical planet full of people traveling in all kinds of combinations.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.320
This isn't the first time two dudes have hung out together.

51:52.320 --> 51:57.320
Why do you keep... Your fixation is making me think that there's shit up with you.

51:57.320 --> 52:01.320
When you're ready, you'll be ready.

52:01.320 --> 52:04.320
Alright, well, then we all go to sleep for the night.

52:04.320 --> 52:10.320
Do you have a room? Sadama Hussein?

52:10.320 --> 52:13.320
Moraine Sadana. Yes, I have my room.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.320
My room is the forest.

52:15.320 --> 52:18.320
Go to sleep in the woods and we'll...

52:18.320 --> 52:22.320
I am immune to sleep, so I will walk the woods.

52:22.320 --> 52:23.320
It's quite alright, sir.

52:23.320 --> 52:27.320
Let's meet at six in the lobby.

52:27.320 --> 52:38.320
Alright. Okay, Spencer everybody.

52:38.320 --> 52:41.320
Alright, so it comes to this point in the show.

52:41.320 --> 52:43.320
This has happened before.

52:43.320 --> 52:47.320
We're trying to figure out how this isn't the worst Harmontown ever.

52:47.320 --> 52:52.320
What do we do? We're going to go for broke. We're going to do something.

52:52.320 --> 52:54.320
So we have to close up the show.

52:54.320 --> 53:02.320
We have to go to a weird, personal, revelatory, exciting, interesting place.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.320
Okay. Help me out.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.320
Alright.

53:07.320 --> 53:10.320
Weird, personal for you and I.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.320
I don't know.

53:12.320 --> 53:16.320
Well, it's not going to be for any of them. I don't know them.

53:16.320 --> 53:19.320
Oh, I smell... I like your shirt.

53:19.320 --> 53:21.320
Let's get deep.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.320
I like your shirt.

53:22.320 --> 53:25.320
I'll take another look at my phone, I swear.

53:25.320 --> 53:28.320
We're going to remind people about Jareth Halloween.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.320
Everybody dresses Jareth as Halloween. Jareth from the lab.

53:31.320 --> 53:36.320
Did we announce it that Jeff has hired a costumer for his costume?

53:36.320 --> 53:38.320
It's true. This shit is on.

53:38.320 --> 53:43.320
We were having a conversation about Halloween and, yeah, Jeff...

53:43.320 --> 53:47.320
Hired a costumer. He told us he was going to a fitting for a television show.

53:47.320 --> 53:52.320
And then we were hanging out with him and he had to go several times and I was like,

53:52.320 --> 53:54.320
what is your fitting for? And he's like, I'll tell you.

53:54.320 --> 53:58.320
He's not a liar and didn't want to lie and told us that he was getting fitted for his costume.

53:58.320 --> 54:01.320
So we got to measure up.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.320
Jareth is a character.

54:03.320 --> 54:08.320
I'm very excited because that movie meant a lot to me as a kid.

54:08.320 --> 54:12.320
Big deal. Shaped me a lot, sexually.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.320
You know what meant a lot to me as Robocop?

54:14.320 --> 54:18.320
If I ever get the nuts up... Thank you, gentlemen, ladies.

54:18.320 --> 54:22.320
If I ever get the nuts up, it would look like a really good Robocop costume.

54:22.320 --> 54:25.320
And I heard they're remaking Robocop.

54:25.320 --> 54:27.320
They're remaking everything.

54:27.320 --> 54:31.320
I feel like I'm being baited to go, don't remake it.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.320
I don't care. Just bury me.

54:34.320 --> 54:37.320
Bury me in your remake, Pete Moss.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.320
I get what you're doing.

54:39.320 --> 54:42.320
You're telling me that you don't care if I come to the movies anymore.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.320
I get it. It's not my money that you don't care.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.320
How about this?

54:45.320 --> 54:46.320
It's 18-year-old people.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.320
I don't know what Total Recall is.

54:48.320 --> 54:50.320
I don't know what Robocop is.

54:50.320 --> 54:54.320
I feel... How do you think that makes me feel Hollywood?

54:54.320 --> 54:56.320
It's a bummer. Robocop's a perfect movie.

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
You don't have to be like...

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
As you're...

54:59.320 --> 55:01.320
What the hell? First of all...

55:01.320 --> 55:04.320
Fucking... You know what's great about Robocop?

55:04.320 --> 55:07.320
It wasn't a goddamn remake!

55:07.320 --> 55:09.320
What the fuck?

55:09.320 --> 55:12.320
Listen to the title of the fucking movie!

55:12.320 --> 55:15.320
Do you know how dumb sounding that is? Robocop?

55:15.320 --> 55:20.320
And the poster is a dude that fucking looks like the Tin Man.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.320
He just... That's it.

55:21.320 --> 55:24.320
He just looks like the modern version of the Tin Man.

55:24.320 --> 55:28.320
Modern circa 1986, whatever it was.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
87, 88, I think it was 88.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.320
What was it? You know. You're not in your head.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.320
I saw you.

55:33.320 --> 55:34.320
Okay.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
I thought it was like...

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
I knew my kid was here.

55:36.320 --> 55:39.320
Now, there's a poster like... It's a fucking guy.

55:39.320 --> 55:41.320
It's just Peter Weller encased in fucking plastic.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.320
It was a fucking dumb robot suit.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.320
And the poster said...

55:44.320 --> 55:47.320
Part man, part machine, all cop.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.320
And you did Robocop.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.320
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

55:51.320 --> 55:53.320
But here's the crazy thing.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.320
Great movie!

55:55.320 --> 55:57.320
Amazing movie!

55:57.320 --> 56:01.320
And it didn't... It wasn't a revisitation of anything.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.320
So now you're revisiting it.

56:03.320 --> 56:04.320
Why?

56:04.320 --> 56:08.320
Why can't... How hard can it be to make another Robocop

56:08.320 --> 56:10.320
without calling it Robocop?

56:10.320 --> 56:13.320
Here, speaker head.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.320
I'm looking across the room. I see a speaker.

56:15.320 --> 56:17.320
Speaker head.

56:17.320 --> 56:21.320
Part speaker, part head.

56:21.320 --> 56:25.320
All crossing guard.

56:25.320 --> 56:27.320
I'm proving the theory wrong, aren't I?

56:27.320 --> 56:30.320
Maybe it's not that easy, but an hour?

56:30.320 --> 56:31.320
If you had an hour?

56:31.320 --> 56:32.320
Dead.

56:32.320 --> 56:35.320
But it's a fucking unicorn octopus.

56:35.320 --> 56:38.320
A shoe hamburger.

56:38.320 --> 56:42.320
A salt giant.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.320
Ice, ice, ice monster.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.320
Fucking meat balls, nine.

56:47.320 --> 56:48.320
Wait, no, no, no, sorry.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.320
Dan, I think you should stop here

56:49.320 --> 56:53.320
naming all of Rob Schneider's next ten movies.

56:53.320 --> 56:54.320
Dankly.

56:54.320 --> 56:55.320
Lumber, Giant Termite.

56:55.320 --> 56:56.320
Dan.

56:56.320 --> 56:58.320
Giant Anything.

56:58.320 --> 57:00.320
We haven't made everything giant.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.320
Give me a second, baby.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.320
I'm talking to friends.

57:04.320 --> 57:07.320
I'll be to bed in a second.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.320
Giant Anything.

57:08.320 --> 57:09.320
Giant beer bottle.

57:09.320 --> 57:14.320
Giant, giant, giant piece of fucking glass.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.320
What about that video now about the guy

57:16.320 --> 57:18.320
that puts the Mason jar up his ass,

57:18.320 --> 57:20.320
and it breaks in his ass,

57:20.320 --> 57:22.320
and then he pulls the broken glass out of his ass?

57:22.320 --> 57:24.320
Maybe there's a movie there.

57:24.320 --> 57:26.320
Adapt it into something.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.320
What was that guy thinking?

57:27.320 --> 57:28.320
What's he doing?

57:28.320 --> 57:30.320
He's just holding a glass.

57:30.320 --> 57:32.320
Yeah, I don't know, glass,

57:32.320 --> 57:37.320
but yeah, there's a hyphen between the L and the A.

57:37.320 --> 57:44.320
Yeah, insects decide that they're at war with people.

57:44.320 --> 57:47.320
The sky, the sky is a monster.

57:47.320 --> 57:50.320
The sky, the hole in the ozone becomes a mouth.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.320
Yeah, it's a monster.

57:51.320 --> 57:57.320
How do you run from the only thing you've ever been under?

57:57.320 --> 58:00.320
Fucking done, taking 90 minutes to write it.

58:00.320 --> 58:02.320
It's called Chicken Huge.

58:02.320 --> 58:05.320
Maybe it's good, maybe it's bad.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.320
Make 10 of them.

58:06.320 --> 58:08.320
One of them is going to be good on accident.

58:08.320 --> 58:10.320
Die Hard wasn't made by geniuses,

58:10.320 --> 58:13.320
it was just fucking stop it, knock it off.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.320
Stop trying to figure out the system

58:16.320 --> 58:19.320
of how to guarantee your movie is going to make money

58:19.320 --> 58:21.320
based on the variables of,

58:21.320 --> 58:23.320
well, you take Matt Damon and you put him in it,

58:23.320 --> 58:26.320
and then you take this thing where the wild things are.

58:26.320 --> 58:30.320
That was a hit book, and then you shoot it in 3D

58:30.320 --> 58:32.320
and you can guarantee the overseas.

58:32.320 --> 58:34.320
Come on, man, like fucking,

58:34.320 --> 58:37.320
people used to wing it a little bit.

58:37.320 --> 58:41.320
Dan hates romantic comedies

58:41.320 --> 58:45.320
because he hates the idea of people cheating on people,

58:45.320 --> 58:47.320
and he's convinced that every romantic comedy

58:47.320 --> 58:50.320
is about people cheating on people.

58:50.320 --> 58:52.320
And recently, Dan and I got in a very, very big fight,

58:52.320 --> 58:56.320
because I never asked Dan to watch romantic comedies with me,

58:56.320 --> 58:58.320
but I wait till he's asleep,

58:58.320 --> 59:01.320
and then I put on a romantic comedy,

59:01.320 --> 59:04.320
and I was watching the five-year engagement

59:04.320 --> 59:07.320
with Alison Brie from your fucking show.

59:07.320 --> 59:10.320
It wasn't a five-year engagement.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.320
It was a two-year relationship,

59:12.320 --> 59:14.320
and then they broke up for two years,

59:14.320 --> 59:16.320
and then they got back together.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.320
You didn't watch the movie.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.320
He woke up in the middle, and you didn't watch any of that.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.320
He woke up in the middle, like, in a fever dream,

59:22.320 --> 59:23.320
and it was like,

59:23.320 --> 59:26.320
fucking romantic comedies, movie industry,

59:26.320 --> 59:29.320
you're cheating on somebody, get together,

59:29.320 --> 59:31.320
and, no, I want to be with somebody,

59:31.320 --> 59:35.320
and I kiss another real, like, insane.

59:35.320 --> 59:37.320
I realize I want to be with you

59:37.320 --> 59:38.320
because I kiss this person,

59:38.320 --> 59:39.320
the more I love that fucking,

59:39.320 --> 59:41.320
and I make a million movies.

59:41.320 --> 59:45.320
It's like going to a salt restaurant.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.320
It's a seasoning.

59:47.320 --> 59:49.320
Romance is a fucking seasoning.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.320
It's not a plot point.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.320
Adam, you're killing me.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.320
No, I don't disagree with you.

59:54.320 --> 59:56.320
He hadn't watched the movie.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.320
I watched it when he was asleep.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.320
I leaned over and I was like,

59:58.320 --> 59:59.320
oh, I'm sorry, Dan.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.320
I don't be upset, and I kissed him.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320
He shoved me off of him,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.320
and he's like fucking cheating,

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.320
and he just was associating me with a cheating

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.320
and a movie.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.320
It was a sleep.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320
You're not putting this...

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.320
I talk in my sleep.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320
He was asleep.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320
And I was asleep.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320
That's not...

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.320
You're making everyone think I'm a weird scarface.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.320
I talk in my sleep.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320
I sleep with all this cocaine,

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320
and then these guns,

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.320
and they were his friends.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.320
I talk in my sleep.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320
Well, you tell him the thing I said.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320
What was the thing?

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320
The...

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320
Which spang?

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320
The...

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320
You talk in the sleep.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320
You sleep all the time.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320
The shittles thing.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.320
Dan talks in the sleep all the time,

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.320
and sometimes I can understand it,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320
and I write it down,

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
and he...

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.320
It sounded like a movie pitch.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.320
And he...

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.320
I can remember it.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320
He said,

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.320
It's the 70s.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.320
But it was...

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.320
Is it 70s?

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320
My mouth's got this rain.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320
And I'm just gonna...

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320
There.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320
What was the middle part about?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320
They're all shooting us.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.320
Yeah, they're all shooting us.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320
They're all shooting us.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.320
There's this campaign here.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320
And he's gonna...

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320
Shittles!

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320
Shittles!

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320
There's like a pitch.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320
It sounds good.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320
I'm developing in my sleep.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320
It's the 70s.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320
In a world where disco is...

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320
Disco is...

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
Disco is...

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320
Disco is...

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320
Disco is...

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320
Disco is...

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:21.320
Disco is the way you dance, and bullets are what you use to shoot.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.320
Shiddles.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.320
Don't make them angry.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.320
They'll dance all over you with their poop.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.320
They'll dance all over you.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.320
I'm just saying, you...

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.320
Here's the thing about movies.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.320
Yeah.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.320
You can just make them up as you go.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:50.320
Speaking of making them up, Dan and I did an improvised movie like a month ago.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.320
Where's this going?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.320
Could we get a suggestion of a moody title?

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Wait, you want to close the show with more improv movie things?

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.320
Can we hash out the rom-com thing?

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.320
Because when you and I talk about it and there's no one else around,

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.320
it's seriously, I swear to God, it sounds like a bit...

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.320
We've never fought about anything more severely.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320
Here's the thing, I never make you watch them,

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.320
and you get mad at me for watching them,

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.320
and then tell me that it's not a big deal that I watch them.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.320
But I don't make you watch them.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.320
I just don't want...

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.320
You don't make me watch them, but then I go,

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.320
well, I go to the sci-fi fantasy section,

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.320
and you kind of like, come on, you roll your eyes a little bit.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.320
No, I don't.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.320
The time that you're talking about was after a very big fight we had

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320
where you were in the wrong,

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.320
and I made a bit saying, well, I thought you were going to get a hug,

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.320
and then it became a big thing.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.320
Exactly, we got in a fight about something else,

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320
you went to the bathroom, and I started picking out a movie,

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.320
and I came back and you looked at the section I was looking in,

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.320
which is what I would like to call Movies About Things.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.320
But Dan, I watch exclusively sci-fi with you.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320
I don't make you watch anything you don't want to watch.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.320
I like watching sci-fi, I like watching all those things.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.320
I'm perfect!

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320
You came back from the bathroom,

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320
and you looked that I was surfing through movies

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.320
that are about time travel and spaceships and lasers and stuff,

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.320
and you went, huh, well, I guess you weren't that sorry.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.320
Like, as if I owed you, because we had a fight and then we made up,

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.320
now I got to watch fucking Jason Siegel and James Franco

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320
travel across the country together.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.320
This is where we had the fight.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.320
The fight started because I made a joke,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.320
like, well, I thought you were going to turn on some romantic comedies,

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.320
and I was like, well, what do you want to, Jason Siegel's Steven Crudley?

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.320
As if those are the only movies I like.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320
I like romantic comedies.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320
Those guys make my romantic comedies.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.320
I watch every single romantic comedy.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.320
Yeah, but I know they're shitty, Dan.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.320
Jesus, I know that movies about octopus monsters are shitty,

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320
but they're about something.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.320
There's always a guy, no matter how bad the movie is.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.320
Yeah, and I don't discourage you from watching them, ever.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.320
You did when you came out of the bathroom.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320
God damn it.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320
It was a bit.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.320
You're a bit.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.320
You're a human bit, and I'm telling you, man,

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.320
I'm just saying, movies about people that fall in love

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320
and then fall out of love and then fall in love again,

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320
it's like eating ketchup.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320
They're not fucking for you.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.320
You can put that ketchup on a movie about an octopus monster.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.320
You can have a guy invent an octopus monster

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320
while he's falling in love with someone,

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.320
and you can have the octopus monster

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320
be the reason they fall out of love,

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.320
and then they can fall back in love

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.320
because they beat the octopus monster.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.320
It's ketchup.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320
The movies that are popular,

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.320
it's just fucking the mushrooms on top of the steak.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.320
You're right.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.320
If you only eat those, you'll die.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.320
I'm not arguing here.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.320
I watch all of these movies with you.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320
And the ancient Greeks didn't.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.320
You're the most high maintenance, difficult person.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320
I can't hear you right now.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.320
I can't hear you because I have a bigger point to make.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.320
We've been telling stories for 60,000 years.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320
Pull that number out of my ass.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320
Guys!

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.320
Guys!

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320
It doesn't matter.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.320
You can play as many sound effects as you want.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.320
We have been telling stories for 60,000 years.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.320
If you drew that line on a piece of paper,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.320
and you illustrated the portion of it

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.320
that represented us telling stories about monsters eating people

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.320
and people beating them

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.320
and people with weird shit in them,

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320
it would be like 90% of it.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.320
We only just now invented the idea

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.320
that you can make a whole movie about a dude being not into somebody.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.320
It's fucking dumb.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.320
Who cares if you're not into her?

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.320
Is that a movie?

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
Be not into her and have a robot!

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.320
Have a robot!

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.320
I'm angry!

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.320
I don't think you're wrong.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320
What about a deadly friend?

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.320
He liked a girl and she died,

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.320
and then he turned her into a robot.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320
That's pretty cool.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.320
We have to end this show.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320
Yeah.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.320
Because it's become about a man and a woman's relationship.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.320
So they hate it.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.320
You know, if a fucking monster came up on stage right now,

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.320
they'd be like, I'm in this for three more hours.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.320
Let me see six more of them.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.320
There's no such thing as a series of romantic comedies

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320
that goes to like 12 movies.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.320
Jason Voorhees has been slashing people apart forever.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320
He's a crazy fucking guy that kills people.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320
He does it in space.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320
He does it in the 1800s.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.320
Even the leprechaun can sustain a franchise longer

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.320
than a fucking guy and a girl going,

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320
I don't know if I want to get married!

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.320
And Daniel James Harmon.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320
I know before I was saying,

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.320
look, I don't, this isn't about that,

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.320
and I like those movies, and I also like the movies you like.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320
But you've convinced me.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320
Perhaps we should not be together.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.320
You've made it very clear.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320
You like monster movies.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.320
I like blowjobs and making dinner.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.320
So I think that perhaps we should part ways.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.320
And you should be with a woman that's better suited for you.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320
Alright.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Thank you everyone for coming to our breakup show.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320
I guess that's how it is.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320
I am really quick.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320
I'm always very vulnerable after relationships.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.320
And listen, this throat is super deep.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.320
And I'll listen to you.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320
I have this problem where I just listen to you

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.320
and I'm really interested in things.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.320
I'm really smart and stupid.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.320
So if you want me to listen to you and talk to you for a while

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.320
and blow you and love you and care about you,

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.320
then I'm available.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.320
I know this is a big bummer,

01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:02.320
but I'm not crazy or emotionally dysfunctional.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320
I don't think.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320
Alright, so that's...

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.320
I'll be in the parking lot on my knees.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.320
I'm just going to go down to my secret laboratory

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.320
and mourn the loss of our relationship.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.320
Computer.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.320
Yes, Mr. Harmon.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.320
Continue research project.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.320
Omega Amadeus.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.320
Omega Amadeus online.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.320
Pretty fucking interesting.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.320
Meanwhile...

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.320
Meanwhile in the parking lot...

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.320
I obey your command.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.320
Omega Amadeus, seek out all female life forms

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.320
and annihilate them.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320
I am online.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.320
I am programmed to comply.

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.320
Meanwhile in the parking lot...

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.320
Your mother was shitty.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.320
I'll be your mother.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.320
I'll be there for you.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.320
The wall explodes.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.320
We're a...

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.320
Eliminate all women.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.320
Cars exploding.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.320
Meanwhile in the parking lot...

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:23.320
Yes, I have one of those weird squeezing vaginas.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320
It's so embarrassing,

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.320
but it squeezes and stimulates a penis.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:31.320
Unlike any other vagina that's ever been.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.320
Car door rips off.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Giant robot hand grabs your body,

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.320
lifts you into the air,

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.320
and your Omega Amadeus looks at you

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.320
with its gleaming red eye and says,

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.320
uh, state your primary function.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.320
Or be exterminated.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.320
Honestly, lover.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.320
Oh.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.320
Little tiny robot dick.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.320
Emerging from tiny hatch.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:06.320
Just put it right here.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320
Affirmative.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.320
It'll be okay.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.320
Input acceptable.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320
Thank you, everyone.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.320
Thank you for coming to a very special Harmontown.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.320
As in short bus special.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.320
I'd like to thank some people.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320

Thank you, Erin McGathy for come trolling.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320
Thank you guys.

See you next week.
