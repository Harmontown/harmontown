{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.000\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen, geniuses of Harmontown.\n\n00:05.000 --> 00:06.000\nWoo!\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:16.000\nPlease, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:27.000\nThank you, thank you.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:29.000\nI already screwed up the music.\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:31.000\nAlright, alright, it's cool.\n\n00:31.000 --> 00:32.000\nTake it easy.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:33.000\nYay!\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:36.000\nAlright, please welcome back guest comptroller Erin McGathy.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:37.000\nHey guys.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:44.000\nSee, they like you.\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:45.000\nThey're okay with you.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:46.000\nAlright, thanks guys.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:47.000\nI feel okay.\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:53.000\nFull disclosure, I had two drinks before the show and I feel too drunk for two drinks.\n\n00:53.000 --> 00:54.000\nBut I'm fine.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:56.000\nThat's unacceptable here.\n\n00:56.000 --> 01:00.000\nWe've explained it before, we've run a tight ship.\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:05.000\nJust don't let it get us off on too many tangents because we don't like to do that.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:06.000\nWe like to focus.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nWhat are your guys' favorite drinks?\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\nThe theme of tonight is, I guess we decided on the car because I was trying to explain\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:20.000\nNight Rider to Erin.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:26.000\nSo I thought maybe if we made the theme the 80s and we'll just get some stuff from you guys about the 80s\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nand I'll try to find out what she knows about them.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:35.000\nI was trying to explain Night Rider to her and I realized it sounds like a pretty sloppy show.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:43.000\nWell, he was a cop that he got, I think he got targeted by the mob so he got killed\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:46.000\nbut they erased him and changed his face and gave him a new name.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:47.000\nWhy did they do that?\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nInstead of putting him in the witness protection program, they're like,\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:55.000\nI think you could also just keep on being a cop.\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:58.000\nYeah, well, they wanted to fight more crime.\n\n01:58.000 --> 01:59.000\nIsn't the car talk?\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:00.000\nThe car has a spirit in it, right?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\nIt doesn't have a spirit in it.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:07.000\nIt's just a very sophisticated automobile.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:13.000\nThis was a time in pop culture when computers were very exciting to people and magical.\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:15.000\nIt was enough that it was a computer.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:16.000\nThat's what made it talk.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nBut it had a personality.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:20.000\nYeah, that of William Daniels from St. Elsewhere.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nErin, let me ask you something.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:23.000\nOkay.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:28.000\nWhat do you know about Alph?\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:31.000\nI saw some episodes of Alph as a child.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\nI didn't.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:45.000\nI remember that he was kind of like a sexual puppet and he couldn't tell that guy what to do.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:47.000\nHe had a lot of advice.\n\n02:47.000 --> 02:49.000\nHe also always stayed on a couch.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:50.000\nHe never got up from the couch.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:51.000\nBut sometimes he got up from the couch.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nStayed behind the couch, probably.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nHe's a puppet, right?\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nBut a lot of times he was on the couch, right?\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nI'm just telling you about my memories.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.000\nNo, I don't know.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:00.000\nYou saw it more than me.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.000\nI never watched that.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\nRight.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nBut he was an alien and a family took him in.\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:08.000\nAnd boy, did they learn a lot about who they were.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:10.000\nWere there people trying to catch him?\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:11.000\nWas there ever a danger?\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:15.000\nBecause I used to watch My Favorite Martian and More Convenient, there was always a...\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nWho was your favorite Martian?\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\nJust kidding.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:19.000\nSorry, I don't...\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nRay Walston.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nI don't remember.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:29.000\nThere's usually like an FBI guy or somebody with a cop or somebody that, boy, oh boy, if we find out, oh god.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nBecause in addition to being younger than you...\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:33.000\nI'm sorry, stop everything.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nAdam Goldberg is getting fidgety.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nI just saw him in the audience.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:39.000\nHe's raising his hand.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nNo, that's normal.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nStop the show when he's seizureing.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nAdam, I have a pad of paper.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nWhenever you have an idea, write it down on the paper.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nWe'll talk about it.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.000\nThe elf was constantly menaced by the government.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:56.000\nAnd they still lighted out a cliffhanger where they caught him and they never made part two.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nHe fucking wanted to eat a cat.\n\n03:58.000 --> 03:59.000\nThat's all.\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nRight, right.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nCats, you like cats.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nYes.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nYou're gonna have to call on me.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nI'm sorry I have to ask for yours.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nAll right.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:08.000\nLet's hear for Adam.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:13.000\nHere's everything that Adam just said.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:17.000\nAccording to Adam, elf was wanted by the government and wanted to eat cats.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.000\nThen he said, I'm sorry I have ass burgers.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:26.000\nWhich he insists on pronouncing that way because he has ass burgers.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\nIt's like a tick.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\nI just wanted to say, I feel like this is important.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nI am 12 years younger than you.\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:39.000\nBecause I'm a Navy kid, when I was a kid, the television, was anyone else a child in\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nthe Navy and grew up on Navy bases?\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nSo we watched a channel called AFRTS.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.000\nSo you watched like a weird selection of shows.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:52.000\nSo I may have seen elf, but I saw like three episodes of elf.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:53.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:57.000\nBecause the soldiers aren't allowed to watch current things.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nThey might incite them to be non-solideric.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nWait a minute.\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nWho is the boss?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nKill the general.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nThat car is talking.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nI can talk.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:16.000\nTalk my way out of this war.\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nWho am I fighting?\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nI'm disappearing.\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nThey do the same thing with the juries.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nBecause they have to sequester them.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nThe same thing in all of China.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:37.000\nYou have to keep people from looking at Bloomingdale's catalogs if you want to fight a way of life.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nElf, we have to talk.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nThat's my impression of elf's dad.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nMax Wright.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:54.000\nElf, are you trying to get chased by the government and eat cats?\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:01.000\nI want to get serious tonight because it's obviously a quiet, either intimidated or bored crowd.\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:02.000\nI'm not blaming you guys.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:03.000\nThat's not what I meant.\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nPlease don't ever let me slip into that.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nI will never abuse you just because I'm doing a shitty show.\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nNo.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nI don't think they're doing anything wrong.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:12.000\nNo, they're not.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:13.000\nI'm being nervous.\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nLet her good cop it.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:18.000\nI'm not good copping and I'm saying you can blame me.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nI wouldn't do that either.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nYou were talking about anxiety.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nIt's not a quiet night at Harmontown.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:25.000\nIt's okay.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:26.000\nYou don't have to be uproarious.\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nThere's absolutely nothing funny happening or entertaining.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:30.000\nThere's nothing.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nThere's no one coming at me with a knife.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:40.000\nYour heart rate can be down here by sleeping.\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:46.000\nYou can be relaxed, like a person in a commercial for a bed.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nIt's fine.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:53.000\nBecause ultimately there is no sponsor and there is nothing at stake except your $10,\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:57.000\nwhich is now gone.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nBut I will give you $10 worth of an experience.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:05.000\nIf I have to slash my wrists up here, you won't react to it.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nYou'll cringe and it'll make you sad.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:10.000\nTonight we are sponsored by humanity.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:11.000\nThat's correct.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:12.000\nThank you, baby.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nYou were talking about anxiety.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:18.000\nI want to talk about my newly found mental disorder.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nThe fact that I'm losing my fucking mind.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:22.000\nThe fact that I'm falling apart.\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:26.000\nI started doing this diet where you eat.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nIt's the four-hour body diet and hold for applause.\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\nOkay.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:35.000\nI didn't mean it.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.000\nThe four-hour body diet in a nutshell.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nI didn't read the book.\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.000\nErin did.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:42.000\nShe imparted it to me.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:46.000\nYou eat beans, meat, and veggies for six days a week.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:53.000\nThen every cheat day, Saturday, in our case, you eat 18,000 cupcakes, 20 pretzels,\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\ncars, fire hydrants, whatever you want.\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:59.000\nBecause you're spiking your blood sugar and then you're...\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:06.000\nCertainly not doing the diet right by supplementing it with quarts of vodka.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:08.000\nThere's all kinds of variables there.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:11.000\nStarted doing the diet, lost a bunch of weight.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:17.000\nThen for you avid podcasties, you know that there was a point where I called an ambulance\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nbecause I got so light-headed.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nI had no idea what was going on.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:25.000\nI had a sensation that I had never experienced before, which was just vague, light-headedness.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:30.000\nI didn't faint and there was no pain and my heart wasn't going fast.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:35.000\nThere was nothing other than it was just like cloudy, but it was so persistent and so odd.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nI never experienced it before.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:44.000\nThis means I'm dying and I gave it like 45 minutes to an hour to go away,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:48.000\nthinking, well, in drinking water, maybe it's a thing, a bowl of beans,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:51.000\nmaybe it's blood sugar because of this diet.\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:52.000\nIt just keeps going.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:53.000\nI'll lay down.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nI don't want to lay down because that's what dead people do.\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nI lay down and then I get up.\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:58.000\nNow I'm even more light-headed.\n\n08:58.000 --> 08:59.000\nOkay, call an ambulance.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:03.000\nThe ambulance comes over full of all these Jake Gyllenhaal's and they said,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nyou're in fine condition.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nI went to the doctor.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:08.000\nThe doctor took my blood.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nBlood came back.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:13.000\nHe said, again, as I talked about on the podcast, cholesterol is perfect.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nLiver is perfect.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nKidneys are perfect.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nBlood sugar is very, very low, but not in a bad way.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:22.000\nYour triglycerides are high, but not in a bad way.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nJust a sign of you being on this diet.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:26.000\nI'm like, okay.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nThat didn't show anything.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:32.000\nThey keep having these light-headed spells and I'm like, what the fuck is going on?\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:35.000\nAnd Aaron keeps going, it's probably anxiety.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.000\nProbably like, I'm like, that's retarded stuff.\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:42.000\nI'm sorry for the retarded people that just heard me say that.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nLike my sister.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nMy sister's retarded.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:54.000\nI get one every podcast because of her and the sacrifices I made growing up with her.\n\n09:54.000 --> 10:04.000\nThe next thing I call retarded will be valuable and capable.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:11.000\nThen I had this breakthrough during this beach trip with my friends.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nI'm like, somebody said, maybe it's a vitamin D deficiency.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nI'm like, God damn it, that's it.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nThey said I had a vitamin D deficiency.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:20.000\nSo I go out in the sun and I'm like, I'm like Birdman.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.000\nI get power.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nThat's what it is.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nOf course, I never go out.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nI figured it out.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nI figured it out.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:26.000\nAnd then a half hour later, I'm like, ugh.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:30.000\nAnd then I have a root beer and I go, no, it's blood sugar because now I feel great.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nI take some potassium.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nI eat a banana and I go, no, it's potassium.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nIt's potassium.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:41.000\nAnd every time I get on the internet and I Google whatever it is I'm doing and I go,\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:42.000\npotassium deficiency.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:46.000\nAnd it pulls up the symptoms and I search for light-headedness and I go, okay, there it\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.000\nis.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nI clinched it.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nI got it.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nAnd I'm like doing all these experiments on myself, trying to figure this out.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:56.640\nAnd basically all the experiments result in just further and further panic.\n\n10:56.640 --> 11:00.500\nLike I just keep, like, these things don't go away.\n\n11:00.500 --> 11:01.500\nSo we went to San Diego.\n\n11:01.500 --> 11:03.000\nWe went to the San Diego Zoo.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:04.000\nI'm walking around.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nShe's in heaven.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nShe's always wanted to go there.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:07.000\nIt's a bunch of fucking animals.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.120\nI love it too.\n\n11:09.120 --> 11:12.760\nBut I'm preoccupied by, I just keep having these spells.\n\n11:12.760 --> 11:14.000\nI'm like, there it is again.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:15.000\nOkay, I'll drink a Sprite.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nI think it's blood sugar.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nI'm back around to that.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nNo.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nAnd now I feel better.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nOkay.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.480\nSo after I drink a Sprite, my head clears up perfectly, but then that starts not being\n\n11:24.480 --> 11:25.480\nthe case.\n\n11:25.480 --> 11:26.720\nThen that science goes out the window.\n\n11:26.720 --> 11:29.880\nNow, no matter what I do, maybe I drank too much Sprite.\n\n11:29.880 --> 11:31.000\nMaybe I'm hyperglycemic.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.560\nI don't know what's happening.\n\n11:33.560 --> 11:37.040\nAnd Erin, who's been saying for weeks, like, it's probably anxiety, so we're standing\n\n11:37.040 --> 11:38.040\nin line.\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:41.680\nShe goes like, let's go on the bucket that takes you over the whole San Diego Zoo and\n\n11:41.680 --> 11:44.040\ndangles you from 5,000 feet.\n\n11:44.040 --> 11:45.040\nThat'll relax you.\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:49.680\nAnd I'm standing in line and it's like, this is probably not a good idea, but I don't want\n\n11:49.680 --> 11:56.680\nto be a pussy, because God knows I've done nothing but show her what a man I am so far.\n\n11:56.680 --> 12:03.320\nI want to find out now that I am a complete pussy.\n\n12:03.320 --> 12:05.320\nSo I'm just kind of standing there going, this is not a good idea.\n\n12:05.320 --> 12:10.160\nI'm going to be in a bucket dangling over people and we get to the front of the line\n\n12:10.160 --> 12:13.960\nand I'm just like still talking about it and like, I just don't get it.\n\n12:13.960 --> 12:14.960\nIt's not the Sprite.\n\n12:14.960 --> 12:15.960\nIt's not the bananas.\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:16.960\nIt's not the pretzels.\n\n12:16.960 --> 12:17.960\nIt's not the fire hydrants.\n\n12:17.960 --> 12:18.960\nIt's not the drafts.\n\n12:18.960 --> 12:20.280\nIt's like, what the fuck is wrong with me?\n\n12:20.280 --> 12:21.280\nWhat's happening to me?\n\n12:21.280 --> 12:25.080\nAnd earlier that day, I'd been like in tears, there's something wrong with you and you don't\n\n12:25.080 --> 12:26.080\nknow what it is.\n\n12:26.080 --> 12:27.920\nLike I just, I'm spoiled rotten.\n\n12:27.920 --> 12:31.960\nLike 20% of you in the audience have something, like some of you have diabetes, some of you\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:32.960\nhave this.\n\n12:32.960 --> 12:38.720\nLike there's a guy here that's an aneurysm survivor, he came here tonight in spite of\n\n12:38.720 --> 12:39.720\nhis symptoms.\n\n12:39.720 --> 12:44.240\nHe's like, the doctors are giving him horrible news and he's, I'm just going like, oh, why\n\n12:44.240 --> 12:45.240\nam I lightheaded?\n\n12:45.240 --> 12:50.600\nI can't do it, like crying in hotel rooms and then going to the zoo and going, I think\n\n12:50.600 --> 12:51.720\nwe need to go home.\n\n12:51.720 --> 12:57.560\nWe're standing in front of the line at the, at the bucket and Aaron goes, Dan, Dan, you've\n\n12:57.560 --> 13:02.680\neliminated every possibility sooner or later, you have to accept the fact that you're going\n\n13:02.680 --> 13:04.280\nto be fine.\n\n13:04.280 --> 13:05.280\nIt's anxiety.\n\n13:05.280 --> 13:06.280\nNo, it's not.\n\n13:06.280 --> 13:07.280\nNo, it's not.\n\n13:07.280 --> 13:08.280\nIt's not anxiety.\n\n13:08.280 --> 13:09.280\nI don't have anxiety.\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:10.280\nI'm at a zoo.\n\n13:10.280 --> 13:11.920\nEverything is going fine for me.\n\n13:11.920 --> 13:17.840\nNo, you've gone, you, you, you've spent the last six months to a year going through enormous\n\n13:17.840 --> 13:23.000\nchanges that no one, you're the only one that hasn't acknowledged.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:28.200\nYou're the only one that hasn't accepted or acknowledged or expressed or felt any of it.\n\n13:28.200 --> 13:32.960\nYou've acted completely normal while your entire life has completely changed.\n\n13:32.960 --> 13:37.000\nAnd it doesn't matter if you're at a zoo or eating spaghetti or drinking Sprite or dancing\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:41.900\nor drinking or drinking water or not drinking water, they, they're coming and going at random\n\n13:41.900 --> 13:42.900\nintervals.\n\n13:42.900 --> 13:45.120\nYou're having panic attacks.\n\n13:45.120 --> 13:51.720\nAnd the way that they go away is when you accept the fact that you're going to be fine.\n\n13:51.720 --> 13:54.760\nAnd I, and I was like, I was just thinking in my head, like, this is fucking bitch keeps\n\n13:54.760 --> 13:55.760\ngoing on.\n\n13:55.760 --> 14:02.240\nI, this is just making me panic and I, and I had experimented in the past like looking\n\n14:02.240 --> 14:04.600\nin the mirror and going, you're fine.\n\n14:04.600 --> 14:06.920\nThat's stressful.\n\n14:06.920 --> 14:09.440\nThat's what Norman Bates does.\n\n14:09.440 --> 14:10.440\nYou're fine.\n\n14:10.440 --> 14:11.440\nYou're fine.\n\n14:11.440 --> 14:12.960\nYou're in there.\n\n14:12.960 --> 14:16.280\nYou're going to get out there and take the world by storm.\n\n14:16.280 --> 14:18.680\nGet out there, Norman.\n\n14:18.680 --> 14:24.360\nBut because I was in a line for a bucket that goes over a thing, and I had to just internalize\n\n14:24.360 --> 14:29.280\nit really for the first time I said it in my head, okay, I'm going to be fucking fine.\n\n14:29.280 --> 14:31.200\nThere is nothing left to do.\n\n14:31.200 --> 14:32.200\nEither I'm going to die.\n\n14:32.200 --> 14:37.200\nEither I have a tumor or I like, like, like, like I'm a ghost or like, like I'm a Twilight\n\n14:37.200 --> 14:42.200\nZone episode, somebody erased me in the past or, or it's, or it's a new form of pretzel\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:44.320\nI haven't narrowed down.\n\n14:44.320 --> 14:47.440\nI can do nothing about it.\n\n14:47.440 --> 14:50.360\nI'm probably going to be fine.\n\n14:50.360 --> 14:52.800\nAnd then my, it vanished.\n\n14:52.800 --> 14:54.000\nMy head completely cleared up.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.200\nI got completely normal, like I am now.\n\n14:57.200 --> 15:00.160\nAnd then we got in the bucket and dangled over the zoo and I was fine.\n\n15:00.160 --> 15:01.160\nIt was like even more relaxed.\n\n15:01.160 --> 15:02.160\nI was like, whee.\n\n15:02.160 --> 15:03.160\nIt was a bucket over the zoo.\n\n15:03.160 --> 15:09.200\nAnd I started crying because my girlfriend cured me of my insanity and saved me from\n\n15:09.200 --> 15:11.600\nwhat I thought was something that was killing me.\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:20.480\nAnd it wasn't a funny story, but it was, it was, it, it, it made me like you more.\n\n15:20.480 --> 15:25.960\nI hate, I hate inflating her head, but maybe that has something to do with it.\n\n15:25.960 --> 15:28.680\nMaybe I'm in a relationship where I'm like, ah, it's, you know, this is it.\n\n15:28.680 --> 15:29.760\nAnd I'm, I don't know.\n\n15:29.760 --> 15:30.760\nMaybe that's it.\n\n15:30.760 --> 15:33.280\nI'm like writing a CBS sitcom.\n\n15:33.280 --> 15:35.280\nWait, did you say that I am causing your anxiety?\n\n15:35.280 --> 15:41.480\nNo, no, my, my idea that you're, let me put this in terms that you'll accept.\n\n15:41.480 --> 15:50.880\nMaybe you're so awesome that I'm having anxiety attacks that I'm going to, I'm not trying\n\n15:50.880 --> 15:51.880\nto stress you out.\n\n15:51.880 --> 15:52.880\nI'm just trying to understand.\n\n15:52.880 --> 15:55.680\nI would like to, as an experiment, try to cause an anxiety attack because here's the\n\n15:55.680 --> 15:56.680\nother thing.\n\n15:56.680 --> 15:59.480\nThen I, I, I, I, I, I, then I was fine.\n\n15:59.480 --> 16:00.480\nAnd then I was fine.\n\n16:00.480 --> 16:01.480\nI was like, oh shit, we cured it.\n\n16:01.480 --> 16:02.480\nWe cured it.\n\n16:02.480 --> 16:07.240\nUh, and then like today I was in this writer's room and I, I, and then I started having one.\n\n16:07.240 --> 16:10.600\nAnd then this time I was like, I just noted on my stopwatch, like, okay, let's see how\n\n16:10.600 --> 16:11.600\nlong these things last.\n\n16:11.600 --> 16:12.600\nWhat's going on?\n\n16:12.600 --> 16:17.240\nIt lasted a half hour and, uh, and then it went, and then it was gone.\n\n16:17.240 --> 16:22.920\nAnd then right before the show, I went out with you, we went across the street to a pikey\n\n16:22.920 --> 16:26.560\nand I had one for like an hour, like a general unease.\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:30.240\nThey have, they, they have different classes, like the ghost, ghost and ghostbusters.\n\n16:30.240 --> 16:35.360\nLike there's, there's the kind that are so small, like waves that I can, they're so small\n\n16:35.360 --> 16:36.680\nthat I can just jump over them.\n\n16:36.680 --> 16:39.840\nI can feel them coming in and then I just go, they're not happening.\n\n16:39.840 --> 16:41.200\nAnd then they go away.\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:46.560\nAnd then there's ones that are so big that, that, uh, me saying they're not happening\n\n16:46.560 --> 16:49.200\nand them not going away makes them bigger.\n\n16:49.200 --> 16:53.840\nAnd then, and those are basically the two categories and then they last anywhere from\n\n16:53.840 --> 16:57.240\n30 minutes to an hour and a half.\n\n16:57.240 --> 16:58.240\nRight.\n\n16:58.240 --> 17:02.920\nAnd, uh, and so now I'm like, and then we have this argument about, well, I shouldn't\n\n17:02.920 --> 17:03.920\nbe cataloging them.\n\n17:03.920 --> 17:07.280\nI'm going to the, I'm going to the doctor tomorrow cause I probably have a fucking\n\n17:07.280 --> 17:09.160\nmeatball in my brain or something.\n\n17:09.160 --> 17:14.320\nThere's like a baby skull, like I have a, I have an absorbed twin that's like trying\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:17.640\nto get out of my brain and it just keeps moving every once in a while.\n\n17:17.640 --> 17:21.880\nLike it kicks and then I have a spell and then it's like stops kicking and then I go,\n\n17:21.880 --> 17:24.120\noh, the sprite worked.\n\n17:24.120 --> 17:25.520\nI don't fucking know.\n\n17:25.520 --> 17:26.520\nI've tried not drinking.\n\n17:26.520 --> 17:27.520\nI've tried not drinking.\n\n17:27.520 --> 17:31.880\nYou would have mixed emotions if you found out that you had a really special tumor.\n\n17:31.880 --> 17:32.880\nI know.\n\n17:32.880 --> 17:36.720\nWell, I'm pretty psyched about having anxiety disorder.\n\n17:36.720 --> 17:41.520\nLike on the level of Tony Soprano, like I'm like, I am an interesting guy.\n\n17:41.520 --> 17:42.520\nI'm kind of into it.\n\n17:42.520 --> 17:44.280\nI'm like, oh, do I get to be like Linus?\n\n17:44.280 --> 17:45.280\nDo I get a blanket?\n\n17:45.280 --> 17:50.160\nI said, uh, I think that makes me pretty interesting.\n\n17:50.160 --> 17:55.160\nMaybe add a little side order, Asperger's, I don't know.\n\n17:55.160 --> 17:56.160\nYou want it so bad.\n\n17:56.160 --> 17:57.160\nAnd glasses.\n\n17:57.160 --> 17:59.160\nWhy is my vision 2020?\n\n17:59.160 --> 18:01.160\nI want sexy glasses.\n\n18:01.160 --> 18:06.320\nWell, like I said, and why is it too hot to wear a cool other jacket?\n\n18:06.320 --> 18:12.520\nLike Neil Gaiman, he just dresses like Ford Prefect all day.\n\n18:12.520 --> 18:15.480\nSo lucky to be from London.\n\n18:15.480 --> 18:20.240\nWhen we went into the Hugo Awards because Neil Gaiman was nominated in the same category\n\n18:20.240 --> 18:21.240\nwhen we walked in.\n\n18:21.240 --> 18:22.240\nAnd you know why?\n\n18:22.240 --> 18:24.720\nBecause he grew up with the name Gaiman.\n\n18:24.720 --> 18:25.720\nThat's why he won.\n\n18:25.720 --> 18:30.200\nYou're not going to beat a sci-fi guy in a sci-fi contest who grew up with the name Gaiman\n\n18:30.200 --> 18:31.200\non the playground.\n\n18:31.200 --> 18:32.200\nErin, what?\n\n18:32.200 --> 18:33.200\nYeah.\n\n18:33.200 --> 18:34.200\nI know.\n\n18:34.200 --> 18:35.200\nI know I'm not winning.\n\n18:35.200 --> 18:38.720\nWell, Jesus, I was going to ask, I was going to pull another thing.\n\n18:38.720 --> 18:39.720\nOh, yeah.\n\n18:39.720 --> 18:40.720\nI'm sorry.\n\n18:40.720 --> 18:48.360\nIt's like milking a cobra, like if I just go, Erin, so go, I know, I'm sorry, I raped\n\n18:48.360 --> 18:49.360\nyour brother.\n\n18:49.360 --> 18:50.360\nI didn't know.\n\n18:50.360 --> 18:53.360\nIt's like a tuning fork.\n\n18:53.360 --> 18:54.360\nIt's so weird.\n\n18:54.360 --> 18:55.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n18:55.360 --> 18:56.800\nI don't know why I'm feeling so anxious.\n\n18:56.800 --> 18:58.360\nI apologize.\n\n18:58.360 --> 18:59.360\nDo what I do.\n\n18:59.360 --> 19:00.360\nBlame the audience.\n\n19:00.360 --> 19:03.120\nThey're mellow tonight.\n\n19:03.120 --> 19:06.240\nThe audience's job is to sit and absorb.\n\n19:06.240 --> 19:11.080\nTheir mood is a nuanced, organic thing that no one can predict or control.\n\n19:11.080 --> 19:15.480\nThey're like a gelatinous mass made of little people-shaped particles that are just like\n\n19:15.480 --> 19:22.000\nplay-doh or goo, you know, they can't, and the only thing that they respond to is total\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:26.440\nlike kind of balance between acknowledging them and ignoring them.\n\n19:26.440 --> 19:27.440\nRight.\n\n19:27.440 --> 19:33.920\nLike a guy who spins plates has to like spin his plates and he has to, if he pretended that\n\n19:33.920 --> 19:37.440\nthe audience wasn't there, he'd be a shitty plate spinner, but also if he kept asking\n\n19:37.440 --> 19:40.800\nthem which plate to spin, all the plates would crash to the floor.\n\n19:40.800 --> 19:45.960\nAnd so they sit there like this ooze and then the performer kind of wades into the ooze\n\n19:45.960 --> 19:51.160\nand the air conditioning and the whatever's happened on the evening news and whatever\n\n19:51.160 --> 19:55.560\ncollection of sandwiches they've all been eating, like they all add up to some random\n\n19:55.560 --> 19:57.520\nnumber and we just accept it.\n\n19:57.520 --> 20:00.480\nGuys, I just want to ooze with you.\n\n20:00.480 --> 20:02.600\nJust ooze together.\n\n20:02.600 --> 20:05.680\nOoze is like dark and heavy, like gravy.\n\n20:05.680 --> 20:11.280\nJust like want to take a nap after Thanksgiving, just hang out, watch a football game, whizz\n\n20:11.280 --> 20:12.280\nit around.\n\n20:12.280 --> 20:15.800\nThis isn't me blaming you, but I think all of our talk about anxiety made me feel very\n\n20:15.800 --> 20:16.800\nanxious.\n\n20:16.800 --> 20:19.800\nYeah, that's what you always say.\n\n20:19.800 --> 20:21.840\nI don't know what to do with that.\n\n20:21.840 --> 20:22.840\nThat makes me more anxious.\n\n20:22.840 --> 20:25.720\nNo, no, don't feel anxious, don't feel anxious.\n\n20:25.720 --> 20:26.720\nLet's forget it.\n\n20:26.720 --> 20:27.720\nHey!\n\n20:27.720 --> 20:30.640\nForget that I'm having anxiety attacks.\n\n20:30.640 --> 20:33.760\nForget that me talking about them gives air and anxiety attacks.\n\n20:33.760 --> 20:37.960\nEveryone please forget that you affect us.\n\n20:37.960 --> 20:40.320\nForget you're watching a show.\n\n20:40.320 --> 20:47.440\nGet up in an orderly fashion, go to your cars and forget that you came here.\n\n20:47.440 --> 20:51.760\nI didn't want to say really quick about anxiety attacks, that just because you identified it\n\n20:51.760 --> 20:54.440\ndoesn't mean that it's going to end.\n\n20:54.440 --> 20:58.440\nIt also doesn't mean that I don't have cancer.\n\n20:58.440 --> 21:00.000\nLike the symptoms could still be the same.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:04.120\nI'm going to go back into the doctor and I'll go seriously, you can't just take some blood\n\n21:04.120 --> 21:07.200\nout of a guy's arm and tell him he's fine.\n\n21:07.200 --> 21:08.200\nSomething's happening to me.\n\n21:08.200 --> 21:10.080\nI don't want to think that you have cancer.\n\n21:10.080 --> 21:11.320\nNo, you're not dying.\n\n21:11.320 --> 21:13.760\nErin, I'm dying.\n\n21:13.760 --> 21:16.440\nYou are in love with a dying man.\n\n21:16.440 --> 21:23.120\nIt's just like how I love my mom before she died of cancer.\n\n21:23.120 --> 21:25.920\nMaybe I want that kind of love.\n\n21:25.920 --> 21:28.360\nMaybe I'm sick of hearing about this woman.\n\n21:28.360 --> 21:38.080\nI gave you so much, why don't you marry her or let go of her and marry me?\n\n21:38.080 --> 21:39.640\nYou were going to go to the bucket?\n\n21:39.640 --> 21:45.680\nI don't know what I was doing, hey, Max Headroom, what do you think?\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:51.920\nWe went to my 10-year high school reunion this last weekend and Dan was a hit.\n\n21:51.920 --> 21:56.560\nHe started the whole, like he started everyone dancing, like he just decided that he would\n\n21:56.560 --> 22:02.080\nstart dancing and the band geeks from my class came up to me and were telling me that they\n\n22:02.080 --> 22:06.920\nall knew who Dan was and how, they were telling me how cool it was, all the, all the band\n\n22:06.920 --> 22:08.920\ncould have predicted that.\n\n22:08.920 --> 22:10.560\nWell, that was his reaction.\n\n22:10.560 --> 22:11.560\nI thought it was really cool.\n\n22:11.560 --> 22:12.560\nI was like, Dan, they know who you are.\n\n22:12.560 --> 22:14.720\nI was like, yeah, pretty much.\n\n22:14.720 --> 22:17.960\nAnd I know who they are.\n\n22:17.960 --> 22:25.440\nTheir names are bread and butter and I have known them for my entire 20-year career.\n\n22:25.440 --> 22:30.800\nAnd I am peaking right now, I knew that your high school class would have like five guys\n\n22:30.800 --> 22:36.960\nin it who played tuba or, or a track team too, like I, you know, I knew, I knew there'd\n\n22:36.960 --> 22:41.720\nbe a couple guys who would like slip up to me at the urinal and go, hey man, good job.\n\n22:41.720 --> 22:43.720\nI go like, hey, thank you.\n\n22:43.720 --> 22:45.720\nDid you have people slip up to you at the urinal?\n\n22:45.720 --> 22:46.720\nGood job going to high school with my girlfriend.\n\n22:46.720 --> 22:49.720\nYou had guys slip up to you at the urinal?\n\n22:49.720 --> 22:50.720\nNo.\n\n22:50.720 --> 23:04.400\nAnd I spent, I spent like an hour there because of my prostate and my desperation.\n\n23:04.400 --> 23:08.640\nI was, I, I tried to take Aaron through all of the Friday the 13th movies.\n\n23:08.640 --> 23:13.600\nI just, what I like about trying to explain 80s things to Aaron is, is for the first time\n\n23:13.600 --> 23:18.680\nin my life having to explain them and realizing how dumb they are and like how confusing like\n\n23:18.680 --> 23:24.880\nI was trying to like, like go from Friday the 13th part one all the way to, to the end\n\n23:24.880 --> 23:28.920\neven though they stopped numbering them and started rebooting and, and all this stuff\n\n23:28.920 --> 23:30.920\nand it got very convoluted.\n\n23:30.920 --> 23:36.520\nSame with Knight Rider, same with Phil Collins, all of my, my, my whole life becomes a, just\n\n23:36.520 --> 23:40.800\nbecomes rubble in the eyes of my 27 year old girlfriend.\n\n23:40.800 --> 23:41.800\nNo.\n\n23:41.800 --> 23:46.320\nWell, you, you like dumb shit too.\n\n23:46.320 --> 23:49.440\nI don't care about no neutral milk hotel.\n\n23:49.440 --> 23:53.120\nI don't know why is there, why is there a hotel neutral?\n\n23:53.120 --> 23:55.480\nSounds, answer that.\n\n23:55.480 --> 23:56.480\nStupid.\n\n23:56.480 --> 24:01.480\nCan we talk about the fact that you don't know how Smurfs talk, which I found out.\n\n24:01.480 --> 24:02.600\nI know how Smurfs talk.\n\n24:02.600 --> 24:07.800\nI called Aaron a Smurf for, I can't even remember for what reason we were in a hotel room, but\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:11.440\nI wrote this down because I can't remember why I called her a Smurf.\n\n24:11.440 --> 24:15.160\nI was like, well, she was brushing her teeth and she was like, come on, let's go.\n\n24:15.160 --> 24:16.800\nI was like, yeah, you sound like a Smurf.\n\n24:16.800 --> 24:21.800\nIt was just, it was just a riff, but then her response was, she said, well, stop being\n\n24:21.800 --> 24:26.520\nSmurf lazy and Smurf brush your teeth.\n\n24:26.520 --> 24:31.520\nThat's not.\n\n24:31.520 --> 24:34.440\nI can't believe you don't know how Smurfs talk.\n\n24:34.440 --> 24:39.840\nSmurfs, all their adjectives, all their adjectives, all their adjectives are Smurf.\n\n24:39.840 --> 24:40.840\nOkay.\n\n24:40.840 --> 24:41.840\nSo tell me.\n\n24:41.840 --> 24:45.240\nSo you say I'm going to go park the car in Smurf ease.\n\n24:45.240 --> 24:46.240\nOkay.\n\n24:46.240 --> 24:50.520\nI'm going to go Smurf park my Smurf car.\n\n24:50.520 --> 24:51.520\nAmazing.\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:55.200\nYou're wrong.\n\n24:55.200 --> 24:58.600\nI'm going to go Smurf my Smurf.\n\n24:58.600 --> 24:59.600\nOh.\n\n24:59.600 --> 25:00.600\nYeah.\n\n25:00.600 --> 25:01.600\nWell, that's stupid.\n\n25:01.600 --> 25:02.600\nYeah.\n\n25:02.600 --> 25:08.320\nWell, they're Smurfs, they're fucking idiots and they're all dead now.\n\n25:08.320 --> 25:12.000\nYou don't even, it's not an adjective, it's a noun.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nYeah.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nYou can't tell what the fuck they're talking about.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nThat's the whole point of Smurfs.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:20.440\nThey make no Smurf when they talk.\n\n25:20.440 --> 25:26.360\nThey lean, they ask the question, how strong is context?\n\n25:26.360 --> 25:29.880\nAnd they go over the line to the point where they're like, what are you talking about?\n\n25:29.880 --> 25:33.000\nHoney, the boss gave me a Smurf today.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.680\nNo, fuck you or let's get married.\n\n25:36.680 --> 25:40.280\nDepending on what I find out later, Smurf is.\n\n25:40.280 --> 25:41.280\nYes, exactly.\n\n25:41.280 --> 25:42.280\nThat's the whole thing.\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:45.480\nI'm going to go Smurf brush your Smurf teeth.\n\n25:45.480 --> 25:46.480\nSo adorable.\n\n25:46.480 --> 25:49.760\nI can't believe that's the extent of my power.\n\n25:49.760 --> 25:51.360\nThat's what 12 years buys me.\n\n25:51.360 --> 25:53.960\nI'm lording that over here.\n\n25:53.960 --> 25:59.280\nYou'd think I'd have bigger arms or something or, I don't know, 12 years, like I should\n\n25:59.280 --> 26:03.880\nhave a unicorn or something instead of just some trivial knowledge about Smurfs.\n\n26:03.880 --> 26:07.480\nI don't know, I wonder, I have anxiety attacks.\n\n26:07.480 --> 26:08.680\nI'm feeling better.\n\n26:08.680 --> 26:09.680\nOkay.\n\n26:09.680 --> 26:13.880\nWell, let's change that by playing Dungeons and Dragons.\n\n26:13.880 --> 26:24.320\nAll right, Spencer, you want to take your position at the Dungeon Master table.\n\n26:24.320 --> 26:27.520\nSo for those of you who have never been here before and never listened before, a couple\n\n26:27.520 --> 26:31.160\nweeks ago, we started playing Dungeons and Dragons on this podcast.\n\n26:31.160 --> 26:37.280\nI've since then learned that there are several podcasts that play Dungeons and Dragons, and\n\n26:37.280 --> 26:41.760\nthat Brian Posein just launched one where that's all he's going to do.\n\n26:41.760 --> 26:45.600\nAnd I'm not going to let that stop me.\n\n26:45.600 --> 26:47.920\nI don't think you guys are having a terrible time.\n\n26:47.920 --> 26:49.320\nYou guys all seem very nice.\n\n26:49.320 --> 26:54.520\nCan we give it up for Spencer, who's really wonderful.\n\n26:54.520 --> 26:55.520\nThank you.\n\n26:55.520 --> 27:05.800\nAnd also, can you give it up for yourselves, we're going to a live show, that's exciting.\n\n27:05.800 --> 27:08.560\nThat counts as an accomplishment these days.\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:10.720\nThat's the new thing.\n\n27:10.720 --> 27:15.160\nWe were at the San Diego Zoo, and we came up with an idea that I thought was pretty cool,\n\n27:15.160 --> 27:17.640\nbecause I heard a baby crying, and you're walking around, you're so used to looking\n\n27:17.640 --> 27:21.960\nat animals, and you're seeing these signs with animals on them, and then I heard a\n\n27:21.960 --> 27:25.680\nbaby crying, and I couldn't tell where it was coming from, and I was like, that'd be\n\n27:25.680 --> 27:28.840\nweird if you walked around the corner, and there was a cage, and it was just a baby.\n\n27:28.840 --> 27:38.080\nAnd there's just a baby in there, and then I realized, baby zoo, like ingenious, because\n\n27:38.080 --> 27:43.760\npractically no overhead, because we're overpopulated, and they're everywhere.\n\n27:43.760 --> 27:48.680\nBut people like them, they like looking at them, women love them, and the cages are\n\n27:48.680 --> 27:57.360\ncheap, because they can't go anywhere, and then when they get old enough that they're\n\n27:57.360 --> 28:03.360\nnot fun to look at for women, you send them to an idiot zoo, because they haven't learned\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:10.200\nto do anything, because they've just been babies in a zoo, and guys would love that.\n\n28:10.200 --> 28:16.720\nThat's when you get the men money, because it's like three stooges, you just go through,\n\n28:16.720 --> 28:21.000\nand going through cage after cage of guys that were raised in captivity with no exposure\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:26.120\nto any alphabet or math, and they're just eating bricks, and guys would be high-fiving\n\n28:26.120 --> 28:30.240\neach other.\n\n28:30.240 --> 28:35.000\nPeople call me crazy, but I know how to save the economy.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nBaby zoo.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.600\nOr if you don't have money for idiot zoo, you get a giant take of water, and you drop\n\n28:39.600 --> 28:46.920\nall the babies in the water, and then you flash-freeze it, and you look crazy.\n\n28:46.920 --> 28:54.560\nThey'd all be in different positions, and they're soft-faced, and then you slice it\n\n28:54.560 --> 29:02.600\ninto different sections, and you'd ship it off to different places, like New York, and\n\n29:02.600 --> 29:06.600\nmy parents would pay for it, if I'm Eli Roth.\n\n29:06.600 --> 29:12.880\nGeez, I'm talking about a beautiful baby rolling around in some grass, or whatever\n\n29:12.880 --> 29:13.880\nbaby's like.\n\n29:13.880 --> 29:14.880\nMe too, man.\n\n29:14.880 --> 29:20.640\nYou burn them, you use the fertilizer for a field, and you take people on a tour through\n\n29:20.640 --> 29:26.000\nthe field, but you use baby's breath and stuff, and everyone's like, haha, I got it.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.240\nAll right, I got it.\n\n29:28.240 --> 29:31.240\nOr hats.\n\n29:31.240 --> 29:35.640\nErin Anastasia McGathey, how dare you.\n\n29:35.640 --> 29:36.640\nBaby zoo.\n\n29:36.640 --> 29:37.640\nBaby zoo.\n\n29:37.640 --> 29:38.640\nDon't look it up.\n\n29:38.640 --> 29:39.640\nThere won't be anything.\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:43.640\nNo, there may be something, and you might get in a lot of trouble for it, so don't look\n\n29:43.640 --> 29:44.640\nup anything.\n\n29:44.640 --> 29:50.200\nThere was another thing I thought I wanted to talk about.\n\n29:50.200 --> 29:53.920\nYou also had puppy zoo, and cooties.\n\n29:53.920 --> 29:54.920\nPuppy zoo.\n\n29:54.920 --> 29:59.680\nBut there's always that moment in the zoo where you, like any zoo you go to, you're\n\n29:59.680 --> 30:05.840\nlooking at a Bengal tiger, or a marmoset, or a taper, and then there's like a raccoon.\n\n30:05.840 --> 30:09.840\nAnd you can't figure out whether you're supposed to feel bad for it or good for it.\n\n30:09.840 --> 30:13.920\nLike, I remember taking a pee at the San Diego Zoo, and there was a spider on top of the\n\n30:13.920 --> 30:19.440\nurinal, and I came out, and I said, hey, Erin, there was a spider on the urinal, and I bet\n\n30:19.440 --> 30:23.120\nhe was trying to say to me like, hey, how do I get in on this?\n\n30:23.120 --> 30:29.640\nAnd Erin laughed, but ironically, and said, that is such a dad joke.\n\n30:29.640 --> 30:35.480\nNot to throw her into the bus, but just saying, maybe there should be a bad girlfriend zoo.\n\n30:35.480 --> 30:36.480\nUnsupportive.\n\n30:36.480 --> 30:43.280\nThat raccoon is right after the polar bear exhibit, so there's this beautiful thing called\n\n30:43.280 --> 30:47.640\nthe polar bear plunge, and you're seeing them underwater, and like on the ice, and they're\n\n30:47.640 --> 30:53.120\ntearing apart things, and they're having meetings in front of you, it's amazing.\n\n30:53.120 --> 30:57.600\nAnd then there's a raccoon right next to it, and you can't see him, he's hiding, of course\n\n30:57.600 --> 30:58.600\nhe's hiding.\n\n30:58.600 --> 31:04.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, I could be right outside the cage, and I would do nothing different,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nfuck you guys.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.800\nI'm cool hand-luking this, and I will be inside if you need me.\n\n31:08.800 --> 31:14.720\nSpeaking of people zoos, I'm sorry, Spencer, have you ever worked at a haunted house?\n\n31:14.720 --> 31:17.120\nOh, are you talking to me?\n\n31:17.120 --> 31:21.520\nYou said, I'm sorry, Spencer, have you ever worked at a haunted house, so I thought you\n\n31:21.520 --> 31:22.520\nwere insulting me.\n\n31:22.520 --> 31:26.920\nI'm sorry, Spencer, but you just look like you're really creepy.\n\n31:26.920 --> 31:30.920\nI'm sorry, Spencer, but should you be being paid to scare people right now for the March\n\n31:30.920 --> 31:31.920\nof Dimes?\n\n31:31.920 --> 31:35.720\nHas anyone ever volunteered or worked at a haunted house here?\n\n31:35.720 --> 31:36.720\nClap your hands.\n\n31:36.720 --> 31:37.720\nYeah.\n\n31:37.720 --> 31:39.360\nIt's kind of like being at a zoo.\n\n31:39.360 --> 31:45.360\nYou sit in one little station, and all day long you do one thing, like jump out of a coffin\n\n31:45.360 --> 31:49.240\nor be afraid by a hanger, or...\n\n31:49.240 --> 31:52.560\nYeah, afraid by a hanger.\n\n31:52.560 --> 31:57.200\nI would say that's the mommy dearest exhibit, but there's no 40-year-olds here that would\n\n31:57.200 --> 31:59.280\nlaugh at it.\n\n31:59.280 --> 32:00.280\nThe...\n\n32:00.280 --> 32:01.520\nGoddamn it.\n\n32:01.520 --> 32:05.320\nStop being smurf-lazy and smurf brush your teeth.\n\n32:05.320 --> 32:06.720\nI just kept seeing that.\n\n32:06.720 --> 32:10.000\nSorry, I got my little file.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.520\nAnd then one last thing.\n\n32:11.520 --> 32:13.680\nThis is the last thing.\n\n32:13.680 --> 32:15.040\nAfter this, we're off-roading.\n\n32:15.040 --> 32:16.040\nOkay.\n\n32:16.040 --> 32:21.320\nUntil now, it's been a Ruby on Rails.\n\n32:21.320 --> 32:26.800\nI was just having drinks with Erin before the show, and at Pikey, across the street.\n\n32:26.800 --> 32:27.800\nThanks, guys.\n\n32:27.800 --> 32:34.440\nAnd we split a little burger patty because of our stupid diet, and then they brought\n\n32:34.440 --> 32:39.240\nthe check and they put two little meringues on it, which we can't eat, but Erin took\n\n32:39.240 --> 32:43.800\nthe meringues and put them in her purse and said, I'm hiding these because I don't want\n\n32:43.800 --> 32:44.800\nto hurt her feelings.\n\n32:44.800 --> 32:45.800\nThat's it.\n\n32:45.800 --> 32:49.360\nI wrote it down.\n\n32:49.360 --> 32:52.800\nLike the waitress has a relationship with the meringues.\n\n32:52.800 --> 32:57.040\nWhen I was eight, I went to dinner with my mom and her childhood best friend, and her\n\n32:57.040 --> 33:01.520\nchildhood best friend made steak and put it down on the table, and I took a bite of it\n\n33:01.520 --> 33:04.240\nand I said to my mom, this tastes like rubber.\n\n33:04.240 --> 33:07.760\nAnd my mom took it and threw it in her purse, and she was like, shut up.\n\n33:07.760 --> 33:13.280\nAnd I sat there, and her best friend Denise came back in the room and she was like, whoa,\n\n33:13.280 --> 33:14.280\nbig appetite.\n\n33:14.280 --> 33:20.800\nAnd I was like, big appetite, and I was like, big appetite.\n\n33:20.800 --> 33:25.560\nAnd my mom had to throw away her purse, like she had meat in her purse.\n\n33:25.560 --> 33:26.560\nRIP.\n\n33:26.560 --> 33:31.440\nI'm pulling you to the chair, like Bill Cosby, because it's so fucking low-key tonight.\n\n33:31.440 --> 33:34.480\nLet's talk about a trip to the dentist for 45 minutes.\n\n33:34.480 --> 33:35.480\nI don't care.\n\n33:35.480 --> 33:38.480\nNo, because we're playing Dungeons and Dragons, and I'm going to nail it tonight.\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:39.480\nAm I playing Jeff's character?\n\n33:39.480 --> 33:40.480\nI guess we should just transition.\n\n33:40.480 --> 33:43.480\nI have a little surprise for you.\n\n33:43.480 --> 33:44.480\nOkay.\n\n33:44.480 --> 33:50.480\nYou just sit tight and let me play Dungeons and Dragons by myself.\n\n33:50.480 --> 33:51.480\nSurprise!\n\n33:51.480 --> 33:56.880\nDo I need my character sheet?\n\n33:56.880 --> 33:58.880\nSpencer, how are you tonight?\n\n33:58.880 --> 34:01.400\nI'm doing pretty good, are you?\n\n34:01.400 --> 34:03.400\nI'm good.\n\n34:03.400 --> 34:04.400\nGood.\n\n34:04.400 --> 34:08.880\nThis is engaging podcast talk.\n\n34:08.880 --> 34:10.880\nThank you, Sarkasmos.\n\n34:10.880 --> 34:13.880\nAll right, Spencer, you look very healthy.\n\n34:13.880 --> 34:14.880\nWhat?\n\n34:14.880 --> 34:15.880\nThat's so funny.\n\n34:15.880 --> 34:20.880\nThat's the first time that that's ever been said to me.\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:23.880\nYou look spry, or your cheeks are rosy.\n\n34:23.880 --> 34:24.880\nYou look healthy.\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:25.880\nOh, okay.\n\n34:25.880 --> 34:29.880\nI'm sorry, I'm possessed by a dying Jewish woman, I guess.\n\n34:29.880 --> 34:30.880\nI'm sorry.\n\n34:30.880 --> 34:31.880\nWell, thank you.\n\n34:31.880 --> 34:32.880\nAll right.\n\n34:32.880 --> 34:35.400\nTo recap as quickly as possible, I am Sharpie Buttsalot.\n\n34:35.400 --> 34:38.960\nI am a first level wizard.\n\n34:38.960 --> 34:47.000\nI have recently become friends with my previous rival, Quark, played by Jeff Davis.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:58.160\nWe fought a giant piggy bank and beat it, and then we got some treasure, and now I refuse\n\n34:58.160 --> 35:02.320\njust because Jeff's not here to not play the game, so, Spencer, tell me where I am\n\n35:02.320 --> 35:03.320\nand what's going on.\n\n35:03.320 --> 35:07.320\nWell, you're still in the cave, and after putting most of your treasure away, you notice\n\n35:07.320 --> 35:10.840\na strange wooden box.\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:13.320\nFor the podcast listeners, I have this physical box.\n\n35:13.320 --> 35:14.320\nCome and take it, please.\n\n35:14.320 --> 35:15.320\nOh, my God.\n\n35:15.320 --> 35:16.320\nWow.\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:23.320\nThis wooden box is stained purple with engraved stars and celestial bodies on its surface.\n\n35:23.320 --> 35:27.320\nOh, my God, Spencer's proposing to Dan.\n\n35:27.320 --> 35:33.320\nOh, my God.\n\n35:33.320 --> 35:38.320\nYou know, Dan, it's been great on this podcast in the past few weeks.\n\n35:38.320 --> 35:40.320\nI hope this campaign never ends.\n\n35:40.320 --> 35:44.320\nI know we took it to the next level in our relationship last week with that hug.\n\n35:44.320 --> 35:48.320\nIt meant a lot to me.\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:52.320\nWill you please level up with me forever and become immortal?\n\n35:52.320 --> 35:54.320\nAll right.\n\n35:54.320 --> 35:59.320\nWell, wait, so if I open it in real life, Spencer handed me a real box.\n\n35:59.320 --> 36:01.320\nThis is a little weird.\n\n36:01.320 --> 36:04.320\nSharpie Buttsalot found in his treasure.\n\n36:04.320 --> 36:07.320\nSo if I open it in real life, I'm opening it in the game, right?\n\n36:07.320 --> 36:10.320\nYeah, and if you open it in real life and it's a trap, you're going to die.\n\n36:10.320 --> 36:11.320\nOh, my God.\n\n36:11.320 --> 36:13.320\nSomeone tape it.\n\n36:13.320 --> 36:14.320\nAll right.\n\n36:14.320 --> 36:20.320\nWell, I'm not going to open it because I don't know if you know this about my character,\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:21.320\nbut I'm a pussy.\n\n36:21.320 --> 36:26.320\nI have a lot of anxiety.\n\n36:26.320 --> 36:29.320\nWhat happens if I cast Detect Magic on it?\n\n36:29.320 --> 36:33.320\nYou detect a small trace of unearthly magic coming from inside the box,\n\n36:33.320 --> 36:35.320\nbut the box itself does not seem magical.\n\n36:35.320 --> 36:36.320\nAll right.\n\n36:36.320 --> 36:45.320\nI examine it as much as I can for any kind of mechanisms like strings that lead to guns that are pointing at my face.\n\n36:45.320 --> 36:51.320\nYou look it over thoroughly and find that it doesn't appear to be trapped or mechanized in any way.\n\n36:51.320 --> 36:54.320\nI very carefully open the box.\n\n36:54.320 --> 36:58.320\nOpening the box very carefully, you see a small stone inside.\n\n36:58.320 --> 36:59.320\nI do.\n\n36:59.320 --> 37:02.320\nIn real life, I do, too.\n\n37:02.320 --> 37:04.320\nThat's the beauty of it.\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:08.320\nOh, well, I touched the stone in real life, but I'm not doing that in the game.\n\n37:08.320 --> 37:09.320\nYou can.\n\n37:09.320 --> 37:11.320\nI mean, it's not going to kill you.\n\n37:11.320 --> 37:12.320\nOh, all right.\n\n37:12.320 --> 37:13.320\nMaybe I just gave you a clue.\n\n37:13.320 --> 37:15.320\nSpencer, I'm right here.\n\n37:15.320 --> 37:19.320\nRight here.\n\n37:19.320 --> 37:20.320\nWhat?\n\n37:20.320 --> 37:23.320\nSide lay a small, iridescent stone.\n\n37:23.320 --> 37:29.320\nIts surface shines in many colors and shape is confusing, full of squared spirals and tiny ridges.\n\n37:29.320 --> 37:30.320\nYes.\n\n37:30.320 --> 37:32.320\nKind of like your relationship.\n\n37:32.320 --> 37:42.320\nThis is all an integrated marketing campaign for Spencer's girlfriend who owns a surf shop where she makes shitty jewelry.\n\n37:42.320 --> 37:45.320\nThat's beads on Pacific Avenue.\n\n37:45.320 --> 37:52.320\nYou find yourself enamored with this unique design, which can be ordered online.\n\n37:52.320 --> 37:53.320\nIt's called a quiggle.\n\n37:53.320 --> 37:56.320\nIt's supposed to bring you luck in finance.\n\n37:56.320 --> 37:57.320\nSorry.\n\n37:57.320 --> 38:04.320\nGrasping the stone in your hand, you feel its surface warm up and your surroundings fade to white, and you lose consciousness.\n\n38:04.320 --> 38:05.320\nWhat?\n\n38:05.320 --> 38:07.320\nThe next thing you know, you're outside the trove again.\n\n38:07.320 --> 38:10.320\nThe stone glows brightly than fades to dimness.\n\n38:10.320 --> 38:14.320\nThis must be the fragment of greatness that Derevon sent to you.\n\n38:14.320 --> 38:15.320\nOh, that's right.\n\n38:15.320 --> 38:22.320\nThe scrier who sent me and my friend of Quirk to the trove said that there was a fragment of greatness.\n\n38:22.320 --> 38:24.320\nDid you say I teleported?\n\n38:24.320 --> 38:25.320\nYeah.\n\n38:25.320 --> 38:29.320\nYou lost consciousness, and when you came to, you were outside the trove.\n\n38:29.320 --> 38:31.320\nAnd it wasn't anxiety.\n\n38:31.320 --> 38:32.320\nIt might have been.\n\n38:32.320 --> 38:33.320\nAll right.\n\n38:33.320 --> 38:35.320\nBut I teleported, so that doesn't happen.\n\n38:35.320 --> 38:36.320\nSharpie has his demons.\n\n38:36.320 --> 38:41.320\nAll right, well, then I'm done with that trove, so I'm going back to town.\n\n38:41.320 --> 38:42.320\nAll right.\n\n38:42.320 --> 38:48.320\nThe road back to Thornvale is wrong, well, is long, but you are confident after finding the fragment of greatness.\n\n38:48.320 --> 38:54.320\nYou see the familiar green rows of fields surrounding Thornvale, and it fills you with a sense of comfort and calm.\n\n38:54.320 --> 38:55.320\nThat's true.\n\n38:55.320 --> 38:59.320\nOn your left, you see a stables, and just pass it, the local tavern.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:01.320\nNow, I didn't come up with a tavern name.\n\n39:01.320 --> 39:03.320\nI thought the audience might want to name the tavern, maybe.\n\n39:03.320 --> 39:04.320\nAll right.\n\n39:04.320 --> 39:05.320\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n39:05.320 --> 39:06.320\nDavid.\n\n39:06.320 --> 39:08.320\nUh, uh, what?\n\n39:08.320 --> 39:09.320\nMadlib style.\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:11.320\nDo you want to name a tavern?\n\n39:11.320 --> 39:12.320\nUh, sure.\n\n39:12.320 --> 39:13.320\nTake your time.\n\n39:13.320 --> 39:16.320\nI'm going to make a drink, and we can edit out the pause.\n\n39:16.320 --> 39:17.320\nSo just take your time.\n\n39:17.320 --> 39:24.320\nYou're not under any pressure to be as magnificently witty and quick as I have been tonight.\n\n39:24.320 --> 39:26.320\nYou can take...\n\n39:26.320 --> 39:30.320\nJust listen to this music, and think of a tavern name.\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:33.320\nErin, you can talk about pantyhose or something, will you?\n\n39:33.320 --> 39:43.320\nPantyhose, for times when you feel like your legs are a little too pale, or for when you\n\n39:43.320 --> 39:50.320\nare dating someone who says that he likes pantyhose.\n\n39:50.320 --> 39:56.320\nPantyhose, for ladies who want to feel like Sigourney Weaver in the 80s.\n\n39:56.320 --> 39:58.320\nBut have varicose veins.\n\n39:58.320 --> 40:04.320\nOkay, pantyhose, for when you have a meeting in the morning and a burglary at night.\n\n40:04.320 --> 40:05.320\nPantyhose.\n\n40:05.320 --> 40:06.320\nThanks.\n\n40:06.320 --> 40:17.320\nFor the record, I wore tights and pantyhose before we dated.\n\n40:17.320 --> 40:18.320\nI know.\n\n40:18.320 --> 40:19.320\nThat's important to me.\n\n40:19.320 --> 40:20.320\nI know.\n\n40:20.320 --> 40:21.320\nYeah.\n\n40:21.320 --> 40:22.320\nI know you know.\n\n40:22.320 --> 40:24.320\nThis isn't awkward at all.\n\n40:24.320 --> 40:29.320\nYeah, what do you think I like to?\n\n40:29.320 --> 40:31.320\nBecause of your personality.\n\n40:31.320 --> 40:33.320\nMy hands of your brain.\n\n40:33.320 --> 40:34.320\nAlright.\n\n40:34.320 --> 40:36.320\nI love you.\n\n40:36.320 --> 40:37.320\nI love you too.\n\n40:37.320 --> 40:40.320\nThank you for taking my anxiety attack away at the San Diego Zoo.\n\n40:40.320 --> 40:42.320\nWell, I care about you.\n\n40:42.320 --> 40:45.320\nI want you to feel better.\n\n40:45.320 --> 40:48.320\nWhat was your name again?\n\n40:48.320 --> 40:49.320\nDavid.\n\n40:49.320 --> 40:53.320\nAlright, David, what's the tavern name?\n\n40:53.320 --> 40:55.320\nChacha's Tavern.\n\n40:55.320 --> 40:56.320\nChacha's Tavern, alright.\n\n40:56.320 --> 40:59.320\nI think that's in Silver Lake, isn't it?\n\n40:59.320 --> 41:02.320\nIt's not a tavern in Silver Lake, it's a bar.\n\n41:02.320 --> 41:04.320\nChacha's Tavern.\n\n41:04.320 --> 41:06.320\nChacha's Tavern.\n\n41:06.320 --> 41:09.320\nThe tavern is a welcoming place.\n\n41:09.320 --> 41:14.320\nIt has a large lounge with polished tables and a puffy chairs and a long bar.\n\n41:14.320 --> 41:17.320\nSeveral humans, gnomes, elves and halflings are mingling.\n\n41:17.320 --> 41:22.320\nAnd a gnome is standing on the counter pouring steins of beer from a large keg.\n\n41:22.320 --> 41:25.320\nI assume that Quark and I kind of...\n\n41:25.320 --> 41:28.320\nQuark's a bit tired after his rage.\n\n41:28.320 --> 41:29.320\nHe's not saying much.\n\n41:29.320 --> 41:30.320\nHe's kind of...\n\n41:30.320 --> 41:31.320\nOh, is he with me?\n\n41:31.320 --> 41:32.320\nYeah, he's just hanging out.\n\n41:32.320 --> 41:33.320\nOh, okay.\n\n41:33.320 --> 41:34.320\nHey, Quark.\n\n41:34.320 --> 41:35.320\nHe's doing a show in Chicago, right?\n\n41:35.320 --> 41:37.320\nWell, why don't we get our...\n\n41:37.320 --> 41:41.320\nI'm going to talk to the tavern keep about getting a room.\n\n41:41.320 --> 41:43.320\nDo they have rooms to let at this tavern?\n\n41:43.320 --> 41:46.320\nYeah, this tavern has an upper floor with some rooms.\n\n41:46.320 --> 41:47.320\nAlright.\n\n41:47.320 --> 41:48.320\nAlright.\n\n41:48.320 --> 41:51.320\nSo you head up to the tavern keeper.\n\n41:51.320 --> 41:52.320\nYeah.\n\n41:52.320 --> 41:54.320\nHe's this gnome standing on the counter.\n\n41:54.320 --> 41:56.320\nHis name is Chacha.\n\n41:56.320 --> 41:57.320\nAlright.\n\n41:57.320 --> 41:59.320\nHe's the bartender and the keeper of the tavern.\n\n41:59.320 --> 42:02.320\nHe's a white-haired gnome with thin beard and he says...\n\n42:02.320 --> 42:04.320\nHe sees you coming up and he's like,\n\n42:04.320 --> 42:06.320\nWhat'll you drink?\n\n42:06.320 --> 42:09.320\nI'll have a flagon of ale.\n\n42:09.320 --> 42:10.320\nA flagon of ale?\n\n42:10.320 --> 42:12.320\nThat'll be three copper.\n\n42:12.320 --> 42:13.320\nOh, alright.\n\n42:13.320 --> 42:16.320\nWhat a bargain at twice the price, me thinks.\n\n42:16.320 --> 42:23.320\nWhat say you for two rooms, a tuppence or a shilling for Wayne's cutting?\n\n42:23.320 --> 42:28.320\nI could part with two rooms for only three silvers.\n\n42:28.320 --> 42:29.320\nAlright.\n\n42:29.320 --> 42:32.320\nHere, I assume I have three silvers.\n\n42:32.320 --> 42:35.320\nActually, you only got gold pieces from the treasure.\n\n42:35.320 --> 42:36.320\nYou don't even...\n\n42:36.320 --> 42:38.320\nI'm so sorry.\n\n42:38.320 --> 42:40.320\nAccident.\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:42.320\nThey hate gold.\n\n42:42.320 --> 42:47.320\nI'm very sorry.\n\n42:47.320 --> 42:49.320\nThere's an accident.\n\n42:49.320 --> 42:54.320\nErin just put her elbow on her soundboard iPad app.\n\n42:54.320 --> 42:56.320\nI thought it was a boing.\n\n42:56.320 --> 43:00.320\nIt doesn't make as much noise.\n\n43:00.320 --> 43:03.320\nNo, I thought that was a hooray.\n\n43:03.320 --> 43:04.320\nSorry.\n\n43:04.320 --> 43:06.320\nIt's mixed pretty high.\n\n43:06.320 --> 43:13.320\nAll right.\n\n43:13.320 --> 43:14.320\nHere's a gold piece.\n\n43:14.320 --> 43:16.320\nKeep the change.\n\n43:16.320 --> 43:17.320\nOh, wow.\n\n43:17.320 --> 43:18.320\nA high rule.\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:22.320\nAre you an adventurer?\n\n43:22.320 --> 43:23.320\nYes.\n\n43:23.320 --> 43:25.320\nAnd I'm new to Maine.\n\n43:25.320 --> 43:30.320\nI've never been in the lighthouse district.\n\n43:30.320 --> 43:31.320\nYes.\n\n43:31.320 --> 43:32.320\nI'm an adventurer.\n\n43:32.320 --> 43:36.320\nAnd I'd like to make sure our rooms are particularly safe.\n\n43:36.320 --> 43:40.320\nSo keep the change in exchange for your constant vigilance.\n\n43:40.320 --> 43:41.320\nMuch obliged, sir.\n\n43:41.320 --> 43:43.320\nBut have you seen this?\n\n43:43.320 --> 43:45.320\nEmotions to a poster on the wall.\n\n43:45.320 --> 43:47.320\nIt's a wanted poster.\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:50.320\nIt says, Wanted the Embermaller.\n\n43:50.320 --> 43:54.320\nThere's a picture that looks like a lion with a flaming mane\n\n43:54.320 --> 43:58.320\nand some two tails it's made with pastel crayons.\n\n43:58.320 --> 43:59.320\nThere you go.\n\n43:59.320 --> 44:01.320\nThat's good.\n\n44:01.320 --> 44:04.320\nThe charred dismembered corpses of cats, dogs,\n\n44:04.320 --> 44:07.320\nand most recently a thorn veil mare have been found\n\n44:07.320 --> 44:11.320\nand reports of a black burnt crops have been made in the fields.\n\n44:11.320 --> 44:14.320\nThirty silver pieces for any information on this beast\n\n44:14.320 --> 44:18.320\nor fourteen hundred gold pieces for its head.\n\n44:18.320 --> 44:19.320\nInteresting.\n\n44:19.320 --> 44:20.320\nThanks for the tip.\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:24.320\nAs you read the sign, you notice someone seems to be staring at you\n\n44:24.320 --> 44:27.320\nand seeing you look at the sign.\n\n44:27.320 --> 44:29.320\nAm I noticing them peripherally?\n\n44:29.320 --> 44:32.320\nYou just feel the sense of being watched.\n\n44:32.320 --> 44:35.320\nI look at them.\n\n44:35.320 --> 44:38.320\nYou see a tall, thin, is it an elf?\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:40.320\nNo, it's a half elf.\n\n44:40.320 --> 44:41.320\nLoved by all.\n\n44:41.320 --> 44:43.320\nLoved by all.\n\n44:43.320 --> 44:49.320\nStanding with a bow and a sheath sword in the corner of the room.\n\n44:49.320 --> 44:54.320\nHe seems to be interested in your looking at the poster.\n\n44:54.320 --> 44:59.320\nAll right, so for the podcast listeners, this is Erin's character.\n\n44:59.320 --> 45:02.320\nThank you.\n\n45:02.320 --> 45:03.320\nThank you.\n\n45:03.320 --> 45:04.320\nThank you.\n\n45:04.320 --> 45:06.320\nI have a sheet.\n\n45:06.320 --> 45:07.320\nThank you.\n\n45:07.320 --> 45:09.320\nHow could this go wrong?\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:12.320\nGood morrow, sir Batsalot.\n\n45:12.320 --> 45:13.320\nBatsalot.\n\n45:13.320 --> 45:14.320\nSharpie.\n\n45:14.320 --> 45:16.320\nYou know my name.\n\n45:16.320 --> 45:21.320\nI have heard of you.\n\n45:21.320 --> 45:24.320\nYou have me at a disadvantage, Mr.\n\n45:24.320 --> 45:26.320\nSedana.\n\n45:26.320 --> 45:30.320\nMorrain.\n\n45:30.320 --> 45:36.320\nMay I bow to you?\n\n45:36.320 --> 45:40.320\nI can't stop you?\n\n45:40.320 --> 45:47.320\nWell, regard me bowing for it is a great honor to witness the bow of an elf human.\n\n45:47.320 --> 45:49.320\nBow.\n\n45:49.320 --> 45:50.320\nI'm also a ranger.\n\n45:50.320 --> 45:54.320\nYour bow is so loud.\n\n45:54.320 --> 46:01.320\nI will I have put on my loud robes today.\n\n46:01.320 --> 46:03.320\nTell me what you know of this lion.\n\n46:03.320 --> 46:08.320\nI know that I just started looking at it on a sign.\n\n46:08.320 --> 46:11.320\nAnd that then you started staring at me.\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:15.320\nAnd that now you say you know me and are bowing loudly.\n\n46:15.320 --> 46:20.320\nYou and I are on the same page now across the board, we're all caught up.\n\n46:20.320 --> 46:24.320\nWell, I could sense your energy across the room, dear sir.\n\n46:24.320 --> 46:37.320\nI feel like you and I shall be friends forever and I shall be involved in every adventure that you have from here on out.\n\n46:37.320 --> 46:40.320\nInteresting.\n\n46:40.320 --> 46:43.320\nWell, regard my bow.\n\n46:43.320 --> 46:51.320\nIt's so cloying and invasive, like its owner.\n\n46:51.320 --> 46:53.320\nMay I join your team?\n\n46:53.320 --> 46:54.320\nWhat's up?\n\n46:54.320 --> 46:55.320\nMay I join your team?\n\n46:55.320 --> 46:59.320\nI recognize that you and your lover are on a long journey.\n\n46:59.320 --> 47:01.320\nAll right, hold on a second.\n\n47:01.320 --> 47:04.320\nI just want to stop you there.\n\n47:04.320 --> 47:06.320\nHe's a very good friend of mine.\n\n47:06.320 --> 47:08.320\nWe met in the howling mines.\n\n47:08.320 --> 47:12.320\nIt seems that his face is at dick height, yes?\n\n47:12.320 --> 47:21.320\nI don't wish to be disrespectful, sir.\n\n47:21.320 --> 47:23.320\nOnly understanding.\n\n47:23.320 --> 47:27.320\nCan I inquire as to your specialties, what you're bringing to the table?\n\n47:27.320 --> 47:29.320\nShould we go on an adventure together?\n\n47:29.320 --> 47:33.320\nFor now, I shall let you know one of one of my special abilities.\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:39.320\nFor I am full of mystery and that makes people like me more.\n\n47:39.320 --> 47:43.320\nI am immune to sleep.\n\n47:43.320 --> 47:45.320\nLet us adventure.\n\n47:45.320 --> 47:47.320\nDo you like cookies?\n\n47:47.320 --> 47:49.320\nI also have cookies.\n\n47:49.320 --> 47:53.320\nYou got cookies, yeah.\n\n47:53.320 --> 47:58.320\nYeah, I like the cut of your jib.\n\n47:58.320 --> 48:00.320\nThank you, sir.\n\n48:00.320 --> 48:05.320\nI think that I just have to make sure that you're not going to murder us in our sleep.\n\n48:05.320 --> 48:07.320\nOh, of course not, sir.\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:09.320\nI've never been known to murder.\n\n48:09.320 --> 48:12.320\nIn fact, I'm kneeling.\n\n48:12.320 --> 48:15.320\nI'm taking my hand and I'm crossing it across my chest.\n\n48:15.320 --> 48:26.320\nSir, all of the sedanas have been onerous since the beginning.\n\n48:26.320 --> 48:35.320\nWe existed with the dinosaurs and the fungi and the rocks and the storms.\n\n48:35.320 --> 48:45.320\nI've always been here bringing goodness to the world and no harm has been inflicted on part by part.\n\n48:45.320 --> 48:50.320\nWe haven't done anything wrong.\n\n48:50.320 --> 48:52.320\nI accept your oath.\n\n48:52.320 --> 48:57.320\nI grew up in a family without honor and I appreciate people who have it.\n\n48:57.320 --> 49:07.320\nI've always dreamed of being part of a family that had some kind of tether to the realm of good things.\n\n49:07.320 --> 49:09.320\nWe'll speak no more!\n\n49:09.320 --> 49:10.320\nAdventure!\n\n49:10.320 --> 49:18.320\nYes, let's bound out of the tavern and into adventure while my gnome friend sleeps.\n\n49:18.320 --> 49:23.320\nIf you would like to be alone with your sleeping gnome friend, I understand.\n\n49:23.320 --> 49:28.320\nListen, man, you got the wrong idea about that.\n\n49:28.320 --> 49:30.320\nLike, I barely know the guy.\n\n49:30.320 --> 49:33.320\nWe go on adventures together, okay?\n\n49:33.320 --> 49:38.320\nAnd I'm not saying there'd be anything wrong with it if we were partners in that sense.\n\n49:38.320 --> 49:40.320\nI'm just saying it's not the way it is.\n\n49:40.320 --> 49:43.320\nYou got the wrong idea, man.\n\n49:43.320 --> 49:48.320\nAs the earth is unashamed of his rivers,\n\n49:48.320 --> 49:53.320\nhonesty is like water, let your water flow and be happy.\n\n49:53.320 --> 49:56.320\nAdventure!\n\n49:56.320 --> 50:02.320\nAlright, well, I feel like an adventure would take too long at this point.\n\n50:02.320 --> 50:08.320\nI've come a long way and we need to sleep.\n\n50:08.320 --> 50:17.320\nFine, well, I am immune to sleep, so enjoy your sleep, I shall dance and plan and dream and sing.\n\n50:17.320 --> 50:21.320\nAre you staying here in the tavern?\n\n50:21.320 --> 50:24.320\nYes, I am not leaving you.\n\n50:24.320 --> 50:26.320\nEver.\n\n50:26.320 --> 50:30.320\nI am part of this.\n\n50:30.320 --> 50:31.320\nHaha!\n\n50:31.320 --> 50:39.320\nI should go up to Quark's room and ask him if he's willing to have a Solomon Goldberg?\n\n50:39.320 --> 50:41.320\nWhat's your name?\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:43.320\nQuite alright.\n\n50:43.320 --> 50:45.320\nLorraine Sedona.\n\n50:45.320 --> 50:47.320\nI got the stairs to Quark's room.\n\n50:47.320 --> 50:49.320\nYou open the door.\n\n50:49.320 --> 50:53.320\nQuark is trying to get to sleep, but he hasn't quite got to sleep.\n\n50:53.320 --> 50:55.320\nHe seems kind of bothered.\n\n50:55.320 --> 50:58.320\nI nudge him gently.\n\n50:58.320 --> 51:00.320\nWhat?\n\n51:00.320 --> 51:10.320\nQuark, this is Solana Gomez.\n\n51:10.320 --> 51:17.320\nDo you want to get the quick verification that she will be involved permanently in all her adventures forever?\n\n51:17.320 --> 51:19.320\nWell, does she have a bow?\n\n51:19.320 --> 51:27.320\nDo I have a bow? Does the earth have dirt? Do the oceans have water? Yes, I have a bow! Adventure!\n\n51:27.320 --> 51:29.320\nWell, you guys let me sleep.\n\n51:29.320 --> 51:36.320\nYes, I know that you're metaphorically out of town by being in bed.\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:39.320\nAnd your butt is full of cum.\n\n51:39.320 --> 51:41.320\nThat's not true.\n\n51:41.320 --> 51:44.320\nI don't know where you got that impression.\n\n51:44.320 --> 51:49.320\nThere's a giant mythical planet full of people traveling in all kinds of combinations.\n\n51:49.320 --> 51:52.320\nThis isn't the first time two dudes have hung out together.\n\n51:52.320 --> 51:57.320\nWhy do you keep... Your fixation is making me think that there's shit up with you.\n\n51:57.320 --> 52:01.320\nWhen you're ready, you'll be ready.\n\n52:01.320 --> 52:04.320\nAlright, well, then we all go to sleep for the night.\n\n52:04.320 --> 52:10.320\nDo you have a room? Sadama Hussein?\n\n52:10.320 --> 52:13.320\nMoraine Sadana. Yes, I have my room.\n\n52:13.320 --> 52:15.320\nMy room is the forest.\n\n52:15.320 --> 52:18.320\nGo to sleep in the woods and we'll...\n\n52:18.320 --> 52:22.320\nI am immune to sleep, so I will walk the woods.\n\n52:22.320 --> 52:23.320\nIt's quite alright, sir.\n\n52:23.320 --> 52:27.320\nLet's meet at six in the lobby.\n\n52:27.320 --> 52:38.320\nAlright. Okay, Spencer everybody.\n\n52:38.320 --> 52:41.320\nAlright, so it comes to this point in the show.\n\n52:41.320 --> 52:43.320\nThis has happened before.\n\n52:43.320 --> 52:47.320\nWe're trying to figure out how this isn't the worst Harmontown ever.\n\n52:47.320 --> 52:52.320\nWhat do we do? We're going to go for broke. We're going to do something.\n\n52:52.320 --> 52:54.320\nSo we have to close up the show.\n\n52:54.320 --> 53:02.320\nWe have to go to a weird, personal, revelatory, exciting, interesting place.\n\n53:02.320 --> 53:04.320\nOkay. Help me out.\n\n53:04.320 --> 53:07.320\nAlright.\n\n53:07.320 --> 53:10.320\nWeird, personal for you and I.\n\n53:10.320 --> 53:12.320\nI don't know.\n\n53:12.320 --> 53:16.320\nWell, it's not going to be for any of them. I don't know them.\n\n53:16.320 --> 53:19.320\nOh, I smell... I like your shirt.\n\n53:19.320 --> 53:21.320\nLet's get deep.\n\n53:21.320 --> 53:22.320\nI like your shirt.\n\n53:22.320 --> 53:25.320\nI'll take another look at my phone, I swear.\n\n53:25.320 --> 53:28.320\nWe're going to remind people about Jareth Halloween.\n\n53:28.320 --> 53:31.320\nEverybody dresses Jareth as Halloween. Jareth from the lab.\n\n53:31.320 --> 53:36.320\nDid we announce it that Jeff has hired a costumer for his costume?\n\n53:36.320 --> 53:38.320\nIt's true. This shit is on.\n\n53:38.320 --> 53:43.320\nWe were having a conversation about Halloween and, yeah, Jeff...\n\n53:43.320 --> 53:47.320\nHired a costumer. He told us he was going to a fitting for a television show.\n\n53:47.320 --> 53:52.320\nAnd then we were hanging out with him and he had to go several times and I was like,\n\n53:52.320 --> 53:54.320\nwhat is your fitting for? And he's like, I'll tell you.\n\n53:54.320 --> 53:58.320\nHe's not a liar and didn't want to lie and told us that he was getting fitted for his costume.\n\n53:58.320 --> 54:01.320\nSo we got to measure up.\n\n54:01.320 --> 54:03.320\nJareth is a character.\n\n54:03.320 --> 54:08.320\nI'm very excited because that movie meant a lot to me as a kid.\n\n54:08.320 --> 54:12.320\nBig deal. Shaped me a lot, sexually.\n\n54:12.320 --> 54:14.320\nYou know what meant a lot to me as Robocop?\n\n54:14.320 --> 54:18.320\nIf I ever get the nuts up... Thank you, gentlemen, ladies.\n\n54:18.320 --> 54:22.320\nIf I ever get the nuts up, it would look like a really good Robocop costume.\n\n54:22.320 --> 54:25.320\nAnd I heard they're remaking Robocop.\n\n54:25.320 --> 54:27.320\nThey're remaking everything.\n\n54:27.320 --> 54:31.320\nI feel like I'm being baited to go, don't remake it.\n\n54:31.320 --> 54:34.320\nI don't care. Just bury me.\n\n54:34.320 --> 54:37.320\nBury me in your remake, Pete Moss.\n\n54:37.320 --> 54:39.320\nI get what you're doing.\n\n54:39.320 --> 54:42.320\nYou're telling me that you don't care if I come to the movies anymore.\n\n54:42.320 --> 54:44.320\nI get it. It's not my money that you don't care.\n\n54:44.320 --> 54:45.320\nHow about this?\n\n54:45.320 --> 54:46.320\nIt's 18-year-old people.\n\n54:46.320 --> 54:48.320\nI don't know what Total Recall is.\n\n54:48.320 --> 54:50.320\nI don't know what Robocop is.\n\n54:50.320 --> 54:54.320\nI feel... How do you think that makes me feel Hollywood?\n\n54:54.320 --> 54:56.320\nIt's a bummer. Robocop's a perfect movie.\n\n54:56.320 --> 54:58.320\nYou don't have to be like...\n\n54:58.320 --> 54:59.320\nAs you're...\n\n54:59.320 --> 55:01.320\nWhat the hell? First of all...\n\n55:01.320 --> 55:04.320\nFucking... You know what's great about Robocop?\n\n55:04.320 --> 55:07.320\nIt wasn't a goddamn remake!\n\n55:07.320 --> 55:09.320\nWhat the fuck?\n\n55:09.320 --> 55:12.320\nListen to the title of the fucking movie!\n\n55:12.320 --> 55:15.320\nDo you know how dumb sounding that is? Robocop?\n\n55:15.320 --> 55:20.320\nAnd the poster is a dude that fucking looks like the Tin Man.\n\n55:20.320 --> 55:21.320\nHe just... That's it.\n\n55:21.320 --> 55:24.320\nHe just looks like the modern version of the Tin Man.\n\n55:24.320 --> 55:28.320\nModern circa 1986, whatever it was.\n\n55:28.320 --> 55:30.320\n87, 88, I think it was 88.\n\n55:30.320 --> 55:32.320\nWhat was it? You know. You're not in your head.\n\n55:32.320 --> 55:33.320\nI saw you.\n\n55:33.320 --> 55:34.320\nOkay.\n\n55:34.320 --> 55:35.320\nI thought it was like...\n\n55:35.320 --> 55:36.320\nI knew my kid was here.\n\n55:36.320 --> 55:39.320\nNow, there's a poster like... It's a fucking guy.\n\n55:39.320 --> 55:41.320\nIt's just Peter Weller encased in fucking plastic.\n\n55:41.320 --> 55:43.320\nIt was a fucking dumb robot suit.\n\n55:43.320 --> 55:44.320\nAnd the poster said...\n\n55:44.320 --> 55:47.320\nPart man, part machine, all cop.\n\n55:47.320 --> 55:49.320\nAnd you did Robocop.\n\n55:49.320 --> 55:51.320\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.\n\n55:51.320 --> 55:53.320\nBut here's the crazy thing.\n\n55:53.320 --> 55:55.320\nGreat movie!\n\n55:55.320 --> 55:57.320\nAmazing movie!\n\n55:57.320 --> 56:01.320\nAnd it didn't... It wasn't a revisitation of anything.\n\n56:01.320 --> 56:03.320\nSo now you're revisiting it.\n\n56:03.320 --> 56:04.320\nWhy?\n\n56:04.320 --> 56:08.320\nWhy can't... How hard can it be to make another Robocop\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:10.320\nwithout calling it Robocop?\n\n56:10.320 --> 56:13.320\nHere, speaker head.\n\n56:13.320 --> 56:15.320\nI'm looking across the room. I see a speaker.\n\n56:15.320 --> 56:17.320\nSpeaker head.\n\n56:17.320 --> 56:21.320\nPart speaker, part head.\n\n56:21.320 --> 56:25.320\nAll crossing guard.\n\n56:25.320 --> 56:27.320\nI'm proving the theory wrong, aren't I?\n\n56:27.320 --> 56:30.320\nMaybe it's not that easy, but an hour?\n\n56:30.320 --> 56:31.320\nIf you had an hour?\n\n56:31.320 --> 56:32.320\nDead.\n\n56:32.320 -->

ass,\n\n57:20.320 --> 57:22.320\nand then he pulls the broken glass out of his ass?\n\n57:22.320 --> 57:24.320\nMaybe there's a movie there.\n\n57:24.320 --> 57:26.320\nAdapt it into something.\n\n57:26.320 --> 57:27.320\nWhat was that guy thinking?\n\n57:27.320 --> 57:28.320\nWhat's he doing?\n\n57:28.320 --> 57:30.320\nHe's just holding a glass.\n\n57:30.320 --> 57:32.320\nYeah,

guarantee your movie is going to make money\n\n58:19.320 --> 58:21.320\nbased on the variables of,\n\n58:21.320 --> 58:23.320\nwell, you take Matt Damon and you put him in it,\n\n58:23.320 --> 58:26.320\nand then you take this thing where the wild things are.\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:30.320\nThat was a hit book, and then you shoot it in 3D\n\n58:30.320 --> 58:32.320\nand you can guarantee the overseas.\n\n58:32.320 --> 58:34.320\nCome on, man, like fucking,\n\n58:34.320 --> 58:37.320\npeople used to wing it a little bit.\n\n58:37.320 --> 58:41.320\nDan hates romantic comedies\n\n58:41.320 --> 58:45.320\nbecause he hates the idea of people cheating on people,\n\n58:45.320 --> 58:47.320\nand he's convinced that every romantic comedy\n\n58:47.320 --> 58:50.320\nis about people cheating on people.\n\n58:50.320 --> 58:52.320\nAnd recently, Dan and I got in a very, very big fight,\n\n58:52.320 --> 58:56.320\nbecause I never asked Dan to watch romantic comedies with me,\n\n58:56.320 --> 58:58.320\nbut I wait till he's asleep,\n\n58:58.320 --> 59:01.320\nand then I put on a romantic comedy,\n\n59:01.320 --> 59:04.320\nand I was watching the five-year engagement\n\n59:04.320 --> 59:07.320\nwith Alison Brie from your fucking show.\n\n59:07.320 --> 59:10.320\nIt wasn't a five-year engagement.\n\n59:10.320 --> 59:12.320\nIt was a two-year relationship,\n\n59:12.320 --> 59:14.320\nand then they broke up for two years,\n\n59:14.320 --> 59:16.320\nand then they got back together.\n\n59:16.320 --> 59:18.320\nYou didn't watch the movie.\n\n59:18.320 --> 59:20.320\nHe woke up in the middle, and you didn't watch any of that.\n\n59:20.320 --> 59:22.320\nHe woke up in the middle, like, in a fever dream,\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:23.320\nand it was like,\n\n59:23.320 --> 59:26.320\nfucking romantic comedies, movie industry,\n\n59:26.320 --> 59:29.320\nyou're cheating on somebody, get together,\n\n59:29.320 --> 59:31.320\nand, no, I want to be with

restaurant.\n\n59:45.320 --> 59:47.320\nIt's a seasoning.\n\n59:47.320 --> 59:49.320\nRomance is a fucking seasoning.\n\n59:49.320 --> 59:50.320\nIt's not a plot point.\n\n59:50.320 --> 59:52.320\nAdam, you're killing me.\n\n59:52.320 --> 59:54.320\nNo, I don't disagree with you.\n\n59:54.320 --> 59:56.320\nHe hadn't watched the movie.\n\n59:56.320 --> 59:57.320\nI watched it when he was asleep.\n\n59:57.320 --> 59:58.320\nI leaned over and I was like,\n\n59:58.320 --> 59:59.320\noh, I'm sorry, Dan.\n\n59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.320\nI don't be upset, and I kissed him.\n\n01:00:01.320

01:00:10.320\nI talk in my sleep.\n\n01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320\nHe was asleep.\n\n01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320\nAnd I was asleep.\n\n01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320\nThat's not...\n\n01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.320\nYou're making everyone think I'm a weird scarface.\n\n01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.320\nI talk in my sleep.\n\n01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320\nI sleep with all this cocaine,\n\n01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320\nand then these guns,\n\n01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.320\nand they were his friends.\n\n01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.320\nI talk in my sleep.\n\n01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320\nWell, you tell him the thing I said.\n\n01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320\nWhat was the thing?\n\n01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320\nThe...\n\n01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320\nWhich

write it down,\n\n01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320\nand he...\n\n01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.320\nIt sounded like a movie pitch.\n\n01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.320\nAnd he...\n\n01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.320\nI can remember it.\n\n01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320\nHe said,\n\n01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.320\nIt's the 70s.\n\n01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.320\nBut it was...\n\n01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.320\nIs it 70s?\n\n01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320\nMy mouth's got this rain.\n\n01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320\nAnd I'm just gonna...\n\n01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320\nThere.\n\n01:00:55.320

01:01:00.320\nThey're all shooting us.\n\n01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.320\nThere's this campaign here.\n\n01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320\nAnd he's gonna...\n\n01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320\nShittles!\n\n01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320\nShittles!\n\n01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320\nThere's like a pitch.\n\n01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320\nIt sounds good.\n\n01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320\nI'm developing in my sleep.\n\n01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.320\nIt's the 70s.\n\n01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320\nIn a world where disco is...\n\n01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320\nDisco is...\n\n01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320\nDisco is...\n\n01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320\nDisco is...\n\n01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320\nDisco is...\n\n01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320\nDisco is...\n\n01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:21.320\nDisco is the way you dance, and bullets are what you use to shoot.\n\n01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.320\nShiddles.\n\n01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.320\nDon't make them angry.\n\n01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.320\nThey'll dance all over you with their poop.\n\n01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.320\nThey'll dance all over you.\n\n01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:36.320\nI'm just saying, you...\n\n01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.320\nHere's the thing about movies.\n\n01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.320\nYeah.\n\n01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.320\nYou can just make them up as you go.\n\n01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:50.320\nSpeaking of making them up, Dan and I did an improvised movie like a month ago.\n\n01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.320\nWhere's this going?\n\n01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.320\nCould we get a suggestion of a moody title?\n\n01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.320\nWait, you want to close the show with more improv movie things?\n\n01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.320\nCan we hash out the rom-com thing?\n\n01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.320\nBecause when you and I talk about it and there's no one else around,\n\n01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.320\nit's seriously, I swear to God, it sounds like a bit...\n\n01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.320\nWe've never fought about anything more severely.\n\n01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320\nHere's the thing, I never make you watch them,\n\n01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.320\nand you get mad at me for watching them,\n\n01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.320\nand then tell me that it's not a big deal that I watch them.\n\n01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.320\nBut I don't make you watch them.\n\n01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.320\nI just don't want...\n\n01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.320\nYou don't make me watch them, but then I go,\n\n01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.320\nwell, I go to the sci-fi fantasy section,\n\n01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.320\nand you kind of like, come on, you roll your eyes a little bit.\n\n01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.320\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.320\nThe time that you're talking about was after a very big fight we had\n\n01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320\nwhere you were in the wrong,\n\n01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.320\nand I made a bit saying, well, I thought you were going to get a hug,\n\n01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.320\nand then it became a big thing.\n\n01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.320\nExactly, we got in a fight about something else,\n\n01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320\nyou went to the bathroom, and I started picking out a movie,\n\n01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.320\nand I came back and you looked at the section I was looking in,\n\n01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.320\nwhich is what I would like to call Movies About Things.\n\n01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.320\nBut Dan, I watch exclusively sci-fi with you.\n\n01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320\nI don't make you watch anything you don't want to watch.\n\n01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.320\nI like watching sci-fi, I like watching all those things.\n\n01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.320\nI'm perfect!\n\n01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.320\nYou came back from the bathroom,\n\n01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320\nand you looked that I was surfing through movies\n\n01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.320\nthat are about time travel and spaceships and lasers and stuff,\n\n01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.320\nand you went, huh, well, I guess you weren't that sorry.\n\n01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.320\nLike, as if I owed you, because we had a fight and then we made up,\n\n01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.320\nnow I got to watch fucking Jason Siegel and James Franco\n\n01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320\ntravel across the country together.\n\n01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.320\nThis is where we had the fight.\n\n01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.320\nThe fight started because I made a joke,\n\n01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.320\nlike, well, I thought you were going to turn on some romantic comedies,\n\n01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.320\nand I was like, well, what do you want to, Jason Siegel's Steven Crudley?\n\n01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.320\nAs if those are the only movies I like.\n\n01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.320\nI like romantic comedies.\n\n01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320\nThose guys make my romantic comedies.\n\n01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.320\nI watch every single romantic comedy.\n\n01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.320\nYeah, but I know they're shitty, Dan.\n\n01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.320\nJesus, I know that movies about octopus monsters are shitty,\n\n01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320\nbut they're about something.\n\n01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.320\nThere's always a guy, no matter how bad the movie is.\n\n01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.320\nYeah, and I don't discourage you from watching them, ever.\n\n01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.320\nYou did when you came out of the bathroom.\n\n01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320\nGod damn it.\n\n01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320\nIt was a bit.\n\n01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.320\nYou're a bit.\n\n01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.320\nYou're a human bit, and I'm telling you, man,\n\n01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.320\nI'm just saying, movies about people that fall in love\n\n01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320\nand then fall out of love and then fall in love again,\n\n01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320\nit's like eating ketchup.\n\n01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320\nThey're not fucking for you.\n\n01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.320\nYou can put that ketchup on a movie about an octopus monster.\n\n01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.320\nYou can have a guy invent an octopus monster\n\n01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.320\nwhile he's falling in love with someone,\n\n01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.320\nand you can have the octopus monster\n\n01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.320\nbe the reason they fall out of love,\n\n01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.320\nand then they can fall back in love\n\n01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.320\nbecause they beat the octopus monster.\n\n01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.320\nIt's ketchup.\n\n01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320\nThe movies that are popular,\n\n01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.320\nit's just fucking the mushrooms on top of the steak.\n\n01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.320\nYou're right.\n\n01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.320\nIf you only eat those, you'll die.\n\n01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.320\nI'm not arguing here.\n\n01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.320\nI watch all of these movies with you.\n\n01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320\nAnd the ancient Greeks didn't.\n\n01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.320\nYou're the most high maintenance, difficult person.\n\n01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320\nI can't hear you right now.\n\n01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.320\nI can't hear you because I have a bigger point to make.\n\n01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.320\nWe've been telling stories for 60,000 years.\n\n01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320\nPull that number out of my ass.\n\n01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320\nGuys!\n\n01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.320\nGuys!\n\n01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.320\nYou can play as many sound effects as you want.\n\n01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.320\nWe have been telling stories for 60,000 years.\n\n01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.320\nIf you drew that line on a piece of paper,\n\n01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.320\nand you illustrated the portion of it\n\n01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.320\nthat represented us telling stories about monsters eating people\n\n01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.320\nand people beating them\n\n01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.320\nand people with weird shit in them,\n\n01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320\nit would be like 90% of it.\n\n01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.320\nWe only just now invented the idea\n\n01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.320\nthat you can make a whole movie about a dude being not into somebody.\n\n01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.320\nIt's fucking dumb.\n\n01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.320\nWho cares if you're not into her?\n\n01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.320\nIs that a movie?\n\n01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320\nBe not into her and have a robot!\n\n01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.320\nHave a robot!\n\n01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.320\nI'm angry!\n\n01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.320\nI don't think you're wrong.\n\n01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320\nWhat about a deadly friend?\n\n01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.320\nHe liked a girl and she died,\n\n01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.320\nand then he turned her into a robot.\n\n01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.320\nWe have to end this show.\n\n01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320\nYeah.\n\n01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.320\nBecause it's become about a man and a woman's relationship.\n\n01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.320\nSo they hate it.\n\n01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.320\nYou know, if a fucking monster came up on stage right now,\n\n01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.320\nthey'd be like, I'm in this for three more hours.\n\n01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.320\nLet me see six more of them.\n\n01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.320\nThere's no such thing as a series of romantic comedies\n\n01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320\nthat goes to like 12 movies.\n\n01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.320\nJason Voorhees has been slashing people apart forever.\n\n01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320\nHe's a crazy fucking guy that kills people.\n\n01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320\nHe does it in space.\n\n01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320\nHe does it in the 1800s.\n\n01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.320\nEven the leprechaun can sustain a franchise longer\n\n01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.320\nthan a fucking guy and a girl going,\n\n01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320\nI don't know if I want to get married!\n\n01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.320\nAnd Daniel James Harmon.\n\n01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.320\nI know before I was saying,\n\n01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.320\nlook, I don't, this isn't about that,\n\n01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.320\nand I like those movies, and I also like the movies you like.\n\n01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.320\nBut you've convinced me.\n\n01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.320\nPerhaps we should not be together.\n\n01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.320\nYou've made it very clear.\n\n01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.320\nYou like monster movies.\n\n01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.320\nI like blowjobs and making dinner.\n\n01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.320\nSo I think that perhaps we should part ways.\n\n01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.320\nAnd you should be with a woman that's better suited for you.\n\n01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320\nAlright.\n\n01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.320\nThank you everyone for coming to our breakup show.\n\n01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320\nI guess that's how it is.\n\n01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.320\nI am really quick.\n\n01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320\nI'm always very vulnerable after relationships.\n\n01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.320\nAnd listen, this throat is super deep.\n\n01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.320\nAnd I'll listen to you.\n\n01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.320\nI have this problem where I just listen to you\n\n01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.320\nand I'm really interested in things.\n\n01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.320\nI'm really smart and stupid.\n\n01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.320\nSo if you want me to listen to you and talk to you for a while\n\n01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.320\nand blow you and love you and care about you,\n\n01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.320\nthen I'm available.\n\n01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.320\nI know this is a big bummer,\n\n01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:02.320\nbut I'm not crazy or emotionally dysfunctional.\n\n01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320\nI don't think.\n\n01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320\nAlright, so
