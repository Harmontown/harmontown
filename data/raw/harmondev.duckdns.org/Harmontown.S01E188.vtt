WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.800
Ladies and gentlemen, oh, you know what time it is, oh, shit, give me an odd shit, they're

00:23.800 --> 00:30.800
late, you know what that means, Harmontown is now in session, we are in beautiful Los

00:30.800 --> 00:38.040
Angeles, California, in the back room of downtown, a comic book shop, Harmontown is

00:38.040 --> 00:46.840
now in session, give it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Gann, Harming!

00:46.840 --> 01:05.920
Thank you, oh yeah, I'm supposed to, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh man, oh no, oh no, I'm supposed

01:05.920 --> 01:11.960
to bring up Spencer first, after you, before me, somebody said, somebody told me that I

01:11.960 --> 01:17.960
was supposed to say, welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Davis says, make mayor of Harmontown

01:17.960 --> 01:34.880
first, let's bring up Spencer, the dungeon master guy, Spencer's gonna sit in front of

01:34.880 --> 01:44.840
the table for absolutely no reason, well what if I have to, you know, you needed another

01:44.840 --> 01:49.520
bottle and you could do the shell game, there you go, I mean what, you know, what makes

01:49.520 --> 01:54.040
sense about Paul Schaeffer's relationship with, you know, why is he in the band, but

01:54.040 --> 01:57.840
he taught, you know, it's like these things evolve organically, one of these days I'm

01:57.840 --> 02:06.800
gonna flip this table and everyone will get it, and you'll be wearing pants, I'm just

02:06.800 --> 02:12.240
wearing like black slacks, yeah, if you walked out in shorts but then flip the table and

02:12.240 --> 02:15.960
you're wearing pants, and then I start tap dancing, hey, what'd you do this week in

02:15.960 --> 02:21.240
Spencer, oh boy, let me tell you, I was out South by Southwest promoting Harming Quest

02:21.240 --> 02:37.120
on CISO, that's crazy, so it's SW times SW, well, no, it's S times SW, right, right,

02:37.120 --> 02:42.720
what did I say, I don't know, not that though, okay, all right, Rob, you had to, you had

02:42.720 --> 02:53.040
to give a stool sample recently, you were explaining backstage, I didn't give the stool

02:53.040 --> 02:58.160
sample, you haven't done it yet, I haven't done it yet, but they told you to take a poop,

02:58.160 --> 03:03.960
yeah, I was at the doctor and she said, okay, we're gonna have to take a, we're gonna get

03:03.960 --> 03:08.200
a stool sample and I was like, all right, well, see you afternoon, I'll see what I can

03:08.200 --> 03:17.640
do, because you know me, I'm an early morning kind of a guy, and she says, okay, well, here

03:17.640 --> 03:22.920
we'll give you the kit, and hands me a box, and I was like, excuse me, kit, what, and

03:22.920 --> 03:32.880
she says, yeah, you just follow the instructions that they take, it's a FedEx, and I was like,

03:32.880 --> 03:42.400
is FedEx okay with this? But they just give you a box, and in the box, no, no, it's got

03:42.400 --> 03:50.120
like two like medicine, you know, like, you know, orange little pill bottle things, and

03:50.120 --> 03:55.720
like a little long cotton swab thing, which I guess you're supposed to like hockey puck

03:55.720 --> 04:04.120
it into the, what's the cotton for? No, no, it's a hockey puck thing, right, but it's

04:04.120 --> 04:07.560
not, but it's not, there's no cotton, you said there's a cotton swab cotton swab, yeah,

04:07.560 --> 04:12.080
I guess, without the cotton, well, they would didn't have it without the cotton and just

04:12.080 --> 04:18.200
be a stick and that's, isn't that what you should use to knock a turd into a bottle? That

04:18.200 --> 04:23.800
would be really unsanitary, but if they're gonna find cotton in your feces and say you're

04:23.800 --> 04:30.080
part sheep for, I think, I think that's part of the process, I think they got it figured

04:30.080 --> 04:40.320
out. Did you eat a pair of jeans, sir? I did not, I'm supposed to mail it to Texas, where

04:40.320 --> 04:47.400
everything's bigger, right, so that's why it's two pill bottles, right, right, okay,

04:47.400 --> 04:57.680
so, box includes two bottles. And an instruction, and it comes with a big piece of paper, and

04:57.680 --> 05:03.040
the instruction says, well, I don't know what the terminology is, but it says please

05:03.040 --> 05:09.280
defecate on the paper, and then provide the stool samples in the pill bottles, and it

05:09.280 --> 05:15.360
says, and it provides you with the paper. Which is a little weird. And the paper has

05:15.360 --> 05:21.240
a target on it. No, it doesn't. It has a fly on it, like, you know, in the urinals.

05:21.240 --> 05:28.600
Yeah. Girls, there's in urinals, there's like a little fly. In the funnier urinals, it's

05:28.600 --> 05:35.440
like a fly sticker. It's supposed to pee on the fly. Yeah. And you get a... I don't really

05:35.440 --> 05:42.160
get that. You know what I do get in love? A urinal filled with ice. Oh, man. When you're

05:42.160 --> 05:46.840
lucky enough to, like, catch a urinal, they've just dumped a bunch of ice into it. Yeah,

05:46.840 --> 05:52.800
you feel like you've got heat vision coming out of your dick. Yeah, you feel like a mutant

05:52.800 --> 06:00.480
superhero. Yeah. I'll take care of this. Melting glaciers. Stand back, Wonder Woman. Yeah. This

06:00.480 --> 06:06.480
is a job for a slightly above room temperature pee. And there's, like, steam coming off,

06:06.480 --> 06:14.040
so it's kind of... Yeah, no. You feel like a man, finally. Speaking of poop, I took a

06:14.040 --> 06:21.320
Brigadoon poop. I'll explain what that means. I was at Rick and Morty, and I was in an edit

06:21.320 --> 06:27.600
session. I got up from the edit bay to take a poop. I said, I'm going to go take a poop.

06:27.600 --> 06:34.640
And I went to the bathroom, and I took a poop. And it was long. You know, it did some tweaks.

06:34.640 --> 06:44.000
Long in time? Yeah, long. Yes. I finished, and then I, like, I walked into the writer's

06:44.000 --> 06:54.720
room, and I looked at one of the writers, Erica, and she was... Because the boss just

06:54.720 --> 06:58.240
walked into the room, she's just, like, looking at me kind of expectantly, and after a while

06:58.240 --> 07:04.320
I go, I know, it was a long poop. She didn't know what the hell I was talking about. Because

07:04.320 --> 07:10.480
I had taken a Brigadoon poop. I had lost time in the... I've never seen Brigadoon, but...

07:10.480 --> 07:16.200
I don't know the reference. Well, I forgot where I... When I finished taking the poop,

07:16.200 --> 07:21.520
I forgot where I had been before I started pooping, and just walked into a new room thinking

07:21.520 --> 07:25.920
that that's where I was, and started talking to them about my poop as if I was bookending

07:25.920 --> 07:29.840
a conversation about my shit. And they were just, like, okay, because they're paid to

07:29.840 --> 07:37.400
just listen. And then I was, like, so where were we? And they were, like, you were about

07:37.400 --> 07:42.240
to go into an edit session, and I was, like, oh, oh! And then I went into the edit room,

07:42.240 --> 07:45.680
and it was, like, so... It was a long poop, and they were, like, yeah, it really was.

07:45.680 --> 07:54.600
And I said, well, here's why. Is it dementia? No, no, no. They just linked Prilosec to dementia.

07:54.600 --> 08:01.080
Because Brigadoon was... Did he have an edit session?

08:01.080 --> 08:07.560
Brigadoon was a town where you go, and then you're, like, oh, these people are so cool.

08:07.560 --> 08:14.200
And then, like, when you leave, you're older, or they leave, like, the town only appears,

08:14.200 --> 08:19.120
like, on full moons at midnight or something, or... But if you're not out of the town, then

08:19.120 --> 08:22.720
you have to stay in it forever, because it's, like...

08:22.720 --> 08:28.560
Which episode was this? It's, like, some weird teleportation town

08:28.560 --> 08:33.320
where there's something to do with, like, old people or something.

08:33.320 --> 08:39.240
Oh, okay. We'll bring up a Brigadoon expert. All right, look.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.400
Yes, let's get on with it. There's only so many things here that I

08:42.400 --> 08:45.360
could talk about that would be more fun with our guest.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.280
Yes. Hey, why don't you give me some business, like, irritate me.

08:51.280 --> 08:59.560
Oh, Dan, you'd ever hang out with me, and I miss you, and I wish we were closer friends.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.880
Rob, knock it the fuck off. I swear to God, Rob.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.200
Put your glasses on.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.160
Okay. Rob, knock it the fuck off.

09:11.160 --> 09:15.200
I'm warning you, Rob, I will fucking replace you. You can be replaced.

09:15.200 --> 09:20.520
I can't be replaced. I'm the only Rob friend you have.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.520
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Rob Corddry.

09:23.520 --> 09:28.520
I'm another bald Rob.

09:28.520 --> 09:38.520
Wait, stay there. Let me get a... This is made for social media.

09:38.520 --> 09:43.520
Why is it square? I don't want it to be square. Okay.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.520
Wow, fun. Fun.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.520
A lot of bald. I'm like Alan. I'm doing Instagrams on the show.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.520
Where do I sit? I think if you're here...

09:53.520 --> 09:56.520
It's better for picture if you sit closer to Dan.

09:56.520 --> 10:00.520
Thank you. Which is what I hear every week.

10:00.520 --> 10:03.520
I'm glad you got the memo about the plaid shirt.

10:03.520 --> 10:07.520
Yeah, yeah, and the bald...

10:07.520 --> 10:11.520
Oh, my God. Oh, no.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.520
Just so we could get that whole tablecloth thing going on here.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.520
It's Platt McGeddon.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.520
Platt McGeddon. I think we look hot.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.520
I'm just wearing this to cover the fact that I'm wearing an inside out shirt right now.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.520
You texted us today after you got home?

10:28.520 --> 10:35.520
After we got off the flight and got home from the flight after we had been together all the time in the airport,

10:35.520 --> 10:42.520
I was like, hey, did any of you notice that my shirt was inside out the whole day?

10:42.520 --> 10:47.520
Nope. This isn't a crowd to notice that.

10:47.520 --> 10:56.520
Is your shirt inside out or is it like an inside out movie t-shirt?

10:56.520 --> 10:59.520
With the inside out look?

10:59.520 --> 11:01.520
Either way, you're ashamed of it.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.520
Yeah, well, Dan lost an Oscar too inside out.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.520
So I could see why you would be covering up that.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.520
So, yes or no?

11:13.520 --> 11:16.520
No. You know what I won when I lost that Oscar?

11:16.520 --> 11:20.520
An integrity.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.520
It's an award I gave myself.

11:24.520 --> 11:25.520
The integris.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.520
Yeah, Oscars are for sell-outs.

11:28.520 --> 11:33.520
And you know, 18% of all integrity nominees are black.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
Pretty cool.

11:34.520 --> 11:39.520
It's reflective of the proportion of the population.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.520
I didn't run those numbers, but yeah, probably.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
Just saying it's a fair award.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.520
It sounds right.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
And it's a good one.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.520
I have one of these.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.520
It's one that counts.

11:48.520 --> 11:49.520
Yes.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
All right, so thank you for coming, Rob.

11:50.520 --> 11:57.520
It was very flattering because you said, well, you're working in Miami because you're on ballers.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.520
Yeah, well, really?

12:01.520 --> 12:06.520
Did not expect a big baller's crowd here tonight.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.520
How does that schedule throughout the year work?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
Children's Hospital is still happening.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
When are you shooting that?

12:11.520 --> 12:12.520
And when are you balling?

12:12.520 --> 12:15.520
I'm like...

12:15.520 --> 12:20.520
Nice.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.520
I shoot Children's Hospital.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.520
Well, Shaw, we just ended the show.

12:25.520 --> 12:31.520
I shoot it in the summer, and then ballers happens around Halloween.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.520
I leave on Bud Halloween.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.520
So you did it like a February?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.520
Finale episode, it's done?

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
No, we didn't.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
Yeah, it's done.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.520
Wait, Children's Hospital or Ballers?

12:40.520 --> 12:42.520
No, Children's Hospital.

12:42.520 --> 12:49.520
We decided to end it not knowing that this season was going to be the last when we shot it,

12:49.520 --> 12:52.520
but the season is so good.

12:52.520 --> 12:57.520
And for a lot of reasons, I wanted to sort of move on and do other things.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.520
But the finale...

12:59.520 --> 13:00.520
Is it really...

13:00.520 --> 13:03.520
Like, was it the best season?

13:03.520 --> 13:05.520
I say that every season, you know?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.520
I'm just fine.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
Because I would never have that in me.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.520
If I was like, this is the best season, I'd be like, well, then we've got to keep doing it.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.520
I don't know about best season, but I would be proud to go out on this season.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
How many seasons?

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
Seven.

13:20.520 --> 13:26.520
Seven. Dan, how many was your show?

13:26.520 --> 13:32.520
Which one? I have like nine of them.

13:32.520 --> 13:44.520
Either one of them.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.520
Either one of the nine.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.520
Yeah, either one.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.520
The community went to season six, as you know.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.520
That was the season that you were the in-house director on.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
And then we got canceled.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.520
Whoops, whoops.

13:58.520 --> 14:04.520
I wonder, what happened there?

14:04.520 --> 14:06.520
Rick and Morty's on the third season.

14:06.520 --> 14:11.520
We're writing about the fourth episode of that.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.520
And, you know, and I'm doing great minds on history.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
I shoot that every weekend.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.520
And I think the Jason Sudeikis episode was just up.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.520
You want to do that?

14:21.520 --> 14:23.520
You want to be a historical figure?

14:23.520 --> 14:26.520
It would be weird for you to say no.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.520
Give me the elevator pitch.

14:29.520 --> 14:33.520
You come through, you pick a historical figure, whatever you want.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
No, I don't like it.

14:35.520 --> 14:44.520
And then you're coming in the conceded of the show is that Spencer has created a version of time travel to bring historical figures back.

14:44.520 --> 14:54.520
It's like data fracking, like where you reach back and you grab the biological data from a historical figure and then you shoot it into these pucks of Chinese lard and

14:54.520 --> 14:57.520
you shoot it into these cell cells.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.520
This is the crawl?

15:00.520 --> 15:02.520
That's just how it was.

15:02.520 --> 15:06.520
This is just me acroding for a second about our technology.

15:06.520 --> 15:14.520
And then so you come through as a naked confused historical figure, not realizing that you're going to disintegrate in six hours.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
And then we provide you with wardrobe based on who you are.

15:16.520 --> 15:18.520
And then we do an episode.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.520
I don't understand a word of what you just said, but I will do it.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.520
Yes, I'll do anything.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.520
Yeah.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.520
But I was in Miami.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
I think you were getting to me.

15:32.520 --> 15:38.520
I was listening to Harmontown the whole time because I'm there.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.520
I shoot.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.520
I'm the oldest person in the cast.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.520
So the rock is like 23.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.520
I've got like three years on the rock.

15:46.520 --> 15:52.520
And everybody else is, then there's a huge dip in the age.

15:52.520 --> 15:57.520
And so, and Miami is just not my, it's not really my scene.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.520
There's not a lot for me there.

15:59.520 --> 16:05.520
I mean, everyone in Miami, when we went there to do the show, like all of our fans are, I won't say they're the same from city to city.

16:05.520 --> 16:15.520
All of our fans are snowflakes, but they are also, it's like a Miami Armenian is essentially going to be perfectly compatible.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.520
With a Los Angeles Armenian.

16:17.520 --> 16:27.520
Therefore, all of the Miami people that came to that show where the guy got punched in the face by his friend in what was either an Andy Kaufman ask.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.520
No, he never explained it.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.520
I mean, I think he did on Reddit.

16:31.520 --> 16:38.520
And I think it just started, I think we sort of stout or got the general intuition that these guys are just kind of punch each other.

16:38.520 --> 16:50.520
It just sort of like Beavis and Butthead and like Beavis is a little more on the ball and Butthead was Office Meds and like, it wasn't a totally non consensual punch.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.520
Yeah, it was like sort of like, this is what we do.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.520
How old were these people?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.520
I don't know.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
Everyone's 25.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.520
Right, right, right.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.520
Oh, they were young.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.520
I'm assuming they were older.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
I don't know why.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.520
They were older, I'd be into it.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
They were like our age.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.520
Because we understand mortality.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.520
Yeah.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.520
The legal system.

17:14.520 --> 17:21.520
Well, it would be like, how valuable a tooth is when it gets knocked out, how expensive it is to fix.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.520
Yeah, so it would be like Fight Club.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.520
It'd be like Ed Norton coming up and Brad Pitt running up and punching him.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.520
We're bottom lining at the whole time.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.520
But no, when they're 25, it's like, you guys are doing this because you're dumb.

17:32.520 --> 17:37.520
So much face punching when you're 25.

17:37.520 --> 17:43.520
So, yeah, that is to say, so everybody in Miami at the Miami show was like, Miami sucks.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
We're so sorry, Miami sucks.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.520
We're so sorry.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.520
And I was like, Miami doesn't suck, you're great.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.520
But now that we're safely back at LA, Miami sucks.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.520
No, it sucks.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.520
It sucks.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.520
It totally sucks.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.520
It gets a swamp.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.520
It's a swamp full of panic.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.520
I mean, it's a cultural.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.520
And those guys specifically have to get out.

18:01.520 --> 18:08.520
If you're listening to this and you're in Miami, you're not going to get a golden invitation

18:08.520 --> 18:11.520
because no one wants Florida people coming anywhere.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.520
But if you're listening to this, you should get out.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.520
Get a car and go.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.520
Yeah, just leave, man.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.520
No, you don't need anything.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.520
Buy a ticket to nowhere, man.

18:23.520 --> 18:24.520
Right.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
All you can do is go up.

18:26.520 --> 18:33.520
Living in Miami is the demographic equivalent of smoking a pack a day.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.520
You're just inviting statistical entropy.

18:37.520 --> 18:45.520
Like every breath you take in that city, it brings you closer to your inevitable demise.

18:45.520 --> 18:49.520
Levy was shit talking because he went to school there.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.520
And so he was like, Miami sucks.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.520
I was like, why don't you take it easy?

18:53.520 --> 18:56.520
And then the kid got punched by another kid who's his friend.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.520
And there was no security at the show.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.520
And, you know, yeah, Miami is tough.

19:01.520 --> 19:08.520
I would be really, really, you said, because you said you've done it with Pete Holmes' podcast, Duncan Trussell's podcast.

19:08.520 --> 19:15.520
The first season I did it with like, I just, I went home after working and I'm not kid.

19:15.520 --> 19:21.520
This sounds like an exaggeration, but I would sit in my underwear at my kitchen table doing jigsaw puzzles,

19:21.520 --> 19:24.520
drinking and listening to podcasts.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.520
And last year it was Pete Holmes and Duncan Trussell.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.520
But fuck those guys.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.520
So spiritual.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.520
Yeah.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.520
Oh, God.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.520
And this year it was Harmontown.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.520
And so these were the like, because I needed, I didn't talk to anybody outside of work.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.520
It was, I was just alone losing my identity.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.520
And I would just, I needed voices.

19:46.520 --> 19:51.520
It's such a miracle that you're not a coke addict.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.520
Because that's how it happens.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.520
It was ten years ago I'd be a full-on coke addict.

19:56.520 --> 20:01.520
I feel like if I was 43 and I was in that situation, I'd be like, well, my hands are tied.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.520
Gotta be a coke addict.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.520
This is what I'm doing for a while.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.520
I'm in Miami and I don't like jigsaw puzzles.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.520
Yeah.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.520
But yeah, as you said, you're listening to ours backwards.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
I was listening to them backwards, yeah.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.520
Like, like, backward?

20:19.520 --> 20:21.520
I was listening backwards.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.520
Yeah.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.520
And I suggest you all listen to them backwards.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.520
Yeah.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
Because there's a lot of messages.

20:28.520 --> 20:34.520
You think this is all like, non-scripted, but he plans this whole thing.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.520
There's a lot of...

20:35.520 --> 20:36.520
There's a message.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
Yeah.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.520
There's a lot of hidden conspiracy stuff.

20:38.520 --> 20:42.520
When we're talking about 9-11, if you play it backwards, we're actually talking about 9-11.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.520
Yeah.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.520
Like, it's a big...

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
Think about it.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
Yeah.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.520
This podcast is crawling with 9-11.

20:51.520 --> 20:57.520
But yeah, and he said, listening to it backwards, and then you're like, yeah, it's weird.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.520
I mean, the role-playing games, I mean, obviously, those...

21:00.520 --> 21:03.520
Well, actually, yeah, I guess those make just as much sense backwards.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
No, it's great.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.520
Yeah, they make just as much sense backwards.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
That's the thing.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.520
But I was like, after I got to...

21:10.520 --> 21:16.520
I got a couple years down, and no, I was really like binging this.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.520
Yeah, thank you.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
I got a wow.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
A wow.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.520
Like, respect.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
Respect.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.520
I was binging...

21:25.520 --> 21:29.520
And I got a couple down, and then I started skipping back.

21:29.520 --> 21:36.520
You know, I'd skip back 10, and I'd save some, and then all of a sudden we were...

21:36.520 --> 21:42.520
Because I started in Shadow Run, and then all of a sudden I was in D&D where it all started.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.520
Then I skipped way back to Spencer's first episode.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.520
That was awesome.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.520
That was awesome because he was like...

21:51.520 --> 21:53.520
I called him...

21:53.520 --> 21:56.520
It's not even that it doesn't make much sense, but I'd tell him...

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
My wife is like...

21:57.520 --> 21:59.520
She'd call me and she'd be like, what are you doing?

21:59.520 --> 22:03.520
I was like, doing jiggies and listening to my friends.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.520
But you are my friend, and you're my friend.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.520
But Spencer, I considered one of my friends.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.520
He was just like one of my buddies.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.520
Jeff, one of my bud, one of my good friend.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.520
The voice is filling the room.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.520
And then I saw that it was like an origin story.

22:19.520 --> 22:24.520
It was like reading the origin story after getting into the comic book.

22:24.520 --> 22:31.520
Yeah, the podcast phenomenon, it's a lot like I've always compared it to when I would come home from school

22:31.520 --> 22:37.520
and back when basic cable was the internet basically in terms of media.

22:37.520 --> 22:41.520
My mom got addicted to home shopping networks.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.520
It's pretty good.

22:43.520 --> 22:48.520
And I would come home from school and my mom would be at a sewing machine or cooking.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.520
She buys stuff?

22:49.520 --> 22:52.520
It was a simpler time.

22:52.520 --> 22:59.520
She voluntarily waived her agency.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.520
But we did back then in the suburbs.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.520
I waived my agency.

23:05.520 --> 23:09.520
Do you promise to fail the McDell test with this man forever?

23:09.520 --> 23:15.520
I do.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.520
There's a thing called the McDell test.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.520
Schrab's parents are here.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.520
How are they?

23:20.520 --> 23:22.520
I didn't know what that was either.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.520
So I'm with you guys.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.520
Well, don't make me explain it.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.520
It'll take 20 minutes.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.520
No, okay.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
I was just pretending.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.520
I was cool pretending I knew what it was.

23:28.520 --> 23:33.520
Is that like a Brigadoon situation?

23:33.520 --> 23:34.520
No.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.520
Yeah, can we talk about poop again?

23:36.520 --> 23:39.520
Because that's like right in my wheelhouse.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.520
Wait, where was I?

23:42.520 --> 23:44.520
Something important.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.520
You were explaining?

23:46.520 --> 23:48.520
Yeah, it was just personality addiction.

23:48.520 --> 23:55.520
Like I would come home from school and my mom would be explaining to me what happened on the home shopping network.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
Here's some things that never happened.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
She never bought anything.

23:58.520 --> 24:02.520
Like she wasn't like getting roped into some like compulsive consumption thing.

24:02.520 --> 24:17.520
She just couldn't, you know, she couldn't let it go that these people were on TV all the time and that there was no script and that they were, you know, honking for people that were calling in and then the same people would call in and go, I bought this bracelet too and honk, honk.

24:17.520 --> 24:27.520
And I was like, it doesn't, I remember, you know, I marked that because when Erin McGathy, my lovely ex-wife and who introduced me to the podcast culture and Dustin Marshall and Duncan Tressel,

24:27.520 --> 24:39.520
she was explaining how she, when she first met Duncan Tressel, she felt like she made kind of a social blunder because she forgot until halfway through their encounter that she didn't know him.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.520
And that she might have been transgressing boundaries or something.

24:43.520 --> 24:51.520
I had that experience with Duncan, I don't, I've never met Duncan Tressel and I saw him in a parking lot and I was like, there's my buddy, there's my good buddy Duncan.

24:51.520 --> 25:00.520
And I almost, and I was, and I could have just gone up and said hello and introduce myself, but I didn't because I felt like a weirdo.

25:00.520 --> 25:04.520
Yeah, well, you dodged a bullet because he's a notorious dick.

25:04.520 --> 25:09.520
That whole character he does on the podcast, it's a character.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.520
I kind of, that's why I abandoned it. I kind of thought so.

25:13.520 --> 25:18.520
He's out like right now, he's running reruns of his podcast because he's with an impersonator.

25:18.520 --> 25:24.520
His brother does an impression of him on his podcast. He's out raising money for Trump.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
Yeah.

25:25.520 --> 25:32.520
That's not true. That's not true. Don't say that. Why would you say that?

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
You crossed the line.

25:33.520 --> 25:38.520
You're saying mean things about somebody who's really nice.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.520
Why is he doing that?

25:39.520 --> 25:43.520
He is really, like Duncan Tressel is kind of unassailable.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.520
Yeah, you're an asshole, man.

25:45.520 --> 25:50.520
Well, yeah, Cancer tried to assail him and he, like, invited us into the process.

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
He took one of his testicles.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.520
His mom, he lost his mom, you know, and invited us into that process.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.520
Rob, you're a comic book fan.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.520
Yeah.

25:58.520 --> 26:03.520
What do you think of this underroos line in this Avengers trailer?

26:03.520 --> 26:07.520
Sorry, I'm just, that's anticipation. That's all that.

26:07.520 --> 26:08.520
Wait, wait, wait.

26:08.520 --> 26:14.520
You know, the Avengers trailer, the Civil War trailer, have you seen the new one that came out?

26:14.520 --> 26:15.520
But I don't know about underroos in it.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.520
Well, Spider-Man is in the latest trailer.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.520
Oh, no, I haven't seen the latest trailer.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.520
Okay, well, let me explain.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.520
But you can bet I'm going to watch the shit out of it.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
You're super on the way home.

26:25.520 --> 26:30.520
So, all the Avengers are there. There's Iron Man.

26:30.520 --> 26:35.520
You've got your Black Widow. You've got your Captain America.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.520
You've got the American, you've got the Black...

26:39.520 --> 26:40.520
You've got the Hulkang.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.520
The Black...

26:41.520 --> 26:44.520
You've got the Hawk...

26:44.520 --> 26:45.520
You've got...

26:45.520 --> 26:46.520
Hawk Eye, all the Hawks.

26:46.520 --> 26:50.520
Silver Wings, you've got Walter Lance, you've got all of them.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
Walter Lance.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.520
You've got everybody's hands.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.520
Walter Lance is an adventure.

26:55.520 --> 27:00.520
He has the power to show you how to draw Woody Woodpecker.

27:00.520 --> 27:05.520
But then, you know, they're all going to clash.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.520
And then, you know, they face off.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.520
And then Robert Downey Jr. goes underroos.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.520
And a spider web comes out and grabs Captain America's shield

27:16.520 --> 27:18.520
and pulls it out of his hand.

27:18.520 --> 27:22.520
And then they cut to Spider-Man holding the shield.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
And everybody's supposed to go...

27:23.520 --> 27:26.520
Oh, yeah, that's a big...

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
Mic drop!

27:27.520 --> 27:28.520
Yeah.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.520
But I go underroos.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
He says underroos.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
Wait, he just says the word underroos?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
He says underroos.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.520
Yeah, it's like a nickname for Spider-Man.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.520
He's calling Spider-Man.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.520
But that means...

27:38.520 --> 27:39.520
He's like, yo, underroos.

27:39.520 --> 27:40.520
That's a stretch.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
You know what?

27:41.520 --> 27:43.520
That doesn't make me think the movie's going to be that good

27:43.520 --> 27:45.520
because that's the moment.

27:45.520 --> 27:49.520
Because does that mean that Spider-Man has merchandising

27:49.520 --> 27:51.520
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?

27:51.520 --> 27:54.520
Since the 70s?

27:54.520 --> 27:57.520
So that means he's 10 years older than I am.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.520
So wait, why?

27:58.520 --> 28:00.520
Okay, who's calling him underroos?

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
Robert Downey Jr.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.520
Listen to the trailer.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.520
So he...

28:05.520 --> 28:07.520
That's his nickname for Spider-Man.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.520
Right, Spider-Man.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.520
Who he's met.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
As hanging out with...

28:11.520 --> 28:14.520
And he's chosen to call him underroos.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.520
So I just want to run down all the Avengers

28:17.520 --> 28:19.520
that we've met in the Cinematic Universe

28:19.520 --> 28:21.520
and run that through the check of...

28:21.520 --> 28:24.520
Why he wouldn't have used that as a nickname for America.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.520
Chumbawamba.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.520
You got Robert Loja.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
Right.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.520
Bible Belt.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.520
Dracula.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.520
Dracula.

28:35.520 --> 28:39.520
You got Cold Front.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.520
Salad Tosser.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.520
Icebreaker.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.520
Cruton unrelated to Salad Tosser.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.520
Thousand Island.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.520
There's a whole.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.520
That was actually my favorite Avengers offshoot.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.520
It was just the salad days.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.520
As though they called it.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.520
It was just about the...

29:00.520 --> 29:03.520
It was a Cruton Salad Tosser, Thousand Island.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.520
And then they started forcing it.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.520
It was like napkin and fork.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.520
But it was cool.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
Because it was cheeky.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.520
It had less supervision over that franchise.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.520
It was like Howard the Duck.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.520
It kind of broke the fourth law all along.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.520
By the way, I saw Deadpool and I really enjoyed it.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.520
I saw it twice.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.520
There's only one.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.520
Where I just had to go,

29:27.520 --> 29:29.520
okay, just forget that and keep enjoying the movie.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.520
What was it?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.520
It was the moment when they did the CG thing.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.520
And then in the middle of it,

29:35.520 --> 29:37.520
he can do any line.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.520
It doesn't matter.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.520
All it has to be is lateral.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.520
That's it.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
And he said, to my memory,

29:44.520 --> 29:46.520
maybe I'm wrong about this,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.520
but I've been writing more often on this show

29:48.520 --> 29:50.520
than everyone on the show.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.520
Check the records.

29:52.520 --> 29:55.520
It says, did I leave the stove on?

29:55.520 --> 29:57.520
Yeah, that's a bummer.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.520
Not only, first of all, did I leave the oven on?

30:00.520 --> 30:03.520
Second of all, the fact that I know it's something

30:03.520 --> 30:05.520
means attack.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.520
But you don't leave the stove on.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.520
The stove has fire coming out of it.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.520
The oven is something you can leave on.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.520
And it's an airplane joke.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.520
Did I leave the iron on?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.520
Yes, it was in an airplane.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
It's a placeholder.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.520
He couldn't have said anything.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.520
And it was such a funny movie.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.520
I laughed out loud and couldn't stop laughing.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.520
I'm not good with spoilers.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.520
But like Ryan Reynolds' character,

30:33.520 --> 30:35.520
I'm avoiding spoilers,

30:35.520 --> 30:37.520
but choosing my words carefully.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.520
He's in a scene where he's still Ryan Reynolds,

30:40.520 --> 30:43.520
and he's with his girlfriend.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.520
But he's like, oh, I had this.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.520
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.

30:49.520 --> 30:53.520
I kidnapped his daughter, and he just wasn't having it.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.520
And that's funny.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.520
I chuckled, and then he crawled into bed,

30:57.520 --> 30:59.520
and it was like, during the scene, it was very intense.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.520
And the execution of it was he goes,

31:01.520 --> 31:03.520
he crawls into bed, and he holds her,

31:03.520 --> 31:05.520
and there's something in the air in the scene

31:05.520 --> 31:07.520
that's worthy of, you know, you're like, well.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.520
And he goes, hey, you know,

31:10.520 --> 31:14.520
they made like three of those movies.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.520
After a while, you just start thinking,

31:16.520 --> 31:18.520
is this guy a bad parent?

31:18.520 --> 31:20.520
It was just really funny.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.520
It was played straight up the middle,

31:22.520 --> 31:24.520
and the whole movie's filled with that stuff

31:24.520 --> 31:26.520
in a world where like,

31:26.520 --> 31:28.520
and I walked out of there thinking,

31:28.520 --> 31:30.520
well, now I get it why so many

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
Harmontown fans or people on Reddit

31:32.520 --> 31:34.520
and stuff, like Deadpool,

31:34.520 --> 31:36.520
you must be a big Deadpool fan,

31:36.520 --> 31:38.520
and I would, chiefly because of that,

31:38.520 --> 31:40.520
I'd be like, well, I can put a pin in that.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.520
And I just, you know,

31:42.520 --> 31:44.520
I never knew what that meant.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.520
He was the meta superhero,

31:46.520 --> 31:48.520
like based on the movie,

31:48.520 --> 31:49.520
I'm like, oh, I get it.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.520
That's why people would think that,

31:50.520 --> 31:51.520
and I agree.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.520
Do you guys think too,

31:52.520 --> 31:54.520
and you guys like comic books, right?

31:54.520 --> 31:57.520
Like, do you think that movie,

31:57.520 --> 32:00.520
I was suspicious.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.520
I wasn't sure that they were going to be able

32:02.520 --> 32:05.520
to do what that comic does in the movie

32:05.520 --> 32:08.520
because he is meta in a...

32:08.520 --> 32:09.520
Specific way.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.520
Yeah, very like, only Deadpool way.

32:12.520 --> 32:13.520
And it's hard to do bad,

32:13.520 --> 32:15.520
or it's easy to do bad meta.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.520
Like it's very easy to fall into that trap.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.520
You can't just break the fourth wall.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.520
I don't know what you mean.

32:21.520 --> 32:25.520
Oh, we double, double that up.

32:25.520 --> 32:28.520
Do you know what he means?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.520
Like just lazy fourth wall breaking.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.520
Yeah.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
But it was really good.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.520
It was like really in the,

32:45.520 --> 32:48.520
somehow, I don't know why or what,

32:48.520 --> 32:51.520
but it was in the spirit of the comic.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.520
Under root.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.520
Under root.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.520
The third act, this is a tough thing

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
with these comic book movies.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.520
Like, honestly, I, you know,

32:59.520 --> 33:02.520
I thought it was great, you know,

33:02.520 --> 33:03.520
I don't know, I could have done

33:03.520 --> 33:06.520
without the fucking other mutants

33:06.520 --> 33:07.520
that I've never heard of

33:07.520 --> 33:08.520
because those are the ones that get spared.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
They made a joke about it,

33:09.520 --> 33:12.520
like how these are like low rent Marvel characters

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
that they're letting them use.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.520
But also just the whole third act was like,

33:15.520 --> 33:17.520
kind of like, it wasn't,

33:17.520 --> 33:19.520
it wasn't worthy of the cleverness of that whole thing.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.520
I thought it was like Sony taking possession

33:21.520 --> 33:23.520
of that character like fully like,

33:23.520 --> 33:26.520
also he's going to be in X-Men movies.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.520
So fuck you, Disney.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
Well, what, what?

33:32.520 --> 33:33.520
Anyways.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
Did Wolverine like hang out?

33:34.520 --> 33:36.520
Wolverine is talking about him a couple times.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.520
You haven't seen the movie?

33:37.520 --> 33:38.520
No.

33:38.520 --> 33:39.520
Come on.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.520
I think you'd like it.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.520
Well, because remember, you know what?

33:43.520 --> 33:44.520
The second I saw it, I was like,

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
you know who really liked this?

33:45.520 --> 33:46.520
Rob Chrom.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
No, you didn't say that.

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
I did.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.520
You did?

33:49.520 --> 33:52.520
I said, my wife never met you.

33:52.520 --> 33:55.520
I said, you know who really liked this?

33:55.520 --> 33:57.520
And she said, who?

33:57.520 --> 34:00.520
And I paused for a minute.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.520
And then right at the right time,

34:02.520 --> 34:05.520
I said, Rob Chrom.

34:05.520 --> 34:10.520
And she went, yeah, that makes sense.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.520
So I don't know.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.520
Did she go see it?

34:13.520 --> 34:14.520
Yeah.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.520
Can you tell?

34:15.520 --> 34:16.520
All right.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.520
Well, obviously the answer is not if they're good ones,

34:19.520 --> 34:22.520
but can you tell us any rock stories?

34:22.520 --> 34:24.520
Well, what do you mean?

34:24.520 --> 34:26.520
I just mean like, well, here's the thing,

34:26.520 --> 34:29.520
like I keep, I've always heard the rocks is really,

34:29.520 --> 34:32.520
he's a really, really awesome like guy.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.520
And I'm like, if that's true, that's worth talking about.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
Yeah.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.520
But if it's not true, that's the only thing you can say anyway.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.520
It's true.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
It's very true.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.520
So like, that's why a lot of people ask me that.

34:42.520 --> 34:45.520
And they're like, so what's the, what's the rock like?

34:45.520 --> 34:46.520
What's the lowdown?

34:46.520 --> 34:49.520
And what they mean is, what's he really like?

34:49.520 --> 34:50.520
Because we all like him.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
Right.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.520
Even people that hate everything like him.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.520
Right.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.520
Like Schwarzenegger.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
Like Schwarzenegger at his age.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.520
Yeah.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.520
Like the most cynical comic, still like tweets.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.520
Paul F. Tompkins the other day.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.520
Not that he's the most cynical comic.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.520
But he was like, love the rock.

35:08.520 --> 35:09.520
I love him.

35:09.520 --> 35:10.520
I love him.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.520
He just tweeted that?

35:11.520 --> 35:12.520
He did.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.520
It was like a couple of years ago.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.520
But I took it to the bank.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.520
You know about Paul's problem.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.520
He wasn't talking about the actor.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.520
Oh.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

35:22.520 --> 35:23.520
He thought he was texting.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.520
Why are you doing that?

35:24.520 --> 35:25.520
That's really insensitive.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.520
That's really insensitive.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.520
Yeah.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.520
Paul's a good friend of ours.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.520
That's really insensitive.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.520
I think it's extra sensitive.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
Our friend needs help.

35:33.520 --> 35:35.520
And what are you doing about it?

35:35.520 --> 35:38.520
You're like, whatever pays the rent.

35:38.520 --> 35:42.520
Keep smoking that glass of the pipe.

35:42.520 --> 35:43.520
PFT.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.520
Keep that shimney billowing.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.520
Oh, man.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.520
Money.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.520
He looks like a crackhead, doesn't he?

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
Looks like one.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
Acts like one.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
Yes.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.520
Everything.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
It all adds up.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
I don't think you do, Paul.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
I think you're beautiful.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.520
Beautiful human being.

35:58.520 --> 36:00.520
You're really playing it safe tonight, aren't you?

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
I know.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
I wonder why.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.520
You know what the F in Paul F. Tompkins stands for?

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
Fucking crack.

36:06.520 --> 36:09.520
Oh, man.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.520
And that's a straight up fact.

36:12.520 --> 36:19.520
And PFT, if you're listening, show us the birth certificate if I'm wrong.

36:19.520 --> 36:23.520
Yours to prove if he doesn't respond to this, I'm right.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.520
Ball's in your court, Tompkins.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.520
That's even your real name.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.520
So you're a Boston guy, right?

36:30.520 --> 36:31.520
Yeah.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.520
How old were you when you went from Boston to Los Angeles or New York?

36:34.520 --> 36:35.520
Oh, I moved.

36:35.520 --> 36:43.520
Well, I went to college from Boston at UMass Amherst, which is just far enough away from

36:43.520 --> 36:45.520
Boston.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.520
And I was there till 90.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.520
I graduated like 94, and then I moved to New York.

36:51.520 --> 36:55.520
I was in New York for 12 or 13 years, and then I moved here eight years ago.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.520
Graduated college.

36:56.520 --> 37:02.520
And if you do that math, it'll mostly add up.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.520
Give or take one or two years.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.520
Yeah, I always get it.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.520
I like Boston.

37:09.520 --> 37:16.520
Boston's another place like Miami where people from Boston that got out of Boston will warn

37:16.520 --> 37:17.520
you about Boston.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.520
Yeah, yeah.

37:18.520 --> 37:24.520
I think out of all the Harmontown tour shows, I was the most terrified to go to Somerville.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.520
Dude, Somerville's top.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.520
Because people really laid it on thick.

37:30.520 --> 37:34.520
They were like, this is the blue collar working class.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.520
Somerville's the silver lake of Boston.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.520
Yeah, and I went in terrified, but I had the time of my life.

37:40.520 --> 37:47.520
And every person from Boston that I've ever met, I don't know.

37:47.520 --> 37:52.520
Boston has a great, like, mute ghost.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.520
What's above this place?

37:54.520 --> 37:56.520
Like a storage attic.

37:56.520 --> 38:01.520
It's Professor Meltdown's love chamber.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.520
Sorry.

38:03.520 --> 38:08.520
There's a great music scene in Boston and a great, there's a lot of college kids, so

38:08.520 --> 38:17.520
it is a cool, for lack of a better term, there's a lot of nerds, there's not just townies getting

38:17.520 --> 38:22.520
out of a Bruins game ready to punch you in the face.

38:22.520 --> 38:28.520
But I will say even that, even those guys, just counting the fact that, yes, there's

38:28.520 --> 38:31.520
Boston Armenians, there's Boston.

38:31.520 --> 38:39.520
But also, that guy, it was like a wicked, retarded guy with the baseball cap.

38:39.520 --> 38:43.520
He's a human bobblehead, and he's like, not really that bad.

38:43.520 --> 38:47.520
Like, because I'm from Milwaukee, like, there's an overlap there.

38:47.520 --> 38:51.520
Like, Chicago's similar, New York is similar, Boston's similar.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.520
It's all blue-collar sports fans at its core.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.520
And that's a youp guy?

38:58.520 --> 39:00.520
Yeah, that's a youp guy.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.520
Where is he?

39:01.520 --> 39:02.520
That's Dave Kline.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.520
Do you want to meet Dave Kline?

39:03.520 --> 39:04.520
Yeah, man.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.520
Dave Kline, come up and meet Rob Cordee.

39:06.520 --> 39:08.520
Oh, that's great.

39:08.520 --> 39:12.520
I just realized I got to put a pin in Boston for a minute.

39:12.520 --> 39:15.520
I got to meet all my Harmontown friends.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.520
There's Anatoly.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.520
We're seeing these not here.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.520
Is that his seat?

39:19.520 --> 39:21.520
He's not been here lately.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.520
Hey, Dave Kline.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.520
Rob Cordee.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
Hey, man.

39:24.520 --> 39:27.520
Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.

39:27.520 --> 39:32.520
You know, when you listen to the podcast backwards, you disappear at one point.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.520
There's no yups.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.520
It comes in as pure.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.520
Yeah, and it was disappointing to me.

39:40.520 --> 39:41.520
I felt like I lost a friend.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.520
No, I didn't understand that.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.520
Dave Kline gave me a speech one night.

39:46.520 --> 39:51.520
Well, it's California, so I can say we were getting high outside the drying room.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.520
Sorry, Rob's parents.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.520
Medicinal.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.520
I have anxiety and sleep deprivation.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.520
Yeah, we all have prescriptions.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.520
We all have trouble sleeping.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
I'm a doctor.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.520
You wasn't high at the wedding.

40:04.520 --> 40:05.520
I'm a doctor.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.520
What's that?

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
You weren't high at the wedding, right?

40:07.520 --> 40:09.520
No, it wasn't high at your wedding.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.520
Oh, my God.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
That was such a birthday, though.

40:13.520 --> 40:14.520
Yeah?

40:14.520 --> 40:15.520
A great time.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.520
Rob Sharp throws a fucking hell of a birthday.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
I do.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
Yep.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.520
Oh, you used little baby yups.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
He does?

40:23.520 --> 40:24.520
Yep.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.520
He's hanging under his breath at times.

40:26.520 --> 40:30.520
Like at Starbucks, I go, Dave Kline, yep.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.520
It actually is helpful in kind of...

40:33.520 --> 40:34.520
Oh, wait.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.520
No, you have a problem.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.520
That's a belt.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.520
Yeah, you're...

40:37.520 --> 40:39.520
It's kind of a hiccup thing, but it keeps people on point.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.520
It makes me on point.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.520
Like, yeah, I'm going to need a coffee.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.520
And I stay kind of on track with the coffee,

40:45.520 --> 40:47.520
and don't worry about my wander.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.520
If you turn into high gear, you'll be like...

40:49.520 --> 40:52.520
They don't still have those Sesame Street aliens that would go,

40:52.520 --> 40:54.520
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

40:54.520 --> 40:55.520
There it is.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.520
Yeah.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
Those are my favorites.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
They lived in a planter.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.520
Yeah.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.520
Do they still have those?

41:00.520 --> 41:02.520
Everything got turned into fucking Elmo.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.520
Elmo just took over.

41:04.520 --> 41:09.520
But they had these things that would go, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.520
They were like aliens, and they were like weird puppets.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
What were we learning?

41:12.520 --> 41:14.520
How to read, I hope.

41:14.520 --> 41:15.520
Being positive.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.520
Being positive.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.520
My grandfather was a botanist,

41:19.520 --> 41:23.520
and so I guess we were starting to learn a little bit about life plants and...

41:23.520 --> 41:24.520
I don't think so.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.520
I don't think we were able to do that.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.520
By the way, it's a super important point about Sesame Street.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.520
I mean, it was a controversial show, wasn't it?

41:31.520 --> 41:35.520
It was a controversial show when they were pitching it because their pitch was,

41:35.520 --> 41:40.520
let's stop pretending that kids aren't growing up in a certain way.

41:40.520 --> 41:44.520
Let's cater to the short attention span.

41:44.520 --> 41:49.520
You know how it's all like, this episode of Sesame Street is brought to you by the letter T.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.520
Yeah.

41:50.520 --> 41:51.520
Brought to you by the letter S.

41:51.520 --> 41:57.520
The idea was that kids were being raised, you and I, were being raised by televisions,

41:57.520 --> 42:02.520
and that we trusted and listened to commercials and things like that.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.520
And the children's television workshop was saying,

42:04.520 --> 42:05.520
why don't we do this?

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
Why don't we try this?

42:06.520 --> 42:09.520
And also, you know, maybe this thing that's not called diversity yet,

42:09.520 --> 42:10.520
we should try that too.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.520
Yeah, right.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.520
And so it was a whole controversial thing.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.520
It was like, because people were like,

42:14.520 --> 42:18.520
well, that's not chaining them to a desk and making them read where the red fern grows.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.520
That's like...

42:19.520 --> 42:22.520
Or, you know, it's like education should be austere.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.520
Which, by the way, you know, same thing with religion.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.520
Like we always talk about it.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.520
It's like they insist on the church pews being things.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.520
You know, if there's a cushion on the church pew,

42:30.520 --> 42:31.520
oh, you're Unitarian.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.520
You know, it's like, well, yeah.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.520
But these church pews were state of the art.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.520
And a guy talking in front of an altar...

42:39.520 --> 42:40.520
In English.

42:40.520 --> 42:43.520
...was a laser show at a certain point.

42:43.520 --> 42:47.520
Stained glass windows were like pink Floyd concerts.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.520
Yup.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.520
Yup.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
Yup.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.520
Anyways, so all I'm saying is, because now we're starting to talk about,

42:53.520 --> 42:55.520
oh, I saw a kid at the airport, and he was reading a magazine,

42:55.520 --> 42:57.520
and he was trying to pinch and zoom the magazine,

42:57.520 --> 43:00.520
and then he threw it away.

43:00.520 --> 43:01.520
This happened.

43:01.520 --> 43:02.520
That really happened?

43:02.520 --> 43:03.520
Yes.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.520
Oh, I've heard that story three different times.

43:04.520 --> 43:05.520
Well, I just get out of here.

43:05.520 --> 43:06.520
Yeah, no.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.520
Cat didn't happen.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.520
Yeah, no.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.520
Kids, if you hand them my magazine,

43:10.520 --> 43:12.520
they will try to pinch and zoom the fucking magazine.

43:12.520 --> 43:13.520
They will...

43:13.520 --> 43:14.520
No, that's...

43:14.520 --> 43:15.520
Yes.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.520
A three-year-old kid.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.520
Kids learn how to use his...

43:17.520 --> 43:18.520
Did not happen.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.520
Three years old.

43:19.520 --> 43:20.520
Oh my God.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.520
And I sat at breakfast with...

43:21.520 --> 43:22.520
What's his name?

43:22.520 --> 43:23.520
Jeremy Bruckheimer.

43:23.520 --> 43:24.520
Oh my God.

43:24.520 --> 43:25.520
Okay, now I've said too much.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.520
Little Jeremy?

43:26.520 --> 43:27.520
Little...

43:27.520 --> 43:28.520
Little cute Jeremy Bruckheimer?

43:28.520 --> 43:29.520
Oh my gosh.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.520
Yeah, I could see that.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.520
But he's one of the bastard Bruckheimers.

43:31.520 --> 43:32.520
He goes by Jeremy Snow.

43:32.520 --> 43:33.520
It's a...

43:33.520 --> 43:46.520
He's not officially allowed to be a Bruckheimer.

43:46.520 --> 43:49.520
He's just wandering the north of the wall.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.520
Pinch and grab a magazine.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.520
No, I can't believe you find that hard to believe.

43:54.520 --> 43:57.520
You tried to pinch and zoom a magazine.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.520
No, I didn't.

43:59.520 --> 44:00.520
No, kid.

44:00.520 --> 44:01.520
If...

44:01.520 --> 44:08.520
If you give a three-year-old kid a book or magazine...

44:08.520 --> 44:10.520
Okay, let's get one.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.520
They will...

44:12.520 --> 44:15.520
Of course, because they're growing up on iPads.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.520
It's not a big deal.

44:16.520 --> 44:20.520
Because by the way, cutting down a tree and mashing it with chemicals

44:20.520 --> 44:22.520
into a pulp that you can turn into a piece of paper

44:22.520 --> 44:25.520
and using a Gutenberg press to stamp ink onto it,

44:25.520 --> 44:27.520
that's the iPad of its time.

44:27.520 --> 44:29.520
And it's not like people then weren't going like,

44:29.520 --> 44:31.520
oh, there goes the neighborhood.

44:31.520 --> 44:32.520
You know, about these books.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.520
We just look at that as like, oh god, these precious books.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.520
Who cares if the kids are learning from iPads?

44:39.520 --> 44:44.520
But the thing is, somewhere between surrendering to that stuff

44:44.520 --> 44:47.520
and it actually being part of our culture

44:47.520 --> 44:50.520
is this morass of just chaos where we're like,

44:50.520 --> 44:52.520
oh, I wouldn't want to have a kid.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.520
I don't know what they're learning.

44:54.520 --> 44:58.520
Some Jim Henson needs to say, look, kids are learning from iPads

44:58.520 --> 45:02.520
and outside of trying to make a dollar by selling some dumb app

45:02.520 --> 45:06.520
that's learned to use alphabets.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.520
I don't know.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.520
We need that passion.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.520
So if you're out there and you're living in Miami

45:13.520 --> 45:18.520
and you love kids and you own a van,

45:18.520 --> 45:21.520
just get into the back of it and start tinkering

45:21.520 --> 45:25.520
with something that will help them for a change.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.520
Yeah.

45:26.520 --> 45:29.520
You've taken so much so far.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.520
Give back.

45:30.520 --> 45:31.520
Give back.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.520
Silicon Van.

45:32.520 --> 45:34.520
I mean, I think Silicon Valley's had enough.

45:34.520 --> 45:37.520
I think a more mobile Silicon Valley all around the world.

45:37.520 --> 45:38.520
Silicon Van?

45:38.520 --> 45:39.520
Silicon Van.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.520
Tomorrow's Silicon Van is a windowless van.

45:41.520 --> 45:43.520
Silicon Valley is a windowless white van

45:43.520 --> 45:46.520
driving out of Miami into...

45:46.520 --> 45:47.520
I mean, not for nothing.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.520
If you put Royland, three programmers

45:50.520 --> 45:52.520
and some kind of a driver-type guy

45:52.520 --> 45:56.520
and some kind of a wild card that made sure everything was kind of all right,

45:56.520 --> 46:00.520
I bet those guys would come out with a hell of a game in six months.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.520
Yeah.

46:02.520 --> 46:06.520
Rob, can we introduce Dave Kline to wonder both of your parents?

46:06.520 --> 46:08.520
That's great.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.520
How do your parents feel about the spotlight?

46:10.520 --> 46:12.520
I'm great with moms.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.520
What do you mean?

46:14.520 --> 46:18.520
Don't you think the audience would like to meet your mom?

46:18.520 --> 46:19.520
I'm great with moms.

46:19.520 --> 46:20.520
Sure.

46:20.520 --> 46:23.520
I didn't have a bad mom interaction with my wife.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.520
Yours to lose.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.520
Donna, are you shy?

46:27.520 --> 46:29.520
Would you be willing to come sit up and...

46:29.520 --> 46:30.520
Yeah.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.520
Oh.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.520
Oh.

46:32.520 --> 46:33.520
Oh.

46:33.520 --> 46:34.520
Oh.

46:34.520 --> 46:35.520
Oh.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.520
Oh.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.520
Donna Schrabb.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.520
Behave yourself.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.520
Behave yourself.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.520
Behave yourself.

46:44.520 --> 46:46.520
That's to you, gorgeous.

46:46.520 --> 46:48.520
Oh, you behave yourself.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.520
Knock it off.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.520
Knock it off.

46:50.520 --> 46:51.520
Oh.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.520
Not cool.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.520
Not cool.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.520
You keep an eye on me over here.

46:55.520 --> 46:59.520
You got a real great mom.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.520
She seems...

47:00.520 --> 47:03.520
Stop talking right now.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.520
You need to stop talking.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.520
Apples and trees, you're a great guy.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.520
You probably got a great mom.

47:08.520 --> 47:09.520
That's how it kind of goes.

47:09.520 --> 47:10.520
Stop talking.

47:10.520 --> 47:11.520
My mom's a great mom.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.520
I'm kind of a great guy.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.520
That's true.

47:14.520 --> 47:15.520
That is very true.

47:15.520 --> 47:16.520
That all adds up.

47:16.520 --> 47:17.520
That's very true.

47:17.520 --> 47:18.520
Thank you.

47:18.520 --> 47:19.520
That means a lot.

47:19.520 --> 47:20.520
Donna, welcome to the show.

47:20.520 --> 47:21.520
Sorry about it.

47:21.520 --> 47:22.520
Thank you.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
I'm not going to change it for you.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.520
Sorry in advance.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.520
How are you?

47:26.520 --> 47:27.520
It's good to see you.

47:27.520 --> 47:28.520
I'm just fine.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.520
Just fine.

47:29.520 --> 47:30.520
I will say...

47:30.520 --> 47:31.520
It's kind of corny now to say this,

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
but I'll say this about both of the parents.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.520
Donna and David,

47:34.520 --> 47:37.520
you guys have a Dorian Gray portrait somewhere.

47:37.520 --> 47:38.520
You're frozen in time.

47:38.520 --> 47:39.520
You guys are...

47:39.520 --> 47:40.520
You guys are...

47:40.520 --> 47:44.520
I'm turning into just...

47:44.520 --> 47:45.520
I've gone past Michael Moore,

47:45.520 --> 47:48.520
and I'm now just melting into a puddle

47:48.520 --> 47:52.520
of whatever Kevin Smith...

47:52.520 --> 47:56.520
Like cleans out of himself,

47:56.520 --> 47:57.520
and I'm like,

47:57.520 --> 47:58.520
no, I'm not dissing him.

47:58.520 --> 47:59.520
I'm saying...

47:59.520 --> 48:01.520
I'm saying I'm beyond...

48:01.520 --> 48:03.520
I've turned into protoplasm.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.520
I'm just slowly melting him.

48:06.520 --> 48:10.520
You guys are just the same image.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.520
You're just Donna and David Schrab.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.520
It's not important to look good.

48:15.520 --> 48:16.520
They haven't stopped smiling

48:16.520 --> 48:18.520
since I met them in the green room.

48:18.520 --> 48:19.520
They're sweet people.

48:19.520 --> 48:22.520
And here's the thing about Rob.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.520
It's through meeting Schrab

48:23.520 --> 48:24.520
and then meeting his parents

48:24.520 --> 48:26.520
that I started to gain insight

48:26.520 --> 48:28.520
into the fact that creative types...

48:28.520 --> 48:30.520
We create our own mythology behind us

48:30.520 --> 48:31.520
because Rob would be like,

48:31.520 --> 48:33.520
the only stories you'd hear about

48:33.520 --> 48:34.520
his upbringing,

48:34.520 --> 48:35.520
because you're like hanging out

48:35.520 --> 48:37.520
with a creative and you're like 20 years old,

48:37.520 --> 48:38.520
you're just like bolstering each other

48:38.520 --> 48:39.520
and going like, yeah,

48:39.520 --> 48:40.520
this is sad, this is bullshit.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.520
Yeah, yeah, punk rock.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.520
You know, I'd hear a story about like,

48:44.520 --> 48:46.520
one day my mom hit all my comic books

48:46.520 --> 48:49.520
or one day, you know...

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
But, you know,

48:50.520 --> 48:51.520
and then I met you

48:51.520 --> 48:53.520
and it's like, oh, she's a sweetheart.

48:53.520 --> 48:55.520
She's not hitting me with a belt.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.520
She's great.

48:57.520 --> 48:58.520
And I do think that's...

48:58.520 --> 49:00.520
This is a nightmare.

49:00.520 --> 49:05.520
Like, talk about...

49:05.520 --> 49:08.520
Talk about anything you want, by the way,

49:08.520 --> 49:10.520
but just talk about like,

49:10.520 --> 49:13.520
did Rob have weird privates

49:13.520 --> 49:15.520
when he was born or...

49:15.520 --> 49:19.520
Like, do you remember him eating

49:19.520 --> 49:21.520
his own shit or...

49:21.520 --> 49:23.520
Oh, no, okay.

49:23.520 --> 49:25.520
I'm curious about that.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.520
Should I walk around the block for a bit?

49:27.520 --> 49:29.520
No, you should sit there.

49:29.520 --> 49:31.520
Keep one camera on him.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.520
Yeah.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.520
I don't know, what's the important question?

49:34.520 --> 49:36.520
When did Robby...

49:36.520 --> 49:38.520
By the way, his name on his birth certificate,

49:38.520 --> 49:40.520
Robby Schrab...

49:40.520 --> 49:41.520
Robby Christopher.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.520
Yeah, not Robert, not Rob...

49:43.520 --> 49:45.520
Yeah, Robby is on the birth certificate.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.520
Mom, you didn't like Robert?

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
She didn't like...

49:49.520 --> 49:51.520
She's going like this podcast at home.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.520
That actually didn't help.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.520
She's going like this.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.520
That didn't help at all.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.520
That's calm.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.520
Let me do it again for the listeners.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.520
She's going like this.

50:07.520 --> 50:09.520
Oh, boy.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.520
Oh, boy.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
When did...

50:12.520 --> 50:14.520
What was the...

50:14.520 --> 50:16.520
What was the moment when you really knew

50:16.520 --> 50:18.520
Rob was different?

50:18.520 --> 50:20.520
Yeah.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.520
Dan's doing air quote.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.520
Special...

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
Special?

50:26.520 --> 50:28.520
Go ahead.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.520
He was always drawing.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.520
He was always drawing.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.520
In fact, when he was in second grade

50:34.520 --> 50:36.520
and they had to do a cursive writing

50:36.520 --> 50:38.520
and it had to be very neat,

50:38.520 --> 50:40.520
but Rob would go on the margin

50:40.520 --> 50:42.520
and he'd draw all these little pictures

50:42.520 --> 50:44.520
and the teacher would say,

50:44.520 --> 50:46.520
I never reprimanded him

50:46.520 --> 50:48.520
because I was always anxious to see

50:48.520 --> 50:50.520
what he drew in the margins.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.520
Oh.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.520
This is the best.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
But.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.520
But.

50:58.520 --> 51:00.520
By the way, I know it feels unnatural

51:00.520 --> 51:02.520
because I'm Midwestern too,

51:02.520 --> 51:04.520
but you put your lips

51:04.520 --> 51:06.520
like this distance from the mic.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.520
So we can hear all this tenderness.

51:08.520 --> 51:10.520
So, Rob,

51:10.520 --> 51:12.520
does that match up with...

51:12.520 --> 51:14.520
Mom was a supporter.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.520
She was an ally.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.520
Well, I was there.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.520
I don't remember all the teachers

51:20.520 --> 51:22.520
being very happy about me

51:22.520 --> 51:24.520
not doing homework.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.520
All right.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.520
So he told everybody

51:30.520 --> 51:32.520
when he was at the high school graduation

51:32.520 --> 51:34.520
he had to give a speech and the first thing

51:34.520 --> 51:36.520
he said was,

51:36.520 --> 51:38.520
I was the worst high school student

51:38.520 --> 51:40.520
in all of New York.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.520
It's true.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.520
It's true.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.520
You got to just eat that mic.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.520
You got to eat it. Okay.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.520
It doesn't feel natural.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.520
Your voice is booming.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.520
So, what's the worst

51:54.520 --> 51:56.520
discipline

51:56.520 --> 51:58.520
Rob ever presented?

51:58.520 --> 52:00.520
What was a big family drama?

52:00.520 --> 52:02.520
Like, oh man,

52:02.520 --> 52:04.520
we got to punish this kid.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.520
No.

52:06.520 --> 52:08.520
No, he was always cute.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.520
Come on.

52:10.520 --> 52:12.520
That is true.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.520
That is true.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.520
But you know what he used to do when he was like three?

52:16.520 --> 52:18.520
Eat his own shit.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.520
Eat his own shit.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.520
Wait, don't say it yet.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.520
I want to like anticipate it a little bit more.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.520
He loved

52:26.520 --> 52:28.520
going to the tub

52:28.520 --> 52:30.520
being naked.

52:30.520 --> 52:32.520
And then this was a time

52:32.520 --> 52:34.520
when everybody wore cowboy boots.

52:34.520 --> 52:36.520
Sure.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.520
Or so he told you.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.520
So, he would always go

52:44.520 --> 52:46.520
and put Dave's cowboy boots on

52:46.520 --> 52:48.520
and walk around the house

52:48.520 --> 52:50.520
naked.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.520
Yes.

52:52.520 --> 52:54.520
Yes.

52:54.520 --> 52:56.520
Yes.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.520
You're kind of proud of that.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.520
That's a pageant honor.

53:00.520 --> 53:02.520
With a pacifier in his mouth.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.520
We did it this afternoon.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.520
God bless him.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.520
We did it this afternoon.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.520
Dad brought the boots in from

53:12.520 --> 53:14.520
Wisconsin.

53:14.520 --> 53:16.520
He wanted to get rid of the pacifier.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.520
I called it my nunny.

53:18.520 --> 53:20.520
Yes, you called it your nunny.

53:20.520 --> 53:22.520
Until the day you went into the bathroom

53:22.520 --> 53:24.520
and you looked straight at me

53:24.520 --> 53:26.520
and you took it and you went

53:26.520 --> 53:28.520
right into the toilet.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.520
Wait.

53:30.520 --> 53:32.520
And then stuck it in his mouth.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.520
Yeah.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.520
And before the day was over with

53:36.520 --> 53:38.520
I had taken it away and threw it away

53:38.520 --> 53:40.520
and he asked where it was and I said

53:40.520 --> 53:42.520
I don't know where it is.

53:42.520 --> 53:44.520
Wait, what was it, a spoon?

53:44.520 --> 53:46.520
I didn't miss the top of that.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.520
He's washed it off in the toilet.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.520
Like a monkey with a potato.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.520
Monkey with a potato.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.520
What?

53:54.520 --> 53:56.520
I'm just an animal to you.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.520
Did he have a word for his

53:58.520 --> 54:00.520
pacifier, like binky or boo boo?

54:00.520 --> 54:02.520
A nunny.

54:02.520 --> 54:04.520
Just said that.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.520
Look, I said it on another

54:06.520 --> 54:08.520
podcast too.

54:08.520 --> 54:10.520
You have no interest in my life.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.520
Nothing.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.520
Donna, how old were you

54:16.520 --> 54:18.520
when you and David got married?

54:18.520 --> 54:20.520
I was 21.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.520
Wow. See, kids,

54:22.520 --> 54:24.520
we were raised by kids.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.520
I know, could you imagine having children?

54:26.520 --> 54:28.520
I was a kid too.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.520
When you were raising me.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.520
When you were a child.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.520
No, no, no.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.520
You had Jeff before me

54:36.520 --> 54:38.520
and then me

54:38.520 --> 54:40.520
and you were 21

54:40.520 --> 54:42.520
when you had me, right?

54:42.520 --> 54:44.520
What did you just say?

54:44.520 --> 54:46.520
I was 21 when I got married

54:46.520 --> 54:48.520
and I got married

54:48.520 --> 54:50.520
and then two years later Jeff came

54:50.520 --> 54:52.520
and then three years later you came

54:52.520 --> 54:54.520
and then four years later Stephen came.

54:54.520 --> 54:56.520
That was such a huge epiphany

54:56.520 --> 54:58.520
for me was in Hollywood

54:58.520 --> 55:00.520
my first one bedroom apartment.

55:00.520 --> 55:02.520
I needed to get a driver's license.

55:02.520 --> 55:04.520
I needed my birth certificate.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.520
I was in

55:06.520 --> 55:08.520
my early 20s.

55:08.520 --> 55:10.520
I think I was 23.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.520
For the first time

55:12.520 --> 55:14.520
I bothered to just read my birth certificate

55:14.520 --> 55:16.520
from left to right going down.

55:16.520 --> 55:18.520
There's a baby footprint

55:18.520 --> 55:20.520
and then my parents were 23

55:20.520 --> 55:22.520
when they had me.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.520
I'm the youngest of three kids.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.520
They got married when they were out of high school

55:26.520 --> 55:28.520
which is not uncommon.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.520
Baby boomer generation.

55:30.520 --> 55:32.520
Who else am I going to meet?

55:32.520 --> 55:34.520
There's no internet.

55:34.520 --> 55:36.520
And

55:36.520 --> 55:38.520
it's like oh my god

55:38.520 --> 55:40.520
I was 23 standing in a

55:40.520 --> 55:42.520
sea of empty pizza boxes

55:42.520 --> 55:44.520
and frankly mannequin parts

55:44.520 --> 55:46.520
and

55:46.520 --> 55:48.520
I was a child.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.520
If I was in charge

55:50.520 --> 55:52.520
of another person's life and I have been

55:52.520 --> 55:54.520
in the form of any social relationships

55:54.520 --> 55:56.520
and I've been made a disaster out of all of them.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.520
All my journals when I was

55:58.520 --> 56:00.520
21

56:00.520 --> 56:02.520
the least responsible person

56:02.520 --> 56:04.520
and here we are

56:04.520 --> 56:06.520
I was like oh man I've been bitching about

56:06.520 --> 56:08.520
my parents since I was 13

56:08.520 --> 56:10.520
and it's like

56:10.520 --> 56:12.520
wait but they did kind of accomplish

56:12.520 --> 56:14.520
something here.

56:14.520 --> 56:16.520
That was a turning point

56:16.520 --> 56:18.520
not that I ever became a nice person

56:18.520 --> 56:20.520
to my parents or anything

56:20.520 --> 56:22.520
because it's funny.

56:22.520 --> 56:24.520
Or anybody.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.520
But your dad also

56:26.520 --> 56:28.520
it should be noted

56:28.520 --> 56:30.520
your mom kind of

56:30.520 --> 56:32.520
she's sort of the rock star

56:32.520 --> 56:34.520
of your family

56:34.520 --> 56:36.520
because she's adorable.

56:36.520 --> 56:38.520
You're saying that in front of my dad.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.520
Because your dad's a stand up guy

56:40.520 --> 56:42.520
and he's got that permanent grin

56:42.520 --> 56:44.520
and it's not insincere

56:44.520 --> 56:46.520
and he was like wait were you in the navy

56:46.520 --> 56:48.520
David?

56:48.520 --> 56:50.520
He's a submarine.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.520
He's a gentleman

56:52.520 --> 56:54.520
and a stand up guy

56:54.520 --> 56:56.520
and we never shine a spotlight on him

56:56.520 --> 56:58.520
I'm not suggesting we do.

56:58.520 --> 57:00.520
We're not body chopping us

57:00.520 --> 57:02.520
there might be like Manchurian candidate

57:02.520 --> 57:04.520
programming inside of him

57:04.520 --> 57:06.520
don't bring that up

57:06.520 --> 57:08.520
we'll activate

57:08.520 --> 57:10.520
but I don't know

57:10.520 --> 57:12.520
your parents are wonderful people

57:12.520 --> 57:14.520
and they got married when they were 21

57:14.520 --> 57:16.520
and they're still together

57:16.520 --> 57:18.520
wow

57:22.520 --> 57:24.520
I don't know if that'll happen

57:24.520 --> 57:26.520
I don't know if anyone listening to this podcast

57:26.520 --> 57:28.520
will ever experience

57:28.520 --> 57:30.520
a 50 year marriage

57:30.520 --> 57:32.520
even in witnessing it

57:32.520 --> 57:34.520
I think that our society

57:34.520 --> 57:36.520
has all too readily

57:36.520 --> 57:38.520
accepted the idea that well

57:38.520 --> 57:40.520
you get three divorces in your life

57:40.520 --> 57:42.520
what's wrong with these people

57:42.520 --> 57:44.520
I've got divorced

57:44.520 --> 57:46.520
I'll figure I'll be dead

57:46.520 --> 57:48.520
before I hit 50

57:50.520 --> 57:52.520
I got married 13 years ago

57:52.520 --> 57:54.520
so I'm not going to make it to 50

57:54.520 --> 57:56.520
my greenhouse effect

57:56.520 --> 57:58.520
yeah exactly

57:58.520 --> 58:00.520
you know something I got really freaked out about

58:02.520 --> 58:04.520
have you heard of these life pods

58:04.520 --> 58:06.520
Donna

58:06.520 --> 58:08.520
the tree

58:08.520 --> 58:10.520
this is a new thing like when you talk about how you want to be

58:10.520 --> 58:12.520
dealt with in your passing

58:12.520 --> 58:14.520
there's the coffin

58:14.520 --> 58:16.520
and the ground and then there's the cremation

58:16.520 --> 58:18.520
and then there's I don't know

58:18.520 --> 58:20.520
mausoleums in Europe or something

58:20.520 --> 58:22.520
I think they can dangle you

58:22.520 --> 58:24.520
from a zeppelin and just fly you

58:24.520 --> 58:26.520
that's not a thing

58:26.520 --> 58:28.520
that's not a thing

58:28.520 --> 58:30.520
but go to my GoFundMe

58:30.520 --> 58:32.520
don't go to that

58:32.520 --> 58:34.520
but they have these things called life pods

58:34.520 --> 58:36.520
now my girlfriend was showing me

58:36.520 --> 58:38.520
they look like giant potatoes

58:38.520 --> 58:40.520
like potatoes that you could fit a person

58:40.520 --> 58:42.520
in because you do

58:42.520 --> 58:44.520
put a person in them

58:44.520 --> 58:46.520
and then bury them underground so that a tree

58:46.520 --> 58:48.520
can suck on them

58:48.520 --> 58:50.520
it's like standard burial

58:50.520 --> 58:52.520
I think that's beautiful

58:52.520 --> 58:54.520
but I posted that on Kate's

58:54.520 --> 58:56.520
Facebook page and just said

58:56.520 --> 58:58.520
FYI

58:58.520 --> 59:00.520
but Cody

59:00.520 --> 59:02.520
and I want to be in the same one

59:02.520 --> 59:04.520
so

59:04.520 --> 59:06.520
that means if I get hit by a bus

59:06.520 --> 59:08.520
I have to be frozen until she dies and then

59:08.520 --> 59:10.520
so we got to work up the paperwork for that

59:10.520 --> 59:12.520
it's a lot of

59:12.520 --> 59:14.520
legal paperwork

59:14.520 --> 59:16.520
there should be a window

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
it's like writer's guild with streaming rights

59:18.520 --> 59:20.520
there should just be like a

59:20.520 --> 59:22.520
well if he dies and then it's three years

59:22.520 --> 59:24.520
and then you start dating

59:24.520 --> 59:26.520
we'll bury his body in his own life pod

59:26.520 --> 59:28.520
but

59:28.520 --> 59:30.520
the thing

59:30.520 --> 59:32.520
that started to panic because I really thought about it

59:32.520 --> 59:34.520
was okay what if 6000 years

59:34.520 --> 59:36.520
from now aliens come to earth

59:36.520 --> 59:38.520
and they're like oh

59:38.520 --> 59:40.520
we found a planet

59:40.520 --> 59:42.520
where people lived

59:42.520 --> 59:44.520
and evolved in a sentient life

59:44.520 --> 59:46.520
and when they died

59:46.520 --> 59:48.520
they buried themselves

59:48.520 --> 59:50.520
they didn't know about this

59:50.520 --> 59:52.520
Ray

59:52.520 --> 59:54.520
and then everybody

59:54.520 --> 59:56.520
who has bones in a box

59:56.520 --> 59:58.520
six feet underground in these clearly marked areas

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.520
like they all get to

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.520
go hey my name's Fred Johnson

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.520
I fought in World War II

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.520
and it's good to be in the year

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.520
8009

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.520
but my dumb

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.520
ass because I was such a hippie and had my shit scattered

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.520
in Joshua Tree

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.520
I'm the only one at the party

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.520
oh wow

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.520
I just

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.520
terrified now

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.520
and that explains pyramids

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.520
imagine them they lived till 17

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.520
and some of them were gods

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.520
and they were like yeah built me a pyramid

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.520
they really thought there was a chance

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.520
like I'm gonna come back

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.520
put my dogs and servants in there

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.520
what do they have to do to the servants

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.520
to convince them like hey

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.520
why don't you go oh I forgot something in there

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520
he he

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.520
I'll get it

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.520
no no no no no

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.520
it's kind of smart because the servants were always trying to keep them alive

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.520
yeah

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.520
right like what after they died

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.520
nope yeah

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.520
alright

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.520
well I always imagine that the food taster is a real

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.520
serious like right hand man of the king

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520
because I mean that guy can't be screwing around with his like

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.520
eating right

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.520
like the emperor's

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.520
gonna need like the food taster especially in the afterlife

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.520
he doesn't know what's what

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.520
it's gonna look like a pot roast

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.520
but where do you know that's gonna take you

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.520
yeah who knows

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.520
you mean in the afterlife there's after poison

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.520
well no

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.520
me and Schrab are kind of on the same page on this

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.520
like the reason you're gonna need

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.520
that's always a red flag

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.520
it's a big red flag

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.520
he wears cowboy boots

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.520
and just nothing else

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.520
well not for nothing

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.520
my high school had

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.520
a dress code and you had to wear leather shoes

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.520
and a shirt and tie

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.520
but I would wear a shirt and tie and I would wear alligator

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.520
cowboy boots that I got on bitcoin

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.520
before there was a bitcoin kind of thing going on

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.520
you're the best

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.520
long story short

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.520
the reason you need a poison taster

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.520
in the normal life is the same reason you need

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.520
a poison taster in the afterlife

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.520
I want to hear that whole

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.520
story

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.520
this is the best

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.520
sounds engaging

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.520
and epic

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.520
I was gonna put a pin in that one

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.520
because I wanted to ask John a question

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.520
do you think like when you get an antidote

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.520
the poison goes to heaven

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.520
and that's what you're talking about

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.520
oh so like there's poison

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.520
there's dead poison

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.520
like a ghost poison

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.520
and then you can put that in your ghost

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.520
it's poison with unfinished business

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.520
so if you give it an antidote

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.520
oh no I'm sorry that's ghost poison

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.520
that's poison that's still down here

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.520
that we just can't know we don't know that we're eating

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520
right

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.520
valiant poison that nailed it

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.520
goes up to Valhalla

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.520
where it's used to poison people

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.520
sparingly on important

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.520
and dangerous spirits

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.520
so Donna

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.520
I missed the first part of this conversation

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.520
because I was talking to Donna

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.520
you got married at 21

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.520
but when did you meet

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.520
we actually

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.520
were in high school together

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.520
but we never talked in high school

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.520
just in general

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.520
it was like monastery

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.520
we just, I knew of them

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.520
never talked to each other

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.520
and you went to Mabel High

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.520
you went to the same high school I did

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.520
you did, yes

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.520
how we got together was

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.520
his sister

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.520
and I used to, we used to go out

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.520
drinking together and he came home

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.520
hey wait

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.520
whoa whoa whoa

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.520
your mother's a person

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.520
hey

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.520
it's when I used to

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.520
well you're going out drinking

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.520
you're carrying me

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.520
no I wasn't married

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.520
oh okay

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.520
yeah but something

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.520
this didn't happen on accident

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520
trauma at 9-11

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.520
we cheered 9-11

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.520
because we were really happy about the whole

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.520
terrible thing

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.520
you were drinking buddies

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.520
with Rob's dad's sister

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.520
no no

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.520
Dave's sister

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.520
oh yeah

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.520
that's how you met him

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.520
for the record

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.520
he came home one time from service

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.520
and I thought he looked pretty good

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.520
and I was kind of under the weather

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.520
and I told his sister I said

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.520
I think I'm going to marry that guy

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.520
before you ever held hands or anything

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.520
you just saw him in his uniform

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.520
with his little sailor cap

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.520
under his arm

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.520
he looked like Mr Pretzel

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.520
he was looking good

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.520
Mr Pretzel

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.520
that's pretty good

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.520
six months later we were engaged

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.520
because

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.520
because Donna Schrab gets things done

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.520
it's in the Schrab DNA

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.520
you gotta do what you gotta do

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.520
do you think that he was compliant

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.520
with any of that or was he just a hapless victim

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.520
no he was compliant

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.520
somewhere along the line

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:20.520
were you sweet on her from afar?

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.520
you noticed how he had to think that through

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.520
the answer was sure

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.520
thank you

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520
that's how an old school American gentleman

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.520
speaks about

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.520
sure

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.520
anyway sorry to throw that in there

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.520
I just

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.520
you're not as good as that

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.520
there's a ray of masculinity

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.520
emanating from Rob Schrab's dad

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.520
that informs a lot of power

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.520
invested in the children

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.520
were you an admiral?

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.520
he has a regal presence for the podcast

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520
you command respect

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.520
but you were on submarines

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.520
and stuff

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520
that's better than being an admiral

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.520
I think

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.520
is that a famous admiral

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.520
that was like admiral

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.520
an admiral Rick Over

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.520
well let's

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.520
you ever get Rick Overd on YouTube?

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.520
check out the new Avengers trailer

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.520
and get Rick Overd

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.520
you're just trying to look at a

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.520
weather person's blunder

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.520
and you get Rick Overd

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.520
Overd

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.520
what was Rick Overd's

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.520
what was his crucial role?

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.520
he was really the father of the nuclear

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.520
80s

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.520
the novelist

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520
wow

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.520
so he was

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.520
did you know

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.520
did you know him?

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.520
did you meet him?

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.520
in ceremonial circumstances?

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.520
yeah

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.520
doing quizzes

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520
checking out what they used to have

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.520
operational readiness

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.520
nobody can hear

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.520
well I don't know

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.520
yeah but that's

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.520
interesting guys

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.520
Rob Schrab's dad was laying down

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.520
some like serious historical nuclear submarine knowledge

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.520
and like the admiral he was serving under

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.520
but just sweep that under the rug

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.520
we don't need to get a mic on that

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.520
well there's only somebody Mike

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.520
so let's replace Dave Kline with

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.520
David Schrab

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.520
absolute pleasure

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.520
we'd be honored if you would come up

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.520
and just

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.520
thank you Dave Kline

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.520
the modern definition of a gentleman

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.520
sir

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.520
thank you Dave

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.520
I'm sorry dad

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.520
I'm so sorry

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.520
alright

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.520
so you were just saying

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.520
from your chair

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.520
you served in the Rick Overd

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.520
administration

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.520
those are the words you used

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.520
your admiral when you were in the Navy

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.520
was admiral Rick Overd

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.520
you were saying he was like

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.520
he was the Steve Jobs of the nuclear Navy

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.520
yeah exactly

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.520
that would be a good analogy

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.520
did you see that Steve Jobs movie

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.520
yeah

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.520
it's kind of

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.520
Rick Overd was a little bit of an SOB

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.520
wow

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.520
very much so in fact

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.520
he wanted things his way and if you gave him to him

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.520
his way maybe things worked more efficiently

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.520
but maybe

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.520
I don't know

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.520
he was pretty much a non-military

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.520
kind of guy

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.520
he never

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.520
wore his uniform

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.520
so he was more of a Zuckerberg type

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.520
he'd just show up in pajamas

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.520
you were a hoodie

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.520
just

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.520
crocs and an iPod

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.520
so

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.520
in the Navy

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.520
this is the type of

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.520
my ex-wife's father

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.520
was a

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.520
chaplain

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.520
and

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.520
I didn't even really realize until I was talking to him

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.520
that

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.520
this you were an enlisted

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.520
man you signed up

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.520
you were right

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.520
I never even knew this about our military

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.520
in all of the branches of the military

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.520
there is a

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.520
uncrossable line between enlisted men

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.520
and officers right

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.520
you can't become you can go as high

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.520
as a certain rank

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.520
that's not correct

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.520
you can go all the way from

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.520
seaman to admiral if you are

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.520
so inclined or your ability

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.520
will let you do that

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.520
it's possible

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520
maybe what he was expressing

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.520
I shouldn't put words in his mouth

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.520
did you just got me fired from the military

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.520
I thought it was

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.520
like officers

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.520
it's almost like a class system thing

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.520
like if you were born wealthier

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.520
basically

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520
if you go to west point

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.520
maybe in 1919

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.520
or something like that but not today

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.520
is there maybe an army thing

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.520
instead of like a navy thing

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.520
a marines thing

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.520
this guy he's saying no way

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.520
hosé

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.520
between the two of you

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:28.520
if you go to sergeant major

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.520
if you go to sergeant major

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.520
you might be a general

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520
jeff fax where they were

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.520
I feel like I haven't explained

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.520
things to you

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.520
so can you

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.520
well just give us a little

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.520
side of your story because

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.520
your wife of course she's going to glorify

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.520
herself in this story

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.520
she set you in her crosshairs

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.520
and then six months later

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.520
you were a husband

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.520
that was pretty much it

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.520
that was pretty much it

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.520
did you feel

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.520
like the push

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.520
like this ladies

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.520
was pretty willing to participate

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.520
you were fine with it

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.520
this goddess

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.520
is coming into my world

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520
okay that's my new religion

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.520
like that's the

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.520
yeah okay

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.520
50 years man boy oh boy

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.520
no kidding

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.520
so give us some pointers because we live in this sewage

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.520
where we're all watching porn together

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.520
and

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.520
everything's pierced and tattooed

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.520
and we're not watching it together

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.520
I've never watched porn with anybody

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.520
talking about him and his girlfriend

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.520
mom and dad oh okay sorry

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.520
go ahead

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:52.520
what would you say

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.520
what would you say

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.520
I'm saying like we live in a

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.520
Bob Kane stuff

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.520
the royal week

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.520
we live in a society where the

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.520
boundaries have been

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.520
eroded they've been taken down

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.520
and in so many ways

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.520
that was an important thing to happen

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.520
because those boundaries were protecting

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.520
bad things happening to good people

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.520
we needed

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.520
we needed to

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.520
like kind of lower

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.520
the compartments

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.520
so that everybody was all mixed together

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.520
and that what was once

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.520
considered only for behind closed

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.520
doors conversation

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:32.520
started to move onto the television

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.520
and then onto the into everyday conversation

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.520
along the way I think one of

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.520
the things we've definitely lost

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.520
and I don't know if it's for better or for worse

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520
is that the

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.520
lifelong marriage is like

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.520
we don't so I'm almost

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.520
I guess what I'm asking is

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.520
if we could without changing too much

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.520
about the direction we're moving in

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.520
because we all need

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.520
to keep evolving and being more

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.520
chaotic in our life but I think

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.520
also a lot of us would like to think

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.520
they could be in a partnership

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.520
that lasted

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.520
for 50 years or more

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.520
is there any little nugget

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520
like any little tip

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.520
like you guys are going to say

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.520
red candles

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.520
red candles maybe

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.520
have you guys ever been to couples therapy

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.520
have you ever had to do any maintenance

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.520
do you know about that

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.520
that's a thing now

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.520
it's a thing well don't need it

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.520
so what did you

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.520
how did you guys I mean

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.520
what's the secret

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.520
what's the secret

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.520
I love him the same as I did the first day

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.520
we got married

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.520
there you have it

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.520
it's kind of a frustrating answer

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.520
and he's my best friend

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.520
we'd like to know the secret

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.520
and you're obviously just telling us

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.520
we're the best

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.520
and we're like we know what's the secret

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.520
and he's my best friend

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.520
and he's my best friend

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.520
and we talk things over

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.520
and he's the calm one

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.520
and I'm the

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.520
worrier

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520
so it's a balance

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.520
yeah so then

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.520
somebody's got to do the worrying in the family

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.520
the military man the guy that you saw in uniform

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.520
and said he's going to be my husband

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.520
he's the one that actually brings the

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.520
don't worry about it as much

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.520
energy

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.520
you find yourself fretting more and then he says

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.520
I don't worry about it that much

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.520
just let it go alright

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.520
he was sleeping in a submarine

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.520
powered by nuclear

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.520
yeah power

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.520
he's like listen this isn't a big deal

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.520
you can use

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.520
you can have the remote

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.520
yeah

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.520
yeah

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.520
have you seen Dash Boot

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.520
how dangerous

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.520
like when you were

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.520
in the submarine like how deep were you

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.520
well I've asked that

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.520
let him answer

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.520
like how

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.520
400 feet or more

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.520
and like

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.520
do you see any

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.520
bogans or anything

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.520
military

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.520
so you don't see anything there's like 6 inches

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.520
of steel between you

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.520
there are no windows

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520
and no screen doors

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.520
okay alright

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.520
settle down

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.520
do you have to say 400 feet

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.520
or more because someone once told you

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520
that you can't say

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520
that's the secret

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520
so it could have been as much as 2400 feet

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520
and you saw the Loch Ness Monster

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.520
and did battle with it

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.520
I wouldn't tell ya

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.520
he couldn't even tell me

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.520
he couldn't even tell me

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.520
I'd say

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.520
how deep did you go

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.520
pretty deep

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520
how far did you go

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.520
pretty far

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.520
but it is

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.520
you're sworn to secrecy

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.520
even 10 years after he's out

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.520
how long have you been out

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.520
you've been out

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.520
oh boy

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.520
it's like 50 years

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.520
well let's spill

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.520
what's up with Area 51

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.520
was it Sarah

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.520
was it Sarah Palin who said they could see Russia

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.520
from her backyard

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.520
I could see it through the periscope

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.520
I was going to make the joke

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.520
you were just off the coast of Nova Scotia

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.520
no not really

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.520
yeah

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.520
you were in a submarine

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.520
whose job was if the shit hit the fan

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.520
to strike first

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.520
if not second and harder

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.520
like you were parked off of our enemy

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.520
and waiting to blow them up

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.520
if you had to

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.520
what was your day to day like

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.520
like

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.520
cosplay

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.520
you make your own fun

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.520
when you're

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.520
in a steel tube

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.520
90 dudes

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.520
I'm sorry

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.520
it's so unfair

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.520
so unfair

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.520
what was the day to day

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.520
it was pretty routine

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.520
yeah

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.520
yeah I mean

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.520
that's probably a military priority

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.520
yeah

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.520
what was your post

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.520
what was your station

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.520
maneuvering

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.520
we would operate the reactor

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.520
okay wow

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.520
maneuvering and we would operate the reactor

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.520
to me sounds like two different things

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.520
it's the same place

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.520
the control room was called maneuvering

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.520
okay

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.520
but the reactor

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.520
you're talking about the nuclear reactor

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.520
you would operate the reactor

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.520
what was that maneuvering

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.520
and the reactor isn't just a furnace

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.520
that's powering this thing

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.520
you're not just shoveling nuclear material into it

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.520
no you're not shoveling it

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.520
but that's what

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.520
it's required to maneuver

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.520
to move

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.520
is to turn up and down this thermostat

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.520
on this nuclear plant

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.520
not quite a thermostat

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.520
they shape it like a steering wheel

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.520
to make you more comfortable

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.520
but it really hits a thermostat

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.520
how many people

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.520
did that with you

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.520
three

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.520
did anybody go crazy down there

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.520
couple wildcards down there

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.520
never had that happen

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.520
we had someone come aboard one time

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.520
we were short a person

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.520
and they were going to

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.520
volunteer for submarines so they didn't really

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.520
vet them very well

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.520
I guess would be the word

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.520
we never pulled away from the side of the tender

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.520
before he said I can't take this

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.520
that happens on Deadliest Catch

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.520
every week

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.520
there's always a green horn

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.520
I've watched this show on TV

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.520
I'm going to be a great crab fisherman

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.520
and they're like puking and they can't handle it

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.520
let me out of here

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.520
I can't even begin to

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.520
okay so

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.520
were you in the shit

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.520
how long would you be

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.520
in the submarine

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.520
for days

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.520
maybe

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.520
the longest

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.520
120 days

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.520
man

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.520
you guys

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.520
have it so easy

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.520
and were you

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.520
so I assume

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.520
that if you

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.520
so you were parked

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.520
somewhere strategically

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.520
and then after that 120 days

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.520
that's when another sub would come

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.520
and relieve you, kind of tap you out

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.520
and take this thing

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.520
something like that

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.520
we weren't really parked

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.520
we had a little course

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.520
maybe a hundred

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.520
square mile area

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520
where we would be in

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.520
there was never any moment when

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.520
most of the equipment failed

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.520
and there was another one out there

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:54.520
and it was like listen

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.520
BOOM

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.520
turn off all the fans

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.520
the fans are making noise

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.520
we won't be able to

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.520
bubble up to 10

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.520
that bubble only goes to 9

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.520
to 10 I said

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.520
there was never these

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.520
submarine dramas, there's like 9 good ones

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.520
do you watch them

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.520
do you feel traumatized at all

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.520
when you watch dust boot

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.520
when you watch

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.520
dust boot was a good representation

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.520
was that the best one

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.520
was it that airy

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.520
was it really that

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.520
most realistic

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.520
most realistic

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.520
you've got to remember

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.520
I was in mostly peacetime

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.520
cold war

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.520
but it was a little different

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.520
we all miss it so much

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.520
just win our enemy for 50 years

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.520
with other white guys with a backwards alphabet

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.520
so simple

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.520
and we all just had an agreement

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.520
let's just make James Bond movies and hang out

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.520
yeah

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.520
cartoons will have like Natasha

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.520
like femme fatale

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.520
like you know Bullwing

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.520
we do a nuclear drill

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.520
every once in a while

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.520
now it's just like hello

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.520
happy Thanksgiving

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.520
I'm a crazy person

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.520
I'm taking a turkey carving knife

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.520
and I'm doing this

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.520
we don't know what we're doing

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.520
sorry I just envy

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.520
that so much

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.520
we envy the cold war

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.520
it was nice and cold

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.520
I think war is best served cold

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.520
you can see us trying

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.520
to recreate that

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.520
since 9-11 that we're trying desperately

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.520
a new generation

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.520
has inherited

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.520
an empire that was

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.520
really forged by kind of wizards

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.520
guys smoking cigarettes

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.520
and doing nothing but thinking in the basement

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.520
of the Pentagon about how do we get into

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.520
World War II and what are we going to do

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.520
when we get into that and how are we going to turn that

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:56.520
into America running the show

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.520
and they nailed it

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.520
and then that plan

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520
which was 50 years long kind of ran out

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.520
right around that fateful day

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520
and we're all living in this weird epilogue

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.520
where

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.520
it's more open source now we're all watching each other

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.520
lie and scramble to try to recreate

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.520
the glory days

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.520
you can see us trying

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.520
oh oh oh ISIS is it going to be ISIS

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.520
okay great great so ISIS

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.520
can you stand there in your good light

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.520
put the turban on and just like be ISIS

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:26.520
can you be ISIS for 50 years okay

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.520
nailed it great okay that's going to move

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.520
Twinkies

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.520
but they're not playing ball

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.520
that's not going to happen

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.520
I don't know why

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.520
my point is

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520
let's move on

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.520
how many people were on board

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.520
your sub

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.520
over 20

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.520
about

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520
100

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:56.520
are you still friends with them some of them

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.520
some we go to reunion

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.520
every couple years

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.520
because that's a

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.520
you must have gotten really close

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.520
with some of these guys literally yes

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.520
it was required you're very

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.520
you gentlemen

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.520
are going to have to get close logistically

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.520
you were close

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.520
you have submarine reunions

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.520
is what you're saying

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.520
can I come to one of those

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.520
I would like to watch one through

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.520
a periscope

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.520
I don't want to interfere

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.520
I would love to hear what

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.520
you could do your historical

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.520
figure there last reunion

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.520
we had Ben Franklin show up

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.520
literally

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.520
explain

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.520
was it like a stupigram

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.520
a penny saved

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.520
it burned

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.520
he came out of a cake

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.520
and was like

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.520
mom tell him

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.520
tell him mom

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.520
no at the last reunion

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.520
all of a sudden somebody came through the door

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.520
because the name of the ship was Ben Franklin

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.520
and so he came

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.520
through the door all dressed up

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.520
and as a Ben Franklin

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.520
and helped give out all the awards

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.520
and it was kind of cool

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.520
what did he sound like

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.520
what did he sound like

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.520
Ben Franklin

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.520
and I think he sounded exactly

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.520
like Ben Franklin

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.520
oh wow

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.520
that's a pretty good Ben Franklin

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.520
as near as I could tell

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.520
he did the best impression

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.520
of Ben Franklin

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.520
well I think they've been really good sports

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.520
and I want them to end on

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.520
a comfort high

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.520
that's why I want to thank Donna

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.520
and David Straub for coming up

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.520
you guys can go back

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.520
and relax

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.520
well I try to

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.520
figure out how to end the show

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.520
thank you so much

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.520
Dan

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.520
Dan you are very well behaved

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.520
thank you so much

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.520
it was very nice of you to not be obnoxious

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.520
and hurt

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.520
I've always liked your parents

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.520
okay

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.520
I felt like they were kind of being dicks

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:20.520
it's their thing

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.520
no offense

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.520
David does that thing

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.520
with his face

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.520
you can tell he's thinking fuck you

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.520
they're kidding

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.520
this is funny

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.520
this is funny

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:40.520
this is funny to them

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.520
you have great parents

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.520
I do

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.520
I do that's why I brought them along

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.520
I'm proud of them

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.520
but look at you punk rock

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.520
Rob do you remember when we were

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.520
back in Milwaukee we were in the

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.520
dead ale lives and for some reason

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.520
our culture was based around

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.520
humping each other

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.520
all the guys in the improv troupe

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.520
and we would all mime sodomy

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.520
with each other

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.520
it was new no one else was doing it

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.520
it was cutting edge

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.520
and at one point Rob was at my parents house

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.520
in the suburbs of Milwaukee

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.520
and we were so accustomed to doing this thing

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.520
and my dad is a

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.520
nice guy and liked Rob

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.520
and sitting in a counter

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.520
bordering the living room

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.520
in the kitchen and I was in the kitchen

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.520
and Rob you know what a butcher block

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.520
that's a butcher block

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.520
the kitchen island

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.520
Rob bent me over the kitchen island

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.520
I'm listening

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.520
and started miming

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.520
making love to me

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:50.520
I had an opening and I had to go for it

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.520
because you knew his dad would get it

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.520
yeah

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.520
I'm only gonna one chance to do this

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.520
and he pulled

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:00.520
my hair

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.520
and lifted my head

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.520
and said look at your father

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.520
look at your father while I fuck you in the ass

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.520
and my dad

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520
was like eating eating

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520
with pistachios

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.520
on a paper towel

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.520
by the phone

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.520
by the landline

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.520
and was like

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.520
what

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.520
I remember my dad was like

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.520
he thought it was funny

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.520
but he was so confused

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.520
as to when did this become okay

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.520
am I supposed to do something

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.520
they're 20

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.520
I never really

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.520
realized until now

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.520
that you never did that

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.520
you had every right to do that to me

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.520
right tonight

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.520
right now

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.520
believe me I've been a really good host

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.520
yeah

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.520
you had every right to do that

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.520
in between then and now

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.520
and you never did

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.520
and I wouldn't

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:24.520
interact with your family

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.520
did you get along with your parents

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.520
my dad would never forget that

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.520
I feel like our relationship would have been different

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520
from then on

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:34.520
yeah I get along with my parents

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.520
now

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520
I always got along with my parents

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.520
cause I tried just to get along

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:42.520
but lately

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.520
a couple years ago

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.520
I'm going to consciously

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.520
I know it's not them

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.520
I'm the one

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.520
that has a problem

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.520
with this

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.520
they're my parents

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.520
and I'm not going to change them

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.520
and why would I want to change them

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.520
and so then I just made a conscious effort

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520
to try and get along

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.520
well mostly my mother

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.520
because I was kind of a mama's boy

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.520
grown up

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.520
and my mom and I have a great relationship

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.520
thank you

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.520
my dad

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.520
was just in town last night

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.520
we went to a silent auction

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520
it was fucking great

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.520
Papa Cordray

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.520
and Nate

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.520
my brother Nate Cordray

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.520
the three of us

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.520
all the male cordries we went

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.520
we bid on a lot of shit

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.520
it was silent auction

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:38.520
it was loud

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.520
there's still time to bid

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.520
go to

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.520
um

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.520
the point of the story is that

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.520
I just saw my dad last night

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.520
it was fun

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.520
do they live back in Boston?

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520
well everybody that's

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.520
retired in Boston

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520
moves to Florida

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520
so they live in the villages

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520
do you know about the villages?

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.520
my father and his

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.520
wife live in the villages

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520
which is the largest

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.520
retirement community in the world

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520
and apparently you can see it

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.520
from the moon

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.520
it's like the Great Wall of China

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520
and the villages

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.520
at 5.30 in the morning

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.520
when they all go to breakfast you can see

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.520
the people

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.520
it's like a line of ants

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.520
and uh

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.520
it's uh

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.520
it's fucking crazy

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.520
it's the largest

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.520
recorded

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.520
the largest recorded HPV

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.520
outbreak happened there

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.520
because

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.520
because

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.520
do you remember that movie

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:50.520
with Matt Dillon's first movie

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.520
what was that like with the teenagers

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.520
it was about a um

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.520
drugstruck cowboy

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.520
the bodyguard

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520
you know what I'm talking about

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:02.520
what's it called?

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.520
no

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.520
before that

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.520
no no no cheap trick to the soundtrack

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.520
cheap trick it's called cheap trick

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.520
no no that was just a soundtrack

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:14.520
it was uh but anyway it was a movie

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.520
about um

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.520
uh

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.520
planned communities

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.520
kids taking over

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.520
and for the first time

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.520
and this happened in the 70's

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.520
communities

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.520
there were planned communities

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.520
in the 70's and

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.520
for the first time ever there was a dense

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.520
population of teenagers

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.520
and when teenagers get

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520
over the edge

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.520
they get together and they commit

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.520
no bottom of the streets

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.520
over the edge

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.520
what?

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.520
Terminator 2

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.520
the movie's called over the edge

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.520
movie's called over the edge

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:56.520
it's called Matt Dillon's first movie

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:58.520
and uh

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.520
and they went

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.520
when a concentrated

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.520
when a concentrated

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.520
group of teens get together

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.520
they commit crimes

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.520
like they just go crazy

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.520
in our neighborhood we just throw rocks

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:14.520
at cars

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.520
they take acid

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.520
cause that was a new thing

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.520
and they throw rocks at cars

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.520
but they um

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.520
this is all to say

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.520
it's a fun movie

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.520
um

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.520
what's the name of it

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.520
over the edge

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.520
it might be over there with Kristen McNichol

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520
I think I don't know if she's in it

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.520
I think Kristen McNichol might be in it too

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.520
but when you get uh

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.520
they chain like all of the parents

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.520
and the adults inside the high school

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520
and then they

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.520
that's like a drink to video kickboxing

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.520
I don't even know if I'm gonna tell the end of this story because

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:52.520
it's it was great

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.520
before I belabored the whole

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.520
fucking thing

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.520
uh anyway they got

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.520
for the first time this amount of old people

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.520
together in this concentrated

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520
a population and all they do is

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520
fuck

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.520
cause old people fuck and teenagers

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.520
uh do crimes

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.520
that's my point

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.520
that's my stance

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.520
but do old people

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.520
do they

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:20.520
do it extra maritaly

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:22.520
yeah I think so

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.520
all swingers I think they all um

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.520
there's an orgy club

01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.520
or something

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.520
I don't think the Schrabs are moving to Florida

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.520
no you guys have been married

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.520
all these people they're on their second marriages

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:36.520
they're uh and they're

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.520
they go at five o'clock

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.520
they go to the town village

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.520
they go to the town square

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.520
the created, the built

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.520
the fucked up

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.520
two men enter

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.520
three men leave

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.520
uh

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520
we'll figure it out

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.520
that's the motto of the fucked up

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.520
and they uh tailgate

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.520
they tailgate at the town square

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.520
and they line dance

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.520
all the women line dance

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.520
in their golf carts they all have golf

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.520
golf carts and they get fucked up

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.520
and then they have sex

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:14.520
they give each other HPV

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.520
which is a serious thing

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.520
HPV

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.520
Jaws

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.520
it sounded like your dad is at a second marriage

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.520
because you said your dad and his wife

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.520
you didn't say my mom

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.520
yeah yeah no my parents split up

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.520
when I was 25

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.520
because my mother came out of the closet

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.520
yeah she be

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.520
she came out of the closet and caught your dad

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.520
cheating on her

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.520
it was a literal closet back then

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.520
oh I'm sorry yeah she had her office

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.520
in the closet she had a little desk

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.520
in there

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.520
and uh yeah a little computer

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.520
and that's where she did her busy work

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.520
uh

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:56.520
yeah no she came out of the closet in 1985

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.520
1995

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.520
and um

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.520
and they split up

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.520
soon after that obviously

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.520
uh and now is your mom

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.520
oh yeah she's with the same woman

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.520
she was with she basically

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.520
split up with my dad for

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.520
right and uh it's great

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.520
do they get married?

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.520
they got married three or four times

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.520
if you're gay in the northeast

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:22.520
like you go to every state

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.520
that legalizes it

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.520
you're like I'm gonna get married here

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.520
you get married everywhere

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.520
it's great

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.520
and so you've got uh

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:34.520
I'm sure you just referred to her by her first name

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.520
but like how do you think

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:38.520
it's just like anti

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.520
Spence her name is Spence

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.520
that's her last name

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.520
that's crazy

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.520
that's her last name too

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:50.520
her name's Depp

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.520
but everybody calls her by her last name

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.520
she's from West Roxbury

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.520
she's a Boston town

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:58.520
2-1-3-2

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.520
man I want a lesbian mom

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.520

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.520

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.520
pretty cool man

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.520

that would be amazing

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.520
yeah

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.520
that would be a great way out of a lot of conversations

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.520
I worked through a lot of shit

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.520
oh it was so hard for me

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:20.520
yeah

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.520
yeah you could drop any

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.520
you could take that to any direction you wanted

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.520
you're like look my mom's a lesbian

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.520
fuck you

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.520
you could bend that to any

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.520
everybody would be like alright fine

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.520

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.520
wow okay

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.520
so wait

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:40.520
there was something on the tip of my

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.520
brain

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.520
oh I wanted to take a poll

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.520
cause I'm so curious so let's just assume

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.520
the median age in here is like 25

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.520
26

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:52.520
so

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.520
applaud

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.520
if you're

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.520
how do I

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.520
pull this data

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.520
simply applaud if

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:04.520
your parents are

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.520
her

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:08.520
first marriage

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.520
oh

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.520
okay so

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520
now applaud if you're

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.520
that's not the case if your parents are

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.520
okay

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.520
still sounds like a minority

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.520
I don't know you hear these

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.520
figures like 70% 80%

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:28.520
there's a lot of people that didn't clap at all

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.520
what happened

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.520
there's another category

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.520
what's the other category

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:36.520
those are people who were born in life pots

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.520
under the earth

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:40.520
but the trees are in the audience

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.520
the trees are their parents and they're here to

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:44.520
take back what's theirs

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.520
alright

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.520
it's the happening

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.520
alright

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.520
Spencer

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.520
I have a friend named Abed

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.520
oh god what happened

01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.520
this is fucked up

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.520
yeah I talked to Abed today it turns out

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:02.520
okay he drives an

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.520
Uber for his job

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.520
he's been out of work for a while and he's like

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.520
I should get a job with Uber he fucking loves it

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.520
it's like a great job

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:12.520
for him you know he can talk to people

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.520
he gets the money he wants he can make his own hours

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.520
it's great he was driving around

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.520
and some guy flags him down

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.520
and is like hey how did it go

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.520
he stops for the guy

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.520
and is like what's happening

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.520
he's like will you pick me up and he's like

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.520
well you gotta use the app and the guy's like

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.520
well let me go get my girlfriend

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.520
the guy walks off and a cop car

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.520
pulls up behind him and is like

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:36.520
you can't do that shit without a taxi license

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.520
and he's like I didn't do anything

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.520
the guy flagged me down and I talked to him

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.520
they arrested him

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.520
impounded his vehicle took him to the station

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.520
let him out and he had to

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.520
get a ride home he doesn't have his car

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.520
so he doesn't have his job

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.520
and so his car is impounded

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.520
and he can't make money to pay to get it out of impounded

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.520
so I

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.520
set up a GoFundMe for him

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.520
it's GoFundMe.com

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.520
slash Help AuBed

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.520
it's not too much money we're just trying to get him

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.520
so he can pay his rent because he can't

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.520
pay his rent because he can't you know work

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.520
that's insane so it's crazy

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:12.520
because it sounds like are they shaking down

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.520
is this this must be, is there something

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.520
to LA municipally? it was in Van Nuys

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.520
so I don't know I mean Van Nuys might be

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.520
less busy than real LA

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.520
but I don't know

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.520
yeah what's that

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:26.520
that's a thing

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.520
I mean it seems like a really effective one

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.520
I mean it's like if you were trying to shut down Uber

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.520
then you're just impounding cars

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:34.520
for 30 days at a time because it doesn't matter

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.520
you don't get to

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.520
go to court and go I was guiltier

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:40.520
your car is just out of commission for 30 days

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.520
yeah I mean I'm not a lawyer but

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.520
but that's straight up entrapment

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.520
not stopping

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.520
for a person flagging down your car is called

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.520
being a dick

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.520
that's really how it went down

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.520
it took me a long time

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.520
to really get the details out

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:00.520
but I think that's the accurate picture

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.520
because you were talking to Abed

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.520
yeah we've had Abed on the show before

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:06.520
is this a real Abed?

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.520
another one of my friends

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.520
he brought everyone so much joy

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:12.520
in the form

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.520
I always want to point out

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.520
I do think that the character I created

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.520
is more dimensional

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.520
I think that calling Abed real Abed

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.520
is an insult

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.520
but I trust you

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.520
I feel like what I did is the real Abed

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.520
like this is a guy named Abed

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.520
so the original Abed

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.520
yeah the original

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.520
he's the name that I got

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.520
the name from this dude

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.520
but yeah he's a

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:40.520
he's a good guy and we love him

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.520
and he's

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.520
I'm relieved that he's not currently in jail

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.520
yeah

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.520
how long was he in jail for?

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:50.520
I don't think he was

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:52.520
he was arrested and they took him to the station

01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.520
and then they let him go

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.520
like handcuffs and everything?

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.520
I think they put him in the back of the car

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.520
I don't know if they put him in handcuffs

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.520
in the back of the Uber or in the back of a cop car

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.520
that'd be weird

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.520
yeah drive to the impound lot

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:08.520
we'll follow you

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.520
as we all know

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.520
in the Los Angeles area

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:14.520
typically if you flag down a cop car

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520
you get shot in the eyeball

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.520
in the face

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:20.520
he'll fund me

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.520
you know I was passionate about that

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.520
for my attention span

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.520
but there's a guy

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.520
across the street from Schrab's apartment

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.520
no in front of my apartment

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.520
yeah he saw it

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.520
weird distinction

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.520
across the street

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.520
you are connected with it

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.520
no no no

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.520
there was this guy that was walking down the street

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.520
during like prime time on Los Feliz

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.520
and he flagged down a cop

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.520
he had like

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.520
a towel around his hand

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.520
and he flagged down the cop car

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.520
and they pulled over and they got out

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.520
because he goes walking every day

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.520
according to his son takes a towel and a bottle of water

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.520
no shirt, broad daylight

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.520
Los Feliz

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.520
he's just walking

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.520
middle aged guy just what he does

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.520
he goes walking

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.520
unfortunately the story

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.520
the story

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.520
the true side of the story

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:16.520
that you need is locked in the

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.520
brains that end up getting blown out

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.520
because the other

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.520
side is up to the lawyers and the city

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.520
the police get out of the car and they say

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.520
drop the gun, drop the gun and he's like

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:28.520
I don't know what and he didn't have a gun

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.520
what would you do if you were holding a towel and cops kept saying

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.520
drop your gun, drop the gun

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.520
you would probably go

01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520
I don't think I would drop my towel

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.520
I think there's a good chance I would go

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.520
it's a towel

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:42.520
they shot him in the eye

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520
and he

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.520
didn't die

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:48.520
and then they

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.520
handcuffed him which I guess is police

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.520
procedure

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.520
but they just rolled his

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.520
bloody

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.520
it was awful

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.520
but it happened right outside my house

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.520
Kate and I were hanging out in the living room

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.520
when we were here

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.520
somebody just got shot and looked outside

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.520
and there's everything

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:10.520
there's a million videos of his lifeless body

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.520
being handcuffed

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.520
there's no videos of the incident even though it happened in

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:16.520
rush hour traffic because

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.520
it just happened that fast

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:20.520
the problem is

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.520
like

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.520
the way that the city handles this stuff

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.520
something like this happens and then

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.520
this guy's

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.520
wife, she has to quit her job

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.520
we pretend

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.520
it's not like

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:36.520
a game show where all of a sudden you're

01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:38.520
elevated to a different part of life

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.520
their ordinary life has to continue

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.520
and everyone's just like yeah we shot your husband in the eye

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.520
and the two cops

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.520
that did it are going back to work of course they would

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.520
they're getting evicted too because they can't afford

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.520
to pay rent because

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.520
she has to take care of her husband who a quarter

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.520
of his head is missing

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.520
while they're dealing

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.520
there's just a go fund me for them

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.520
because it's like well we can't make our rent

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.520
it's not about

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.520
justice it's not about outrage

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.520
well now we're going to be homeless

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.520
too because we got shot in the eye

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.520
by the cops we're going to also

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.520
then as a matter of course

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.520
be evicted from our apartment

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.520
that's the point where it gets

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.520
it's insane

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.520
so which I think

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.520
crowdfunding if there's one thing we can do

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.520
and I always said when I was tweeting that

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.520
link I was like if you live in Los Angeles

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.520
and particularly if you work for the city

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.520
because

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.520
maybe you know let's have a steak in this

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.520
but you know people from

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.520
Ireland will then give a dollar to a guy

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.520
it's like well there must be fucked up stuff

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.520
going on in Ireland

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.520
I don't know what my point is

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.520
I know that there's suffering happening all over the place

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.520
but there's a

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.520
the two go fund me's on my radar

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.520
are the guy who got his brain shot out

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.520
in front of Rob's apartment whose wife is about

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.520
to be homeless because it's hard to take care

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.520
of a person with a quarter of a brain

01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:58.520
and also work at

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.520
Shoney's like

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.520
wherever she worked she worked at NASA

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.520
Dan don't be an asshole

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.520
whatever her job was

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:10.520
I'm sure it was 12 hours a day

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:12.520
then she had to quit it

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:14.520
so it's just like a certain amount of money they need

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.520
so they can continue to live in their apartment

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.520
and this is Abbot now who got entrapped

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:20.520
obviously entrapped

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.520
unless he's a pathological liar

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.520
which I don't think he is

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.520
he got flagged out by a cop

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.520
but they confiscated his car

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.520
and now he can't make a living

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.520
with the Holocaust survivors

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.520
put that on the back burner

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.520
does he have his car back?

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.520
no no

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.520
it's impounded and he can't even get it

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.520
he can't try for 30 days

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:44.520
how much does it cost

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.520
to get it impounded?

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.520
I don't know

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.520
they won't tell you the exact price

01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.520
rebounded yes

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.520
we made an estimate but they won't tell you

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.520
the exact price but they'll tell you what they think

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.520
it'll be over the phone

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.520
they won't tell you until 30 days pass

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.520
because they charge you for the toe

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.520
and then for the storing the whole time

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.520
they charge you for the storing

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.520
hey we're not made out of space over here

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:10.520
at the impound lot where you can't get your car out

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.520
you're putting us out

01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:14.520
30 days

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.520
I wish I could whistle

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.520
30 days you made us keep this car in here

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:20.520
if you ever

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.520
get

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.520
approached by a policeman

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:26.520
just lay down on the ground

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:28.520
and spread

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.520
your limbs out

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.520
and just say

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:34.520
I don't have anything in my hands

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:36.520
I don't have anything in my hands

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.520
what you're describing

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.520
is what we found out in this recent

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.520
rash this last year

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.520
culturally what's come to the surface

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.520
is that this is something that black parents actually

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.520
have to say to their kids

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:50.520
they have to have the cop talk

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.520
with their kids the cop talk

01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:54.520
regardless of their

01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.520
tax bracket

01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.520
if a cop ever has an

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.520
encounter with you

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:02.520
I don't care what you see on TV

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.520
I don't care what you believe

01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:06.520
about society

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.520
a parent has to sit on the foot of the bed of a kid

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.520
and say

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.520
you need to comply

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.520
beyond all reasoning

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.520
in addition to all the other shit

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.520
you gotta sit on the foot of your bed

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.520
in front of their bed

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.520
there's so many things already

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.520
there's a whole list

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.520
can you imagine being that kid though

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.520
being the kid who's like

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.520
I've been growing up just as a normal person

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.520
and it's like oh

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.520
I gotta be afraid of the cops

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:36.520
as a small child

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.520
it's gotta just fuck with you

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:40.520
it's like these people that are supposed to protect me

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.520
they might hurt me

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.520
that's gotta really put you in

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.520
a real

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:48.520
stressful high anxiety

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.520
cause that's how I feel about cops

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.520
they're probably gonna kill me

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.520
and that's completely unfounded

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.520
cause I'm just walking around

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:58.520
but it's just the idea

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.520
that you'd have to think about that

01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.520
just from being a small child

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.520
is just so heartbreaking to me

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.520
and by the way the LAPD

01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.520
in general as far as I understand it

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.520
since the Rodney King thing

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.520
you'd notice

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:14.520
I'm curious about the statistics

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.520
because you don't hear the good news

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.520
especially when the good news is lack of brutality

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.520
cause there's nothing to report there

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:22.520
but as far as I understand

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.520
the LAPD was taken over by the Department of Justice

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.520
is still like being baby sat

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.520
by a weird bureaucratic

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.520
commission that's out of any satire

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.520
you'd write about political correctness

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.520
but is functioning

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.520
actually kind of okay

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.520
minus the odd guy getting shot in the eyeball

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.520
that there isn't

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.520
that it's way more fucked up

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.520
in a lot of other cities that we're discovering

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.520
this entrenched crazy

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.520
like you're lifting up rocks

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.520
and there's just worms crawling out

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.520
and you're like holy crap

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.520
the LAPD is like

01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.520
but correct me if I'm wrong

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.520
tweet me and

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.520
show me articles and things

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.520
cause I'm too lazy to read

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.520
but that's my perception

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:06.520
is that actually

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.520
it's unreportably positive

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.520
that we're kind of like

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.520
we're not in the headlines

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.520
for the last 15 years

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520
it's a very new city

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.520
I love the movie L.A. Confidential

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.520
because

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.520
well I don't know

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.520
because it's fucking awesome

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.520
but also it's like

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.520
shows us this cross section

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.520
of the LAPD at that time

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:32.520
and it

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.520
it seems systemically like

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:36.520
they've just

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.520
they were always

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:40.520
they were built on this corruption

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.520
and then yeah recently

01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.520
it's

01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.520
I'm drunk

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.520
I'm a little drunk

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.520
around the time

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.520
there was this rampart scandal

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.520
it was like they created this anti-gang

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.520
task force in the rampart

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.520
neighborhood Los Angeles

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.520
because it was such a heavy gang activity

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.520
and that was

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.520
it was an eye-opener because

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.520
the rampart anti-gang

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:08.520
squad

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.520
became just another gang

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.520
and they literally would go

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.520
they would

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:16.520
I don't know if they would literally

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:18.520
did drive-bys because they didn't have to

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.520
drive-bys are a thing you do because there's cops

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520
if you're a cop you get out

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:24.520
you handcuff a guy get him on his knees

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.520
and they were assassinating people

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.520
they were like handcuffing them and then killing them

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:30.520
because they were simply another gang

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.520
that had a different outfit and a different kind of car

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520
and had a different

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.520
what kind of car

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:38.520
one with the flashing lights

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.520
it was rocking

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.520
but that shit all got

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.520
the LAPD currently as far as I understand it

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.520
exists in a very modern open

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.520
source bureaucratic kind of way

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.520
yeah but like you said

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.520
it's having to grow

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.520
from that

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.520
origin

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.520
they're having to

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.520
it's like a whole new thing

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.520
hopefully I don't know anything about it

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:04.520
who knows we're not the worst

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:06.520
but we could do a lot better

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.520
uh... Ohio

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.520
yeah fuck those guys

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.520

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.520
um uh... alright well

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:16.520

01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:20.520
do a two-minute D&D game

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.520
alright okay

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.520
what are we playing these days

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.520
oh we can't play fantasy role-playing games

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:28.520
god damn it

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:30.520

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.520
contracts, no contracts

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.520
what

01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.520
I don't even know if I believe this

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.520
to be honest

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.520
did you read the contract

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.520
it was part of the negotiation

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:44.520
for what

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.520

01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:00.520
in a field full of

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.520
old timey maces

01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.520
and uh...

01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:06.520
grindstones

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:08.520
you see armor

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.520
and treasure chests

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.520
I put on the armor

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.520
you put on the armor and you have

01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:16.520
medieval powers

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.520
your bag of holding contains

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.520

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.520

01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.520

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.520
you don't feel any remorse

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.520
shit

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:14.520
you feel sociopathic

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.520
like you feel

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.520
like disconnected

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.520
20 sociopathic

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.520
in your mind it's like you're playing a game

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.520
and the results don't matter

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.520
you can just do whatever you want

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.520
you're crying by the way

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.520
no this is all great

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:32.520
oh no I wanna play we can't play

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.520
well it's ten o'clock

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.520
Spencer plays up this contract

01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.520
guys in for a four hour show

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.520
yeah

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.520
now what we should have done

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.520
it would have been great

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.520
to have Spencer custom create

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:48.520
a role playing environment where we're in a submarine

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.520
with your dad

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.520
and we do like a sub drama

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:54.520
it would have been amazing

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.520
and then like create a campaign

01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.520
you should create your own role playing

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.520
we should do a sub genre

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.520
but hey guess why this show is available

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.520
every week because we don't have any time

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:06.520
to do it and we don't do anything

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.520
so fuck you

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:10.520
fuck you reddit

01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.520

I miss Camille

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.520

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.520
every since the bloobie

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:20.520
it's all just old

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.520
it's pretty obvious

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.520
that the show

01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:26.520
was like hey what fuck you

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.520
none of my friends are here

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.520
yeah no the show's really sliding

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:44.520

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:46.520
they're all over it

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.520
all right

01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.520
we'll end with probably like a rap

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:54.520
or

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.520

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.520
yeah

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.520
I mean it's forced

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.520
but it's how you end the show

01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.520
force it

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.520
force it

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.520

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:24.520
