But they just give you a box, and in the box, no, no, it's got\n\n03:42.400 --> 03:50.120\nlike two like medicine, you know, like, you know, orange little pill bottle things, and\n\n03:50.120 --> 03:55.720\nlike a little long cotton swab thing, which I guess you're supposed to like hockey puck\n\n03:55.720 --> 04:04.120\nit into the, what's the cotton for? No, no, it's a hockey puck thing, right, but it's\n\n04:04.120 --> 04:07.560\nnot, but it's not, there's no cotton, you said there's a cotton swab cotton swab, yeah,\n\n04:07.560 --> 04:12.080\nI guess, without the cotton, well, they would didn't have it without the cotton and just\n\n04:12.080 --> 04:18.200\nbe a stick and that's, isn't that what you should use to knock a turd into a bottle? That\n\n04:18.200 --> 04:23.800\nwould be really unsanitary, but if they're gonna find cotton in your feces and say you're\n\n04:23.800 --> 04:30.080\npart sheep for, I think, I think that's part of the process, I think they got it figured\n\n04:30.080 --> 04:40.320\nout. Did you eat a pair of jeans, sir? I did not, I'm supposed to mail it to Texas, where\n\n04:40.320 --> 04:47.400\neverything's bigger, right, so that's why it's two pill bottles, right, right, okay,\n\n04:47.400 --> 04:57.680\nso, box includes two bottles. And an instruction, and it comes with a big piece of paper, and\n\n04:57.680 --> 05:03.040\nthe instruction says, well, I don't know what the terminology is, but it says please\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:09.280\ndefecate on the paper, and then provide the stool samples in the pill bottles, and it\n\n05:09.280 --> 05:15.360\nsays, and it provides you with the paper. Which is a little weird. And the paper has\n\n05:15.360 --> 05:21.240\na target on it. No, it doesn't. It has a fly on it, like, you know, in the urinals.\n\n05:21.240 --> 05:28.600\nYeah. Girls, there's in urinals, there's like a little fly. In the funnier urinals, it's\n\n05:28.600 --> 05:35.440\nlike a fly sticker. It's supposed to pee on the fly. Yeah. And you get a... I don't really\n\n05:35.440 --> 05:42.160\nget that. You know what I do get in love? A urinal filled with ice. Oh, man. When you're\n\n05:42.160 --> 05:46.840\nlucky enough to, like, catch a urinal, they've just dumped a bunch of ice into it. Yeah,\n\n05:46.840 --> 05:52.800\nyou feel like you've got heat vision coming out of your dick. Yeah, you feel like a mutant\n\n05:52.800 --> 06:00.480\nsuperhero. Yeah. I'll take care of this. Melting glaciers. Stand back, Wonder Woman. Yeah. This\n\n06:00.480 --> 06:06.480\nis a job for a slightly above room temperature pee. And there's, like, steam coming off,\n\n06:06.480 --> 06:14.040\nso it's kind of... Yeah, no. You feel like a man, finally. Speaking of poop, I took a\n\n06:14.040 --> 06:21.320\nBrigadoon poop. I'll explain what that means. I was at Rick and Morty, and I was in an edit\n\n06:21.320 --> 06:27.600\nsession. I got up from the edit bay to take a poop. I said, I'm going to go take a poop.\n\n06:27.600 --> 06:34.640\nAnd I went to the bathroom, and I took a poop. And it was long. You know, it did some tweaks.\n\n06:34.640 --> 06:44.000\nLong in time? Yeah, long. Yes. I finished, and then I, like, I walked into the writer's\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:54.720\nroom, and I looked at one of the writers, Erica, and she was... Because the boss just\n\n06:54.720 --> 06:58.240\nwalked into the room, she's just, like, looking at me kind of expectantly, and after a while\n\n06:58.240 --> 07:04.320\nI go, I know, it was a long poop. She didn't know what the hell I was talking about. Because\n\n07:04.320 --> 07:10.480\nI had taken a Brigadoon poop. I had lost time in the... I've never seen Brigadoon, but...\n\n07:10.480 --> 07:16.200\nI don't know the reference. Well, I forgot where I... When I finished taking the poop,\n\n07:16.200 --> 07:21.520\nI forgot where I had been before I started pooping, and just walked into a new room thinking\n\n07:21.520 --> 07:25.920\nthat that's where I was, and started talking to them about my poop as if I was bookending\n\n07:25.920 --> 07:29.840\na conversation about my shit. And they were just, like, okay, because they're paid to\n\n07:29.840 --> 07:37.400\njust listen. And then I was, like, so where were we? And they were, like, you were about\n\n07:37.400 --> 07:42.240\nto go into an edit session, and I was, like, oh, oh! And then I went into the edit room,\n\n07:42.240 --> 07:45.680\nand it was, like, so... It was a long poop, and they were, like, yeah, it really was.\n\n07:45.680 --> 07:54.600\nAnd I said, well, here's why. Is it dementia? No, no, no. They just linked Prilosec to dementia.\n\n07:54.600 --> 08:01.080\nBecause Brigadoon was... Did he have an edit session?\n\n08:01.080 --> 08:07.560\nBrigadoon was a town where you go, and then you're, like, oh, these people are so cool.\n\n08:07.560 --> 08:14.200\nAnd then, like, when you leave, you're older, or they leave, like, the town only appears,\n\n08:14.200 --> 08:19.120\nlike, on full moons at midnight or something, or... But if you're not out of the town, then\n\n08:19.120 --> 08:22.720\nyou have to stay in it forever, because it's, like...\n\n08:22.720 --> 08:28.560\nWhich episode was this? It's, like, some weird teleportation town\n\n08:28.560 --> 08:33.320\nwhere there's something to do with, like, old people or something.\n\n08:33.320 --> 08:39.240\nOh, okay. We'll bring up a Brigadoon expert. All right, look.\n\n08:39.240 --> 08:42.400\nYes, let's get on with it. There's only so many things here that I\n\n08:42.400 --> 08:45.360\ncould talk about that would be more fun with our guest.\n\n08:45.360 --> 08:51.280\nYes. Hey, why don't you give me some business, like, irritate me.\n\n08:51.280 --> 08:59.560\nOh, Dan, you'd ever hang out with me, and I miss you, and I wish we were closer friends.\n\n08:59.560 --> 09:03.880\nRob, knock it the fuck off. I swear to God, Rob.\n\n09:03.880 --> 09:06.200\nPut your glasses on.\n\n09:06.200 --> 09:11.160\nOkay. Rob, knock it the fuck off.\n\n09:11.160 --> 09:15.200\nI'm warning you, Rob, I will fucking replace you. You can be replaced.\n\n09:15.200 --> 09:20.520\nI can't be replaced. I'm the only Rob friend you have.\n\n09:20.520 --> 09:23.520\nLadies and gentlemen, please welcome Rob Corddry.\n\n09:23.520 --> 09:28.520\nI'm another bald Rob.\n\n09:28.520 --> 09:38.520\nWait, stay there.

Which is what I hear every week.\n\n10:00.520 --> 10:03.520\nI'm glad you got the memo about the plaid shirt.\n\n10:03.520 --> 10:07.520\nYeah, yeah, and the bald...\n\n10:07.520 --> 10:11.520\nOh, my God.

I think we look hot.\n\n10:21.520 --> 10:26.520\nI'm just wearing this to cover the fact that I'm wearing an inside out shirt right now.\n\n10:26.520 --> 10:28.520\nYou texted us today after you got home?\n\n10:28.520 --> 10:35.520\nAfter we got off the flight and got home from the flight after we had been together all the time in the airport,\n\n10:35.520 --> 10:42.520\nI was like, hey, did any of you notice that my shirt was inside out the whole day?\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:47.520\nNope. This isn't a crowd to notice that.\n\n10:47.520 --> 10:56.520\nIs your shirt inside out or is it like an inside out movie t-shirt?\n\n10:56.520 --> 10:59.520\nWith the inside out look?\n\n10:59.520 --> 11:01.520\nEither way, you're ashamed of it.\n\n11:01.520 --> 11:05.520\nYeah, well, Dan lost an Oscar too inside out.\n\n11:05.520 --> 11:10.520\nSo I could see why you would be covering up that.\n\n11:10.520 --> 11:13.520\nSo, yes or no?\n\n11:13.520 --> 11:16.520\nNo. You know what I won when I lost that Oscar?\n\n11:16.520 --> 11:20.520\nAn integrity.\n\n11:20.520 --> 11:24.520\nIt's an award I gave myself.\n\n11:24.520 --> 11:25.520\nThe integris.\n\n11:25.520 --> 11:28.520\nYeah, Oscars are for sell-outs.\n\n11:28.520 --> 11:33.520\nAnd you know, 18% of all integrity nominees are black.\n\n11:33.520 --> 11:34.520\nPretty cool.\n\n11:34.520 --> 11:39.520\nIt's reflective of the proportion of the population.\n\n11:39.520 --> 11:43.520\nI didn't run those numbers, but yeah, probably.\n\n11:43.520 --> 11:44.520\nJust saying it's a fair award.\n\n11:44.520 --> 11:45.520\nIt sounds right.\n\n11:45.520 --> 11:46.520\nAnd it's a good one.\n\n11:46.520 --> 11:47.520\nI have one of these.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:48.520\nIt's one that counts.\n\n11:48.520 --> 11:49.520\nYes.\n\n11:49.520 --> 11:50.520\nAll right, so thank you for coming, Rob.\n\n11:50.520 --> 11:57.520\nIt was very flattering because you said, well, you're working in Miami because you're on ballers.\n\n11:57.520 --> 12:01.520\nYeah, well, really?\n\n12:01.520 --> 12:06.520\nDid not expect a big baller's crowd here tonight.\n\n12:06.520 --> 12:09.520\nHow does that schedule throughout the year work?\n\n12:09.520 --> 12:10.520\nChildren's Hospital is still happening.\n\n12:10.520 --> 12:11.520\nWhen are you shooting that?\n\n12:11.520 --> 12:12.520\nAnd when are you balling?\n\n12:12.520 --> 12:15.520\nI'm like...\n\n12:15.520 --> 12:20.520\nNice.\n\n12:20.520 --> 12:23.520\nI shoot Children's Hospital.\n\n12:23.520 --> 12:25.520\nWell, Shaw, we just ended the show.\n\n12:25.520 --> 12:31.520\nI shoot it in the summer, and then ballers happens around Halloween.\n\n12:31.520 --> 12:32.520\nI leave on Bud Halloween.\n\n12:32.520 --> 12:34.520\nSo you did it like a February?\n\n12:34.520 --> 12:36.520\nFinale episode, it's done?\n\n12:36.520 --> 12:37.520\nNo, we didn't.\n\n12:37.520 --> 12:38.520\nYeah, it's done.\n\n12:38.520 --> 12:40.520\nWait, Children's Hospital or Ballers?\n\n12:40.520 --> 12:42.520\nNo, Children's Hospital.\n\n12:42.520 --> 12:49.520\nWe decided to end it not knowing that this season was going to be the last when we shot it,\n\n12:49.520 --> 12:52.520\nbut the season is so good.\n\n12:52.520 --> 12:57.520\nAnd for a lot of reasons, I wanted to sort of move on and do other things.\n\n12:57.520 --> 12:59.520\nBut the finale...\n\n12:59.520 --> 13:00.520\nIs it really...\n\n13:00.520 --> 13:03.520\nLike, was it the best season?\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:05.520\nI say that every season, you know?\n\n13:05.520 --> 13:07.520\nI'm just fine.\n\n13:07.520 --> 13:09.520\nBecause I would never have that in me.\n\n13:09.520 --> 13:13.520\nIf I was like, this is the best season, I'd be like, well, then we've got to keep doing it.\n\n13:13.520 --> 13:18.520\nI don't know about best season, but I would be proud to go out on this season.\n\n13:18.520 --> 13:19.520\nHow many seasons?\n\n13:19.520 --> 13:20.520\nSeven.\n\n13:20.520 --> 13:26.520\nSeven.

13:50.520\nThe community went to season six, as you know.\n\n13:50.520 --> 13:53.520\nThat was the season that you were the in-house director on.\n\n13:53.520 --> 13:54.520\nAnd then we got canceled.\n\n13:54.520 --> 13:58.520\nWhoops, whoops.\n\n13:58.520 --> 14:04.520\nI wonder, what happened there?\n\n14:04.520 --> 14:06.520\nRick and Morty's on the third season.\n\n14:06.520 --> 14:11.520\nWe're writing about the fourth episode of that.\n\n14:11.520 --> 14:15.520\nAnd, you know, and I'm doing great minds on history.\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:17.520\nI shoot that every weekend.\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:20.520\nAnd I think the Jason Sudeikis episode was just up.\n\n14:20.520 --> 14:21.520\nYou want to do that?\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:23.520\nYou want to be a historical figure?\n\n14:23.520 --> 14:26.520\nIt would be weird for you to say no.\n\n14:26.520 --> 14:29.520\nGive me the elevator pitch.\n\n14:29.520 --> 14:33.520\nYou come through, you pick a historical figure, whatever you want.\n\n14:33.520 --> 14:35.520\nNo, I don't like it.\n\n14:35.520 --> 14:44.520\nAnd then you're coming in the conceded of the show is that Spencer has created a version of time travel to bring historical figures back.\n\n14:44.520 --> 14:54.520\nIt's like data fracking, like where you reach back and you grab the biological data from a historical figure and then you shoot it into these pucks of Chinese lard and\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:57.520\nyou shoot it into these cell cells.\n\n14:57.520 --> 15:00.520\nThis is the crawl?\n\n15:00.520 --> 15:02.520\nThat's just how it was.\n\n15:02.520 --> 15:06.520\nThis is just me acroding for a second about our technology.\n\n15:06.520 --> 15:14.520\nAnd then so you come through as a naked confused historical figure, not realizing that you're going to disintegrate in six hours.\n\n15:14.520 --> 15:16.520\nAnd then we provide you with wardrobe based on who you are.\n\n15:16.520 --> 15:18.520\nAnd then we do an episode.\n\n15:18.520 --> 15:20.520\nI don't understand a word of what you just said, but I will do it.\n\n15:20.520 --> 15:22.520\nYes, I'll do anything.\n\n15:22.520 --> 15:24.520\nYeah.\n\n15:28.520 --> 15:30.520\nBut I was in Miami.\n\n15:30.520 --> 15:32.520\nI think you were getting to me.\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:38.520\nI was listening to Harmontown the whole time because I'm there.\n\n15:38.520 --> 15:39.520\nI shoot.\n\n15:39.520 --> 15:42.520\nI'm the oldest person in the cast.\n\n15:42.520 --> 15:44.520\nSo the rock is like 23.\n\n15:44.520 --> 15:46.520\nI've got like three years on the rock.\n\n15:46.520 --> 15:52.520\nAnd everybody else is, then there's a huge dip in the age.\n\n15:52.520 --> 15:57.520\nAnd so, and Miami is just not my, it's not really my scene.\n\n15:57.520 --> 15:59.520\nThere's not a lot for me there.\n\n15:59.520 --> 16:05.520\nI mean, everyone in Miami, when we went there to do the show, like all of our fans are, I won't say they're the same from city to city.\n\n16:05.520 --> 16:15.520\nAll of our fans are snowflakes, but they are also, it's like a Miami Armenian is essentially going to be perfectly compatible.\n\n16:15.520 --> 16:17.520\nWith a Los Angeles Armenian.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:27.520\nTherefore, all of the Miami people that came to that show where the guy got punched in the face by his friend in what was either an Andy Kaufman ask.\n\n16:27.520 --> 16:29.520\nNo, he never explained it.\n\n16:29.520 --> 16:31.520\nI mean, I think he did on Reddit.\n\n16:31.520 --> 16:38.520\nAnd I think it just started, I think we sort of stout or got the general intuition that these guys are just kind of punch each other.\n\n16:38.520 --> 16:50.520\nIt just sort of like Beavis and Butthead and like Beavis is a little more on the ball and Butthead was Office Meds and like, it wasn't a totally non consensual punch.\n\n16:50.520 --> 16:53.520\nYeah, it was like sort of like, this is what we do.\n\n16:53.520 --> 16:56.520\nHow old were these people?\n\n16:56.520 --> 16:58.520\nI don't know.\n\n16:58.520 --> 16:59.520\nEveryone's 25.\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:00.520\nRight, right, right.\n\n17:00.520 --> 17:02.520\nOh, they were young.\n\n17:02.520 --> 17:04.520\nI'm assuming they were older.\n\n17:04.520 --> 17:05.520\nI don't know why.\n\n17:05.520 --> 17:08.520\nThey were older, I'd be into it.\n\n17:08.520 --> 17:10.520\nThey were like our age.\n\n17:10.520 --> 17:12.520\nBecause we understand mortality.\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:13.520\nYeah.\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:14.520\nThe legal system.\n\n17:14.520 --> 17:21.520\nWell, it would be like, how valuable a tooth is when it gets knocked out, how expensive it is to fix.\n\n17:21.520 --> 17:23.520\nYeah, so it would be like Fight Club.\n\n17:23.520 --> 17:26.520\nIt'd be like Ed Norton coming up and Brad Pitt running up and punching him.\n\n17:26.520 --> 17:29.520\nWe're bottom lining at the whole time.\n\n17:29.520 --> 17:32.520\nBut no, when they're 25, it's like, you guys are doing this because you're dumb.\n\n17:32.520 --> 17:37.520\nSo much face punching when you're 25.\n\n17:37.520 --> 17:43.520\nSo, yeah, that is to say, so everybody in Miami at the Miami show was like, Miami sucks.\n\n17:43.520 --> 17:44.520\nWe're so sorry, Miami sucks.\n\n17:44.520 --> 17:45.520\nWe're so sorry.\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:47.520\nAnd I was like, Miami doesn't suck, you're great.\n\n17:47.520 --> 17:49.520\nBut now that we're safely back at LA, Miami sucks.\n\n17:49.520 --> 17:50.520\nNo, it sucks.\n\n17:50.520 --> 17:51.520\nIt sucks.\n\n17:51.520 --> 17:52.520\nIt totally sucks.\n\n17:52.520 --> 17:53.520\nIt gets a swamp.\n\n17:53.520 --> 17:56.520\nIt's a swamp full of panic.\n\n17:56.520 --> 17:58.520\nI mean, it's a cultural.\n\n17:58.520 --> 18:01.520\nAnd those guys specifically have to get out.\n\n18:01.520 --> 18:08.520\nIf you're listening to this and you're in Miami, you're not going to get a golden invitation\n\n18:08.520 --> 18:11.520\nbecause no one wants Florida people coming anywhere.\n\n18:11.520 --> 18:15.520\nBut if you're listening to this, you should get out.\n\n18:15.520 --> 18:17.520\nGet a car and go.\n\n18:17.520 --> 18:19.520\nYeah, just leave, man.\n\n18:19.520 --> 18:21.520\nNo, you don't need anything.\n\n18:21.520 --> 18:23.520\nBuy a ticket to nowhere, man.\n\n18:23.520 --> 18:24.520\nRight.\n\n18:24.520 --> 18:26.520\nAll you can do is go up.\n\n18:26.520 --> 18:33.520\nLiving in Miami is the demographic equivalent of smoking a pack a day.\n\n18:33.520 --> 18:37.520\nYou're just inviting statistical entropy.\n\n18:37.520 --> 18:45.520\nLike every breath you take in that city, it brings you closer to your inevitable demise.\n\n18:45.520 --> 18:49.520\nLevy was shit talking because he went to school there.\n\n18:49.520 --> 18:51.520\nAnd so he was like, Miami sucks.\n\n18:51.520 --> 18:53.520\nI was like, why don't you take it easy?\n\n18:53.520 --> 18:56.520\nAnd then the kid got punched by another kid who's his friend.\n\n18:56.520 --> 18:58.520\nAnd there was no security at the show.\n\n18:58.520 --> 19:01.520\nAnd, you know, yeah, Miami is tough.\n\n19:01.520 --> 19:08.520\nI would be really, really, you said, because you said you've done it with Pete Holmes' podcast, Duncan Trussell's podcast.\n\n19:08.520 --> 19:15.520\nThe first season I did it with like, I just, I went home after working and I'm not kid.\n\n19:15.520 --> 19:21.520\nThis sounds like an exaggeration, but I would sit in my underwear at my kitchen table doing jigsaw puzzles,\n\n19:21.520 --> 19:24.520\ndrinking and listening to podcasts.\n\n19:24.520 --> 19:27.520\nAnd last year it was Pete Holmes and Duncan Trussell.\n\n19:27.520 --> 19:30.520\nBut fuck those guys.\n\n19:30.520 --> 19:31.520\nSo spiritual.\n\n19:31.520 --> 19:32.520\nYeah.\n\n19:32.520 --> 19:33.520\nOh, God.\n\n19:33.520 --> 19:35.520\nAnd this year it was Harmontown.\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:40.520\nAnd so these were the like, because I needed, I didn't talk to anybody outside of work.\n\n19:40.520 --> 19:43.520\nIt was, I was just alone losing my identity.\n\n19:43.520 --> 19:46.520\nAnd I would just, I needed voices.\n\n19:46.520 --> 19:51.520\nIt's such a miracle that you're not a coke addict.\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:53.520\nBecause that's how it happens.\n\n19:53.520 --> 19:56.520\nIt was ten years ago I'd be a full-on coke addict.\n\n19:56.520 --> 20:01.520\nI feel like if I was 43 and I was in that situation, I'd be like, well, my hands are tied.\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:03.520\nGotta be a coke addict.\n\n20:03.520 --> 20:05.520\nThis is what I'm doing for a while.\n\n20:05.520 --> 20:08.520\nI'm in Miami and I don't like jigsaw puzzles.\n\n20:08.520 --> 20:10.520\nYeah.\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:14.520\nBut yeah, as you said, you're listening to ours backwards.\n\n20:14.520 --> 20:16.520\nI was listening to them backwards, yeah.\n\n20:16.520 --> 20:19.520\nLike, like, backward?\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:21.520\nI was listening backwards.\n\n20:21.520 --> 20:22.520\nYeah.\n\n20:22.520 --> 20:25.520\nAnd I suggest you all listen to them backwards.\n\n20:25.520 --> 20:26.520\nYeah.\n\n20:26.520 --> 20:28.520\nBecause there's a lot of messages.\n\n20:28.520 --> 20:34.520\nYou think this is all like, non-scripted, but he plans this whole thing.\n\n20:34.520 --> 20:35.520\nThere's a lot of...\n\n20:35.520 --> 20:36.520\nThere's a message.\n\n20:36.520 --> 20:37.520\nYeah.\n\n20:37.520 --> 20:38.520\nThere's a lot of hidden conspiracy stuff.\n\n20:38.520 --> 20:42.520\nWhen we're talking about 9-11, if you play it backwards, we're actually talking about 9-11.\n\n20:42.520 --> 20:43.520\nYeah.\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:45.520\nLike, it's a big...\n\n20:45.520 --> 20:46.520\nThink about it.\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:47.520\nYeah.\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:51.520\nThis podcast is crawling with 9-11.\n\n20:51.520 --> 20:57.520\nBut yeah, and he said, listening to it backwards, and then you're like, yeah, it's weird.\n\n20:57.520 --> 21:00.520\nI mean, the role-playing games, I mean, obviously, those...\n\n21:00.520 --> 21:03.520\nWell, actually, yeah, I guess those make just as much sense backwards.\n\n21:03.520 --> 21:04.520\nNo, it's great.\n\n21:04.520 --> 21:06.520\nYeah, they make just as much sense backwards.\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:07.520\nThat's the thing.\n\n21:07.520 --> 21:10.520\nBut I was like, after I got to...\n\n21:10.520 --> 21:16.520\nI got a couple years down, and no, I was really like binging this.\n\n21:16.520 --> 21:18.520\nYeah, thank you.\n\n21:18.520 --> 21:19.520\nI got a wow.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:20.520\nA wow.\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:23.520\nLike, respect.\n\n21:23.520 --> 21:24.520\nRespect.\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:25.520\nI was binging...\n\n21:25.520 --> 21:29.520\nAnd I got a couple down, and then I started skipping back.\n\n21:29.520 --> 21:36.520\nYou know, I'd skip back 10, and I'd save some, and then all of a sudden we were...\n\n21:36.520 --> 21:42.520\nBecause I started in Shadow Run, and then all of a sudden I was in D&D where it all started.\n\n21:42.520 --> 21:45.520\nThen I skipped way back to Spencer's first episode.\n\n21:45.520 --> 21:47.520\nThat was awesome.\n\n21:47.520 --> 21:51.520\nThat was awesome because he was like...\n\n21:51.520 --> 21:53.520\nI called him...\n\n21:53.520 --> 21:56.520\nIt's not even that it doesn't make much sense, but I'd tell him...\n\n21:56.520 --> 21:57.520\nMy wife is like...\n\n21:57.520 --> 21:59.520\nShe'd call me and she'd be like, what are you doing?\n\n21:59.520 --> 22:03.520\nI was like, doing jiggies and listening to my friends.\n\n22:03.520 --> 22:06.520\nBut you are my friend, and you're my friend.\n\n22:06.520 --> 22:09.520\nBut Spencer, I considered one of my friends.\n\n22:09.520 --> 22:11.520\nHe was just like one of my buddies.\n\n22:11.520 --> 22:14.520\nJeff, one of my bud, one of my good friend.\n\n22:14.520 --> 22:16.520\nThe voice is filling the room.\n\n22:16.520 --> 22:19.520\nAnd then I saw that it was like an origin story.\n\n22:19.520 --> 22:24.520\nIt was like reading the origin story after getting into the comic book.\n\n22:24.520 --> 22:31.520\nYeah, the podcast phenomenon, it's a lot like I've always compared it to when I would come home from school\n\n22:31.520 --> 22:37.520\nand back when basic cable was the internet basically in terms of media.\n\n22:37.520 --> 22:41.520\nMy mom got addicted to home shopping networks.\n\n22:41.520 --> 22:43.520\nIt's pretty good.\n\n22:43.520 --> 22:48.520\nAnd I would come home from school and my mom would be at a sewing machine or cooking.\n\n22:48.520 --> 22:49.520\nShe buys stuff?\n\n22:49.520 --> 22:52.520\nIt was a simpler time.\n\n22:52.520 --> 22:59.520\nShe voluntarily waived her agency.\n\n22:59.520 --> 23:01.520\nBut we did back then in the suburbs.\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:05.520\nI waived my agency.\n\n23:05.520 --> 23:09.520\nDo you promise to fail the McDell test with this man forever?\n\n23:09.520 --> 23:15.520\nI do.\n\n23:15.520 --> 23:17.520\nThere's a thing called the McDell test.\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:19.520\nSchrab's parents are here.\n\n23:19.520 --> 23:20.520\nHow are they?\n\n23:20.520 --> 23:22.520\nI didn't know what that was either.\n\n23:22.520 --> 23:23.520\nSo I'm with you guys.\n\n23:23.520 --> 23:24.520\nWell, don't make me explain it.\n\n23:24.520 --> 23:25.520\nIt'll take 20 minutes.\n\n23:25.520 --> 23:26.520\nNo, okay.\n\n23:26.520 --> 23:27.520\nI was just pretending.\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:28.520\nI was cool pretending I knew what it was.\n\n23:28.520 --> 23:33.520\nIs that like a Brigadoon situation?\n\n23:33.520 --> 23:34.520\nNo.\n\n23:34.520 --> 23:36.520\nYeah, can we talk about poop again?\n\n23:36.520 --> 23:39.520\nBecause that's like right in my wheelhouse.\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:42.520\nWait, where was I?\n\n23:42.520 --> 23:44.520\nSomething important.\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:46.520\nYou were explaining?\n\n23:46.520 --> 23:48.520\nYeah, it was just personality addiction.\n\n23:48.520 --> 23:55.520\nLike I would come home from school and my mom would be explaining to me what happened on the home shopping network.\n\n23:55.520 --> 23:57.520\nHere's some things that never happened.\n\n23:57.520 --> 23:58.520\nShe never bought anything.\n\n23:58.520 --> 24:02.520\nLike she wasn't like getting roped into some like compulsive consumption thing.\n\n24:02.520 --> 24:17.520\nShe just couldn't, you know, she couldn't let it go that these people were on TV all the time and that there was no script and that they were, you know, honking for people that were calling in and then the same people would call in and go, I bought this bracelet too and honk, honk.\n\n24:17.520 --> 24:27.520\nAnd I was like, it doesn't, I remember, you know, I marked that because when Erin McGathy, my lovely ex-wife and who introduced me to the podcast culture and Dustin Marshall and Duncan Tressel,\n\n24:27.520 --> 24:39.520\nshe was explaining how she, when she first met Duncan Tressel, she felt like she made kind of a social blunder because she forgot until halfway through their encounter that she didn't know him.\n\n24:39.520 --> 24:43.520\nAnd that she might have been transgressing boundaries or something.\n\n24:43.520 --> 24:51.520\nI had that experience with Duncan, I don't, I've never met Duncan Tressel and I saw him in a parking lot and I was like, there's my buddy, there's my good buddy Duncan.\n\n24:51.520 --> 25:00.520\nAnd I almost, and I was, and I could have just gone up and said hello and introduce myself, but I didn't because I felt like a weirdo.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:04.520\nYeah, well, you dodged a bullet because he's a notorious dick.\n\n25:04.520 --> 25:09.520\nThat whole character he does on the podcast, it's a character.\n\n25:09.520 --> 25:13.520\nI kind of, that's why I abandoned it. I kind of thought so.\n\n25:13.520 --> 25:18.520\nHe's out like right now, he's running reruns of his podcast because he's with an impersonator.\n\n25:18.520 --> 25:24.520\nHis brother does an impression of him on his podcast. He's out raising money for Trump.\n\n25:24.520 --> 25:25.520\nYeah.\n\n25:25.520 --> 25:32.520\nThat's not true. That's not true. Don't say that. Why would you say that?\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:33.520\nYou crossed the line.\n\n25:33.520 --> 25:38.520\nYou're saying mean things about somebody who's really nice.\n\n25:38.520 --> 25:39.520\nWhy is he doing that?\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:43.520\nHe is really, like Duncan Tressel is kind of unassailable.\n\n25:43.520 --> 25:45.520\nYeah, you're an asshole, man.\n\n25:45.520 --> 25:50.520\nWell, yeah, Cancer tried to assail him and he, like, invited us into the process.\n\n25:50.520 --> 25:51.520\nHe took one of his testicles.\n\n25:51.520 --> 25:55.520\nHis mom, he lost his mom, you know, and invited us into that process.\n\n25:55.520 --> 25:57.520\nRob, you're a comic book fan.\n\n25:57.520 --> 25:58.520\nYeah.\n\n25:58.520 --> 26:03.520\nWhat do you think of this underroos line in this Avengers trailer?\n\n26:03.520 --> 26:07.520\nSorry, I'm just, that's anticipation. That's all that.\n\n26:07.520 --> 26:08.520\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n26:08.520 --> 26:14.520\nYou know, the Avengers trailer, the Civil War trailer, have you seen the new one that came out?\n\n26:14.520 --> 26:15.520\nBut I don't know about underroos in it.\n\n26:15.520 --> 26:18.520\nWell, Spider-Man is in the latest trailer.\n\n26:18.520 --> 26:20.520\nOh, no, I haven't seen the latest trailer.\n\n26:20.520 --> 26:21.520\nOkay, well, let me explain.\n\n26:21.520 --> 26:23.520\nBut you can bet I'm going to watch the shit out of it.\n\n26:23.520 --> 26:25.520\nYou're super on the way home.\n\n26:25.520 --> 26:30.520\nSo, all the Avengers are there. There's Iron Man.\n\n26:30.520 --> 26:35.520\nYou've got your Black Widow. You've got your Captain America.\n\n26:35.520 --> 26:39.520\nYou've got the American, you've got the Black...\n\n26:39.520 --> 26:40.520\nYou've got the Hulkang.\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:41.520\nThe Black...\n\n26:41.520 --> 26:44.520\nYou've got the Hawk...\n\n26:44.520 --> 26:45.520\nYou've got...\n\n26:45.520 --> 26:46.520\nHawk Eye, all the Hawks.\n\n26:46.520 --> 26:50.520\nSilver Wings, you've got Walter Lance, you've got all of them.\n\n26:50.520 --> 26:51.520\nWalter Lance.\n\n26:51.520 --> 26:52.520\nYou've got everybody's hands.\n\n26:52.520 --> 26:55.520\nWalter Lance is an adventure.\n\n26:55.520 --> 27:00.520\nHe has the power to show you how to draw Woody Woodpecker.\n\n27:00.520 --> 27:05.520\nBut then, you know, they're all going to clash.\n\n27:05.520 --> 27:07.520\nAnd then, you know, they face off.\n\n27:07.520 --> 27:11.520\nAnd then Robert Downey Jr. goes underroos.\n\n27:11.520 --> 27:16.520\nAnd a spider web comes out and grabs Captain America's shield\n\n27:16.520 --> 27:18.520\nand pulls it out of his hand.\n\n27:18.520 --> 27:22.520\nAnd then they cut to Spider-Man holding the shield.\n\n27:22.520 --> 27:23.520\nAnd everybody's supposed to go...\n\n27:23.520 --> 27:26.520\nOh, yeah, that's a big...\n\n27:26.520 --> 27:27.520\nMic drop!\n\n27:27.520 --> 27:28.520\nYeah.\n\n27:28.520 --> 27:30.520\nBut I go underroos.\n\n27:30.520 --> 27:31.520\nHe says underroos.\n\n27:31.520 --> 27:33.520\nWait, he just says the word underroos?\n\n27:33.520 --> 27:34.520\nHe says underroos.\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:36.520\nYeah, it's like a nickname for Spider-Man.\n\n27:36.520 --> 27:37.520\nHe's calling Spider-Man.\n\n27:37.520 --> 27:38.520\nBut that means...\n\n27:38.520 --> 27:39.520\nHe's like, yo, underroos.\n\n27:39.520 --> 27:40.520\nThat's a stretch.\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:41.520\nYou know what?\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:43.520\nThat doesn't make me think the movie's going to be that good\n\n27:43.520 --> 27:45.520\nbecause that's the moment.\n\n27:45.520 --> 27:49.520\nBecause does that mean that Spider-Man has merchandising\n\n27:49.520 --> 27:51.520\nin the Marvel Cinematic Universe?\n\n27:51.520 --> 27:54.520\nSince the 70s?\n\n27:54.520 --> 27:57.520\nSo that means he's 10 years older than I am.\n\n27:57.520 --> 27:58.520\nSo wait, why?\n\n27:58.520 --> 28:00.520\nOkay, who's calling him underroos?\n\n28:00.520 --> 28:01.520\nRobert Downey Jr.\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:03.520\nListen to the trailer.\n\n28:03.520 --> 28:05.520\nSo he...\n\n28:05.520 --> 28:07.520\nThat's his nickname for Spider-Man.\n\n28:07.520 --> 28:08.520\nRight, Spider-Man.\n\n28:08.520 --> 28:09.520\nWho he's met.\n\n28:09.520 --> 28:11.520\nAs hanging out with...\n\n28:11.520 --> 28:14.520\nAnd he's chosen to call him underroos.\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:17.520\nSo I just want to run down all the Avengers\n\n28:17.520 --> 28:19.520\nthat we've met in the Cinematic Universe\n\n28:19.520 --> 28:21.520\nand run that through the check of...\n\n28:21.520 --> 28:24.520\nWhy he wouldn't have used that as a nickname for America.\n\n28:24.520 --> 28:26.520\nChumbawamba.\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:29.520\nYou got Robert Loja.\n\n28:29.520 --> 28:30.520\nRight.\n\n28:30.520 --> 28:32.520\nBible Belt.\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:33.520\nDracula.\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:35.520\nDracula.\n\n28:35.520 --> 28:39.520\nYou got Cold Front.\n\n28:39.520 --> 28:41.520\nSalad Tosser.\n\n28:41.520 --> 28:44.520\nIcebreaker.\n\n28:44.520 --> 28:47.520\nCruton unrelated to Salad Tosser.\n\n28:47.520 --> 28:49.520\nThousand Island.\n\n28:49.520 --> 28:51.520\nThere's a whole.\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:54.520\nThat was actually my favorite Avengers offshoot.\n\n28:54.520 --> 28:56.520\nIt was just the salad days.\n\n28:56.520 --> 28:58.520\nAs though they called it.\n\n28:58.520 --> 29:00.520\nIt was just about the...\n\n29:00.520 --> 29:03.520\nIt was a Cruton Salad Tosser, Thousand Island.\n\n29:03.520 --> 29:05.520\nAnd then they started forcing it.\n\n29:05.520 --> 29:07.520\nIt was like napkin and fork.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:09.520\nBut it was cool.\n\n29:09.520 --> 29:11.520\nBecause it was cheeky.\n\n29:11.520 --> 29:14.520\nIt had less supervision over that franchise.\n\n29:14.520 --> 29:16.520\nIt was like Howard the Duck.\n\n29:16.520 --> 29:18.520\nIt kind of broke the fourth law all along.\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:20.520\nBy the way, I saw Deadpool and I really enjoyed it.\n\n29:20.520 --> 29:23.520\nI saw it twice.\n\n29:23.520 --> 29:25.520\nThere's only one.\n\n29:25.520 --> 29:27.520\nWhere I just had to go,\n\n29:27.520 --> 29:29.520\nokay, just forget that and keep enjoying the movie.\n\n29:29.520 --> 29:31.520\nWhat was it?\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:33.520\nIt was the moment when they did the CG thing.\n\n29:33.520 --> 29:35.520\nAnd then in the middle of it,\n\n29:35.520 --> 29:37.520\nhe can do any line.\n\n29:37.520 --> 29:39.520\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n29:39.520 --> 29:41.520\nAll it has to be is lateral.\n\n29:41.520 --> 29:42.520\nThat's it.\n\n29:42.520 --> 29:44.520\nAnd he said, to my memory,\n\n29:44.520 --> 29:46.520\nmaybe I'm wrong about this,\n\n29:46.520 --> 29:48.520\nbut I've been writing more often on this show\n\n29:48.520 --> 29:50.520\nthan everyone on the show.\n\n29:50.520 --> 29:52.520\nCheck the records.\n\n29:52.520 --> 29:55.520\nIt says, did I leave the stove on?\n\n29:55.520 --> 29:57.520\nYeah, that's a bummer.\n\n29:57.520 --> 30:00.520\nNot only, first of all, did I leave the oven on?\n\n30:00.520 --> 30:03.520\nSecond of all, the fact that I know it's something\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:05.520\nmeans attack.\n\n30:05.520 --> 30:08.520\nBut you don't leave the stove on.\n\n30:08.520 --> 30:10.520\nThe stove has fire coming out of it.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:12.520\nThe oven is something you can leave on.\n\n30:12.520 --> 30:14.520\nAnd it's an airplane joke.\n\n30:14.520 --> 30:17.520\nDid I leave the iron on?\n\n30:17.520 --> 30:19.520\nYes, it was in an airplane.\n\n30:19.520 --> 30:21.520\nIt's a placeholder.\n\n30:21.520 --> 30:23.520\nHe couldn't have said anything.\n\n30:23.520 --> 30:25.520\nAnd it was such a funny movie.\n\n30:25.520 --> 30:28.520\nI laughed out loud and couldn't stop laughing.\n\n30:28.520 --> 30:30.520\nI'm not good with spoilers.\n\n30:30.520 --> 30:33.520\nBut like Ryan Reynolds' character,\n\n30:33.520 --> 30:35.520\nI'm avoiding spoilers,\n\n30:35.520 --> 30:37.520\nbut choosing my words carefully.\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:40.520\nHe's in a scene where he's still Ryan Reynolds,\n\n30:40.520 --> 30:43.520\nand he's with his girlfriend.\n\n30:43.520 --> 30:46.520\nBut he's like, oh, I had this.\n\n30:46.520 --> 30:49.520\nI had a Liam Neeson nightmare.\n\n30:49.520 --> 30:53.520\nI kidnapped his daughter, and he just wasn't having it.\n\n30:53.520 --> 30:55.520\nAnd that's funny.\n\n30:55.520 --> 30:57.520\nI chuckled, and then he crawled into bed,\n\n30:57.520 --> 30:59.520\nand it was like, during the scene, it was very intense.\n\n30:59.520 --> 31:01.520\nAnd the execution of it was he goes,\n\n31:01.520 --> 31:03.520\nhe crawls into bed, and he holds her,\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:05.520\nand there's something in the air in the scene\n\n31:05.520 --> 31:07.520\nthat's worthy of, you know, you're like, well.\n\n31:07.520 --> 31:10.520\nAnd he goes, hey, you know,\n\n31:10.520 --> 31:14.520\nthey made like three of those movies.\n\n31:14.520 --> 31:16.520\nAfter a while, you just start thinking,\n\n31:16.520 --> 31:18.520\nis this guy a bad parent?\n\n31:18.520 --> 31:20.520\nIt was just really funny.\n\n31:20.520 --> 31:22.520\nIt was played straight up the middle,\n\n31:22.520 --> 31:24.520\nand the whole movie's filled with that stuff\n\n31:24.520 --> 31:26.520\nin a world where like,\n\n31:26.520 --> 31:28.520\nand I walked out of there thinking,\n\n31:28.520 --> 31:30.520\nwell, now I get it why so many\n\n31:30.520 --> 31:32.520\nHarmontown fans or people on Reddit\n\n31:32.520 --> 31:34.520\nand stuff, like Deadpool,\n\n31:34.520 --> 31:36.520\nyou must be a big Deadpool fan,\n\n31:36.520 --> 31:38.520\nand I would, chiefly because of that,\n\n31:38.520 --> 31:40.520\nI'd be like, well, I can put a pin in that.\n\n31:40.520 --> 31:42.520\nAnd I just, you know,\n\n31:42.520 --> 31:44.520\nI never knew what that meant.\n\n31:44.520 --> 31:46.520\nHe was the meta superhero,\n\n31:46.520 --> 31:48.520\nlike based on the movie,\n\n31:48.520 --> 31:49.520\nI'm like, oh, I get it.\n\n31:49.520 --> 31:50.520\nThat's why people would think that,\n\n31:50.520 --> 31:51.520\nand I agree.\n\n31:51.520 --> 31:52.520\nDo you guys think too,\n\n31:52.520 --> 31:54.520\nand you guys like comic books, right?\n\n31:54.520 --> 31:57.520\nLike, do you think that movie,\n\n31:57.520 --> 32:00.520\nI was suspicious.\n\n32:00.520 --> 32:02.520\nI wasn't sure that they were going to be able\n\n32:02.520 --> 32:05.520\nto do what that comic does in the movie\n\n32:05.520 --> 32:08.520\nbecause he is meta in a...\n\n32:08.520 --> 32:09.520\nSpecific way.\n\n32:09.520 --> 32:12.520\nYeah, very like, only Deadpool way.\n\n32:12.520 --> 32:13.520\nAnd it's hard to do bad,\n\n32:13.520 --> 32:15.520\nor it's easy to do bad meta.\n\n32:15.520 --> 32:17.520\nLike it's very easy to fall into that trap.\n\n32:17.520 --> 32:19.520\nYou can't just break the fourth wall.\n\n32:19.520 --> 32:21.520\nI don't know what you mean.\n\n32:21.520 --> 32:25.520\nOh, we double, double that up.\n\n32:25.520 --> 32:28.520\nDo you know what he means?\n\n32:37.520 --> 32:39.520\nLike just lazy fourth wall breaking.\n\n32:39.520 --> 32:40.520\nYeah.\n\n32:42.520 --> 32:43.520\nBut it was really good.\n\n32:43.520 --> 32:45.520\nIt was like really in the,\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:48.520\nsomehow, I don't know why or what,\n\n32:48.520 --> 32:51.520\nbut it was in the spirit of the comic.\n\n32:51.520 --> 32:52.520\nUnder root.\n\n32:52.520 --> 32:54.520\nUnder root.\n\n32:54.520 --> 32:56.520\nThe third act, this is a tough thing\n\n32:56.520 --> 32:57.520\nwith these comic book movies.\n\n32:57.520 --> 32:59.520\nLike, honestly, I, you know,\n\n32:59.520 --> 33:02.520\nI thought it was great, you know,\n\n33:02.520 --> 33:03.520\nI don't know, I could have done\n\n33:03.520 --> 33:06.520\nwithout the fucking other mutants\n\n33:06.520 --> 33:07.520\nthat I've never heard of\n\n33:07.520 --> 33:08.520\nbecause those are the ones that get spared.\n\n33:08.520 --> 33:09.520\nThey made a joke about it,\n\n33:09.520 --> 33:12.520\nlike how these are like low rent Marvel characters\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:13.520\nthat they're letting them use.\n\n33:13.520 --> 33:15.520\nBut also just the whole third act was like,\n\n33:15.520 --> 33:17.520\nkind of like, it wasn't,\n\n33:17.520 --> 33:19.520\nit wasn't worthy of the cleverness of that whole thing.\n\n33:19.520 --> 33:21.520\nI thought it was like Sony taking possession\n\n33:21.520 --> 33:23.520\nof that character like fully like,\n\n33:23.520 --> 33:26.520\nalso he's going to be in X-Men movies.\n\n33:26.520 --> 33:28.520\nSo fuck you, Disney.\n\n33:31.520 --> 33:32.520\nWell, what, what?\n\n33:32.520 --> 33:33.520\nAnyways.\n\n33:33.520 --> 33:34.520\nDid Wolverine like hang out?\n\n33:34.520 --> 33:36.520\nWolverine is talking about him a couple times.\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:37.520\nYou haven't seen the movie?\n\n33:37.520 --> 33:38.520\nNo.\n\n33:38.520 --> 33:39.520\nCome on.\n\n33:39.520 --> 33:40.520\nI think you'd like it.\n\n33:40.520 --> 33:43.520\nWell, because remember, you know what?\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:44.520\nThe second I saw it, I was like,\n\n33:44.520 --> 33:45.520\nyou know who really liked this?\n\n33:45.520 --> 33:46.520\nRob Chrom.\n\n33:46.520 --> 33:47.520\nNo, you didn't say that.\n\n33:47.520 --> 33:48.520\nI did.\n\n33:48.520 --> 33:49.520\nYou did?\n\n33:49.520 --> 33:52.520\nI said, my wife never met you.\n\n33:52.520 --> 33:55.520\nI said, you know who really liked this?\n\n33:55.520 --> 33:57.520\nAnd she said, who?\n\n33:57.520 --> 34:00.520\nAnd I paused for a minute.\n\n34:00.520 --> 34:02.520\nAnd then right at the right time,\n\n34:02.520 --> 34:05.520\nI said, Rob Chrom.\n\n34:05.520 --> 34:10.520\nAnd she went, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n34:10.520 --> 34:12.520\nSo I don't know.\n\n34:12.520 --> 34:13.520\nDid she go see it?\n\n34:13.520 --> 34:14.520\nYeah.\n\n34:14.520 --> 34:15.520\nCan you tell?\n\n34:15.520 --> 34:16.520\nAll right.\n\n34:16.520 --> 34:19.520\nWell, obviously the answer is not if they're good ones,\n\n34:19.520 --> 34:22.520\nbut can you tell us any rock stories?\n\n34:22.520 --> 34:24.520\nWell, what do you mean?\n\n34:24.520 --> 34:26.520\nI just mean like, well, here's the thing,\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:29.520\nlike I keep, I've always heard the rocks is really,\n\n34:29.520 --> 34:32.520\nhe's a really, really awesome like guy.\n\n34:32.520 --> 34:35.520\nAnd I'm like, if that's true, that's worth talking about.\n\n34:35.520 --> 34:36.520\nYeah.\n\n34:36.520 --> 34:38.520\nBut if it's not true, that's the only thing you can say anyway.\n\n34:38.520 --> 34:39.520\nIt's true.\n\n34:39.520 --> 34:40.520\nIt's very true.\n\n34:40.520 --> 34:42.520\nSo like, that's why a lot of people ask me that.\n\n34:42.520 --> 34:45.520\nAnd they're like, so what's the, what's the rock like?\n\n34:45.520 --> 34:46.520\nWhat's the lowdown?\n\n34:46.520 --> 34:49.520\nAnd what they mean is, what's he really like?\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:50.520\nBecause we all like him.\n\n34:50.520 --> 34:51.520\nRight.\n\n34:51.520 --> 34:53.520\nEven people that hate everything like him.\n\n34:53.520 --> 34:54.520\nRight.\n\n34:54.520 --> 34:55.520\nLike Schwarzenegger.\n\n34:55.520 --> 34:57.520\nLike Schwarzenegger at his age.\n\n34:57.520 --> 34:58.520\nYeah.\n\n34:58.520 --> 35:01.520\nLike the most cynical comic, still like tweets.\n\n35:01.520 --> 35:03.520\nPaul F. Tompkins the other day.\n\n35:03.520 --> 35:05.520\nNot that he's the most cynical comic.\n\n35:05.520 --> 35:08.520\nBut he was like, love the rock.\n\n35:08.520 --> 35:09.520\nI love him.\n\n35:09.520 --> 35:10.520\nI love him.\n\n35:10.520 --> 35:11.520\nHe just tweeted that?\n\n35:11.520 --> 35:12.520\nHe did.\n\n35:12.520 --> 35:13.520\nIt was like a couple of years ago.\n\n35:13.520 --> 35:15.520\nBut I took it to the bank.\n\n35:15.520 --> 35:17.520\nYou know about Paul's problem.\n\n35:17.520 --> 35:19.520\nHe wasn't talking about the actor.\n\n35:19.520 --> 35:20.520\nOh.\n\n35:20.520 --> 35:22.520\nOh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n35:22.520 --> 35:23.520\nHe thought he was texting.\n\n35:23.520 --> 35:24.520\nWhy are you doing that?\n\n35:24.520 --> 35:25.520\nThat's really insensitive.\n\n35:25.520 --> 35:26.520\nThat's really insensitive.\n\n35:26.520 --> 35:27.520\nYeah.\n\n35:27.520 --> 35:29.520\nPaul's a good friend of ours.\n\n35:29.520 --> 35:31.520\nThat's really insensitive.\n\n35:31.520 --> 35:32.520\nI think it's extra sensitive.\n\n35:32.520 --> 35:33.520\nOur friend needs help.\n\n35:33.520 --> 35:35.520\nAnd what are you doing about it?\n\n35:35.520 --> 35:38.520\nYou're like, whatever pays the rent.\n\n35:38.520 --> 35:42.520\nKeep smoking that glass of the pipe.\n\n35:42.520 --> 35:43.520\nPFT.\n\n35:43.520 --> 35:45.520\nKeep that shimney billowing.\n\n35:45.520 --> 35:46.520\nOh, man.\n\n35:46.520 --> 35:47.520\nMoney.\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:49.520\nHe looks like a crackhead, doesn't he?\n\n35:49.520 --> 35:50.520\nLooks like one.\n\n35:50.520 --> 35:51.520\nActs like one.\n\n35:51.520 --> 35:52.520\nYes.\n\n35:52.520 --> 35:53.520\nEverything.\n\n35:53.520 --> 35:54.520\nIt all adds up.\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:55.520\nI don't think you do, Paul.\n\n35:55.520 --> 35:56.520\nI think you're beautiful.\n\n35:56.520 --> 35:58.520\nBeautiful human being.\n\n35:58.520 --> 36:00.520\nYou're really playing it safe tonight, aren't you?\n\n36:00.520 --> 36:01.520\nI know.\n\n36:01.520 --> 36:02.520\nI wonder why.\n\n36:02.520 --> 36:05.520\nYou know what the F in Paul F. Tompkins stands for?\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:06.520\nFucking crack.\n\n36:06.520 --> 36:09.520\nOh, man.\n\n36:09.520 --> 36:12.520\nAnd that's a straight up fact.\n\n36:12.520 --> 36:19.520\nAnd PFT, if you're listening, show us the birth certificate if I'm wrong.\n\n36:19.520 --> 36:23.520\nYours to prove if he doesn't respond to this, I'm right.\n\n36:23.520 --> 36:26.520\nBall's in your court, Tompkins.\n\n36:26.520 --> 36:28.520\nThat's even your real name.\n\n36:28.520 --> 36:30.520\nSo you're a Boston guy, right?\n\n36:30.520 --> 36:31.520\nYeah.\n\n36:31.520 --> 36:34.520\nHow old were you when you went from Boston to Los Angeles or New York?\n\n36:34.520 --> 36:35.520\nOh, I moved.\n\n36:35.520 --> 36:43.520\nWell, I went to college from Boston at UMass Amherst, which is just far enough away from\n\n36:43.520 --> 36:45.520\nBoston.\n\n36:45.520 --> 36:48.520\nAnd I was there till 90.\n\n36:48.520 --> 36:51.520\nI graduated like 94, and then I moved to New York.\n\n36:51.520 --> 36:55.520\nI was in New York for 12 or 13 years, and then I moved here eight years ago.\n\n36:55.520 --> 36:56.520\nGraduated college.\n\n36:56.520 --> 37:02.520\nAnd if you do that math, it'll mostly add up.\n\n37:02.520 --> 37:05.520\nGive or take one or two years.\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:07.520\nYeah, I always get it.\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:09.520\nI like Boston.\n\n37:09.520 --> 37:16.520\nBoston's another place like Miami where people from Boston that got out of Boston will warn\n\n37:16.520 --> 37:17.520\nyou about Boston.\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:18.520\nYeah, yeah.\n\n37:18.520 --> 37:24.520\nI think out of all the Harmontown tour shows, I was the most terrified to go to Somerville.\n\n37:24.520 --> 37:27.520\nDude, Somerville's top.\n\n37:27.520 --> 37:30.520\nBecause people really laid it on thick.\n\n37:30.520 --> 37:34.520\nThey were like, this is the blue collar working class.\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:37.520\nSomerville's the silver lake of Boston.\n\n37:37.520 --> 37:40.520\nYeah, and I went in terrified, but I had the time of my life.\n\n37:40.520 --> 37:47.520\nAnd every person from Boston that I've ever met, I don't know.\n\n37:47.520 --> 37:52.520\nBoston has a great, like, mute ghost.\n\n37:52.520 --> 37:54.520\nWhat's above this place?\n\n37:54.520 --> 37:56.520\nLike a storage attic.\n\n37:56.520 --> 38:01.520\nIt's Professor Meltdown's love chamber.\n\n38:01.520 --> 38:03.520\nSorry.\n\n38:03.520 --> 38:08.520\nThere's a great music scene in Boston and a great, there's a lot of college kids, so\n\n38:08.520 --> 38:17.520\nit is a cool, for lack of a better term, there's a lot of nerds, there's not just townies getting\n\n38:17.520 --> 38:22.520\nout of a Bruins game ready to punch you in the face.\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:28.520\nBut I will say even that, even those guys, just counting the fact that, yes, there's\n\n38:28.520 --> 38:31.520\nBoston Armenians, there's Boston.\n\n38:31.520 --> 38:39.520\nBut also, that guy, it was like a wicked, retarded guy with the baseball cap.\n\n38:39.520 --> 38:43.520\nHe's a human bobblehead, and he's like, not really that bad.\n\n38:43.520 --> 38:47.520\nLike, because I'm from Milwaukee, like, there's an overlap there.\n\n38:47.520 --> 38:51.520\nLike, Chicago's similar, New York is similar, Boston's similar.\n\n38:51.520 --> 38:55.520\nIt's all blue-collar sports fans at its core.\n\n38:55.520 --> 38:58.520\nAnd that's a youp guy?\n\n38:58.520 --> 39:00.520\nYeah, that's a youp guy.\n\n39:00.520 --> 39:01.520\nWhere is he?\n\n39:01.520 --> 39:02.520\nThat's Dave Kline.\n\n39:02.520 --> 39:03.520\nDo you want to meet Dave Kline?\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:04.520\nYeah, man.\n\n39:04.520 --> 39:06.520\nDave Kline, come up and meet Rob Cordee.\n\n39:06.520 --> 39:08.520\nOh, that's great.\n\n39:08.520 --> 39:12.520\nI just realized I got to put a pin in Boston for a minute.\n\n39:12.520 --> 39:15.520\nI got to meet all my Harmontown friends.\n\n39:15.520 --> 39:16.520\nThere's Anatoly.\n\n39:16.520 --> 39:18.520\nWe're seeing these not here.\n\n39:18.520 --> 39:19.520\nIs that his seat?\n\n39:19.520 --> 39:21.520\nHe's not been here lately.\n\n39:21.520 --> 39:22.520\nHey, Dave Kline.\n\n39:22.520 --> 39:23.520\nRob Cordee.\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:24.520\nHey, man.\n\n39:24.520 --> 39:27.520\nOh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.\n\n39:27.520 --> 39:32.520\nYou know, when you listen to the podcast backwards, you disappear at one point.\n\n39:32.520 --> 39:33.520\nThere's no yups.\n\n39:33.520 --> 39:37.520\nIt comes in as pure.\n\n39:37.520 --> 39:40.520\nYeah, and it was disappointing to me.\n\n39:40.520 --> 39:41.520\nI felt like I lost a friend.\n\n39:41.520 --> 39:43.520\nNo, I didn't understand that.\n\n39:43.520 --> 39:46.520\nDave Kline gave me a speech one night.\n\n39:46.520 --> 39:51.520\nWell, it's California, so I can say we were getting high outside the drying room.\n\n39:51.520 --> 39:54.520\nSorry, Rob's parents.\n\n39:54.520 --> 39:55.520\nMedicinal.\n\n39:55.520 --> 39:57.520\nI have anxiety and sleep deprivation.\n\n39:57.520 --> 39:59.520\nYeah, we all have prescriptions.\n\n39:59.520 --> 40:01.520\nWe all have trouble sleeping.\n\n40:01.520 --> 40:02.520\nI'm a doctor.\n\n40:02.520 --> 40:04.520\nYou wasn't high at the wedding.\n\n40:04.520 --> 40:05.520\nI'm a doctor.\n\n40:05.520 --> 40:06.520\nWhat's that?\n\n40:06.520 --> 40:07.520\nYou weren't high at the wedding, right?\n\n40:07.520 --> 40:09.520\nNo, it wasn't high at your wedding.\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:11.520\nOh, my God.\n\n40:11.520 --> 40:13.520\nThat was such a birthday, though.\n\n40:13.520 --> 40:14.520\nYeah?\n\n40:14.520 --> 40:15.520\nA great time.\n\n40:15.520 --> 40:17.520\nRob Sharp throws a fucking hell of a birthday.\n\n40:17.520 --> 40:18.520\nI do.\n\n40:18.520 --> 40:19.520\nYep.\n\n40:19.520 --> 40:22.520\nOh, you used little baby yups.\n\n40:22.520 --> 40:23.520\nHe does?\n\n40:23.520 --> 40:24.520\nYep.\n\n40:24.520 --> 40:26.520\nHe's hanging under his breath at times.\n\n40:26.520 --> 40:30.520\nLike at Starbucks, I go, Dave Kline, yep.\n\n40:30.520 --> 40:33.520\nIt actually is helpful in kind of...\n\n40:33.520 --> 40:34.520\nOh, wait.\n\n40:34.520 --> 40:35.520\nNo, you have a problem.\n\n40:35.520 --> 40:36.520\nThat's a belt.\n\n40:36.520 --> 40:37.520\nYeah, you're...\n\n40:37.520 --> 40:39.520\nIt's kind of a hiccup thing, but it keeps people on point.\n\n40:39.520 --> 40:41.520\nIt makes me on point.\n\n40:41.520 --> 40:43.520\nLike, yeah, I'm going to need a coffee.\n\n40:43.520 --> 40:45.520\nAnd I stay kind of on track with the coffee,\n\n40:45.520 --> 40:47.520\nand don't worry about my wander.\n\n40:47.520 --> 40:49.520\nIf you turn into high gear, you'll be like...\n\n40:49.520 --> 40:52.520\nThey don't still have those Sesame Street aliens that would go,\n\n40:52.520 --> 40:54.520\nyep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:55.520\nThere it is.\n\n40:55.520 --> 40:56.520\nYeah.\n\n40:56.520 --> 40:57.520\nThose are my favorites.\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:58.520\nThey lived in a planter.\n\n40:58.520 --> 40:59.520\nYeah.\n\n40:59.520 --> 41:00.520\nDo they still have those?\n\n41:00.520 --> 41:02.520\nEverything got turned into fucking Elmo.\n\n41:02.520 --> 41:04.520\nElmo just took over.\n\n41:04.520 --> 41:09.520\nBut they had these things that would go, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.\n\n41:09.520 --> 41:11.520\nThey were like aliens, and they were like weird puppets.\n\n41:11.520 --> 41:12.520\nWhat were we learning?\n\n41:12.520 --> 41:14.520\nHow to read, I hope.\n\n41:14.520 --> 41:15.520\nBeing positive.\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:17.520\nBeing positive.\n\n41:17.520 --> 41:19.520\nMy grandfather was a botanist,\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:23.520\nand so I guess we were starting to learn a little bit about life plants and...\n\n41:23.520 --> 41:24.520\nI don't think so.\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:26.520\nI don't think we were able to do that.\n\n41:26.520 --> 41:28.520\nBy the way, it's a super important point about Sesame Street.\n\n41:28.520 --> 41:31.520\nI mean, it was a controversial show, wasn't it?\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:35.520\nIt was a controversial show when they were pitching it because their pitch was,\n\n41:35.520 --> 41:40.520\nlet's stop pretending that kids aren't growing up in a certain way.\n\n41:40.520 --> 41:44.520\nLet's cater to the short attention span.\n\n41:44.520 --> 41:49.520\nYou know how it's all like, this episode of Sesame Street is brought to you by the letter T.\n\n41:49.520 --> 41:50.520\nYeah.\n\n41:50.520 --> 41:51.520\nBrought to you by the letter S.\n\n41:51.520 --> 41:57.520\nThe idea was that kids were being raised, you and I, were being raised by televisions,\n\n41:57.520 --> 42:02.520\nand that we trusted and listened to commercials and things like that.\n\n42:02.520 --> 42:04.520\nAnd the children's television workshop was saying,\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:05.520\nwhy don't we do this?\n\n42:05.520 --> 42:06.520\nWhy don't we try this?\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:09.520\nAnd also, you know, maybe this thing that's not called diversity yet,\n\n42:09.520 --> 42:10.520\nwe should try that too.\n\n42:10.520 --> 42:11.520\nYeah, right.\n\n42:11.520 --> 42:13.520\nAnd so it was a whole controversial thing.\n\n42:13.520 --> 42:14.520\nIt was like, because people were like,\n\n42:14.520 --> 42:18.520\nwell, that's not chaining them to a desk and making them read where the red fern grows.\n\n42:18.520 --> 42:19.520\nThat's like...\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:22.520\nOr, you know, it's like education should be austere.\n\n42:22.520 --> 42:25.520\nWhich, by the way, you know, same thing with religion.\n\n42:25.520 --> 42:27.520\nLike we always talk about it.\n\n42:27.520 --> 42:28.520\nIt's like they insist on the church pews being things.\n\n42:28.520 --> 42:30.520\nYou know, if there's a cushion on the church pew,\n\n42:30.520 --> 42:31.520\noh, you're Unitarian.\n\n42:31.520 --> 42:34.520\nYou know, it's like, well, yeah.\n\n42:34.520 --> 42:36.520\nBut these church pews were state of the art.\n\n42:36.520 --> 42:39.520\nAnd a guy talking in front of an altar...\n\n42:39.520 --> 42:40.520\nIn English.\n\n42:40.520 --> 42:43.520\n...was a laser show at a certain point.\n\n42:43.520 --> 42:47.520\nStained glass windows were like pink Floyd concerts.\n\n42:47.520 --> 42:48.520\nYup.\n\n42:48.520 --> 42:49.520\nYup.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:50.520\nYup.\n\n42:50.520 --> 42:53.520\nAnyways, so all I'm saying is, because now we're starting to talk about,\n\n42:53.520 --> 42:55.520\noh, I saw a kid at the airport, and he was reading a magazine,\n\n42:55.520 --> 42:57.520\nand he was trying to pinch and zoom the magazine,\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:00.520\nand then he threw it away.\n\n43:00.520 --> 43:01.520\nThis happened.\n\n43:01.520 --> 43:02.520\nThat really happened?\n\n43:02.520 --> 43:03.520\nYes.\n\n43:03.520 --> 43:04.520\nOh, I've heard that story three different times.\n\n43:04.520 --> 43:05.520\nWell, I just get out of here.\n\n43:05.520 --> 43:06.520\nYeah, no.\n\n43:06.520 --> 43:07.520\nCat didn't happen.\n\n43:07.520 --> 43:08.520\nYeah, no.\n\n43:08.520 --> 43:10.520\nKids, if you hand them my magazine,\n\n43:10.520 --> 43:12.520\nthey will try to pinch and zoom the fucking magazine.\n\n43:12.520 --> 43:13.520\nThey will...\n\n43:13.520 --> 43:14.520\nNo, that's...\n\n43:14.520 --> 43:15.520\nYes.\n\n43:15.520 --> 43:16.520\nA three-year-old kid.\n\n43:16.520 --> 43:17.520\nKids learn how to use his...\n\n43:17.520 --> 43:18.520\nDid not happen.\n\n43:18.520 --> 43:19.520\nThree years old.\n\n43:19.520 --> 43:20.520\nOh my God.\n\n43:20.520 --> 43:21.520\nAnd I sat at breakfast with...\n\n43:21.520 --> 43:22.520\nWhat's his name?\n\n43:22.520 --> 43:23.520\nJeremy Bruckheimer.\n\n43:23.520 --> 43:24.520\nOh my God.\n\n43:24.520 --> 43:25.520\nOkay, now I've said too much.\n\n43:25.520 --> 43:26.520\nLittle Jeremy?\n\n43:26.520 --> 43:27.520\nLittle...\n\n43:27.520 --> 43:28.520\nLittle cute Jeremy Bruckheimer?\n\n43:28.520 --> 43:29.520\nOh my gosh.\n\n43:29.520 --> 43:30.520\nYeah, I could see that.\n\n43:30.520 --> 43:31.520\nBut he's one of the bastard Bruckheimers.\n\n43:31.520 --> 43:32.520\nHe goes by Jeremy Snow.\n\n43:32.520 --> 43:33.520\nIt's a...\n\n43:33.520 --> 43:46.520\nHe's not officially allowed to be a Bruckheimer.\n\n43:46.520 --> 43:49.520\nHe's just wandering the north of the wall.\n\n43:49.520 --> 43:51.520\nPinch and grab a magazine.\n\n43:51.520 --> 43:54.520\nNo, I can't believe you find that hard to believe.\n\n43:54.520 --> 43:57.520\nYou tried to pinch and zoom a magazine.\n\n43:57.520 --> 43:59.520\nNo, I didn't.\n\n43:59.520 --> 44:00.520\nNo, kid.\n\n44:00.520 --> 44:01.520\nIf...\n\n44:01.520 --> 44:08.520\nIf you give a three-year-old kid a book or magazine...\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:10.520\nOkay, let's get one.\n\n44:10.520 --> 44:12.520\nThey will...\n\n44:12.520 --> 44:15.520\nOf course, because they're growing up on iPads.\n\n44:15.520 --> 44:16.520\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n44:16.520 --> 44:20.520\nBecause by the way, cutting down a tree and mashing it with chemicals\n\n44:20.520 --> 44:22.520\ninto a pulp that you can turn into a piece of paper\n\n44:22.520 --> 44:25.520\nand using a Gutenberg press to stamp ink onto it,\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:27.520\nthat's the iPad of its time.\n\n44:27.520 --> 44:29.520\nAnd it's not like people then weren't going like,\n\n44:29.520 --> 44:31.520\noh, there goes the neighborhood.\n\n44:31.520 --> 44:32.520\nYou know, about these books.\n\n44:32.520 --> 44:36.520\nWe just look at that as like, oh god, these precious books.\n\n44:36.520 --> 44:39.520\nWho cares if the kids are learning from iPads?\n\n44:39.520 --> 44:44.520\nBut the thing is, somewhere between surrendering to that stuff\n\n44:44.520 --> 44:47.520\nand it actually being part of our culture\n\n44:47.520 --> 44:50.520\nis this morass of just chaos where we're like,\n\n44:50.520 --> 44:52.520\noh, I wouldn't want to have a kid.\n\n44:52.520 --> 44:54.520\nI don't know what they're learning.\n\n44:54.520 --> 44:58.520\nSome Jim Henson needs to say, look, kids are learning from iPads\n\n44:58.520 --> 45:02.520\nand outside of trying to make a dollar by selling some dumb app\n\n45:02.520 --> 45:06.520\nthat's learned to use alphabets.\n\n45:06.520 --> 45:08.520\nI don't know.\n\n45:08.520 --> 45:11.520\nWe need that passion.\n\n45:11.520 --> 45:13.520\nSo if you're out there and you're living in Miami\n\n45:13.520 --> 45:18.520\nand you love kids and you own a van,\n\n45:18.520 --> 45:21.520\njust get into the back of it and start tinkering\n\n45:21.520 --> 45:25.520\nwith something that will help them for a change.\n\n45:25.520 --> 45:26.520\nYeah.\n\n45:26.520 --> 45:29.520\nYou've taken so much so far.\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:30.520\nGive back.\n\n45:30.520 --> 45:31.520\nGive back.\n\n45:31.520 --> 45:32.520\nSilicon Van.\n\n45:32.520 --> 45:34.520\nI mean, I think Silicon Valley's had enough.\n\n45:34.520 --> 45:37.520\nI think a more mobile Silicon Valley all around the world.\n\n45:37.520 --> 45:38.520\nSilicon Van?\n\n45:38.520 --> 45:39.520\nSilicon Van.\n\n45:39.520 --> 45:41.520\nTomorrow's Silicon Van is a windowless van.\n\n45:41.520 --> 45:43.520\nSilicon Valley is a windowless white van\n\n45:43.520 --> 45:46.520\ndriving out of Miami into...\n\n45:46.520 --> 45:47.520\nI mean, not for nothing.\n\n45:47.520 --> 45:50.520\nIf you put Royland, three programmers\n\n45:50.520 --> 45:52.520\nand some kind of a driver-type guy\n\n45:52.520 --> 45:56.520\nand some kind of a wild card that made sure everything was kind of all right,\n\n45:56.520 --> 46:00.520\nI bet those guys would come out with a hell of a game in six months.\n\n46:00.520 --> 46:02.520\nYeah.\n\n46:02.520 --> 46:06.520\nRob, can we introduce Dave Kline to wonder both of your parents?\n\n46:06.520 --> 46:08.520\nThat's great.\n\n46:08.520 --> 46:10.520\nHow do your parents feel about the spotlight?\n\n46:10.520 --> 46:12.520\nI'm great with moms.\n\n46:12.520 --> 46:14.520\nWhat do you mean?\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:18.520\nDon't you think the audience would like to meet your mom?\n\n46:18.520 --> 46:19.520\nI'm great with moms.\n\n46:19.520 --> 46:20.520\nSure.\n\n46:20.520 --> 46:23.520\nI didn't have a bad mom interaction with my wife.\n\n46:23.520 --> 46:25.520\nYours to lose.\n\n46:25.520 --> 46:27.520\nDonna, are you shy?\n\n46:27.520 --> 46:29.520\nWould you be willing to come sit up and...\n\n46:29.520 --> 46:30.520\nYeah.\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:31.520\nOh.\n\n46:31.520 --> 46:32.520\nOh.\n\n46:32.520 --> 46:33.520\nOh.\n\n46:33.520 --> 46:34.520\nOh.\n\n46:34.520 --> 46:35.520\nOh.\n\n46:35.520 --> 46:36.520\nOh.\n\n46:36.520 -->

you, gorgeous.\n\n46:46.520 --> 46:48.520\nOh, you behave yourself.\n\n46:48.520 --> 46:49.520\nKnock it off.\n\n46:49.520 --> 46:50.520\nKnock it off.\n\n46:50.520 --> 46:51.520\nOh.\n\n46:51.520 --> 46:52.520\nNot cool.\n\n46:52.520 --> 46:53.520\nNot cool.\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:55.520\nYou keep an eye on me over here.\n\n46:55.520 --> 46:59.520\nYou got a real great mom.\n\n46:59.520 --> 47:00.520\nShe seems...\n\n47:00.520 --> 47:03.520\nStop talking right now.\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:05.520\nYou need to stop talking.\n\n47:05.520 --> 47:07.520\nApples and trees, you're a great guy.\n\n47:07.520 --> 47:08.520\nYou probably got a great mom.\n\n47:08.520 --> 47:09.520\nThat's how it kind of goes.\n\n47:09.520 --> 47:10.520\nStop talking.\n\n47:10.520 --> 47:11.520\nMy mom's a great mom.\n\n47:11.520 --> 47:13.520\nI'm kind of a great guy.\n\n47:13.520 --> 47:14.520\nThat's true.\n\n47:14.520 --> 47:15.520\nThat is very true.\n\n47:15.520 --> 47:16.520\nThat all adds up.\n\n47:16.520 --> 47:17.520\nThat's very true.\n\n47:17.520 --> 47:18.520\nThank you.\n\n47:18.520 --> 47:19.520\nThat means a lot.\n\n47:19.520 --> 47:20.520\nDonna, welcome to the show.\n\n47:20.520 --> 47:21.520\nSorry about it.\n\n47:21.520 --> 47:22.520\nThank you.\n\n47:22.520 --> 47:23.520\nI'm not going to change it for you.\n\n47:23.520 --> 47:25.520\nSorry in advance.\n\n47:25.520 --> 47:26.520\nHow are you?\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:27.520\nIt's good to see you.\n\n47:27.520 --> 47:28.520\nI'm just fine.\n\n47:28.520 --> 47:29.520\nJust fine.\n\n47:29.520 --> 47:30.520\nI will say...\n\n47:30.520 --> 47:31.520\nIt's kind of corny now to say this,\n\n47:31.520 --> 47:33.520\nbut I'll say this about both of the parents.\n\n47:33.520 --> 47:34.520\nDonna and David,\n\n47:34.520 --> 47:37.520\nyou guys have a Dorian Gray portrait somewhere.\n\n47:37.520 --> 47:38.520\nYou're frozen in time.\n\n47:38.520 --> 47:39.520\nYou guys are...\n\n47:39.520 --> 47:40.520\nYou guys are...\n\n47:40.520 --> 47:44.520\nI'm turning into just...\n\n47:44.520 --> 47:45.520\nI've gone past Michael Moore,\n\n47:45.520 --> 47:48.520\nand I'm now just melting into a puddle\n\n47:48.520 --> 47:52.520\nof whatever Kevin Smith...\n\n47:52.520 --> 47:56.520\nLike cleans out of himself,\n\n47:56.520 --> 47:57.520\nand I'm like,\n\n47:57.520 --> 47:58.520\nno, I'm not dissing him.\n\n47:58.520 --> 47:59.520\nI'm saying...\n\n47:59.520 --> 48:01.520\nI'm saying I'm beyond...\n\n48:01.520 --> 48:03.520\nI've turned into protoplasm.\n\n48:03.520 --> 48:06.520\nI'm just slowly melting him.\n\n48:06.520 --> 48:10.520\nYou guys are just the same image.\n\n48:10.520 --> 48:13.520\nYou're just Donna and David Schrab.\n\n48:13.520 --> 48:15.520\nIt's not important to look good.\n\n48:15.520 --> 48:16.520\nThey haven't stopped smiling\n\n48:16.520 --> 48:18.520\nsince I met them in the green room.\n\n48:18.520 --> 48:19.520\nThey're sweet people.\n\n48:19.520 --> 48:22.520\nAnd here's the thing about Rob.\n\n48:22.520 --> 48:23.520\nIt's through meeting Schrab\n\n48:23.520 --> 48:24.520\nand then meeting his parents\n\n48:24.520 --> 48:26.520\nthat I started to gain insight\n\n48:26.520 --> 48:28.520\ninto the fact that creative types...\n\n48:28.520 --> 48:30.520\nWe create our own mythology behind us\n\n48:30.520 --> 48:31.520\nbecause Rob would be like,\n\n48:31.520 --> 48:33.520\nthe only stories you'd hear about\n\n48:33.520 --> 48:34.520\nhis upbringing,\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:35.520\nbecause you're like hanging out\n\n48:35.520 --> 48:37.520\nwith a creative and you're like 20 years old,\n\n48:37.520 --> 48:38.520\nyou're just like bolstering each other\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:39.520\nand going like, yeah,\n\n48:39.520 --> 48:40.520\nthis is sad, this is bullshit.\n\n48:40.520 --> 48:42.520\nYeah, yeah, punk rock.\n\n48:42.520 --> 48:44.520\nYou know, I'd hear a story about like,\n\n48:44.520 --> 48:46.520\none day my mom hit all my comic books\n\n48:46.520 --> 48:49.520\nor one day, you know...\n\n48:49.520 --> 48:50.520\nBut, you know,\n\n48:50.520 --> 48:51.520\nand then I met you\n\n48:51.520 --> 48:53.520\nand it's like, oh, she's a sweetheart.\n\n48:53.520 --> 48:55.520\nShe's not hitting me with a belt.\n\n48:55.520 --> 48:57.520\nShe's great.\n\n48:57.520 --> 48:58.520\nAnd I do think that's...\n\n48:58.520 --> 49:00.520\nThis is a nightmare.\n\n49:00.520 --> 49:05.520\nLike, talk about...\n\n49:05.520 --> 49:08.520\nTalk about anything you want, by the way,\n\n49:08.520 --> 49:10.520\nbut just talk about like,\n\n49:10.520 --> 49:13.520\ndid Rob have weird privates\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:15.520\nwhen he was born or...\n\n49:15.520 --> 49:19.520\nLike, do you remember him eating\n\n49:19.520 --> 49:21.520\nhis own shit or...\n\n49:21.520 --> 49:23.520\nOh, no, okay.\n\n49:23.520 --> 49:25.520\nI'm curious about that.\n\n49:25.520 --> 49:27.520\nShould I walk around the block for a bit?\n\n49:27.520 --> 49:29.520\nNo, you should sit there.\n\n49:29.520 --> 49:31.520\nKeep one camera on him.\n\n49:31.520 --> 49:32.520\nYeah.\n\n49:32.520 --> 49:34.520\nI don't know, what's the important question?\n\n49:34.520 --> 49:36.520\nWhen did Robby...\n\n49:36.520 --> 49:38.520\nBy the way, his name on his birth certificate,\n\n49:38.520 --> 49:40.520\nRobby Schrab...\n\n49:40.520 --> 49:41.520\nRobby Christopher.\n\n49:41.520 --> 49:43.520\nYeah, not Robert, not Rob...\n\n49:43.520 --> 49:45.520\nYeah, Robby is on the birth certificate.\n\n49:45.520 --> 49:48.520\nMom, you didn't like Robert?\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:49.520\nShe didn't like...\n\n49:49.520 --> 49:51.520\nShe's going like this podcast at home.\n\n49:51.520 --> 49:53.520\nThat actually didn't help.\n\n49:53.520 --> 49:54.520\nShe's going like this.\n\n49:54.520 --> 49:55.520\nThat didn't help at all.\n\n49:55.520 --> 49:56.520\nThat's calm.\n\n49:56.520 --> 49:58.520\nLet me do it again for the listeners.\n\n49:58.520 --> 50:00.520\nShe's going like this.\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:09.520\nOh, boy.\n\n50:09.520 --> 50:11.520\nOh, boy.\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:12.520\nWhen did...\n\n50:12.520 --> 50:14.520\nWhat was the...\n\n50:14.520 --> 50:16.520\nWhat was the moment when you really knew\n\n50:16.520 --> 50:18.520\nRob was different?\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:20.520\nYeah.\n\n50:20.520 --> 50:22.520\nDan's doing air quote.\n\n50:22.520 --> 50:24.520\nSpecial...\n\n50:24.520 --> 50:26.520\nSpecial?\n\n50:26.520 --> 50:28.520\nGo ahead.\n\n50:28.520 --> 50:30.520\nHe was always drawing.\n\n50:30.520 --> 50:32.520\nHe was always drawing.\n\n50:32.520 --> 50:34.520\nIn fact, when he was in second grade\n\n50:34.520 --> 50:36.520\nand they had to do a cursive writing\n\n50:36.520 --> 50:38.520\nand it had to be very neat,\n\n50:38.520 --> 50:40.520\nbut Rob would go on the margin\n\n50:40.520 --> 50:42.520\nand he'd draw all these little pictures\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:44.520\nand the teacher would say,\n\n50:44.520 --> 50:46.520\nI never reprimanded him\n\n50:46.520 --> 50:48.520\nbecause I was always anxious to see\n\n50:48.520 --> 50:50.520\nwhat he drew in the margins.\n\n50:50.520 --> 50:52.520\nOh.\n\n50:52.520 --> 50:54.520\nThis is the best.\n\n50:54.520 --> 50:56.520\nBut.\n\n50:56.520 --> 50:58.520\nBut.\n\n50:58.520 --> 51:00.520\nBy the way, I know it feels unnatural\n\n51:00.520 --> 51:02.520\nbecause I'm Midwestern too,\n\n51:02.520 --> 51:04.520\nbut you put your lips\n\n51:04.520 --> 51:06.520\nlike this distance from the mic.\n\n51:06.520 --> 51:08.520\nSo we can hear all this tenderness.\n\n51:08.520 --> 51:10.520\nSo, Rob,\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:12.520\ndoes that match up with...\n\n51:12.520 --> 51:14.520\nMom was a supporter.\n\n51:14.520 --> 51:16.520\nShe was an ally.\n\n51:16.520 --> 51:18.520\nWell, I was there.\n\n51:18.520 --> 51:20.520\nI don't remember all the teachers\n\n51:20.520 --> 51:22.520\nbeing very happy about me\n\n51:22.520 --> 51:24.520\nnot doing homework.\n\n51:26.520 --> 51:28.520\nAll right.\n\n51:28.520 --> 51:30.520\nSo he told everybody\n\n51:30.520 --> 51:32.520\nwhen he was at the high school graduation\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:34.520\nhe had to give a speech and the first thing\n\n51:34.520 --> 51:36.520\nhe said was,\n\n51:36.520 --> 51:38.520\nI was
