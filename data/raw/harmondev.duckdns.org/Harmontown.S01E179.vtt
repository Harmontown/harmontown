MUSIC

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
From San Francisco, California.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
CHEERING

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
And the SF sketch fest, Hyman Town, is now in session.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
CHEERING

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
And the mayor of Hyman Town, Mr. Dan Hyman.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
CHEERING

00:42.000 --> 00:58.000
MUSIC

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
CHEERING

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
What happened?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
What happened to your pants?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Ah, boy.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
The show's already off to a...

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
CHEERING

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
San Francisco start.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Here's the thing, going through the TSA checkpoint,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
you always have to take off your belt.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
And I thought, don't wear a belt.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
And then I was like, I did it, I'm a genius.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Like, I got through so fast.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
And then I'm like, yay, I love my show.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
And then the...

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, because the thing is, when you're fat and you're a guy...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know, I'm not being sexist.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm sure if you're fat and you're a woman, I don't know.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I don't pretend to know about...

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
But like, when you're fat and you're a guy,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
you have pants in your closet,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
and you put them on and it's like, oh, it barely fits.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I can't get it around my fat body.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And then you're like, I don't need a belt.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
And then, but then throughout the day,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
you fat out the pants...

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
What am I, Bridget Jones?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I mean, you get the idea.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I didn't know until I got out here.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
And then I was dancing, and then the pants fell down.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
It doesn't matter. This is a terrible way to start a show.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Hello, cultural capital of the United States of America!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
CHEERING

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Greatest city on Earth.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
CHEERING

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
So much better than Los Angeles!

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
CHEERING

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Fuck that sewer, that fucking piece of fetid shit!

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
CHEERING

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Fucking, what kind of city is so proud of itself

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
that it has the word Hollywood on a hill above it?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
It's not even the name of the city!

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Why does it say Hollywood? It's Los fucking Angeles.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Don't put San Francisco, let alone like just Ben & Jerry's or something like that.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You don't do that. You're San Francisco.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
You let it sell itself.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You're good people.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
And you're gay and or writers.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
CHEERING

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
This is where the typewriter was invented.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
CHEERING

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And you're our favorite city in the world.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Dan, since we are here at the historic Swedish American Hall,

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
I know Dan that you are something of a closet historian.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
Do you want to tell us a little bit about what your favorite Swedish American...

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
What connects you most to Swedish American history?

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
You can feel the ghosts of Swedish past out here.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
It's not just everyone's like, oh, the inventor of the meatball.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
It's like, no, think about the 900,000 years of them being confused with Switzerland.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
And just generally going like, what's our deal?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
All those meetings had to happen here.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
What's our deal?

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
What do you think separates Sweden from the rest of Scandinavia?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Mexico?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Because I dropped out of college, I don't know.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Was Ron Funches laughing?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
He didn't stay here.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
That was somebody with a nailing the Ron Funches laugh.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I wasn't playing with Ron Funches.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
That might be the ghost of Ron Funches.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
A famous Swedish...

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Can we please get a stream line show tonight?

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
The show started with you coming up dancing and your pants fell down.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Like a little baby.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
Pornography makes feminism...

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Makes you feminist when you realize because men can age out better.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
It's like eight guys still working in porn.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
It's not fair.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I don't have to go.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Just talk amongst yourselves about it later.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
That's the thing.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
What could be less of a feminist than a guy that's watching a lot of porn?

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
But the more porn miles you log, the more you keep seeing the same eight guys.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And then you're seeing this 500 women a minute and you're like,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
this is not a fair society.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
All roads lead to Rome.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
What role, Dan, do you think that the man should play in a porn?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
The father?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Ideally.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Can we please...

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Can we just have a moment...

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
This is San Francisco.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
Can we please have a moment to talk about incest porn and how...

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And how ridiculous it is that there always has to be this fucking mention of,

05:59.000 --> 06:08.000
step daddy, that's not why I Googled this shit.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Daddy daughter in the title and then it's like,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
my step daughter.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, pretend I didn't hear that because you know what I want.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It's the taboo.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
This is what people don't understand about pornography, Jeff.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Taboo.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Taboo is, it takes you across the threshold into a world where you can become pure animal.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I just want, I don't want to think about my mortgage.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I don't want to think about the police.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I don't want to think about fucking Bill Maher.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I don't want to think about Jay Leno.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I don't want to think about Froot Loops.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I don't want to think about cleaning the gutters.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
I want to think about fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
All right.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
That's the purpose of taboo is that it shocks your system.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
And that's our job tonight, ladies and gentlemen, here at Hammer Town.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
We're going to take you into the realm of taboo.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm a porn zealot now because I got a divorce and I'm like totally into porn.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Like, you've been hearing me in the podcast.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
Like, but I think the thing is like it's awakening me to like this weird disease that we have in this culture where we're like,

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
oh, we don't understand, like, fuck it.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
Just watch porn with your girlfriend, with your lover.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
If you're hearing a date tonight, just go home to your bed and just say,

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
let's do this as a bit because Dan Harmon said,

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
and just, and just like fucking like set an hour on your iPhone.

07:52.000 --> 08:05.000
And during that hour, the joke is try to get the other person to break up with you

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
by searching for things on Pornhub Premium.

08:10.000 --> 08:17.000
Like just, and if you make it through that hour, fucking marry that person.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
And if you don't keep doing this process until you've married somebody,

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
and then the divorce rate will go to 0% within five years.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Is the end game all about marriage?

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
I know, it's just I'm luring them in because I know what they value.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Marriage is a placeholder for whatever you value.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
Can you say what the weirdest place that you go to in porn?

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
No, I can't. That's why it's amazing.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
I mean, you already, you already tipped that you were into incest porn.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
We already got that.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
I am into incest porn.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
What? What?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I am.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
It's fucking hot.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
And you know what? It started with fucking like,

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
it started with, oh daddy, oh daddy.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
You know what?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The reason I'm willing to tell you this is because I fucking,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I met a girl who's like fucking into it too.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And I was like, we were just like, so now I'm like, oh shit,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm not a monster, or she is too.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
It's like, it's like Shrek. It's like Shrek.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
I found my Cameron Diaz.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And we're just sitting in the swamp together and like,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
what if the gingerbread guy fucking ate out the Pinocchio?

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
And we're like, ah, it's fucking amazing.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm telling you, just tonight, just open the laptop,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
go to Pornhub.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Tell them Dan Harmon sent you.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
If you type in the code Harmon, it's,

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
you can get a free three months subscription to Pornhub Premium.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Where were we? Oh, but my news.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Where were we?

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
But my new thing, I was like,

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
brother's sister in says porn is now kind of like on my radar

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
because I find it, I was like, oh, I'd never click on that

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
because it's not taboo enough.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
But it's actually, it is kind of a turn on.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, let me stop you there.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Let me stop you there.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Brother's fucking sisters doesn't scratch that itch for you yet.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It's not getting there.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
No, it doesn't. I was like, I was like, well, they're, you know,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
the same age and like, I, I, I, I,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Oh, yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, yeah, tonight's going to end with you guys either judging me

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
or me becoming president.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
No, it's going to end with me being a fucking human being

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
and getting away with murder for the rest of my life

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
because I'm a fucking, I love myself.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I'd rather, I'd rather die in a fucking ditch

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
an honest man going like, I thought that was hot

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
when the sister fucked her brother.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't really want it to happen in real life ever.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Why do we live in a society where movies are,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
are capable of affecting real life?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's the, that's fucking fucked up.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
In the news today is the matrix responsible for a column mind.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
You're the fucking perverts.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Fuck you. You know?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Like, like, I fucking pay my taxes.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I get to jerk off to a video of a guy going like,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Hey, sister.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Yes, brother.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
I know they're not really, this isn't really going to happen ever.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Are they Amish?

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
I like, I, but I, but the hot thing about,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I could get into Amish in SES porn.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
The, the hot thing about sister brother,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
the brother thing to me is like,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
that I didn't think I would actually,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
it's the eye rolling.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Like, I never thought, like, it's sex as a, well, eye rolling.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
It's like, it's like, it's like,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
because it's like this energy of like,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
this sibling energy of like, hey,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm going to tell mom and dad that you stole those,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
that money from their cabinet.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
Don't, don't, don't do that.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Why would you do that?

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
You're my step-brother.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh, I don't know, I don't know what to tell you.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I don't know what to tell you.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
I'm going to tell them, you're my step-sister.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
What do I have to do?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
What do I have to do?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I really want to go to this concert.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, why don't you, why don't you suck my dick?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Are you serious?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That's the best, that's the best part.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's the reaction.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Are you serious?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It's like, it's like, it's like Fred,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
when he finds out Barney wants his cocoa bubbles.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Are you serious?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I believe that's what Joseph Campbell calls

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
the refusal of the call.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
It's what Dr. Ruth would call healthy and hot.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Because it's fucking like, you're, you want it,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
and it's like fucking not what you're getting

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
at the grocery store.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah, yeah, what do you mean what?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I'll tell you what.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It's not Doritos sex, baby.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
It's fucking art, artisanal.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
It's from your fucking soul.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
You know you want to fuck your brother?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I'm sorry, that's not true.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I know you don't want to fuck your brother.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
That's not the point.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
No one here wants to fuck any of their religions.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
No Dan, she's been a real brother fucker all night long.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Alright, so anyways.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
Okay, segue.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Well, there's another, can I keep talking about porn

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
for just a little bit?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Can we?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't know.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I don't want people to be like, I can't even, okay.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, we can't hear the people that are going,

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
shears are louder than, those people are,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I came here for the book reviews.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Moby Dick was great again.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
I keep, sorry, I keep reading the same book.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
He can't get that whale.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Anyways, back in the world of porn,

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
there's this genre of porn called cuckold porn.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh shit.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Yo, that was my accident, but let's follow that trend.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Cuckold porn is when you watch,

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
but your wife is in the crotch with a guy,

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
but you're just using your eye, you're not using your dick.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
You don't know, you're just sick of fucking your wife,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
and she's sick of fucking you,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and so she's fucking another guy, and you're watching.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
She's cheating on you, and you're left there watching,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
because you're a pussy, and you're spineless,

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
and you're powerless,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
and you just want to worship her sexuality,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
and you know what, she's so fucking sexy,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
you can't imagine yourself fucking her.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
What could be hotter than that?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It's called cuckold porn.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
However, there's this guy.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
I'd like to thank the Swedish-American hall

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
for having us here tonight.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I don't know how to describe guy.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I think you described it quite eloquently.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
No, no, no.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
But there's this video that I want everyone to see,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and I...

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Because it's cuckold porn,

15:44.000 --> 15:51.000
but your typical cuckold porn video is a guy will walk in

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
and go like, you owe me rent,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
and the woman will go like, I can't pay the rent,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
but you must pay the rent.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I don't have the rent, and then the guy will go like,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Oh, pay the rent.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
That's the first cuckold porn.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
All right.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Okay, so let's...

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Okay, here's the next topic.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Now, I don't want to whiplash you guys,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
but starving African children...

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Okay, so these videos...

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Like, don't freak out about this.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I was watching at the airport today,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
and there was like 90 television screens,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
because our culture, our empire is like,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
it's flushed with money,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and it's pumping electricity,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
and we have an international hub at the airport,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and there's all these plasma screens,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and there's 20 football games,

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
and there's like Anderson Cooper's talk

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
under different people,

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
and Fox Wilderson, or whoever his name is,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
or Greta Saskatchewan,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
and they're all telling you,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
in the Middle East today, they're crazy.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
We can't do nothing about it.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
They're crazy.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
And then there's like,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
but football, football, football, and Ovalteen,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
and then there's like always that...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
There's always that one screen,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
if you're at a sports bar or an airport,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
and there's enough screens statistically on accident,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
there's going to be starving African children on the screen,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
on like a loop,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
because somebody's not paying attention,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and Tito's needs to be restocked,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
and they're like, oh, fuck,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
there's like a Christian children's network thing going on,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
and there's just like African kids going,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
and I was like watching it,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
and I was thinking about it from a television producer's standpoint

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
for one second,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
just how in order to get that footage,

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
you have to get on a plane,

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
and you have to fly to Africa,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
and you have to get off the airport in Africa,

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
and then you have all these bags of camera equipment.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Please, can I finish?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
It's going to get worse.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's not really.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And you have camera equipment,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
and you have probably, I mean, that's for real,

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
some food.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
You have some food.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
When's the last time any of you traveled

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
without a couple of neutral-grain bars?

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
Um, and they're like,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
we're going,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
and I'm sure these are the most wonderful people in the world,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
for all I know.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
It's like, I don't, like, they might be volunteering,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
like, I don't think they're like,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
but they're like, from the first world,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
and they're coming here, and they're going to work,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
okay, our job is, we've got a shot list,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
they have a shot list,

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
and the shot list says, hungry baby.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
Baby with flies on face.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Hungry mother, baby,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
depressed, can't give the, whatever.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
It's just like, it's just like,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
it may be not in a line item list,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
but it's a video production,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
and like, they go and they have to shoot it,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
and you know that they have, like,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
fucking probably pockets, like,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
full of neutral-grain bars,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
like, shooting, and obviously they're going to

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
give everybody, when they go there,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
they're going to give them food.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Of course they're going to give them food.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Do we know that?

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, I'm going to assume that because of human nature,

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
but then as a producer, I'm also going to assume,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
obviously, they can't give them that food

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
until they get their shots.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
So, I just said that there's, like,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
ten minutes of that whole thing.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It's like, from a bird's-eye perspective,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
it's like, well, this is normal.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah, you went down there and you covered this stuff,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
and it's like, couldn't you zoom in, and you're like,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
yeah, but for that ten minutes,

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
like, you have, like, a strawberry granola bar

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
in your pocket, and then you're like,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
okay, so, I'm just going to,

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
boy, he's hungry.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay, can you, can you kind of,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
can you, somebody move that tree?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Lim?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
It's just left, left.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And then, like, okay, so, all right,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
he's clearly so hungry.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
You know, for, like, for old, like,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
for like, Greta Garbo and certain old,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
like, silent movie actresses,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
they would put, like, a candle on top of the camera

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
to give them that kind of glimmer in their eye,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
a key light, to make them seem like they're crying.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Do you think they put, like, a granola bar

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
on top of the camera?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
I'm not, I didn't come here with him.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
He, he flew out of Burbank,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I flew out of LAX.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Like, I'm not, like, with him.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
That's not the joke I was doing.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
I don't jerk off to children being rape,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
rape mother and fathers.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Yeah, well, okay, so,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm the bad guy.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Okay.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Why don't you just keep it down?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
No, that's not, I wasn't, no, no.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
But, but, but I'm saying, like,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
all right, well, you get the idea,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
that there's, like, somewhere out there,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
there's like an eight minute window where somebody's like,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
like, I'm gonna, well, remember that day

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
that we gave that kid a gum drop or whatever,

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
and then it ruined the shot.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Like, we're, and then in other words,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
like, we, there was less money came in.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
And like, so you have to actually,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
like, if you're the most benevolent person in the world,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
if you're a volunteer and you're working for that organization,

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
your job is to actually shoot starving people.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Right.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
And they cannot be fed while they're on camera.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
You, you fucking connect the dots that,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
that I had to connect today.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
Yo, yo, yo.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Cynicism sometimes needs to be

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
yanked up from the floor

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
and shoved into your face,

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
because there's not enough bad things to feel bad about.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
So I have to go, like, hunting for the, like, the one.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
No, I was just thinking, it just, it just seems sad

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and ironic.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Okay, all right, the cuckold guy.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I just wanted to talk about the specific cuckold porn,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
where there was a guy, a guy comes in.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
How do we say we have cuckold porn

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
and disturbing children?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
I forget.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Because there was, there was a through line there.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
There's a cuckold porn video

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
where a woman is sitting on her bed in a bathrobe

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
and then the door opens, the bedroom door opens

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
and there's this guy comes in and he's wearing,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
he's on a hoverboard, one of those,

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
and he has a helmet on

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
and it has blinking lights on it.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
And he, and he goes, hey.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Is he the protagonist?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Yes, just don't.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Sorry, sorry, go ahead.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
And he comes in and he goes, hey, honey, look at me.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, look what I got.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Meep, beep, I'm a robot.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Beep, beep, beep.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And he's like twirling around on his hoverboard for real.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
And she, and she's like, what, what's going on?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
What's going on?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Because like, she's, they're all porn actors

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
and they've all been told to say certain things

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
at certain times, but it's already fucked up.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And then there's like weird,

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
like this guy comes in creeping in after the hoverboard guy

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
and he goes like, I gotta tell you, your husband,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
he took to this thing like I've never seen

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
and it's just $700 and he,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and she's like, he can't pay for that.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
And he's like, oh, well, we don't need a car anymore.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And he keeps twirling around and then the,

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and then the guy is like, he's like,

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
well, I can't, I gotta tell you, he bought the hoverboard.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
So I don't know what to tell you.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
It's just like, and it just goes on and on.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Like watching porn people who have never had

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
a single UCB workshop.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Like, and you know, like the camera,

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
like, you know, like the camera will just cut sometimes

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
because it's like, they're just in a circle.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
It's like, it's like the ants' death march of death.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Like they don't know how to stop asking questions

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
and denying each other.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
What do you mean?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I can't do this.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Well, something's gotta be done,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
but I can't do this.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
And then it'll cut to like a slightly different angle,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
but it's a different time of day.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And then they're like, okay, well, here,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
how do we work this out?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Because they've been like cattle prodded.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
The woman finally goes like,

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
well, there must be some way we can work this out.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
But then the guy is on the hoverboard

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
and he's just like having a great time on the hoverboard.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
And then the guy, the supposed alpha male,

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
who is not in control of the scene,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
he has, because they understand cuckold craft.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
They understand porn craft.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
They don't understand stagecraft.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
They don't understand the effect of a fucking hoverboard.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
This guy is not going to be the low status character,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
no matter what they do.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
This is the China syndrome of cuckold porn.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
Like it is, they were fucked before they started

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
and everyone in the scene is fucked.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
But the guy sits on the bed and he goes like,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
huh, well, something's got to get worked out.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
And the guy just keeps like backing into furniture.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
And he's like, and she goes like,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
well, I'd like to work it out.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
And then the guy says, are you thinking how to work this out?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Same way I'm thinking.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
How to work this out?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
That's actual dialogue?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
That's actual dialogue.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
He speaks in origami.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
You have to focus on the center of his palindrome

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and it folds out and then you're like,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
oh my God, he's a genius.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
They go like, slavery, not a good thing,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
because human, not a good thing,

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
because then you're like, oh, wait, whoa, wow, whoa, my boy.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Anyways.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Wait, so what happens?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Well, I'll tell you what happens.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Is that Act One?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Yeah, the crossing of the threshold is, of course,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
the guy's going to start fucking the woman.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
But the guy keeps backing into shit in the room

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
and they keep getting startled and he's got all the status.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
And then he starts having sex.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
He's going like, oh, I love my hoverboard.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
And then the alpha guy is like fucking his wife

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
and he tries to get it back by going like,

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
more like a nerdboard.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
But it's like, oh, no, you shouldn't even have tried.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
Like, he's fucking owning you.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Like, the guy is like, he's like, he's fucking great.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
What is the Act Two crisis?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Well, it's always like, then the woman

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
and a good cuckold porn couldn't air quotes.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I think the woman will go like, you get over here

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and you suck his dick.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Wait, the guy hasn't got the hoverboard

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
and suck like the alpha guy's dick?

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
That's right, San Francisco.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
Looks like someone came in a little higher than you.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You thought you were all impressed with yourselves.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Yeah.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Maybe I watched a couple dudes in a fucking girl

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
and one guy sucked the other guy's dick tonight.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
She got like, suck that guy's dick or lick his balls.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
And then the guy gets on the bed and he goes,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
he starts licking the other guy's balls

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
but he's like, he's looking off in the distance

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
and going...

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
And the look on his face,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
it looks like he's like a kid from Pet Cemetery.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
Like, again, he's not low status.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
He controls the room.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Wait, the wife said, you lick his balls.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Get off the hoverboard and lick the alpha male's balls.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
In cuckold porn, there's not always the male on male thing

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
but it's a typical of cuckold porn

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
where the woman will say to the beta male,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
she'll go, now you do this.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
And then this guy eventually starts blowing that guy.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
That's the other hilarious part.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
Then the alpha male always has this...

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
The other guy is going down at him

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
and then the alpha male goes like,

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
I don't know if I signed up for this.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
Like, four bobs in.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I don't know if I said,

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
yeah, it's not a matter of paperwork at this point.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
And that's a good thing and you should accept that.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
Like, your hard on is all the pen and paper you need.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
So what is Act 3 of this whole thing?

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
I never finished.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
What did I finish?

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
We've started out while you stop. The tape are there.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
Bob 4.

29:17.000 --> 29:24.000
Spacebar.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Once again, thank you Swedish American Hall

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
for having us here tonight.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It's a great heritage.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
So anyways.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Hey, this doesn't broadcast outside of San Francisco, does it?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
I hope not.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Alright, anyways.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
It's tightsweather again.

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
Thank you ladies.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Starving every children.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
I got that.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Doctors, doctors.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
What were we talking about with doctors?

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Doctors, doctors are terrible people.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Okay, alright.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Okay, so Times Square.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Okay, so we were talking about New Year's Eve.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Now, this is where my show is going to go

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
real stunty, potentially.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
I hope you guys are okay with a little bit of a chicanery,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
a little bit of prop comic.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Normally we just come up here and freestyle.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
We were talking about New Year's Eve and Times Square

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
and you were telling me that the people that crammed into Times Square

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
for New Year's Eve, they were diapers.

30:30.000 --> 30:41.000
San Francisco is blown away again.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
Some people, you know, your shoulder to shoulder

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
with a lot of people.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Get it.

30:46.000 --> 30:56.000
See, I like her style.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
But Madam, you heard the harrumphing going on.

31:00.000 --> 31:05.000
No, she's saying like the harrumphing is a second level harrumphing.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
We got all the tools we need.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
We choose to harrump.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
The harrumphing is they get the premise

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
they don't like where it's going.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Yeah, no, no, no.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Well, that's a good question.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
Are you guys harrumphing because you don't believe it?

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Wait, well, I can't.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
We're going to need to elect a representative

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
to speak for you or something.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Who is the guy that said, I got it.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
What was your name?

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Come on stage.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Get up here.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
If you want.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
If you want.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
If you want.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
We won't make fun of you.

31:36.000 --> 31:43.000
If you want to come up, come on.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Here, why don't you sit there and I'll sit there

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
and I'm going to lower this and I feel like...

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
What is your name?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Nikki.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
Nikki, what happened to the knees of your pants?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I fall a lot.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
I fall a lot?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
You fall a lot?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I love it.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
I mean, that's crazy to come on and say to a youngster.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
Obviously, that's some kind of fashion thing.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
That is suggestive.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Were these knee blowouts on your jeans by design or by accident?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
Do you wear those jeans so much that the knees actually gave out?

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Both.

32:20.000 --> 32:27.000
They were ripped when I bought them and they have become increasingly more blown out.

32:27.000 --> 32:34.000
Are you a 21?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Fair question.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Yes, I am.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Okay.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Do you want to do...

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
I don't...

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
Look, I don't do this a lot.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Dan, put your mic down.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Hand it to Spencer.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Make her a drink.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
I know what we're doing.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
What's your name again?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm sorry, I already forgot.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Nikki.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Nikki, hello, Nikki.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Hi.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Nikki, where are you from?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Actually, just recently saw you.

32:56.000 --> 33:06.000
You did a who's lying thing in Marin, I believe.

33:06.000 --> 33:14.000
We're watching Dan be a gentleman for the first time in his life.

33:14.000 --> 33:24.000
Nikki, Dan's offering you the drippingest glass.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Appetizing.

33:25.000 --> 33:33.000
Spencer, how are you doing over there?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Oh, great.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Great, Jeff.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
I'm doing great.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm not going to use it.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
You're not going to check it?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
No, I'm not going to do it by myself.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
You're not going to drink it by yourself?

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
This is like a Spice Girls thing.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
I've got to get with your friends.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
All right, who's your posh spice?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Who's your BFF?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
He's there.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
He?

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
It's San Francisco, buddy.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
All right, get him up here.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Get him up here.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
The he.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Male spice.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Old spice.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Posh spice.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Can you share that with me?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Can you share that with Nikki?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Posh, as I'm best known.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
All right.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
What's your name, sir?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I'm Rob.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Rob and Nikki, everybody.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Rob and Nikki.

34:22.000 --> 34:30.000
Rob and Nikki, if I may be so forward, what is the nature of your friendship relationship?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Are you guys just pals?

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Is there a romance thing happening here?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
No, we bang.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
You bang.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
Now, who plays the father and who plays the sister?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Do you guys role play?

34:48.000 --> 34:55.000
Do you do role playing?

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Do you want to take this one or should I take this one?

34:58.000 --> 35:04.000
I think we know who the bottom is in this relationship.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
I'll take that by the way.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
We're going to now.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
He's asking for...

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I'll take that while we're up here.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Now, do I make you another one and then...

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
She's a white wine now.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
I get something.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I mean, this is...

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
All right.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Make yourself useful, Dan.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
I'm only doing this because you guys are the...

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
I'm only doing this because you guys are the cultural capital of the United States.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
You're my favorite city.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Rob, how long have you been...

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Are you guys are dating?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
You're a couple.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
How long has this been going on, Rob?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
A bit over a year.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Yes, sir.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
And do you guys live together?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Or do you just live separately?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
No, sir.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
I live with her best friend.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
The plot...

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
I love it.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
The plot thickens.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
Wait, both of my best friends, the straight woman and the gay man.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
He lives...

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Come and knock on our door.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Wait, wait, wait.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
No, that got intricate.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Wait, say that again.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
He lives with a gay man and a straight woman and both of them are my best friends.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
Come and knock on our door.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
He lives with a gay man and your best friend, but you don't live with him.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
No.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
I'm just trying to purse through this, guys.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
I...

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Is that vodka for me, Dan?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
No, this is for Nicky, who took the first one.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It was like, I can't drink this without a friend.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Dan, make a fireman line.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Make me a drink, too, you piece of shit.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Goddamn it.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
All right.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
While you're at it.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Okay.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
All right.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Well, cheers.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah, Nicky, I'll give it to you.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Nicky, your turn.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Take the drink.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Oh, is that mine?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Was it Rob?

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Rob?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Yeah.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Sorry.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Cheers.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
I don't know how to do a show.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
I don't know how to do a show.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Okay, there you go.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Okay.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Okay, so what the fuck were we talking about when you came up?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Ask him about Chemtrails.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Chemtrails.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Chemtrails.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
You...

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Chemtrails.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
Well, there's a mandate about Chemtrails.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Yeah.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Couldn't fit all those chemicals on one of those little planes.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Also, Spencer.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Wait, what?

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
So, I'm just interested.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
What about Chemtrails?

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
Dan, you were talking about New Year's Eve and the fact that people can't pee, and she

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
goes, we get it.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
We're with you, mister.

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
Right, but I think she was saying that we're all on board with, you can't...

37:27.000 --> 37:32.000
In order to pee in Times Square, so people are, like, doubling down and going for it,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
yeah.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Right.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
And it's bearing us from the explanation, though.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
Not, like, I'm not gonna wear a diaper, but if I have to pee, I'm gonna do it.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Now, have you been to Times Square in New York before?

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
I have not during New York.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
New Yorkers.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I have peed in Times Square.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
You peed in Times Square?

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
Just walking in front of the Eminem story, he's like, fuck it, I gotta hang a squirt.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
That's a new one.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Oh.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
Dan, let me tell you about my porn fetish.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
It's called squirthangers.com.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Don't pee for it, Jeff.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
Nikki, when you say that you peed in Times Square, walk us through that, would you?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Oh, boy.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
Well, we were in Times Square and drunk.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Right.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
Is this daytime or nighttime?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
This is daytime.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
At a girl.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And we decided...

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Eat that mic, Nikki.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Eat the mic?

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Yeah, just up here, yeah.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
So they can hear you.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
Dan also goes to mic-eaters.com.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
So I decided that I needed to pee.

38:49.000 --> 38:56.000
And around Times Square, they don't let you do that, because obviously all the tourists want to.

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
So we decided we were going to head off to a side road and find a place to pee.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
There's no side roads in Times Square, though.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
It's called 54th Street.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I was drunk.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
So I walk off and try to do that, and I'm squatting, doing my thing.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And I look up and...

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
You're up against a tree, or are you hiding in an alleyway?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I was up against a car.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
A car.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
There's a Times Square version of trees.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
So you pee next to a car.

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
So I'm up against a car peeing, and I hear, like, a tap.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
And I look up, and there's people in the car.

39:37.000 --> 39:43.000
No!

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Why are they in the car?

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
What are they doing in the car?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
They were parking.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
How dare they?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
As one does.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Like, come on.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Expect to get peed on.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
I want to get the full picture.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
So there's a street, they're doing a parallel parking thing, and you're next to the...

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
It seemed like a very suburban street.

40:07.000 --> 40:13.000
I now, like, at Times Square, the suburbs...

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Just off of Broadway, you know?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Suburbia, suburbia.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Bedroom, neighborhood, you know?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Just outside of Hedwig.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Yeah, no.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
If you hit cats, you went too far.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
I think it was a family that was, like, trying to visit Times Square on their vacation.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
And there's a lady just peeing on their car.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
But, like, on the side, I'm trying to picture...

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
On the side of their car, like, crouching by the car, and then I heard a tap.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Because there was, like, out of view.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
But in the view of four people wearing Wisconsin hoodies.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
I was, like, right by the driver's window.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Right.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
So you're in the street?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
If you're by the driver's window, you're out in the middle of the road.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Oh, yeah.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Yeah, I was.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
That's my girl.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
That's your girl.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
You should not applaud that.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
You never close your eyes anymore.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
I didn't say it was a classy moment for me, Jeff.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
Well, honestly, we got a lot of show to do, and I think they're wonderful.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
We can humbly excuse ourselves if that's what you're facing before.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
I got a lot to do.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
If you guys want to plug something or...

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
You were wonderful.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
They should buy you a drink later.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
But if there's anything you want to say, is that burn down the White House?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Is that what you want to say, Rob?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I'm happy to plug bias to drink later.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
What's that?

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Bias-to-drink-later.com.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Oh, bias-to-drink-later.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I thought it was the name of a...

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Rob and Nicky, you can find them on pparker.com, everybody.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Thank you for their...

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
All right.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Oh, yeah.

41:57.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah, I mean, if you go back through the history of that broadcast,

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
Jeff was the one that was like, get up here.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
Because I was in the midst of a point that I was trying to make.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
But I was interested in whether or not you guys believe that people wear diapers.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
But now I'm not anymore.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I've moved beyond whether it's true or not.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I think we're finding out that you don't need to wear diapers.

42:22.000 --> 42:29.000
You can just go pee in the middle of the road on 55th and Broadway.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I got to stop cloaking this in science.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
It's a science thing.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
It's a thing that I want to do.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Jeff Vesuvio, we were talking about this, and I said to Steve Levy, my assistant,

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
who was here, I said, go get some diapers, some adult diapers.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And bring them here.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
And I want to...

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I'll put a pair on.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Are you wearing diapers right now?

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
No, no, I haven't put them on yet.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
I don't want to plan things.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
But I thought, Steve, do you have the diapers?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Oh, no.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Steve?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Oh, here he comes.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Oh, shit.

43:11.000 --> 43:16.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
What in the shopping...

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
What's in the bag?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Take the mic, Steve.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Take the mic.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
These are the ones that you said...

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Those are the fancy ones.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
He's a designer. This is like when Paul Rudd finally has to piss his pants.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
He's going to wear a real fit for men.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
And then the other ones depend for men.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I mean, I don't...

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Say what?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Yeah!

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Why are they for men?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Well, I think the women...

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I really don't know.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I would think maybe...

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
The sexier, the female... The female ones are sexier.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Well, no, because...

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
They have frills and padding.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Well, I would also...

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
Maybe, madam, I don't know, and I'd back you up every step of the way

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
if you want to escape a dichotomous world of adult diapers.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I'm with you.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Say what?

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Oh, you have a theory?

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Okay.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
What can you shout it out before we bring you up here and do the whole thing?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Diaper theory.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Just shout out your theory and...

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
This is a horrible premise, but I haven't told her.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Okay.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
All right.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Get up here.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Get up here.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Come on.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
She says she has a tumbler.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Now we have to bring her up.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Diaper tumbler.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
Diaper tumbler.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
What the...

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Please tell me you're wearing diapers right now, madam.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
What is your name?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Lindsay.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Lindsay, everybody.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Welcome, Lindsay.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Grab that and move that and...

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Okay, Lindsay, what's your theory?

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm not sure I can get on this chair.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Well, that's cool.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
You're only here to give your theory.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
There we go.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
So...

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
No dream is too big.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
All right.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
For me, maybe.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
I can't reach it.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Lindsay...

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
God damn it, the theory.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Okay.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
So I have a tumbler.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
It's called Fragile Masculinity Products.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Oh, sorry.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Say it again.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Fragile Masculinity Products.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Okay.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Right.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Say it again.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
No, it's tumbler.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
There's a tumbler.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
Just keep going through these nested loops.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
And she's going to bring you up and then we're going to end up doing a show for cockroaches

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
in China.

45:26.000 --> 45:34.300
So my theory is that if you use a product that's not branded for men and it's something to

45:34.300 --> 45:37.000
do with caring for your body, it makes you gay.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Oh, okay.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Well, that's fair.

45:39.000 --> 45:44.000
In a world where there, like, Coke Zero exists, like one would expect, yeah, that if...

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
Dr. Pepper 10.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
One of the products on the tumbler is aromatherapy for men.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Aromatherapy.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And it's called Beast Mood.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Well, yeah, we're talking...

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Yeah.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
So, yeah, I mean, that's easy enough to...

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
Like, they market test stuff and then they ask men...

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
There's a tactical Christmas stocking.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
A tactical Christmas stocking.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
That's cool.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
No, it's not.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
That's like, if you get a knife...

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
There's a tactical baby carrier.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
That's cool.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
What?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Like, if you get a knife...

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
No, I mean, there may...

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
You can see on the package, there's a bulge there.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
I'm sure that's not the women's depends, right?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
That's what I was going to say, is that...

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
Am I being naive and thinking that the women's stream comes a little...

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
I mean, there needs to be a bulge.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
It's not just pee.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Well, but it doesn't even matter, because like...

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Well, in the front there is.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
You don't know.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Like, what would be your...

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
I mean, I'm not locking horns with you when I say this.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
I just think this is very interesting because I feel like...

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
Like, obviously capitalism, it propagates itself across the gender gap,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
and there's all kinds of ridiculous things.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Like, when these companies, all we should expect them to do

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
is to try to make money off of people, and they market test stuff,

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
and if men go, I want a toothpick that makes me not feel gay,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
then it's like...

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Then there's these toothpicks that are called like,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
pick your tooth, fucker.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And it's like, it doesn't...

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
It's not made by the government.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
It's made by a fucking toothpick company.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
They're trying to make money as much as they can.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
Like, cool cigarettes? Give me a break.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
Lindsay, have you ever worn an adult diaper?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
No, I have not.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Are you willing to wear one tonight?

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
These are men's ones.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Are you willing to go across gender lines

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
and wear a male adult diaper?

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
What's the incentive?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Huh?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
What's the incentive?

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
Shut up, Jim.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
That's my roommate yelling at me.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Prove they're not for men.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I'm just wondering, what's the incentive?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Prove they're not for men.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Fuck you.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
The things we're forced to say when we have to quickly

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
consolidate our thoughts but shout because of...

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
Prove they're not for men.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
And then you go home and you're like,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
prove they're not for men.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That wasn't me. That wasn't Toby.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Does this...

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
I would have been so much more articulate than that.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Does this mean feminism wins?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Your girlfriend's like, no, it's okay, Toby.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
You were shouting across a crowded room.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Like, no one would have heard you.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
Yeah, but prove they're not for men.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
I'm gonna be hearing that for the rest of my life.

48:27.000 --> 48:34.000
Prove they're not for men.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
That's happening at Trump rallies all over the

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
American village.

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
Bad things come inside the country.

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
You're right because of your hair.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
I'll totally wear one if this means feminism wins.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Wait, sorry.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Does this mean feminism wins if I wear an adult diaper for men?

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Wins what?

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
Just wins.

49:02.000 --> 49:12.000
What if feminism only loses if you say that?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Oh, no.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
The idea that it's a horse in a race,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
not to high road you,

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
but no, I would be happy to,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
in the spirit of,

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
yeah, of course, yeah.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
I don't know what it'll do for gender dichotomy.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I don't know what it'll do.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I don't think it has to be about any actual

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
empirical experiment.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
I think it's simply, do you need that?

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
But I know, okay.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
They've had enough pants down on the road.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
No, no, no, no.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
You can't wear over your pants.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
No, I'm not gonna, I have to,

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
you have to put them over your,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
and I don't know if that's illegal or not,

49:58.000 --> 50:05.000
these are so much more thin than I thought.

50:05.000 --> 50:13.000
Be sure they got a diaper for your drink.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
What?

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
Well, just give me the corner.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
Since 1849, the Swedish-American haul.

50:23.000 --> 50:36.000
Just keep it, keep it near you.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Hey, guys.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Oh, nice.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
Careful, careful.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Oh, geez.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
Oh, boy.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Yeah, you don't have to do it.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Don't feel weird.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
Oh, she's doing it.

50:53.000 --> 51:00.000
All right.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
Now, Dan, personal question, Dan.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Be careful.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Don't hurt yourself.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Can I ask?

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
They are super tight.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Take her wallet.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Get her stuff.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Oh.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Get it, get the pants.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Dan, have you taken the show, Pete?

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Did you pee before the show?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Have you got one of the chairs?

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I didn't pee before the show,

51:21.000 --> 51:25.000
but we got a lot of people to talk about.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
That's why it's for men.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
Oh, shit.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Shit.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I'd be careful.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Take that, Betty, for Dan.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I didn't intend for this to be a gender thing.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Don't jump too high.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
She has a weapon.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
This is an actual knife.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Don't hurt yourself.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
That's cool.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
And you brought it up here?

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
I feel like we should be protecting her

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
and not going through her stuff.

51:55.000 --> 52:01.000
Dan, I've never worn an adult diaper before.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
Do you feel secure?

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
I just really want to pee.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
I'm asking you an honest question.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
I mean, do you feel secure?

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
If you peed right now, do you feel that

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
that would contain the pee?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
No, I don't.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It feels like there's a sheet of cardboard

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
wrapped around my...

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
It's really chafy.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
Let's get back to the show.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
If you want, you can put your pants back on.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
I'm going to put my pants back on

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
because I feel like...

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Nobody puts their pants back on.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
The pants stay off.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
This is quite freeing, actually.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I feel like the point of the diaper

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
is to have them on.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Okay, put your pants back on.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Because also, we have some serious cases.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Okay, how about this?

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Dan, you be the control.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
No, no.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Lindsay, you be the control.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Put your trousers back on.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Dan, you be the experiment.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Leave your trousers off.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Right?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
No?

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
I'm trying to be Mythbusters about this.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Where in San Francisco?

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
This is Mythbusters territory.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
It's a final season.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
The idea is that they're in Times Square

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
and they're wearing these things under their pants

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
and they're freezing outside.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
You're right, you're right.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Okay, so the control is that we're doing a male

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and female experiment right now.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
It doesn't crinkle.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
We have a question.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Dan, does it crinkle?

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
We have a question from the front.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
Actually, it feels really nice.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I can't tell it from...

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Unless I touch it with my hand,

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
I can't tell it from comfortable underwear.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
I'm glad that you're asking questions.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
Actually, it's notable how comfortable they are.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
It actually feels nice.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Calvin Klein.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Because my big thought is...

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
Is it true that adults can wear these

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
and then you can...

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
Could you wail into your pants?

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
Just for one fucking pee, for instance.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Dan, the night is young, baby.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
We're going to find out.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Because it doesn't feel like it would hold anything.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Alright, well, I can't do it yet.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Take this shit.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
Oh, yeah.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Shit on the floor.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Podcast shit.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Podcast shit.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Podcast shit.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Podcast shit.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
I will clear.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
I will clear the Swedish-American haul, you guys.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Okay, so...

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
We're going to win that webby.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
What's your name, young lady?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Lindsay.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Lindsay, would you go take a seat with your diaper?

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
If you start to feel like you're ready to take a piss,

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
you can come up on stage and...

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Okay.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
I feel like this gives me an extra drink during the show.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I mean, like, it'll hold one.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I mean, I need one, too.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Let's thank Lindsay, and we'll see her in a little bit.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah.

54:56.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Yeah, this shit is about science.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
We did it.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Okay, so...

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
So then...

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
Oh, and it's night when you sit, it's like a Nike.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
It's like a gel pad.

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
I just felt like a...

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Now, I'm taking a shit right now.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
I'm not going to poop in them, but I am really curious,

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
like, can an adult pee in an adult diaper just hang out?

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
I am curious about that.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
Has anybody here successfully peed in an adult diaper?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Oh, the hands go up.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Yeah, people have.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Yeah.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
What matter?

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Say it louder.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
After you pee, it feels weird and it's really heavy,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
and it starts to sag.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It starts to sag.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
Okay, wait.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Hang on.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Hang on.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Everybody, I want to completely...

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Dad, bless me.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Can I get...

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
The Ben Franklin of the most obvious statement about...

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
I was like, we needed to hear her say that,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
but I was like, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
She said, after you pee...

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
It gets real heavy.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
It gets real heavy, and it gets heavy, and it starts to sag.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Can we get complete Swedish-American house silence

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
by applause?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
And I don't want ironic applause.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
Actual people who have peed in a diaper in public.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
That's nine people.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Yeah.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Okay.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
So that's for real.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
So we're going to...

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Now we got that cooking, and I swear,

56:42.000 --> 56:46.000
if I have to pee, I'm going to fucking let it go,

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
and I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you I'm doing it.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Did you bring extra pants just in case?

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
No.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
I just didn't rub back my pants.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
No, because I'm not a hack.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
It's a real...

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
I'm not Chris Angel.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
I'm a fucking magician.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
I'm not an illusionist.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
I do fucking magic, okay?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
When I make the Statue of Liberty go away,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
it fucking goes.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
Your huddled masses don't know where they are.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Did I tell you guys, as I was saying in the podcast,

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
when I was 10 years old,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear,

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and I didn't know.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
I turned off the TV, and I was like, huh.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
I don't know if he should have done that.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Yeah.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And it was like two days later that my...

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
He made it come back, you dick.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
All right.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Listen.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I know what you guys are thinking.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Okay, well...

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
No, I mean, yeah.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I know what I'm thinking.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I'm thinking how close are you to peeing your pants

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
and proving this is...

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Listen, I don't want to disappoint you guys,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
but I'll drink as much as I can.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Maybe somebody bring up a bottle of water.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Can we get dead nine ice teas?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
If there's a bottle of water or something,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
because I don't want anybody to be pissed off.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
I'll piss my pants.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Dusty roads.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Well, that happens.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I want to talk to somebody.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
She tweeted me.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Amber, are you in the audience?

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Amber?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Amber, you're not here?

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Amber, do you have cold feet now?

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Do you want to come up and talk?

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
You can come up?

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Okay, Amber.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Okay, come on up, Amber.

58:24.000 --> 58:42.000
All right.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
This is soundtrack.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Hey, Amber.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.000
So, are you going to have a seat here?

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
There you go.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
All right.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
Amber, let's get ready to fucking hairpin turn.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
That's what Harmontown's tonality is about.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
It's not that bad.

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
Amber is fresh, fresh off of a double mastectomy.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Yep, on Monday.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Monday.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
So, tonight is Saturday.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
And you're like...

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And one of the things you warned me about is like,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
well, I'm going to be whacked out on drugs,

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
because you're like...

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
This is not an outpatient procedure, is it?

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Oh, no.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
It's like you're recovering.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Right.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I'm still really sore, and I'm still on a bunch of drugs.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
And you have a knit cap on.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Yeah, it's from chemo before.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Right.

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
So, there's so many things that I don't understand about this,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
and I guess one of the first things is like...

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
So, when they detect it, they try to treat it

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
the way they do regular cancer with chemotherapy,

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
which is just like to flood your body with chemicals and stuff.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
And so, that makes your hair fall out,

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
and makes you sickly and sad and bummed out.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Yeah.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Are you in a relationship?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Yeah.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Husband?

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No, just a long-time boyfriend.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Like, how long ago did this...

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Dan, can I interrupt?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
How did you guys meet each other?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Like, how do you know each other?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
On Twitter, like, eight minutes ago.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Like, I was just like, I'm coming to San Francisco,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and she's like, that's what's great about Twitter.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So, take us, if you will,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and tell me when you don't want to talk about stuff or do.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:35.000
But, like, go back to before anything was happening,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
any of this, and how long ago was that?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
October.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Of this year?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Yeah.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I think maybe at the end of September,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I started feeling like a weird feeling,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and so I started feeling around,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
and I felt a lump, and I went into the doctor,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and they did all the scans and things.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Can you tell me when you say,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I started feeling a weird feeling,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and then I felt a lump.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
What is the weird feeling?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Just, like, something not normal,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
like a small, like, twinge of pain.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Like, when you washed, or...

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
No, no, just not...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I wasn't touching it at all.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Oh, just like, oh, you're feeling like, like, like, like...

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yeah, just like a little pulse,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
every once in a while.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And so then you started, like, investigating.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yeah.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And then you feel a lump.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Yeah.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And so then you go into the doctor,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and they go, okay.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And so, okay, can you take us from there

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
through the narrative?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
We did all the scans and biopsies,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and it came back,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
the test results came back,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
that it was invasive ductal carcinoma,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and they said that they wanted to start out with chemo,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and I did that,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
but I only went through three cycles,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
because it made me so sick that I was just tired of it,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
so I said, let's just go ahead and do the surgery.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Okay, so, and at that point,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
so chemo is an attempt to, like...

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Shrink it down.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And the end game,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
there's this sort of, like, elephant in the room

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
of, like, the mastectomy, right?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Like, it's breast cancer.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Is that how it works?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That they're like, let's try all these things

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
that we have to try before we do the mastectomy.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Is that the idea?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah, usually,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
because sometimes they can just go in

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
and take out that one little bit,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
but then there's a chance that it could have spread

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
to the rest of your body,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
so that's the way they want to do the chemo,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
to get everything.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And yours was double,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
so at some point, you're finding out that it's...

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
No, no.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
It's just I have so much family history

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
and I don't want to have to go through chemo again,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
so I said just take them both.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Right.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It makes it easier.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Did you detect it in October?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It was late September, maybe.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But you detected it pretty early, you think,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
or do you think that you got...

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Yeah.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Yeah, and so you said, let's just do it.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Yeah.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You got to do it before it spreads.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And thank you so much for coming up here

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
and talking about this.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
This is the thing that we're becoming conscious of

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
in our culture, like as celebrities

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
and the other thing is we have to wait for celebrities

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to go through it and all this stuff,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
but it's like...

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Because I'm 43 years old.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I remember in the 80s, like...

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Like, this is not a new thing,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
but what's new is the idea that we're allowed to talk about it.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And the thing that's very...

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
This mind field that I want to wander into,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
if you're willing to with me, is like...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Because I don't understand women's relationships

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
with their breasts.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And I...

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
How the mastectomy affects that,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
because I don't understand where your relationship

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
with your own breasts ends

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
and where it feels like those are a connection

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
to other people or...

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And I'm a terrible interviewer,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
but I'm just like, I want...

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
What I want is for somebody to talk about

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
or just educate me about what...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Because there's no analogy.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Men have prostate cancer.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Men have testicular cancer.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But we can walk around with one ball.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
And I have a ton of friends who are,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
and they feel great about it.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And there's no such thing as like...

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It's like...

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I always wondered about that,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
just like from 13 years old,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
this focus on these things.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Can I stop talking and you start talking?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Sure.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Actually, when they went in and took everything out,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
they also put in this deflated balloon

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
that's called a tissue expander.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
And after everything heals,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
they're going to start to slowly fill it up with saline

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
so it stretches.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Like every couple of weeks, you go in

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
and they add a little more.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Once it gets up to about the right size,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
they can just swap it out and swap it in

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
with like a permanent replacement.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So...

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Okay, well, I...

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm not going to have the, you know,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
that issue that you're talking about.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Amber, do you know, like,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
are you out of the woods right now?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Are you waiting to find out, like,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
if you're clear or in remission or anything?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Well, everything they took out of me,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
they sent to a lab.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So we, I guess, were waiting to see

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
what the lab asked us to say.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
That's amazing.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
That's really good.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I had a friend whose mother went through this

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and, like, there was...

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
It was there after math?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
It sounded like there's stuff

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
that needs to be done to be candid about it.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Like, my friend had to help her mom,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
like, extract, like, pus, liquid.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Oh, yeah, I have drains.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I have four drains, but...

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Sorry, say it again.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Drain?

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Drain.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I'll show you if you're not afraid of blood.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Well, I am afraid of blood.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
He'll pass out.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Okay.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yeah, I'm very squeamish,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
but, and I wouldn't be podcast-worthy,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
but the...

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You're writing diapers, Dan.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
But the personal experience,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
does your husband have to help you?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
No, I can do it just fine.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And there's drainage that has to happen

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
in the aftermath of the amputation.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I'm kind of tapped out of, like,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I really want...

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Like, I...

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You were saying, like,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
so now they're gonna, like,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
now they're putting balloons in

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
and they're inflating these things.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Are they gonna tattoo?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Is there a tattoo thing they do on the...

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Well, actually, they were able to save all the skin.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
There's a new procedure, so...

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Uh-huh.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
They were able to save all the skin.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Oh, so now you're gonna walk out of this

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
with, like, porn star movies.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I could.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Yeah, possibly.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Okay.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Well, fuck you.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Get out of here.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Try to come up here and...

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
People are dropping $10,000 for those things.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Uh...

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
He's there.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I mean, I...

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
So it's pretty amazing.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Like, my mom, like, she had uterine cancer

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and she didn't talk about it,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and she died of it.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Like, and...

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But when she finally, when we knew she had cancer,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
it was in her brain.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And that was because you didn't talk about it,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
because that was a personal thing.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And, like, I like...

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
As...

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I mean, I hate cancer.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
It makes me angry to even, like, talk about it.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Jeff...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
As opposed to bold stance...

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
The hard line.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It's a bold stance.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I, Jeff Davis...

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Tonight on the hard line with Jeff Davis...

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Hey, up yours, cancer.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
But, like...

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
But...

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Exactly.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
But, like, it's...

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
It's, like...

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
What's amazing is that, like, people can, like, have...

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Like, when they're young, like, you get it,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
talk about it, and, like, it's...

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Like, they...

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
My mom didn't do it.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And it's, like, makes me really, like...

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Like, want to break down in tears, like, happily,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
that, like, people can talk, like,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
get in front of it.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Like, get out in front of that.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It's very, very cool.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Is this still the number one way

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
that...

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Have you become a cancer expert

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
in the...

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
In the interim?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I know people who get cancer,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
and then they become cancer experts.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Do you... Not so much.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Not so much.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Like, I remember back in the 90s,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
it was, like, the number one killer of women.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I don't know if that's changed.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And if it's something to high-five about or not.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Like, if it's the number two killer of women now.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Uh...

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
But, uh...

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
All right.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Like, get your own podcast.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
You know?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
What aren't we doing?

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Is there...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Like, just in terms of, like...

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Well, here's something I'm really curious about.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It's because you say,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
well, just take the other one out.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Like, I don't know if I can deal with this anymore.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Like, what are the...

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
With that kind of cancer,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
is that typically the end of it all?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Or do you have to live with that shadow

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
in your doorway forever?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Um, well, there's chances that it could come back

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
or something else could come back.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
But without any tissue there,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
there's nothing for it to really grab onto.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But I guess there's always a chance,

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
but I'm not worried.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Is there a...

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
How...

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Uh...

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I don't want to make fun of them for applauding that,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
but I also, like, they'll make fun of me

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
for so many things.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
But, um...

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
What...

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
What...

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
What in...

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Like...

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Like, what...

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
When you're...

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
When you...

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So you get that tinge,

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
and then you get that diagnosis,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
then you're confronting that threshold.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Where you're going, like,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
holy shit,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
the stakes just got way higher.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Like, are there things that changed in your life,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
like, fundamentally?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Like, details?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Like, anything?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Like, I started feeling differently about my stapler,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
my car,

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
my garage,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
my dog.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Anything that you can think of that was, like, a flip?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
No, mostly I was just in a hurry

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
to get it all out of me

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
and taken care of.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I was just in a rush to make sure it was all gone.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And it all went really, really fast.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
It sounds like...

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Are you close with your family?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Like, do you have, like...

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Was your family there for you?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Or was that not a factor?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Um...

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Over the phone.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I mean, they all live in Indiana, so...

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But I've been talking to them, of course.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Do you feel like you went through,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
like, just on your own,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
or with friends or family?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
With my boyfriend.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Really? That's awesome.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Good for him. Is he here?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Yep.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
What's his name?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Keegan.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
What?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Keegan.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Keegan. Good for you, Motherfucker.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
That's amazing.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Like, I've had friends that went through all alone,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
and they did it all on their own.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
And then their family came back around,

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
but, like, when they went through the hard part of it,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
like, that first stage of,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
oh, shit, what's going on?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
They were completely on their own.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
But it's awesome to have...

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Well, because sickness,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
like, we have this really fucked up,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
like, it's an individual thing.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
What would you remember?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I mean, when you were...

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Did you have relatives that got sick

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
in any way before that?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Oh, yeah.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
You handled that with a plum.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
You were, like, by their bedside.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And, like, it was...

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Sickness was a part of life,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and you were fine with that.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And so...

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And so you had a support system

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
when this happened,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
and, like, you didn't have issues with that.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Like, I don't want people to see me sick.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Well, I mean, I don't like people to see me

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
when I look terrible.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I don't want them to feel bad about me

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
because I don't feel that bad about myself.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Are you from San Francisco?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
No, I'm from Indiana originally.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Oh, but you're living here?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Yeah.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
What are you doing here?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Just hanging out.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I run a donut shop,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
and I don't want this to be my commercial.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yeah, I mean, you don't have to divulge anything about yourself.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Just curious what you do for a living.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
My boyfriend went to school here,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
so he moved here while he was going to school.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
What's he going to school for?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Game programming.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000
What is this?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Are you a nerd shaming her heroic boyfriend?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
No, I know.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I know I was nerd drooling.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I was like, that's a keeper.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Oh, gosh, I thought you were mocking him.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You thought I was going like, oh, what a nerd.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And I work with cats.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You work with cats?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Yeah.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Like actual feline cats?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Yeah.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
In what capacity?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
A cat boarding facility.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Oh.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Cat boarding facility.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Yeah, I'm the one that can get through to all the really angry and grumpy cats.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Is it a private business that you could benefit from plugging?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Can people that are listening to this?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Oh, sure.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Yeah, so if you live in the area, if you need your cat boarded.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Oh, yeah, pet camp, cat safari.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Pet camp, pet safari.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Cat safari.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Did I get that right or did I just fucking up?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Pet camp.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Pet safari?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Cat safari.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Cat camp.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
No, god damn it, you're fucking it up.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Cat camp.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
He's doing it on purpose.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Right?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
See, he's, let's see.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Okay, first two words are pet camp.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Pet camp.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
The last two words are cat safari.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Dan, do you want to try a little jingle for it?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Pet camp, cat safari.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
When you're going near or far, drop off your cat.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Pet camp, cat safari.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Oh shit, I fucked it up again.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Pet camp, cat safari.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Is that right?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Yep.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Okay.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Pet camp, cat safari.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Whether you're going near or far, drop off your feline friend at us.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
We'll put her in a tub and we'll rub off her puss.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
If your cat doesn't have puss, don't worry, that's fine.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:13.000
We'll also just feed her and breakfast and dine.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000
We'll wave a little mice in front of its face.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Pet safari camp.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Camp.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Cat safari.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Pet camp, cat safari.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Pet camp, cat safari.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Is in your face.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Okay, let's give a very extremely amber warm-up.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Thank you to Amber.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Thank you so much.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Make sure she's...

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Also, Keegan, cool boyfriend.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Thank you, Keegan.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Ah look, wait.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Don't diminish Keegan.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Keegan could have phoned it in.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
We don't know if he's a good boyfriend or not.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
We have no idea.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Let's be real.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
We'll find out three months from now.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Dan, I'll bring Keegan up here and give him a diaper.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
We'll find out.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Oh wait, wait, wait.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
No, but I just...

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I'm telling you, when somebody like Amber...

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Amber tweeted me and I was like,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
oh fuck, we've got to bring her up.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I just heard a plum.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I don't even think...

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
I just like...

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I just have to unplug my heart from the whole fucking thing.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And I knew that she had to be up here.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But I was just like...

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I don't know how to fucking process that shit.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But she's fresh out of the fucking process.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And I have no idea...

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
What's that?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That's a corner of a carpet.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Who am I?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
What am I talking about?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I mean, you're fascination with it.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
A lot of your questions about it, Dan.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
They're clearly...

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You want to know what you're worried about yourself.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
So you can't help but internalize.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
When you see somebody going through that,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
you wonder what you would be like going through that yourself.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I always want to know.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
When people tweet me or email me and stuff,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
and they go, I have this or I'm going through that.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I always want to talk to them because,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
yeah, I'm fucking cowered.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I haven't had problems yet and I'm terrified.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
If you found out tomorrow that you came down with some horrific...

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I would make it everyone's problem.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I would wipe my ass across America.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And go like, I got a tennis elbow.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Go to my GoFundMe.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I'm not saying if you have a GoFundMe, that's not...

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Those are good.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
There's a guy back there that...

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I hope that's Rod Funches.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's not Rod Funches.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Don't be sorry.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I want everyone in the world to laugh that cleanfully.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Don't be sorry that you're not Rod Funches, sir.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Be sorry that you have that laugh and aren't Rod Funches.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I was on a plane...

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I was on the Southwest flight from Burbank to Oakland with Rod Funches.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
He slept the whole time, didn't giggle once.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yeah, yeah. Fuck you, Funches.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It's all an act. You know it's all an act.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
He doesn't really giggle. He doesn't actually like people.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
He's filled with whatever the opposite giggles is.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Hey, I'm going... Funches is doing a show tomorrow.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
He's at Cobbs, I think, 11 a.m.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
He's making mimosas and he's serving brunch.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And he's not... I don't think he's calling it brunches with Funches.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
It is? Is that what it's called?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Okay, I'll see you all there. We're all going to that.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Spencer, did I do the double mastectomy lady interview, right?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Yeah, okay.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You're just supposed to bring the person up and let them tell their story, right?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
I didn't do it wrong.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I mean, you know.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I was a little heavy-handed. I was heavy-handed.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
You were high-handed.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
What are you yelling out, sir?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Yell it out again.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Not you. I was looking over there.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
That guy. Pussy.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
We're all fine.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Now what did you yell out?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
No, he's good. Now he's doing it again. People are like, fighter flies.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
He only said it over a laugh, so you'll never know what he said.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Yeah, he's like, he rides in on the fucking laughs of others.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Oh, well, the 9-11 was an inside job.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
What was that, sir?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah, I didn't know.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
He said, just hurry up and crack your pants.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
This guy came for the pants building.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Let's be clear. I am not shitting my pants.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
And I don't think that these things are designed to hold shit.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Well, Dan, how do we know?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
We're here as a scientific experiment.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I asked for what? Oh, there it is.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I guarantee, I promise you, what time is it?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
How much time do we have?

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
11.40?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I promise you, I will piss my pants tonight.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That is the Harmontown guarantee.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Dan went for himself. How much do you guys pay?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Okay, yeah, you guys are fine.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I don't even want to know.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Whatever it is, I'll give it back to you outside.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
How about this? If Dan's rich, if Dan doesn't pee himself in front of you people,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
he'll write you all a personal check outside.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Spencer, that was the biggest yawn I've ever seen.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Spencer, how are you holding up, man?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You guys hear about these Chinese murder vans?

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:03.000
No, seriously, though, you guys hear about these dick switches?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
What's a dick switch?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Let me tell you, Jeff, it's a switch for your dick.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
It turns your sperm on or off.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
It shuts your sperm right off.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
That seems too bad or good to be true.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Well, let me tell you, a sub-dermal switch right in your scrotal sac.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I saw the Facebook diagram of the whole thing.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Oh, yeah.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I mean, what if they're taking it?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Hey, baby, let's go to my place.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Oh shit, let me turn these sperms off real quick.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
It's the new equivalent to wearing a condom to a party, right?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
We all did that, right?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
In college.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I don't want my fertility to be a binary decision.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I want there to be an air scoop on the top of my dick

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
that a warboy can spit gasoline into.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
No.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
No.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Just in case.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I want my sperm to look like the warboy that was the guitar player

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
in front of the thing that was on the bungee cords.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Thank you, lady.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I don't know what you said, but I'm sure you're right.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000
How many women in the audience, by applause, have...

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I don't even know if this is still the phrase.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
This is the phrase my mom used.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Have your tubes tied.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
That's guys.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah, it's hard.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
No, it's not.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
That's men.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
No, I'm talking about having your tubes tied.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It's a lot rougher on women.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I heard nothing from out there.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
What?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I'm sorry, what?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Yeah, it's really hard.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Oh.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
You tried?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I thought that was like a common thing.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
My mom, like...

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You can get a hysterectomy, right?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Isn't that even easy?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You tried to have your tubes tied, but it didn't take?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Yeah, you have to have had a shit ton of children.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Okay.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Oh.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Descent.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Oh.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Well...

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
In...

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Two tubes enter, one tube leaves.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
A spindle wheel.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Oh, nice.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Two in life.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:40.000
A spindle wheel, oh, nice.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Two enlightened post-reproductive women enter.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
One leaves ashamed of herself.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
But you're a raggedy man.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
How many...

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Well, calm down.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
How many men in the audience have...

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Think that picture is fuel.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
That's not the end of the question, you fucking...

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000
You special-ness addicted millennial.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Wait, wait, no, stop.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Oh, shit.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I said how many men in the audience are...

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It's gonna have to be harder than that.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
One Gen Xer, one millennial.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
No, I was gonna say, how many men in the audience have had a hysterectomy?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Yeah, same guy.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
So you were getting the leap on that, okay, I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
He knew where it was going.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
But also, he had his male tube...

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000
You clapped your hands with the vehemence of somebody who's very happy that you did that, right?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Yeah.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
You had a sperm extraction?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
What is that?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
What...

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I mean, I know what that sounds like, but what does that mean?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It sounds amazing.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I had one today on Southwest Flight 2550.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So you have some sperm on the side just in case.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And the freezer, your freezer or somebody else's freezer?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Just next to the peas?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
All right, sir, so what I wanna ask is the vasectomy,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000
my understanding is you're snipping the conduit between the apparatus is generating sperm

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
and the apparatus is shooting it out, right?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Yeah.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:37.000
So that means that anytime you want, we're losing a lot of people.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Those guys are Mormons.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And anytime you want post vasectomy, you could go in like five years after a vasectomy

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
and say, I want a sperm extraction, right?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Is that yes or no?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Right, but yes.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I'm just saying, you keep making sperm, yeah, and so you could...

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
The thing that's...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Okay, so all right, well, you've had vasectomy.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Are you by any chance just willing to come up just for a second and just talk?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Okay.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Does that matter?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I just have a couple of vasectomy questions.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And perdiperon?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Very, very light applause because people don't wanna make it a competition between them

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
with a double mastectomy, lady.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
You don't want...

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Yeah, it's like, he's not John Henry, he got a fucking vasectomy.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I understand, but you don't have to make him feel like a fucking pariah.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
We've moved on to a different segment.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
My name's Matt.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I played D&D with you guys last time we were there.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Oh, shit.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Hello, Matt.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I have face blindness.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
All right.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000
It's called alcoholism.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
So vasectomy.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Okay, so just like, okay, so your balls keep making sperm.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And then the...

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
We lost Jeff.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
If I can't have a podcast and just learn what I need to learn.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So your balls keep making sperm.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Yes, they keep making sperm.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
So when you come, here's my...

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
You come just as I'm sperm in it.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So the sperm is just sitting there and it just doesn't get dropped in so that it gets sent out.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Doesn't that terrify you?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
No, it's fine.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
It's great.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
It's great.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
What terrifies you, Dan, about that?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Because I'm a child, I feel like I'm a third grader.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
What terrifies you?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Because I feel like they're down there and they wanna go out.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Oh, so you feel sympathy for those trapped sperm?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I feel like, no, I don't feel sympathy for them.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I've certainly never done them any favors.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
It's safer in there.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I've never been a benevolent God.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I, on the other hand, don't want them hanging out.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
They don't last very long, right?

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Sperms live and die very short.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
And they just hang out and die all the time.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And it's the fluid that constitutes your cum.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Seminole fluid.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I love it.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
That's not coming...

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Who's yelling shit out?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
It primarily comes from the seminal vesicle in the cowper's gland.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
It's just up in your body.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
It's not in your balls.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Your balls are like the factory where these little sperm cells are made.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And you can just let that factory keep going,

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
and then you're cutting off the assembly line.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It's just like, oh, that's where the Prius is made.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But you're just like, keep making that Prius.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And it's like, they don't care.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It's not gonna rust and hurt you.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
That's correct.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So it's still making great sperm all the time.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Awesome.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And now I have some on ice.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Oh, yeah, that was a great high five.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
That was the weirdest high five I've ever seen in my life.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Well, I had a cap in my hand.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
All right, well, okay.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
But I just thought, okay, so here's the...

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Okay, one more question.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
One more question.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Okay, so you're talking about snipping a line.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Okay, so these sperm are used to going up through a tube.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Are they still trying and then hitting a shape?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
They just don't go anywhere.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So I had a vasectomy and I was 27.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
So it was a long, long time ago and you can get them reversed

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
or you can do an extraction, which is...

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
What happened to the sperm when you're coming?

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
The sperm are going like...

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
No, they're just...

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Here we go, boys.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
We've been waiting for this for our whole lives.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And then they go and they're like, ah, fuck.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
There's a wall.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You tell me they don't get angry and like...

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Then they die and they cry and it's very sad.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And the new ones get made the next day.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Sperm don't think, though, like at all.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
That's what my bumper sticker says.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Sperm don't think.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
All right.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Okay.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Do you want an adult...

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Spencer, if sperm did think...

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
What do you think a sperm would say?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Um, let's go.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
That's absolutely...

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Yeah.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Follow that guy.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I got a fascinating of a sperm like...

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
The average sperm, if you ejaculate inside a woman,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
like there's hundreds of millions of sperm,

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I think there's like a certain number.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And there's like the statistical number of them

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
that they get distracted by like calcium deposits.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Because they look like eggs.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Isn't that adorable?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Like they're on their way to the fallopian tubes

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
and they're like, look, there she blows.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And they're like, it's just like, dude, it's just a fucking like...

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's just a deposit on the side.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I think that's adorable.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Because it's like, they're little men.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I think that's funny that they're like,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
well, I'll do anything to accomplish my goal.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But they have the numbers and so they get it done.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
But they don't.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
They all die and it's funny.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Matt, funny.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Why at 27 did you have that done?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So I got married when I was 22

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and had a daughter when I was 27

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
and decided not to have more kids.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So I got a vasectomy.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And then 12, 13 years later got divorced.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
And my fiance and I are going to have kids.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Wow.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Have you already?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
No, no.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
So my sperm is on ice.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And at some point that'll happen in the future.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
You can see at Lincoln Center in Washington, D.C.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
It's a big sperm on ice.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.000
My sperm is on ice.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
My sperm is on ice.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Let it go.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Let it go.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I have an annual subscription.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I have to keep paying them like Netflix.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
All right.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I forgot your first name again.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Matt.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Let's thank Matt, the vasectomy from Pleasant.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
All right.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
We've clearly had a...

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
We've got to start now.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
You see what we did, Jeff?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
We took this show across a threshold.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
We went down a road of trials.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
We met with certain truths.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
We atoned with fucking death and resurrected.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
We met with the goddess of...

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Who was the...

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
What would you say the goddess point of this?

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
The diapers.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
The diapers.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Yeah.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I'm almost...

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I don't want to excite people, but I'm like,

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I need a little more time.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And then I feel like,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
I know I can pee in my pants.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Dan, we believe in you.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
But I'm going to need another one of these,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
whoever it is.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Dan, like, if I'm...

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Oh, let's do a...

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You know what we should do?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
What?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
A push?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
A push?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Push.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I wasn't...

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I wasn't looking for ways to pee.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
But I thank you.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
You know what we should do?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
There's...

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I'm 43 years old and I'd never tried pushing.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
No, I was going to say we could do a Q&A,

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
because we're never in San Francisco, but...

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
A Q&A?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
That sounds fantastic.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I'm not being sarcastic.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
That sounds good.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
All right.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Should I facilitate?

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Well, there's no...

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000
There's probably not a...

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I guess probably a wireless mic is...

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
No, but what we could do is we could maybe like have...

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I could find people...

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Do we know...

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Do we have a wireless mic here?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
No.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I mean, I really fucked everything up by saying Q&A.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Yeah.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Let's...

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Okay.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Back to the drawing board.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
No, but what...

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
You know what we should do.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Dan, Dan, I could make a Q&A happen, believe me.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I could make this happen.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I don't...

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
But I was only doing that because I didn't have anything else to do,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
but I could think of other things.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Oh, I have another thing I want to try.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Are you going to pee?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
No, no, no, no.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
What?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
He's going to be mid-conversation and be like,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Oh, it's happening.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
All right.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
There's one thing.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
One thing.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I don't think...

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Adam, I don't think...

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You're Steve.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I'm sorry.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
I don't...

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Who's Adam?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Adam is a kid he drowned in camp.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
That you look exactly like,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
which is why he's always so nice to you.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Dan, what was your idea?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
My idea...

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Well, I just...

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I know I had one.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
I saw it straight out of Compton.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Did you guys see it straight out of Compton?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
And then weren't you...

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Well, you were watching it?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Were you like,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
This is great.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I love learning about the hip-hop founding fathers.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Oh, there's EZE.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Oh, he was so hard.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Oh, Dr. Tray seemed rather innocent.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Oh, there's Ice Cube.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Oh, apparently he was the genius of the group.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
There's some guy named DJ Yella.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
There's some other people.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Boy, that...

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Oh, EZE.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Oh, boy, he...

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Man, he really did bad.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Oh, yeah.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
He's evil.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Oh, he's evil.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Oh, he got AIDS.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Boy, that Dr. Tray and that Ice Cube...

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I never actually knew.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000
They were great rappers.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And great people, too.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I didn't know that.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I didn't know that about those people.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And then the credits go.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
It's like produced by Ice T and Dr. Tray...

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Ice Cube and Dr. Tray.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And I was like,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Well, that seems a little unfair.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Are you saying you want a freestyle right now?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
No.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I'm saying...

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
How would Ice T feel about that film?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I mean, if you really want to blow everybody's minds,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
when you start peeing, you have to rap while you're peeing.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You have to freestyle.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
You're saying I have to create a new character called Ice P?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I say, yeah.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I'm gonna...

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
From the streets.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I want to put a beat on while your pants get peed on.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Yo.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Yo, man.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
If I pee in my pants,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
it's not about urination.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's about coronation.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Coronation.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It's about grand fucking...

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
shit.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I was...

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I mean, do you want a beat?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Or are you just talking...

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
No, I wanted to...

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Mr. T, if I can interrupt you.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Honestly, I understand you trying to be respectful,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
but when you call me Mr. T,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
there's another guy that's called that.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Oh, is that a spot of contention,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
where you don't like being called Mr. T?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
There's certain things being worked out

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
in small claims court.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Is it not true that he was Mr. T

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
before you were Ice T?

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I mean, it doesn't...

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Hey, look, man.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Columbus was American before Muhammad Ali,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
but I know who I'm betting on.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
In the third round.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Objection.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Objection, Your Honor.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Made no sense.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
It ain't...

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Sustained.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
This is in court, motherfucker.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
This is business.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
All right.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
In a couple minutes,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I'm gonna urinate in my adult diaper.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I can feel it.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I can feel it.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
But I never got that second water, so...

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Your fault if the show goes too long.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
We're gonna stay here.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I don't care if we're here until Thursday.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
You're gonna fucking wet your son.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
He might can't do it.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Is that it?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Nope.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Somebody give me a water.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Thank you, baby.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Oh, shit.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Thank you.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Let's have a hand for...

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Any personal...

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
She didn't give me that water for personal reasons.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000
This is business.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
This is the digestive business.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Small intestine.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Absorbs water.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
But most of it makes it through your ass.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Comes out your urethra.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.000
As your muscles deteriorate past the point when Darwin's laws expected you to live.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Hopefully that extra waste can be absorbed by a competent weather.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Let me finish.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I have a question, I see.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
How do kidneys work?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Oh, shit.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000
No, kidneys are like the police, you know?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I always try to filter everything, you know?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Like, you take in liquids and all the impurities?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Shit.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Your kidneys are there to rustle them up, put them over the hood, read them their rights,

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
take them to jail, treat them nicely.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
What's the difference between a kidney and a liver?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Shit.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Talk about the difference between the local police and the Department of Justice.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Sometimes the liver needs to create a commission of oversight,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
as in the case of Rodney King in Los Angeles.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
The liver had to come in and say,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
yo, kidney, what are you doing?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Well, you need a temporary injunction.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
What is it?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
What turns out?

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Turns out a lot of people, it's not a popular thing to say.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
But the LAPD is doing pretty well since then.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000
What is the function of the bladder then?

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000
The bladder just holds the pee, motherfucker.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
The bladder is just business.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Actually, I almost just peed a little bit.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
All right, okay, all right, just...

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Okay, everybody?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Now, he needs complete silence for this.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Thank you.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the MGM Casino and Hotel.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
And the Swedish American Home.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I'm proud to present.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
You're about to watch a man.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I will tell you the minute the liquid leaves.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I'm doing it.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Okay, I'm fucking pissing my pants.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Oh my God, I'm pissing.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I'm pissing right now.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
I'm pissing my pants.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I'm fully pissing my pants.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I'm pissing, I'm pissing right now.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Is it holding it?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Spin.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I'm still pissing, I'm pissing.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Are you telling me you can't see anything?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
That's just the fucking greatest.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Wait, I'm doing another...

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I'm pissing again.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I'm pissing again.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.000
You guys, this is fucking a game changer.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
What's that, sir?

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
I'm the Chuck Yanger peeing my pants, sir.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Yes, thank you.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I broke the fucking...

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I just fucking fully took a full piss in my pants.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
How heavy is the diaper?

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I'm just throwing you this.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Nothing.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
And I'm totally comfortable.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000
When you two go pee in your pants

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
and you want to hang out with me,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I'm gonna take you to the toilet.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I'm gonna take you to the toilet.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
I'm gonna take you to the toilet.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I'm gonna take you to the toilet.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I'm gonna take you to the toilet.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
You pee in your pants and you want to hang out.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I'm gonna do a free promotion.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Real fit.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Deep and real fit.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Looks fits.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Feels like real underwear.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Adjustment.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Real fit underwear.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Try a pair.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Where did it go?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Where did it go?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Where did it go?

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Go, go, go.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Wait, you're standing in line.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And you want to pee, just fine.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
You can pee in your pants and go.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You can pee anywhere you want.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
You can pee inside your pants.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And ladies, give it a chance.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Where do you want to break the gender barrier?

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
You can pee anywhere in here.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
She went for the balcony.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Got to pee. Take a pee.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Check it.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I mean, honestly, also, it's a box for a dollar.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
It's okay.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Say hello to everybody.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Thank you.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Thank you.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
It's fine.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000
The Swedish American hope for and doing what we did.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
That's fucking amazing.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Would like to thank our sponsors, the Oval Team.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
No, deep ins.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Cuckold crafts.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I just wailed in my fucking pants.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And there's Robbie and Nikki, Lindsay, Amber, Keegan, Matt.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Matt, thank you so much, everybody.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Are you still peeing?

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
No, no, well, I couldn't more, if you wanted to.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Spencer Quentin, Steve Levy.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Let's take a sandwich.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Let's go sketch while you're having us.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Jennifer and Nicole Stratten.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Are you still peeing?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yeah.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I can't because I put it all in here.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
How does it feel?

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
How does it feel?

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Normal.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Normal.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I could go get a loan right now.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
I could open a zoo.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
There's nothing.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I just pissed in my pants and I'm hanging out.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I could do anything.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I pissed in my pants and now I'm hanging out and dancing.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I pissed in my pants.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I could feel a little bit going down my leg.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
But that's not me.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
No, no, no.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
My name is MCP.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
IP where you can see.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I go in my diaper.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
You see?

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Going to hug to the front or to the east or the west.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
So I...

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Yeah.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
All right.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
We'll see you at the bar.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:04.000
I guess I'll just keep wearing these.
