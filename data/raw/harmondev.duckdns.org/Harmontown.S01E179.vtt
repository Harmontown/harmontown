just, and if you make it through that hour, fucking marry that person.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:23.000\nAnd if you don't keep doing this process until you've married somebody,\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:31.000\nand then the divorce rate will go to 0% within five years.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nIs the end game all about marriage?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:39.000\nI know, it's just I'm luring them in

14:34.000\nYo, that was my accident, but let's follow that trend.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nCuckold porn is when you watch,\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:43.000\nbut your wife is in the crotch with a guy,\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:48.000\nbut you're just using your eye, you're not using your dick.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:53.000\nYou don't know, you're just sick of fucking your wife,\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nand she's sick of fucking you,\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nand so she's fucking another guy, and you're watching.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nShe's cheating on you, and you're left there watching,\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nbecause you're a pussy, and you're spineless,\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nand you're powerless,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nand you just want to worship her sexuality,\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nand you know what, she's so fucking sexy,\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nyou can't imagine yourself fucking her.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nWhat could be hotter than that?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nIt's called cuckold porn.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:26.000\nHowever, there's this guy.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nI'd like to thank the Swedish-American hall\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nfor having us here tonight.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nI don't know how to describe guy.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nI think you described it quite eloquently.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:39.000\nBut there's this video that I want everyone to see,\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nand I...\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nBecause it's cuckold porn,\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:51.000\nbut your typical cuckold porn video is a guy will walk in\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nand go like, you owe me rent,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:57.000\nand the woman will go like, I can't pay the rent,\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nbut you must pay the rent.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nI don't have the rent, and then the guy will go like,\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nOh, pay the rent.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:09.000\nThat's the first cuckold porn.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nAll right.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:16.000\nOkay, so

today,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:35.000\nand there was like 90 television screens,\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nbecause our culture, our empire is like,\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nit's flushed with money,\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nand it's pumping electricity,\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:45.000\nand we have an international hub at the airport,\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nand there's all these plasma

--> 17:21.000\nif you're at a sports bar or an airport,\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nand there's enough screens statistically on accident,\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nthere's going to be starving African children on the screen,\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\non like a loop,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nbecause somebody's not paying attention,\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nand Tito's needs to be

like African kids going,\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.000\nand I was like watching it,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:48.000\nand I was thinking about it from a television producer's standpoint\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.000\nfor one second,\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\njust how in order to get that footage,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nyou have to get on a plane,\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nand you have to fly to Africa,\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:02.000\nand you have to get off the airport in Africa,\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:07.000\nand then you have all these bags of camera equipment.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nPlease,

volunteering,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nlike, I don't think they're like,\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nbut they're like, from the first world,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nand they're coming here, and

because of human nature,\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:41.000\nbut then as a producer, I'm also going to assume,\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:44.000\nobviously, they can't give them that food\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.000\nuntil they get their shots.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:52.000\nSo, I just said that there's, like,\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nten minutes of that whole thing.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nIt's

20:41.000\nto give them that kind of glimmer in their eye,\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:45.000\na key light, to make them seem like they're crying.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nDo you think they put, like, a granola bar\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:51.000\non top of the camera?\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.000\nI'm not, I didn't come here with him.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:56.000\nHe, he flew out of Burbank,\n\n20:56.000 -->

like,\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nall right, well, you get the idea,\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nthat there's, like, somewhere out there,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nthere's like an eight minute window where somebody's like,\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nlike, I'm gonna, well, remember that day\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:30.000\nthat we gave that kid a gum drop or whatever,\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:33.000\nand then it ruined the shot.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nLike, we're, and then in other words,\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nlike, we, there was less money came in.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nAnd like, so you have to actually,\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nlike, if you're the most benevolent person in the world,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nif you're a volunteer and you're working for that organization,\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:48.000\nyour job is to actually shoot starving people.\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:49.000\nRight.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:55.000\nAnd they cannot be fed while they're on camera.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:59.000\nYou, you fucking connect the dots that,\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:02.000\nthat I had to connect today.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:07.000\nYo, yo, yo.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nCynicism sometimes needs to be\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:13.000\nyanked up from the floor\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nand shoved into your face,\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:19.000\nbecause there's not enough bad things to feel bad about.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:22.000\nSo I have to go, like, hunting for the, like, the one.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:26.000\nNo, I was just thinking, it just, it just seems

children?\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nI forget.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nBecause there was, there was a through line there.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nThere's a cuckold porn video\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.000\nwhere a woman is sitting on her bed in a bathrobe\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:51.000\nand then the door opens, the bedroom door opens\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nand there's this guy comes in and

what's going on?\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nBecause like, she's, they're all porn actors\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:27.000\nand they've all been told to say certain things\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nat certain times, but it's already fucked up.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nAnd then there's like weird,\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nlike this guy comes in creeping in after the hoverboard guy\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nand he goes like, I gotta tell you, your husband,\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:42.000\nhe took to this thing like I've never seen\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nand it's just $700 and he,\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nand she's like, he can't pay for that.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nAnd he's like, oh, well, we don't need a car anymore.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nBeep, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:54.000\nAnd he keeps twirling around and then the,\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:56.000\nand then the guy is like, he's

and it just goes on and on.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nLike watching porn people who have never had\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\na single UCB workshop.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nLike, and you know, like the camera,\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nlike, you know, like the camera will just cut sometimes\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nbecause it's like, they're just in a circle.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:21.000\nIt's like, it's like the ants' death march of death.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nLike they don't know how to stop asking questions\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nand denying each other.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:27.000\nI can't do this.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:28.000\nWell, something's gotta be done,\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nbut I can't do this.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nAnd then it'll cut to like a slightly different angle,\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nbut it's a different time of day.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nAnd then they're like, okay, well, here,\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:36.000\nhow do we work this out?\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nBecause they've been like cattle prodded.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:42.000\nThe woman finally goes like,\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:47.000\nwell, there must be some way we can work this out.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:50.000\nBut then the guy is on the hoverboard\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:54.000\nand he's just like having a great time on the hoverboard.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\nAnd then the guy, the supposed alpha male,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nwho is not in control of the scene,\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nhe has, because they understand cuckold craft.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:05.000\nThey understand porn craft.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nThey don't understand stagecraft.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:11.000\nThey don't understand the effect of a fucking hoverboard.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nThis guy is not going to be the low status character,\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:16.000\nno matter what they do.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:19.000\nThis is the China syndrome of cuckold porn.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:23.000\nLike it is, they were fucked before they started\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:25.000\nand everyone in the scene is fucked.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nBut the guy sits on the bed and he goes like,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:30.000\nhuh, well, something's got to get worked out.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:33.000\nAnd the guy just keeps like backing into furniture.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nAnd he's like, and she goes like,\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nwell, I'd like to work it out.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:43.000\nAnd then the guy says, are you thinking how to work this out?\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nSame way I'm thinking.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:51.000\nHow to work this out?\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nThat's actual dialogue?\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\nThat's actual dialogue.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:59.000\nHe speaks in origami.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\nYou have to focus on the center of his palindrome\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nand it folds out and then you're like,\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\noh my God, he's a genius.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nThey go like, slavery, not a good thing,\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nbecause human, not a good thing,\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:16.000\nbecause then you're like, oh, wait, whoa, wow, whoa, my boy.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:17.000\nAnyways.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nWait, so what happens?\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nWell, I'll tell you what happens.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:23.000\nIs that Act One?\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nYeah, the crossing of the threshold is, of course,\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nthe guy's going to start fucking the woman.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:31.000\nBut the guy keeps backing into shit in the room\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\nand they keep getting startled and he's got all the status.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:37.000\nAnd then he starts having sex.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:40.000\nHe's going like, oh, I love my hoverboard.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nAnd then the alpha guy is like fucking his wife\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nand he tries to get it back by going like,\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:49.000\nmore like a nerdboard.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:52.000\nBut it's like, oh, no, you shouldn't even have tried.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nLike, he's fucking owning you.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:59.000\nLike, the guy is like, he's like, he's fucking great.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nWhat is the Act Two crisis?\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nWell, it's always like, then the woman\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:06.000\nand a good cuckold porn couldn't air quotes.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nI think the woman will go like, you get over here\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nand you suck his dick.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nWait, the guy hasn't got the hoverboard\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nand suck like the alpha guy's dick?\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:18.000\nThat's right, San Francisco.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:23.000\nLooks like someone came in a little higher than you.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nYou thought you were all impressed with yourselves.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nYeah.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\nMaybe I watched a couple dudes in a fucking girl\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:32.000\nand one guy sucked the other guy's dick tonight.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:35.000\nShe got like, suck that guy's dick or lick his balls.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nAnd then the guy gets on the bed and he goes,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nhe starts licking the other guy's balls\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:42.000\nbut he's like, he's looking off in the distance\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nand going...\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nAnd the look on his face,\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:52.000\nit looks like he's like a kid from Pet Cemetery.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:57.000\nLike, again, he's not low status.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nHe controls the room.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:03.000\nWait, the wife said, you lick his balls.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:06.000\nGet off the hoverboard and lick the alpha male's balls.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:09.000\nIn cuckold porn, there's not always the male on male thing\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nbut it's a typical of cuckold porn\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:15.000\nwhere the woman will say to the beta male,\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nshe'll go, now you do this.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:24.000\nAnd then this guy eventually starts blowing that guy.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nThat's the other hilarious part.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:31.000\nThen the alpha male always has this...\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nThe other guy is going down at him\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nand then the alpha male goes like,\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:41.000\nI don't know if I signed up for this.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:46.000\nLike, four bobs in.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nI don't know if I said,\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:52.000\nyeah, it's not a matter of paperwork at this point.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:55.000\nAnd that's a good thing and you should accept that.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:59.000\nLike, your hard on is all the pen and paper you need.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:02.000\nSo

freestyle.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:23.000\nWe were talking about New Year's Eve and Times Square\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:27.000\nand you were telling me that the people that crammed into Times Square\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:30.000\nfor New Year's Eve, they were diapers.\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:41.000\nSan Francisco is blown away again.\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:44.000\nSome people, you know, your

--> 31:09.000\nWe choose to harrump.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nThe harrumphing is they get the premise\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:12.000\nthey don't like where it's going.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nYeah,

kind of fashion thing.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nThat is suggestive.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nWere these knee blowouts on your jeans by design or by accident?\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nDo you wear those jeans so much that the knees actually gave out?\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nBoth.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:27.000\nThey were ripped when I bought them and they have become increasingly more

are you doing over there?\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nOh, great.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:35.000\nGreat, Jeff.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nI'm doing great.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:40.000\nI'm not going to use it.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:43.000\nYou're not going to check it?\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nNo, I'm not going to do it by myself.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nYou're not going to drink it by yourself?\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:51.000\nThis is like a Spice Girls thing.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.000\nI've got to get with your friends.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:57.000\nAll right, who's your posh spice?\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nWho's your BFF?\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nHe's there.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nHe?\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nIt's San Francisco, buddy.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nAll right, get him up here.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nGet him up here.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nThe he.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:07.000\nMale spice.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:08.000\nOld spice.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nPosh spice.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nCan you share that with me?\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.000\nCan you share that with Nikki?\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:16.000\nPosh, as I'm best known.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nAll right.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nI'm Rob.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nRob and Nikki, everybody.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nRob and Nikki.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:30.000\nRob and Nikki, if I may be so forward, what is the nature of your friendship relationship?\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nAre you guys just pals?\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nIs there a romance thing happening here?\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nNo, we bang.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:40.000\nYou bang.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:46.000\nNow, who plays the father and who plays the sister?\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nDo you guys role play?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:55.000\nDo you do role playing?\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nDo you want to take this one or should I take this one?\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:04.000\nI think we know who the bottom is in this relationship.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:05.000\nI'll take that by the way.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nWe're going to now.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nHe's asking for...\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nI'll take that while we're up here.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:14.000\nNow, do I make you another one and then...\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nShe's a white wine now.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.000\nI get something.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nI mean, this is...\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nAll right.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:21.000\nMake yourself useful, Dan.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:25.000\nI'm only doing this because you guys are the...\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:30.000\nI'm only doing this because you guys are the cultural capital of the United States.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:31.000\nYou're my favorite city.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nRob, how long have you been...\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nAre you guys are dating?\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:35.000\nYou're a couple.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nHow long has this been going on, Rob?\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:38.000\nA bit over a year.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.000\nYes, sir.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:40.000\nYeah?\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:41.000\nAnd do you guys live together?\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:42.000\nOr do you just live separately?\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:43.000\nNo, sir.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:46.000\nI live with her best friend.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.000\nThe plot...\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:48.000\nI love it.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:49.000\nThe plot thickens.\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:54.000\nWait, both of my best friends, the straight woman and the gay man.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.000\nHe lives...\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nCome and knock on our door.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:58.000\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:00.000\nNo, that got intricate.\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nWait, say that again.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:07.000\nHe lives with a gay man and a straight woman and both of them are my best friends.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:12.000\nCome and knock on our door.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.000\nHe lives with a gay man and your best friend, but you don't live with him.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\nNo.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nI'm just trying to purse through this, guys.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nI...\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nIs that vodka for me, Dan?\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:22.000\nNo, this is for Nicky, who took the first one.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nIt was like, I can't drink this without a friend.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nDan, make a fireman line.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nMake me a drink, too, you piece of shit.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:29.000\nGoddamn it.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:30.000\nAll right.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nWhile you're at it.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:32.000\nOkay.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:33.000\nAll right.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:34.000\nWell, cheers.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:37.000\nYeah, Nicky, I'll give it to you.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:38.000\nNicky, your turn.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:39.000\nTake the drink.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.000\nOh, is that mine?\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.000\nWas it Rob?\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nRob?\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nYeah.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nSorry.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:45.000\nCheers.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:46.000\nI don't know how to do a show.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:50.000\nI don't know how to do a show.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nOkay, there you go.\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:53.000\nOkay.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nOkay, so what the fuck were we talking about when you came up?\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nAsk him about Chemtrails.\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:58.000\nChemtrails.\n\n36:58.000 --> 36:59.000\nChemtrails.\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:00.000\nYou...\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:01.000\nChemtrails.\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:05.000\nWell, there's a mandate about Chemtrails.\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:06.000\nYeah.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nCouldn't fit all those chemicals on one of those little planes.\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:10.000\nAlso, Spencer.\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.000\nWait, what?\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nSo, I'm just interested.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:16.000\nWhat about Chemtrails?\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:21.000\nDan, you were talking about New Year's Eve and the fact that people can't pee, and she\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\ngoes, we get it.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:23.000\nWe're with you, mister.\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:27.000\nRight, but I think she was saying that we're all on board with, you can't...\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:32.000\nIn order to pee in Times Square, so people are, like, doubling down and going for it,\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nyeah.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nRight.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:35.000\nAnd it's bearing us from the explanation, though.\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:39.000\nNot, like, I'm not gonna wear a diaper, but if I have to pee, I'm gonna do it.\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:42.000\nNow, have you been to Times Square in New York before?\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:45.000\nI have not during New York.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nNew Yorkers.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nI have peed in Times Square.\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nYou peed in Times Square?\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:56.000\nJust walking in front of the Eminem story, he's like, fuck it, I gotta hang a squirt.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nThat's a new one.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nOh.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:04.000\nDan, let me tell you about my porn fetish.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:06.000\nIt's called squirthangers.com.\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.000\nDon't pee for it, Jeff.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:16.000\nNikki, when you say that you peed in Times Square, walk us through that, would you?\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nOh, boy.\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:21.000\nWell, we were in Times Square and drunk.\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.000\nRight.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:27.000\nIs this daytime or nighttime?\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:28.000\nThis is daytime.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nAt a girl.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nAnd we decided...\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nEat that mic, Nikki.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:34.000\nEat the mic?\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nYeah, just up here, yeah.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:40.000\nSo they can hear you.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:46.000\nDan also goes to mic-eaters.com.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:49.000\nSo I decided that I needed to pee.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:56.000\nAnd around Times Square, they don't let you do that, because obviously all the tourists want to.\n\n38:56.000 --> 39:03.000\nSo we decided we were going to head off to a side road and find a place to pee.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:07.000\nThere's no side roads in Times Square, though.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nIt's called 54th Street.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nI was drunk.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:16.000\nSo I walk off and try to do that, and I'm squatting, doing my thing.\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nAnd I look up and...\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nYou're up against a tree, or are you hiding in an alleyway?\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nI was up against a car.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nA car.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:29.000\nThere's a Times Square version of trees.\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:30.000\nSo you pee next to a car.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:34.000\nSo I'm up against a car peeing, and I hear, like, a tap.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:37.000\nAnd I look up, and there's people in the car.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:43.000\nNo!\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:45.000\nWhy are they in the car?\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nWhat are they doing in the car?\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nThey were parking.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:50.000\nHow dare they?\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:52.000\nAs one does.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:54.000\nLike, come on.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nExpect to get peed on.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nI want to get the full picture.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:04.000\nSo there's a street, they're doing a parallel parking thing, and you're next to the...\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:07.000\nIt seemed like a very suburban street.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:13.000\nI now, like, at Times Square, the suburbs...\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nJust off of Broadway, you know?\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nSuburbia, suburbia.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nBedroom, neighborhood, you know?\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nJust outside of Hedwig.\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nYeah, no.\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:28.000\nIf you hit cats, you went too far.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:32.000\nI think it was a family that was, like, trying to visit Times Square on their vacation.\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:37.000\nAnd there's a lady just peeing on their car.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:40.000\nBut, like, on the side, I'm trying to picture...\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:43.000\nOn the side of their car, like, crouching by the car, and then I heard a tap.\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nBecause there was, like, out of view.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nBut in the view of four people wearing Wisconsin hoodies.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:50.000\nI was, like, right by the driver's window.\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.000\nRight.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:54.000\nSo you're in the street?\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nIf you're by the driver's window, you're out in the middle of the road.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.000\nYeah, I was.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:02.000\nThat's my girl.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.000\nThat's your girl.\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nYou should not applaud that.\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:11.000\nYou never close your eyes anymore.\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nI didn't say it was a classy moment for me, Jeff.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:19.000\nWell, honestly, we got a lot of show to do, and I think they're wonderful.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:22.000\nWe can humbly excuse ourselves if that's what you're facing before.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.000\nI got a lot to do.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:28.000\nIf you guys want to plug something or...\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nYou were wonderful.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nThey should buy you a drink later.\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:35.000\nBut if there's anything you want to say, is that burn down the White House?\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nIs that what you want to say, Rob?\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nI'm happy to plug bias to drink later.\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nWhat's that?\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:44.000\nBias-to-drink-later.com.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nOh, bias-to-drink-later.\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nI thought it was the name of a...\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:51.000\nRob and Nicky, you can find them on pparker.com, everybody.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nThank you for their...\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nAll right.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n41:57.000 --> 42:03.000\nYeah, I mean, if you go back through the history of that broadcast,\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:08.000\nJeff was the one that was like, get up here.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:12.000\nBecause I was in the midst of a point that I was trying to make.\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:16.000\nBut I was interested in whether or not you guys believe that people wear diapers.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:18.000\nBut now I'm not anymore.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:20.000\nI've moved beyond whether it's true or not.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nI think we're finding out that you don't need to wear diapers.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:29.000\nYou can just go pee in the middle of the road on 55th and Broadway.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nI got to stop cloaking this in science.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nIt's a science thing.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nIt's a thing that I want to do.\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:39.000\nJeff Vesuvio, we were talking about this, and I said to Steve Levy, my assistant,\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:44.000\nwho was here, I said, go get some diapers, some adult diapers.\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:46.000\nAnd bring them here.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:49.000\nAnd I want to...\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nI'll put a pair on.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.000\nAre you wearing diapers right now?\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nNo, no, I haven't put them on yet.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:57.000\nI don't want to plan things.\n\n42:57.000 --> 43:01.000\nBut I thought, Steve, do you have the diapers?\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nOh, no.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nSteve?\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nOh, here he comes.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:11.000\nOh, shit.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:16.000\nOh, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.000\nWhat in the shopping...\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:20.000\nWhat's in the bag?\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:22.000\nTake the mic, Steve.\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.000\nTake the mic.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nThese are the ones that you said...\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nThose are the fancy ones.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:33.000\nHe's a designer. This is like when Paul Rudd finally has to piss his pants.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:38.000\nHe's going to wear a real fit for men.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:43.000\nAnd then the other ones depend for men.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nI mean, I don't...\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:46.000\nSay what?\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.000\nYeah!\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nWhy are they for men?\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nWell, I think the women...\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nI really don't know.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nI would think maybe...\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:58.000\nThe sexier, the female... The female ones are sexier.\n\n43:58.000 --> 44:00.000\nWell, no, because...\n\n44:00.000 --> 44:03.000\nThey have frills and padding.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nWell, I would also...\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:08.000\nMaybe, madam, I don't know, and I'd back you up every step of the way\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:11.000\nif you want to escape a dichotomous world of adult diapers.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nI'm with you.\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.000\nSay what?\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:15.000\nOh, you have a theory?\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:16.000\nOkay.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nWhat can you shout it out before we bring you up here and do the whole thing?\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:19.000\nDiaper theory.\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:21.000\nJust shout out your theory and...\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:24.000\nThis is a horrible premise, but I haven't told her.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:25.000\nOkay.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:26.000\nAll right.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.000\nGet up here.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.000\nGet up here.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:29.000\nCome on.\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:30.000\nShe says she has a tumbler.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:31.000\nNow we have to bring her up.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:32.000\nDiaper tumbler.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:35.000\nDiaper tumbler.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nWhat the...\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:39.000\nPlease tell me you're wearing diapers right now, madam.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:40.000\nWhat is your name?\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nLindsay.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:42.000\nLindsay, everybody.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:43.000\nWelcome, Lindsay.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nGrab that and move that and...\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nOkay, Lindsay, what's your theory?\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nI'm not sure I can get on this chair.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:50.000\nWell, that's cool.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nYou're only here to give your theory.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nThere we go.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:55.000\nSo...\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.000\nNo dream is too big.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nAll right.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:58.000\nFor me, maybe.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\nI can't reach it.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:00.000\nLindsay...\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:01.000\nGod damn it, the theory.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:02.000\nOkay.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nSo I have a tumbler.\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:06.000\nIt's called Fragile Masculinity Products.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:07.000\nOh, sorry.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:08.000\nSay it again.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nFragile Masculinity Products.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nOkay.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nRight.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:13.000\nSay it again.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:14.000\nNo, it's tumbler.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:15.000\nThere's a tumbler.\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:19.000\nJust keep going through these nested loops.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:25.000\nAnd she's going to bring you up and then we're going to end up doing a show for cockroaches\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:26.000\nin China.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:34.300\nSo my theory is that if you use a product that's not branded for men and it's something to\n\n45:34.300 --> 45:37.000\ndo with caring for your body, it makes you gay.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nOh, okay.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nWell, that's fair.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:44.000\nIn a world where there, like, Coke Zero exists, like one would expect, yeah, that if...\n\n45:44.000 --> 45:45.000\nDr. Pepper 10.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:48.000\nOne of the products on the tumbler is aromatherapy for men.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:49.000\nAromatherapy.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nAnd it's called Beast Mood.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nWell, yeah, we're talking...\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nYeah.\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nSo, yeah, I mean, that's easy enough to...\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:59.000\nLike, they market test stuff and then they ask men...\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nThere's a tactical Christmas stocking.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nA tactical Christmas stocking.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:04.000\nThat's cool.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nThat's like, if you get a knife...\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:10.000\nThere's a tactical baby carrier.\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:11.000\nThat's cool.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nWhat?\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nLike, if you get a knife...\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:17.000\nNo, I mean, there may...\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:20.000\nYou can see on the package, there's a bulge there.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:23.000\nI'm sure that's not the women's depends, right?\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:25.000\nThat's what I was going to say, is that...\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:29.000\nAm I being naive and thinking that the women's stream comes a little...\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:30.000\nI mean, there needs to be a bulge.\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:31.000\nIt's not just pee.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nWell, but it doesn't even matter, because like...\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nWell, in the front there is.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:36.000\nYou don't know.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nLike, what would be your...\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:43.000\nI mean, I'm not locking horns with you when I say this.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:46.000\nI just think this is very interesting because I feel like...\n\n46:46.000 --> 46:51.000\nLike, obviously capitalism, it propagates itself across the gender gap,\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nand there's all kinds of ridiculous things.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nLike, when these companies, all we should expect them to do\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:59.000\nis to try to make money off of people, and they market test stuff,\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:03.000\nand if men go, I want a toothpick that makes me not feel gay,\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:04.000\nthen it's like...\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.000\nThen there's these toothpicks that are called like,\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:08.000\npick your tooth, fucker.\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nAnd it's like, it doesn't...\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nIt's not made by the government.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:14.000\nIt's made by a fucking toothpick company.\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nThey're trying to make money as much as they can.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:19.000\nLike, cool cigarettes? Give me a break.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:22.000\nLindsay, have you ever worn an adult diaper?\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nNo, I have not.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nAre you willing to wear one tonight?\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nThese are men's ones.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:31.000\nAre you willing to go across gender lines\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:35.000\nand wear a male adult diaper?\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:36.000\nWhat's the incentive?\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:37.000\nHuh?\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nWhat's the incentive?\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:44.000\nShut up, Jim.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:46.000\nThat's my roommate yelling at me.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nProve they're not for men.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:49.000\nI'm just wondering, what's the incentive?\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nProve they're not for men.\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:52.000\nFuck you.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:55.000\nThe things we're forced to say when we have to quickly\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:58.000\nconsolidate our thoughts but shout because of...\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:02.000\nProve they're not for men.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.000\nAnd then you go home and you're like,\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nprove they're not for men.\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:08.000\nThat wasn't me. That wasn't Toby.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:09.000\nDoes this...\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:12.000\nI would have been so much more articulate than that.\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:14.000\nDoes this mean feminism wins?\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:15.000\nYour girlfriend's like, no, it's okay, Toby.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nYou were shouting across a crowded room.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nLike, no one would have heard you.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:22.000\nYeah, but prove they're not for men.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:27.000\nI'm gonna be hearing that for the rest of my life.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:34.000\nProve they're not for men.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:36.000\nThat's happening at Trump rallies all over the\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:40.000\nAmerican village.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:45.000\nBad things come inside the country.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:50.000\nYou're right because of your hair.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:53.000\nI'll totally wear one if this means feminism wins.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nWait, sorry.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nDoes this mean feminism wins if I wear an adult diaper for men?\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nWins what?\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:02.000\nJust wins.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:12.000\nWhat if feminism only loses if you say that?\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nOh, no.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:18.000\nThe idea that it's a horse in a race,\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nnot to high road you,\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:23.000\nbut no, I would be happy to,\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:26.000\nin the spirit of,\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:28.000\nyeah, of course, yeah.\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:31.000\nI don't know what it'll do for gender dichotomy.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nI don't know what it'll do.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nI don't think it has to be about any actual\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nempirical experiment.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:40.000\nI think it's simply, do you need that?\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:44.000\nBut I know, okay.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:47.000\nThey've had enough pants down on the road.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:52.000\nYou can't wear over your pants.\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:54.000\nNo, I'm not gonna, I have to,\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.000\nyou have to put them over your,\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:58.000\nand I don't know if that's illegal or not,\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:05.000\nthese are so much more thin than I thought.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:13.000\nBe sure they got a diaper for your drink.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:14.000\nWhat?\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:18.000\nWell, just give me the corner.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:23.000\nSince 1849, the Swedish-American haul.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:36.000\nJust keep it, keep it near you.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:37.000\nHey, guys.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nOh, nice.\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:42.000\nCareful, careful.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nOh, geez.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:47.000\nOh, boy.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:48.000\nYeah, you don't have to do it.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nDon't feel weird.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:53.000\nOh, she's doing it.\n\n50:53.000 --> 51:00.000\nAll right.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:04.000\nNow, Dan, personal question, Dan.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nBe careful.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nDon't hurt yourself.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:07.000\nCan I ask?\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:08.000\nThey are super tight.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nTake her wallet.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nGet her stuff.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:13.000\nOh.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:14.000\nGet it, get the pants.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nDan, have you taken the show, Pete?\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:17.000\nDid you pee before the show?\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nHave you got one of the chairs?\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nI didn't pee before the show,\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:25.000\nbut we got a lot of people to talk about.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nThat's why it's for men.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:31.000\nOh, shit.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:32.000\nShit.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nI'd be careful.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:37.000\nTake that, Betty, for Dan.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nI didn't intend for this to be a gender thing.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nDon't jump too high.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nShe has a weapon.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:46.000\nThis is an actual knife.\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:47.000\nDon't hurt yourself.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nThat's cool.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nAnd you brought it up here?\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:53.000\nI feel like we should be protecting her\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nand not going through her stuff.\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:01.000\nDan, I've never worn an adult diaper before.\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:06.000\nDo you feel secure?\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:10.000\nI just really want to pee.\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:14.000\nI'm asking you an honest question.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nI mean, do you feel secure?\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nIf you peed right now, do you feel that\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nthat would contain the pee?\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nIt feels like there's a sheet of cardboard\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nwrapped around my...\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:30.000\nIt's really chafy.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:34.000\nLet's get back to the show.\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:37.000\nIf you want, you can put your pants back on.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:38.000\nI'm going to put my pants back on\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:39.000\nbecause I feel like...\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nNobody puts their pants back on.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nThe pants stay off.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nThis is quite freeing, actually.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nI feel like the point of the diaper\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:48.000\nis to have them on.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nOkay, put your pants back on.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nBecause also, we have some serious cases.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:52.000\nOkay, how about this?\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:53.000\nDan, you be the control.\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:54.000\nNo, no.\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:55.000\nLindsay, you be the control.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.000\nPut your trousers back on.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:57.000\nDan, you be the experiment.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nLeave your trousers off.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:00.000\nRight?\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:01.000\nNo?\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:05.000\nI'm trying to be Mythbusters about this.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:06.000\nWhere in San Francisco?\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:10.000\nThis is Mythbusters territory.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:11.000\nIt's a final season.\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:12.000\nThe idea is that they're in Times Square\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nand they're wearing these things under their pants\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:15.000\nand they're freezing outside.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:16.000\nYou're right, you're right.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nOkay, so the control is that we're doing a male\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nand female experiment right now.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nIt doesn't crinkle.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:23.000\nWe have a question.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:24.000\nDan, does it crinkle?\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:25.000\nWe have a question from the front.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:28.000\nActually, it feels really nice.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nI can't tell it from...\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nUnless I touch it with my hand,\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:35.000\nI can't tell it from comfortable underwear.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:38.000\nI'm glad that you're asking questions.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:41.000\nActually, it's notable how comfortable they are.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nIt actually feels nice.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:44.000\nCalvin Klein.\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nBecause my big thought is...\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:49.000\nIs it true that adults can wear these\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:50.000\nand then you can...\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:53.000\nCould you wail into your pants?\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:56.000\nJust for one fucking pee, for instance.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nDan, the night is young, baby.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:01.000\nWe're going to find out.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:04.000\nBecause it doesn't feel like it would hold anything.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nAlright, well, I can't do it yet.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nTake this shit.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:13.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:14.000\nShit on the floor.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:15.000\nPodcast shit.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nPodcast shit.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nPodcast shit.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:20.000\nPodcast shit.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:21.000\nI will clear.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:24.000\nI will clear the Swedish-American haul, you guys.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:29.000\nOkay, so...\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:32.000\nWe're going to win that webby.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nWhat's your name, young lady?\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:35.000\nLindsay.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:38.000\nLindsay, would you go take a seat with your diaper?\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:41.000\nIf you start to feel like you're ready to take a piss,\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nyou can come up on stage and...\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:44.000\nOkay.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:47.000\nI feel like this gives me an extra drink during the show.\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nI mean, like, it'll hold one.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nI mean, I need one, too.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:54.000\nLet's thank Lindsay, and we'll see her in a little bit.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nYeah.\n\n54:56.000 --> 55:01.000\nYeah.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nYeah, this shit is about science.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.000\nWe did it.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:11.000\nOkay, so...\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:12.000\nSo then...\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:17.000\nOh, and it's night when you sit, it's like a Nike.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:22.000\nIt's like a gel pad.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:26.000\nI just felt like a...\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:29.000\nNow, I'm taking a shit right now.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:33.000\nI'm not going to poop in them, but I am really curious,\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:39.000\nlike, can an adult pee in an adult diaper just hang out?\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:42.000\nI am curious about that.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:46.000\nHas anybody here successfully peed in an adult diaper?\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.000\nOh, the hands go up.\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nYeah, people have.\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:50.000\nYeah.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nWhat matter?\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:53.000\nSay it louder.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:56.000\nAfter you pee, it feels weird and it's really heavy,\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nand it starts to sag.\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:00.000\nIt starts to sag.\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:01.000\nOkay, wait.\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:02.000\nHang on.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:03.000\nHang on.\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nEverybody, I want to completely...\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:06.000\nDad, bless me.\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:07.000\nCan I get...\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:10.000\nThe Ben Franklin of the most obvious statement about...\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nI was like, we needed to hear her say that,\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nbut I was like, yeah, I guess that makes sense.\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nShe said, after you pee...\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:17.000\nIt gets real heavy.\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:21.000\nIt gets real heavy, and it gets heavy, and it starts to sag.\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:24.000\nCan we get complete Swedish-American house silence\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:25.000\nby applause?\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:26.000\nAnd I don't want ironic applause.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:32.000\nActual people who have peed in a diaper in public.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:35.000\nThat's nine people.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nYeah.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:38.000\nOkay.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:39.000\nSo that's for real.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:40.000\nSo we're going to...\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:42.000\nNow we got that cooking, and I swear,\n\n56:42.000 --> 56:46.000\nif I have to pee, I'm going to fucking let it go,\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:49.000\nand I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you I'm doing it.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:52.000\nDid you bring extra pants just in case?\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:53.000\nNo.\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nI just didn't rub back my pants.\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:58.000\nNo, because I'm not a hack.\n\n56:58.000 --> 56:59.000\nIt's a real...\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:00.000\nI'm not Chris Angel.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:04.000\nI'm a fucking magician.\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:05.000\nI'm not an illusionist.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:08.000\nI do fucking magic, okay?\n\n57:08.000 --> 57:10.000\nWhen I make the Statue of Liberty go away,\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:12.000\nit fucking goes.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:18.000\nYour huddled masses don't know where they are.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:20.000\nDid I tell you guys, as I was saying in the podcast,\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:21.000\nwhen I was 10 years old,\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nDavid Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear,\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nand I didn't know.\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:29.000\nI turned off the TV, and I was like, huh.\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:33.000\nI don't know if he should have done that.\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:34.000\nYeah.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:36.000\nAnd it was like two days later that my...\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:38.000\nHe made it come back, you dick.\n\n57:38.000 --> 57:39.000\nAll right.\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:42.000\nListen.\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nI know what you guys are thinking.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:45.000\nOkay, well...\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:46.000\nNo, I mean, yeah.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:48.000\nI know what I'm thinking.\n\n57:48.000 --> 57:50.000\nI'm thinking how close are you to peeing your pants\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:51.000\nand proving this is...\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nListen, I don't want to disappoint you guys,\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nbut I'll drink as much as I can.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nMaybe somebody bring up a bottle of water.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nCan we get dead nine ice teas?\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nIf there's a bottle of water or something,\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nbecause I don't want anybody to be pissed off.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:04.000\nI'll piss my pants.\n\n58:04.000 --> 58:05.000\nDusty roads.\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nWell, that happens.\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nI want to talk to somebody.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:10.000\nShe tweeted me.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:13.000\nAmber, are you in the audience?\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nAmber?\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nAmber, you're not here?\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nAmber, do you have cold feet now?\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nDo you want to come up and talk?\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:22.000\nYou can come up?\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:23.000\nOkay, Amber.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:24.000\nOkay, come on up, Amber.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:42.000\nAll right.\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:44.000\nThis is soundtrack.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:46.000\nHey, Amber.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:51.000\nSo, are you going to have a seat here?\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nThere you go.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nAll right.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:59.000\nAmber, let's get ready to fucking hairpin turn.\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nThat's what Harmontown's tonality is about.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:02.000\nIt's not that bad.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:07.000\nAmber is fresh, fresh off of a double mastectomy.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:08.000\nYep, on Monday.\n\n59:08.000 --> 59:09.000\nMonday.\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.000\nSo, tonight is Saturday.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nAnd you're like...\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nAnd one of the things you warned me about is like,\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nwell, I'm going to be whacked out on drugs,\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:18.000\nbecause you're like...\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.000\nThis is not an outpatient procedure, is it?\n\n59:20.000 --> 59:21.000\nOh, no.\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nIt's like you're recovering.\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:24.000\nRight.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nI'm still really sore, and I'm still on a bunch of drugs.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:29.000\nAnd you have a knit cap on.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nYeah, it's from chemo before.\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:32.000\nRight.\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:36.000\nSo, there's so many things that I don't understand about this,\n\n59:36.000 --> 59:38.000\nand I guess one of the first things is like...\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:42.000\nSo, when they detect it, they try to treat it\n\n59:42.000 --> 59:46.000\nthe way they do regular cancer with chemotherapy,\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:50.000\nwhich is just like to flood your body with chemicals and stuff.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:52.000\nAnd so, that makes your hair fall out,\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:55.000\nand makes you sickly and sad and bummed out.\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:56.000\nYeah.\n\n59:56.000 --> 59:57.000\nAre you in a relationship?\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:58.000\nYeah.\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.000\nHusband?\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000\nNo, just a long-time boyfriend.\n\n01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nLike, how long ago did this...\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nDan, can I interrupt?\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nHow did you guys meet each other?\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nLike, how do you know each other?\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nOn Twitter, like, eight minutes ago.\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nLike, I was just like, I'm coming to San Francisco,\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nand she's like, that's what's great about Twitter.\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nSo, take us, if you will,\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nand tell me when you don't want to talk about stuff or do.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nBut, like, go back to before anything was happening,\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nany of this, and how long ago was that?\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000\nOctober.\n\n01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nOf this year?\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nI think maybe at the end of September,\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nI started feeling like a weird feeling,\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nand so I started feeling around,\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nand I felt a lump, and I went into the doctor,\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nand they did all the scans and things.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000\nCan you tell me when you say,\n\n01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000\nI started feeling a weird feeling,\n\n01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nand then I felt a lump.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nWhat is the weird feeling?\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nJust, like, something not normal,\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nlike a small, like, twinge of pain.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nLike, when you washed, or...\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nNo, no, just not...\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nI wasn't touching it at all.\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nOh, just like, oh, you're feeling like, like, like, like...\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nYeah, just like a little pulse,\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000\nevery once in a while.\n\n01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000\nAnd so then you started, like, investigating.\n\n01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nAnd then you feel a lump.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nAnd so then you go into the doctor,\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nand they go, okay.\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000\nAnd so, okay, can you take us from there\n\n01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nthrough the narrative?\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nWe did all the scans and biopsies,\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nand it came back,\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nthe test results came back,\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nthat it was invasive ductal carcinoma,\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nand they said that they wanted to start out with chemo,\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nand I did that,\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nbut I only went through three cycles,\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nbecause it made me so sick that I was just tired of it,\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nso I said, let's just go ahead and do the surgery.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nOkay, so, and at that point,\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nso chemo is an attempt to, like...\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nShrink it down.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nAnd the end game,\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nthere's this sort of, like, elephant in the room\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nof, like, the mastectomy, right?\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nLike, it's breast cancer.\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nIs that how it works?\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nThat they're like, let's try all these things\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nthat we have to try before we do the mastectomy.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nIs that the idea?\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nYeah, usually,\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nbecause sometimes they can just go in\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nand take out that one little bit,\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nbut then there's a chance that it could have spread\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nto the rest of your body,\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nso that's the way they want to do the chemo,\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nto get everything.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nAnd yours was double,\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nso at some point, you're finding out that it's...\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nIt's just I have so much family history\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nand I don't want to have to go through chemo again,\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nso I said just take them both.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nRight.\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nIt makes it easier.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nDid you detect it in October?\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000\nIt was late September, maybe.\n\n01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nBut you detected it pretty early, you think,\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nor do you think that you got...\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000\nYeah, and so you said, let's just do it.\n\n01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nYeah.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nYou got to do it before it spreads.\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nAnd thank you so much for coming up here\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nand talking about this.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000\nThis is the thing that we're becoming conscious of\n\n01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000\nin our culture, like as celebrities\n\n01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nand the other thing is we have to wait for celebrities\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nto go through it and all this stuff,\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nbut it's like...\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000\nBecause I'm 43 years old.\n\n01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nI remember in the 80s, like...\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nLike, this is not a new thing,\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nbut what's new is the idea that we're allowed to talk about it.\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nAnd the thing that's very...\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nThis mind field that I want to wander into,\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nif you're willing to with me, is like...\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nBecause I don't understand women's relationships\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nwith their breasts.\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000\nAnd I...\n\n01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nHow the mastectomy affects that,\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nbecause I don't understand where your relationship\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nwith your own breasts ends\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nand where it feels like those are a connection\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nto other people or...\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nAnd I'm a terrible interviewer,\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nbut I'm just like, I want...\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nWhat I want is for somebody to talk about\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nor just educate me about what...\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nBecause there's no analogy.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nMen have prostate cancer.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nMen have testicular cancer.\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nBut we can walk around with one ball.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000\nAnd I have a ton of friends who are,\n\n01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nand they feel great about it.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nAnd there's no such thing as like...\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nIt's like...\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nI always wondered about that,\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000\njust like from 13 years old,\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nthis focus on these things.\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nCan I stop talking and you start talking?\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nSure.\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nActually, when they went in and took everything out,\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nthey also put in this deflated balloon\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nthat's called a tissue expander.\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nAnd after everything heals,\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nthey're going to start to slowly fill it up with saline\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nso it stretches.\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nLike every couple of weeks, you go in\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nand they add a little more.\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nOnce it gets up to about the right size,\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nthey can just swap it out and swap it in\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nwith like a permanent replacement.\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nSo...\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nOkay, well, I...\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nI'm not going to have the, you know,\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nthat issue that you're talking about.\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nAmber, do you know, like,\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nare you out of the woods right now?\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nAre you waiting to find out, like,\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nif you're clear or in remission or anything?\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nWell, everything they took out of me,\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nthey sent to a lab.\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nSo we, I guess, were waiting to see\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nwhat the lab asked us to say.\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nThat's really good.\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nI had a friend whose mother went through this\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nand, like, there was...\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nIt was there after math?\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000\nIt sounded like there's stuff\n\n01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000\nthat needs to be done to be candid about it.\n\n01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000\nLike, my friend had to help her mom,\n\n01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nlike, extract, like, pus, liquid.\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000\nOh, yeah, I have drains.\n\n01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000\nI have four drains, but...\n\n01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nSorry, say it again.\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000\nDrain?\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nDrain.\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nI'll show you if you're not afraid of blood.\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nWell, I am afraid of blood.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nHe'll pass out.\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nOkay.\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nYeah, I'm very squeamish,\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nbut, and I wouldn't be podcast-worthy,\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nbut the...\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nYou're writing diapers, Dan.\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nBut the personal experience,\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000\ndoes your husband have to help you?\n\n01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nNo, I can do it just fine.\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nAnd there's drainage that has to happen\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nin the aftermath of the amputation.\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000\nYeah.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000\nI'm kind of tapped out of, like,\n\n01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000\nI really want...\n\n01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000\nLike, I...\n\n01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nYou were saying, like,\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nso now they're gonna, like,\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nnow they're putting balloons in\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nand they're inflating these things.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nAre they gonna tattoo?\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nIs there a tattoo thing they do on the...\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nWell, actually, they were able to save all the skin.\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nThere's a new procedure, so...\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000\nUh-huh.\n\n01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nThey were able to save all the skin.\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nOh, so now you're gonna walk out of this\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nwith, like, porn star movies.\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000\nI could.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nYeah, possibly.\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000\nOkay.\n\n01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nWell, fuck you.\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nGet out of here.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nTry to come up here and...\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nPeople are dropping $10,000 for those things.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nUh...\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nHe's there.\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nI mean, I...\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000\nSo it's pretty amazing.\n\n01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000\nLike, my mom, like, she had uterine cancer\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000\nand she didn't talk about it,\n\n01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nand she died of it.\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000\nLike, and...\n\n01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nBut when she finally, when we knew she had cancer,\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nit was in her brain.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000\nAnd that was because you didn't talk about it,\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nbecause that was a personal thing.\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nAnd, like, I like...\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nAs...\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nI mean, I hate cancer.\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000\nIt makes me angry to even, like, talk about it.\n\n01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nJeff...\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000\nAs opposed to bold stance...\n\n01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nThe hard line.\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nIt's a bold stance.\n\n01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nI, Jeff Davis...\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000\nTonight on the hard line with Jeff Davis...\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nHey, up yours, cancer.\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nBut, like...\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nBut...\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nExactly.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nBut, like,

01:17:08.000\nYou want to know what you're worried about yourself.\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nSo you can't help but internalize.\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nWhen you see somebody going through that,\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nyou wonder what you would be like going through that yourself.\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nI always want to know.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nWhen people tweet me or email me and stuff,\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nand they go, I have this or I'm going through that.\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nI always want to talk

America.\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nAnd go like, I got a tennis elbow.\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nGo to my GoFundMe.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nI'm not saying if you have a GoFundMe, that's not...\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000\nThose are good.\n\n01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000\nThere's a guy back there that...\n\n01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000\nI hope that's Rod Funches.\n\n01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nIt's not Rod Funches.\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nDon't be sorry.\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nI want everyone in the world to laugh that cleanfully.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nDon't be sorry that you're not Rod Funches, sir.\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000\nBe sorry that you have that laugh and aren't Rod Funches.\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000\nI was on a plane...\n\n01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI was on the Southwest flight from Burbank to Oakland with Rod Funches.\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nHe slept the whole time, didn't giggle once.\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nYeah, yeah. Fuck you, Funches.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nIt's all an act. You know it's all an act.\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nHe doesn't really giggle. He doesn't actually like people.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000\nHe's filled with whatever the opposite giggles is.\n\n01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nHey, I'm going... Funches is doing a show tomorrow.\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000\nHe's at Cobbs, I think, 11 a.m.\n\n01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nHe's making mimosas and he's serving brunch.\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nAnd he's not... I don't think he's calling it brunches with Funches.\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nIt is? Is that what it's called?\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000\nOkay, I'll see you all there. We're all going to that.\n\n01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nSpencer, did I do the double mastectomy lady interview, right?\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nYou're just supposed to bring the person up and let them tell their story, right?\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nI didn't do it wrong.\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nI mean, you know.\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nI was a little heavy-handed. I was heavy-handed.\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nYou were high-handed.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nWhat are you yelling out, sir?\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nYell it out again.\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nNot you.

People are like, fighter flies.\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nHe only said it over a laugh, so you'll never know what he said.\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nYeah, he's like, he rides in on the fucking laughs of others.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nOh, well, the 9-11 was an inside job.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nWhat was that, sir?\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000\nYeah, I didn't know.\n\n01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nHe said, just hurry up and crack your pants.\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nThis guy came for the pants building.\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000\nLet's be clear. I am not shitting my pants.\n\n01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nAnd I don't think that these things are designed to hold shit.\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000\nWell, Dan, how do we know?\n\n01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nWe're here as a scientific experiment.\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nI asked for what?

How much do you guys pay?\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nOkay, yeah, you guys are fine.\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nI don't even want to know.\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nWhatever it is, I'll give it back to you outside.\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nHow about this? If Dan's rich, if Dan doesn't pee himself in front of you people,\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nhe'll write you all a personal check outside.\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nSpencer, that was the biggest yawn I've ever seen.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nSpencer, how are you holding up, man?\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nYou guys hear about these Chinese murder

tell you, Jeff, it's a switch for your dick.\n\n01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nIt turns your sperm on or off.\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nIt shuts your sperm right off.\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nThat seems too bad or good to be true.\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nWell, let me tell you, a sub-dermal switch right in your scrotal sac.\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nI saw the Facebook diagram of the whole thing.\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nI mean, what if they're taking it?\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nHey, baby, let's

going.\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nBut also, he had his male tube...\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nYou clapped your hands with the vehemence of somebody who's very happy that you did that, right?\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nYeah.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000\nYou had a sperm extraction?\n\n01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nWhat is that?\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000\nWhat...\n\n01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nI mean, I know what that sounds like, but what does that mean?\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nIt sounds amazing.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nI had one today on Southwest Flight 2550.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nSo you have some sperm on the side just in case.\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000\nAnd the freezer, your freezer or somebody else's freezer?\n\n01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000\nJust next to the peas?\n\n01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nAll right, sir, so what I wanna ask is the vasectomy,\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nmy understanding is you're snipping the conduit between the apparatus is generating sperm\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nand the apparatus is shooting it out, right?\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nSo that means that anytime you want, we're losing a lot of people.\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nThose guys are Mormons.\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nAnd anytime you want post vasectomy, you could go in like five years after a vasectomy\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000\nand say, I want a sperm extraction, right?\n\n01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nIs that yes or no?\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000\nRight, but yes.\n\n01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nI'm just saying, you keep making sperm, yeah, and so you could...\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nThe thing that's...\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nOkay, so all right, well, you've had vasectomy.\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nAre you by any chance just willing to come up just for a second and just talk?\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000\nOkay.\n\n01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nDoes that matter?\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000\nI just have a couple of vasectomy questions.\n\n01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nAnd perdiperon?\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nVery, very light applause because people don't wanna make it a competition between them\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nwith a double mastectomy, lady.\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nYou don't want...\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nYeah, it's like, he's not John Henry, he got a fucking vasectomy.\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nI understand, but you don't have to make him feel like a fucking pariah.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nWe've moved on to a different segment.\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nMy name's Matt.\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nI played D&D with you guys last time we were there.\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nHello, Matt.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nI have face blindness.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nAll right.\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nIt's called alcoholism.\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000\nSo vasectomy.\n\n01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nOkay, so just like, okay, so your balls keep making sperm.\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nAnd then the...\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nWe lost Jeff.\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nIf I can't have a podcast and just learn what I need to learn.\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nSo your balls keep making sperm.\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nYes, they keep making sperm.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000\nSo when you come, here's my...\n\n01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nYou come just as I'm sperm in it.\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nSo the sperm is just sitting there and it just doesn't get dropped in so that it gets sent out.\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nDoesn't that terrify you?\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nNo, it's fine.\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nIt's great.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nIt's great.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nWhat terrifies you, Dan, about that?\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000\nBecause I'm a child, I feel like I'm a third grader.\n\n01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nWhat terrifies you?\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000\nBecause I feel like they're down there and they wanna go out.\n\n01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nOh, so you feel sympathy for those trapped sperm?\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nI feel like, no, I don't feel sympathy for them.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nI've certainly never done them any favors.\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nIt's safer in there.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nI've never been a benevolent God.\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nI, on the other hand, don't want them hanging out.\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nThey don't last very long, right?\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nSperms live and die very short.\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nAnd they just hang out and die all the time.\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nAnd it's the fluid that constitutes your cum.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nSeminole fluid.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000\nI love it.\n\n01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nThat's not coming...\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nWho's yelling shit out?\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nIt primarily comes from the seminal vesicle in the cowper's gland.\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nIt's just up in your body.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nIt's not in your balls.\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nYour balls are like the factory where these little sperm cells are made.\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nAnd you can just let that factory keep going,\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nand then you're cutting off the assembly line.\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nIt's just like, oh, that's where the Prius is made.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nBut you're just like, keep making that Prius.\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nAnd it's like, they don't care.\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nIt's not gonna rust and hurt you.\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nThat's correct.\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nSo it's still making great sperm all the time.\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nAwesome.\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nAnd now I have some on ice.\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nOh, yeah, that was a great high five.\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nThat was the weirdest high five I've ever seen in my life.\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nWell, I had a cap in my hand.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nAll right, well, okay.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nBut I just thought, okay, so here's the...\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nOkay, one more question.\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nOne more question.\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nOkay, so you're talking about snipping a line.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nOkay, so these sperm are used to going up through a tube.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000\nAre they still trying and then hitting a shape?\n\n01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nThey just don't go anywhere.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nSo I had a vasectomy and I was 27.\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000\nSo it was a long, long time ago and you can get them reversed\n\n01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nor you can do an extraction, which is...\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000\nWhat happened to the sperm when you're coming?\n\n01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nThe sperm are going like...\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nNo, they're just...\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nHere we go, boys.\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nWe've been waiting for this for our whole lives.\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nAnd then they go and they're like, ah, fuck.\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nThere's a wall.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000\nYou tell me they don't get angry and like...\n\n01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nThen they die and they cry and it's very sad.\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nAnd the new ones get made the next day.\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000\nSperm don't think, though, like at all.\n\n01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000\nThat's what my bumper sticker says.\n\n01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nSperm don't think.\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nAll right.\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nOkay.\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nDo you want an adult...\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nSpencer, if sperm did think...\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nWhat do you think a sperm would say?\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nUm, let's go.\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000\nThat's absolutely...\n\n01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nFollow that guy.\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nI got a fascinating of a sperm like...\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nThe average sperm, if you ejaculate inside a woman,\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nlike there's hundreds of millions of sperm,\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nI think there's like a certain number.\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nAnd there's like the statistical number of them\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nthat they get distracted by like calcium deposits.\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nBecause they look like eggs.\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nIsn't that adorable?\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nLike they're on their way to the fallopian tubes\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nand they're like, look, there she blows.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nAnd they're like, it's just like, dude, it's just a fucking like...\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nIt's just a deposit on the side.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nI think that's adorable.\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nBecause it's like, they're little men.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nI think that's funny that they're like,\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nwell, I'll do anything to accomplish my goal.\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nBut they have the numbers and so they get it done.\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nBut they don't.\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nThey all die and it's funny.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nMatt, funny.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nWhy at 27 did you have that done?\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nSo I got married when I was 22\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nand had a daughter when I was 27\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nand decided not to have more kids.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nSo I got a vasectomy.\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000\nAnd then 12, 13 years later got divorced.\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nAnd my fiance and I are going to have kids.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nWow.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nHave you already?\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nNo, no.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nSo my sperm is on ice.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nAnd at some point that'll happen in the future.\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nYou can see at Lincoln Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nIt's a big sperm on ice.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.000\nMy sperm is on ice.\n\n01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nMy sperm is on ice.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nLet it go.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nLet it go.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nI have an annual subscription.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nI have to keep paying them like Netflix.\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nI forgot your first name again.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nMatt.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nLet's thank Matt, the vasectomy from Pleasant.\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nWe've clearly had a...\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000\nWe've got to start now.\n\n01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000\nYou see what we did, Jeff?\n\n01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nWe took this show across a threshold.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nWe went down a road of trials.\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nWe met with certain truths.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nWe atoned with fucking death and resurrected.\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nWe met with the goddess of...\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nWho was the...\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nWhat would you say the goddess point of this?\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nThe diapers.\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nThe diapers.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nI'm almost...\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nI don't want to excite people, but I'm like,\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nI need a little more time.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nAnd then I feel like,\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nI know I can pee in my pants.\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nDan, we believe in you.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nBut I'm going to need another one of these,\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nwhoever it is.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000\nDan, like, if I'm...\n\n01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nOh, let's do a...\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nYou know what we should do?\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nWhat?\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nA push?\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nA push?\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nPush.\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nI wasn't...\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nI wasn't looking for ways to pee.\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000\nBut I thank you.\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nYou know what we should do?\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000\nThere's...\n\n01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nOh, I hadn't thought of that.\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nI'm 43 years old and I'd never tried pushing.\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000\nNo, I was going to say we could do a Q&A,\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nbecause we're never in San Francisco, but...\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000\nA Q&A?\n\n01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nThat sounds fantastic.\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nI'm not being sarcastic.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nThat sounds good.\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nAll right.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nShould I facilitate?\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nWell, there's no...\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nThere's probably not a...\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nI guess probably a wireless mic is...\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000\nNo, but what we could do is we could maybe like have...\n\n01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nI could find people...\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nDo we know...\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nDo we have a wireless mic here?\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nNo.\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nI mean, I really fucked everything up by saying Q&A.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nLet's...\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nOkay.\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nBack to the drawing board.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nNo, but what...\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nYou know what we should do.\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nDan, Dan, I could make a Q&A happen, believe me.\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nI could make this happen.\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nI don't...\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nBut I was only doing that because I didn't have anything else to do,\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nbut I could think of other things.\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nOh, I have another thing I want to try.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nAre you going to pee?\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nWhat?\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nHe's going to be mid-conversation and be like,\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nOh, it's happening.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nAll right.\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nThere's one thing.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nOne thing.\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nI don't think...\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nAdam, I don't think...\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nYou're Steve.\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000\nI don't...\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nWho's Adam?\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nAdam is a kid he drowned in camp.\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nThat you look exactly like,\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nwhich is why he's always so nice to you.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nDan, what was your idea?\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000\nMy idea...\n\n01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nWell, I just...\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nI know I had one.\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nI saw it straight out of Compton.\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nDid you guys see it straight out of Compton?\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nAnd then weren't you...\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nWell, you were watching it?\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nWere you like,\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nThis is great.\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nI love learning about the hip-hop founding fathers.\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nOh, there's EZE.\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nOh, he was so hard.\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000\nOh, Dr. Tray seemed rather innocent.\n\n01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nOh, there's Ice Cube.\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nOh, apparently he was the genius of the group.\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nThere's some guy named DJ Yella.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nThere's some other people.\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000\nBoy, that...\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nOh, EZE.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000\nOh, boy, he...\n\n01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000\nMan, he really did bad.\n\n01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000\nHe's evil.\n\n01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nOh, he's evil.\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nOh, he got AIDS.\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nBoy, that Dr. Tray and that Ice Cube...\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nI never actually knew.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nThey were great rappers.\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nAnd great people, too.\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nI didn't know that about those people.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nAnd then the credits go.\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nIt's like produced by Ice T and Dr. Tray...\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nIce Cube and Dr. Tray.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nAnd I was like,\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nWell, that seems a little unfair.\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nAre you saying you want a freestyle right now?\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nI'm saying...\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nHow would Ice T feel about that film?\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nI mean, if you really want to blow everybody's minds,\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nwhen you start peeing, you have to rap while you're peeing.\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nYou have to freestyle.\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nYou're saying I have to create a new character called Ice P?\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nI say, yeah.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nI'm gonna...\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nFrom the streets.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nI want to put a beat on while your pants get peed on.\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nYo.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nYo, man.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nIf I pee in my pants,\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nit's not about urination.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nIt's about coronation.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nCoronation.\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nIt's about grand fucking...\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nshit.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nI was...\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nI mean, do you want a beat?\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nOr are you just talking...\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nNo, I wanted to...\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nMr. T, if I can interrupt you.\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nHonestly, I understand you trying to be respectful,\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000\nbut when you call me Mr. T,\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nthere's another guy that's called that.\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nOh, is that a spot of contention,\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nwhere you don't like being called Mr. T?\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nThere's certain things being worked out\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000\nin small claims court.\n\n01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000\nIs it not true that he was Mr. T\n\n01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000\nbefore you were Ice T?\n\n01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nI mean, it doesn't...\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nHey, look, man.\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nColumbus was American before Muhammad Ali,\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nbut I know who I'm betting on.\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nIn the third round.\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nObjection.\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nObjection, Your Honor.\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nMade no sense.\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nIt ain't...\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nSustained.\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000\nThis is in court, motherfucker.\n\n01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nThis is business.\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nAll right.\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nIn a couple minutes,\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nI'm gonna urinate in my adult diaper.\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nI can feel it.\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nI can feel it.\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nBut I never got that second water, so...\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000\nYour fault if the show goes too long.\n\n01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nWe're gonna stay here.\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nI don't care if we're here until Thursday.\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000\nYou're gonna fucking wet your son.\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nHe might can't do it.\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nIs that it?\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nNope.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000\nSomebody give me a water.\n\n01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nThank you, baby.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nThank you.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000\nLet's have a hand for...\n\n01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000\nAny personal...\n\n01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000\nShe didn't give me that water for personal reasons.\n\n01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nThis is business.\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000\nThis is the digestive business.\n\n01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000\nSmall intestine.\n\n01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nAbsorbs water.\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nBut most of it makes it through your ass.\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nComes out your urethra.\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nAs your muscles deteriorate past the point when Darwin's laws expected you to live.\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:38.000\nHopefully that extra waste can be absorbed by a competent weather.\n\n01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000\nLet me finish.\n\n01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000\nI have a question, I see.\n\n01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000\nHow do kidneys work?\n\n01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000\nNo, kidneys are like the police, you know?\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nI always try to filter everything, you know?\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000\nLike, you take in liquids and all the impurities?\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nShit.\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nYour kidneys are there to rustle them up, put them over the hood, read them their rights,\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000\ntake them to jail, treat them nicely.\n\n01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nWhat's the difference between a kidney and a liver?\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nShit.\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nTalk about the difference between the local police and the Department of Justice.\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nSometimes the liver needs to create a commission of oversight,\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nas in the case of Rodney King in Los Angeles.\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000\nThe liver had to come in and say,\n\n01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nyo, kidney, what are you doing?\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nWell, you need a temporary injunction.\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000\nWhat is it?\n\n01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nWhat turns out?\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nTurns out a lot of people, it's not a popular thing to say.\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000\nBut the LAPD is doing pretty well since then.\n\n01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nWhat is the function of the bladder then?\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000\nThe bladder just holds the pee, motherfucker.\n\n01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nThe bladder is just business.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nActually, I almost just peed a little bit.\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nAll right, okay, all right, just...\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nOkay, everybody?\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000\nNow, he needs complete silence for this.\n\n01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nThank you.\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nLadies and gentlemen, the MGM
