{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.200\nHormontown once again is in session. Welcome everybody. How are you doing today? Fantastic.\n\n00:19.200 --> 00:23.440\nWelcome to Hollywood, California, the Nerdmelt Theater. And thank you for listening to us\n\n00:23.440 --> 00:28.240\nout in the podcast universe. Please put your hands together and open your hearts for the\n\n00:28.240 --> 00:30.240\nmayor of Hormontown, Dan Hormont.\n\n00:46.880 --> 00:54.640\nYou guys are fab or modern, whatever that music was. Jeff, it's an important night tonight.\n\n00:54.640 --> 01:01.920\nI'm very excited, not because I'm in a good mood. I guess I am, but just narratively and\n\n01:06.640 --> 01:13.040\nlike kind of a big night for stuttering. Conceptually, you just pointed out in the\n\n01:13.040 --> 01:18.800\ngreen room before we took the stage that we are standing at the precipice of a nexus here.\n\n01:18.800 --> 01:23.440\nI didn't know. I really don't follow the politics, but we just did the math in the green room.\n\n01:23.440 --> 01:29.760\nEven though right now, tonight in this room, we have no idea who the next president will be,\n\n01:30.960 --> 01:37.040\nwhen this airs, we will know. So we have an opportunity to create multiple timelines,\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:44.080\nmy favorite, my favorite thing. At least we are living on a razor's edge right now.\n\n01:44.080 --> 01:50.800\nWe're Schrodinger's nation. Either there's a guy that's still a president that we don't know\n\n01:50.800 --> 01:54.640\nanything about, or what happened at all, or there'll be a new guy who seems like a douchebag.\n\n01:55.680 --> 02:01.760\nHe seems like, yeah, or a lovely guy if he's the president now. If he's not the president,\n\n02:01.760 --> 02:08.880\nmy head is off to you, sir. Well run campaign, please. And get those jobs, people.\n\n02:11.040 --> 02:16.240\nI don't watch the news. I don't like politics. Dan and I don't know the first thing about politics.\n\n02:16.240 --> 02:23.520\nSurrender your mind. Don't even pontificate about it. Let's just leap into it. Let's do two different\n\n02:23.520 --> 02:32.880\nopenings. Same audience, same enthusiasm, if you please. However you want, but like, bring me.\n\n02:33.680 --> 02:36.400\nDoes somebody have a coin, a quarter? Yeah, let's do it.\n\n02:36.400 --> 02:40.560\nAll right. Heads, Obama, tails, Romney? Yes. We'll do both.\n\n02:40.560 --> 02:45.600\nBy the way, just to be fair, we're going to pick like an added debate. They flip coins. Let's see who goes first.\n\n02:50.080 --> 02:53.760\nCoin has been flipped. It's Heads, Obama won, so let's bring...\n\n02:53.760 --> 02:57.280\nWait, wait. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's fine. That's fine, that's fine, that you're enthusiastic.\n\n02:57.280 --> 03:00.400\nYou got him in there. He may or may not have won. He won.\n\n03:00.400 --> 03:05.440\nYeah, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to tell you. That's not how the Electoral College works,\n\n03:05.440 --> 03:13.840\nto you guys. We're not Daibold. We don't have the power that you think we wield. We didn't\n\n03:13.840 --> 03:17.920\ninvest in a bunch of voting machines. God, what if that was? John King would be out of\n\n03:17.920 --> 03:24.440\na job. Holy shit. No, but I was just saying, hold your applause because do the whole opening.\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:28.840\nDepending on who wins, we would come down on the right side. You guys pretend that you\n\n03:28.840 --> 03:32.280\nhaven't seen me yet. All right, so go back out there. Are you going to stay up or make\n\n03:32.280 --> 03:39.280\na drink? Whatever. Okay, we'll start it again. All right.\n\n03:39.280 --> 03:52.280\nHarmontown is now in session. Put those democratic hands together for the mayor of Harmontown.\n\n03:52.280 --> 04:08.280\nWe did it, motherfuckers. We did it. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.\n\n04:08.280 --> 04:16.280\nFour more years. Four more years. Fuck you. I love abortions. I mean, I don't love them,\n\n04:16.280 --> 04:21.360\nbut if I want to love them, I love them. Fucking. No, I just got myself an honorary abortion\n\n04:21.360 --> 04:25.480\nlast night. I'm in such a good mood tonight, Jeff, because\n\n04:25.480 --> 04:29.360\nObama won. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, though, it was a squeaker. It was a\n\n04:29.360 --> 04:33.040\nsqueaker. It's fucking weird how every four years it's a squeaker. I don't get it. It's\n\n04:33.040 --> 04:36.880\nalmost like there's some weird industrial military complex pretending like we have a choice when\n\n04:36.880 --> 04:41.000\nwe don't actually. Wait, Dan, Dan, Dan, are you saying that voting\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:45.160\nfor one-of-two people, it was an electoral college, it creates a myth of efficacy that\n\n04:45.160 --> 04:49.240\nyour vote doesn't matter at all? Jeff, that would be crazy. Who would be incentivized to\n\n04:49.240 --> 04:54.440\ndo that except a higher echelon of rich people that own everything? Why would all of them\n\n04:54.440 --> 04:59.080\nwho have everything in common do that to a bunch of poor people who also have everything\n\n04:59.080 --> 05:02.960\nin common and outnumber the motherfucker out of them? Why would they do that?\n\n05:02.960 --> 05:05.400\nYeah, but what's in it for them? Why would they lie to us about it?\n\n05:05.400 --> 05:14.440\nI don't know. I just love it that Obama won! It feels good because, and here's why it feels\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:21.880\ngood because that other guy was fucking creepy. I can't believe in a field of Republican candidate\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:24.560\nchoices. I mean, there were some weirdos in there.\n\n05:24.560 --> 05:30.400\nThey're down to Mormons now. Next year there will be a guy with a snake for a necktie.\n\n05:30.400 --> 05:35.440\nNext year? It's every year, right? Well, it will be because there's a black guy in the\n\n05:35.440 --> 05:38.440\nWhite House. It'll be every year now. They're going to change the rules in the Congress.\n\n05:38.440 --> 05:42.800\nI remember right up until the very moment that Pennsylvania finally got their head out of\n\n05:42.800 --> 05:50.640\ntheir ass and fucking just barely went through Obama because, boy, was that a swing state.\n\n05:50.640 --> 05:54.240\nBut I remember thinking, this guy Romney, it always seemed like a joke that he didn't\n\n05:54.240 --> 05:55.960\nlike. No, he was constantly a joke. Here's some\n\n05:55.960 --> 06:01.720\nother names that you don't remember. Steve Forbes, I don't know, just Pab Rasmussen.\n\n06:01.720 --> 06:06.000\nThe name names, especially on the Republican side. I mean, there's a million on the Democrat\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:12.680\nside too, but it's so weird. We will never thank God to hear the words John McCain again.\n\n06:12.680 --> 06:19.280\nHe revealed himself in the final stages to be so vile, and right at the end there, Romney\n\n06:19.280 --> 06:24.360\njust went radio silent. They just fucking turned into, that's what an alligator does,\n\n06:24.360 --> 06:28.720\nright? It just turns into a pair of eyes above swamp level.\n\n06:28.720 --> 06:35.560\nThat's what a cat does right before it pounces. I thought, Jeff, for a second that something\n\n06:35.560 --> 06:41.600\nshady was about to happen, but it turns out we still live in a completely Democratic nation.\n\n06:41.600 --> 06:46.040\nWhat are you talking about the big dispute in Indiana? The big voter fronting in Indiana.\n\n06:46.040 --> 06:52.080\nOh shit, that thing that happened where people thought that Obama's dick.\n\n06:52.080 --> 06:57.000\nThat was a ballot. They counted his dick as a ballot.\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:02.800\nThey kept punching it. It turns out 70-year-old women who fought\n\n07:02.800 --> 07:13.080\nin the World War II, dicks can be ballots to them, because back then paper was made\n\n07:13.080 --> 07:20.880\nof hemp before pot was illegal. So you were allowed to back then tattoo your presidential\n\n07:20.880 --> 07:29.520\nchoice from overseas onto a slave's dick and send him to America, and it was an absentee\n\n07:29.520 --> 07:34.240\nballot. But this is Indiana. This is all a bunch of bullshit. The point\n\n07:34.240 --> 07:40.920\nis 70% of Indiana was unaccounted for, and it was a slave. But anyways, Obama won. It\n\n07:40.920 --> 07:44.960\nwas great. All right. Or did he?\n\n07:44.960 --> 08:04.840\nWe'll come in. Armageddon is back in session. Put your fascist hands together for the fuel\n\n08:04.840 --> 08:20.440\nof Armageddon. 10 armors. Yeah, I don't know. Sorry. How's everyone doing in there?\n\n08:20.440 --> 08:25.680\nFour years. Four years. Let's hope this one isn't eight. Yeah, I don't know.\n\n08:25.680 --> 08:30.680\nWhat the fuck? I'm going to surprisingly, I'm looking at the positive side of it, though.\n\n08:30.680 --> 08:39.360\nThis is very much to me. We have a new president, everybody in the White House. Mr. Metavius\n\n08:39.360 --> 08:44.840\nRomney. I think this is called him. Metavius. We should probably stop colloquializing him.\n\n08:44.840 --> 08:50.200\nHe's the commander-in-chief. He deserves more respect than that. I support our troops.\n\n08:50.200 --> 08:56.040\nI support the people that don't support them. How many people here voted for Mitt? Wow, just\n\n08:56.040 --> 08:58.360\nthe one. It's weird. It's weird.\n\n08:58.360 --> 09:03.000\nCalifornia's a blue state. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We barely any of us voted at all. It was fucking\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.840\nPennsylvania and Indiana who did it, man. It was motherfuckers. God damn it. This is\n\n09:07.840 --> 09:14.440\nswing states. I think, you know, I'm bummed out that I can't get an abortion anymore.\n\n09:14.440 --> 09:20.080\nObviously. Look, we've all known. I mean, this argument's been raging forever. I mean,\n\n09:20.080 --> 09:24.360\nwe've known that abortions have been that coin landing on its edge every election after\n\n09:24.360 --> 09:30.400\nevery election. But, Dan, as somebody that was recently fired off of a television sitcom,\n\n09:30.400 --> 09:33.760\nyou're probably happy to have somebody in office whose main focus is to get you a job\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:38.240\nagain, right? Yes, yes, no. I just have so much about money and the economy and the trickling\n\n09:38.240 --> 09:43.600\ndown with the HMOs and the hedge funds. I've seen such a relief because the last thing\n\n09:43.600 --> 09:49.960\nyou want to do in a giant nation full of people is help people. I just find that repulsive\n\n09:49.960 --> 09:54.560\nwith them. I don't see how you're going to make money that way and I don't see, you\n\n09:54.560 --> 09:59.120\nknow, how, obviously, his dad was very poor. But how do you feel about the fact that he\n\n09:59.120 --> 10:04.240\nlost the popular vote by 400,000 votes and still won? You know what? I mean, that system\n\n10:04.240 --> 10:06.840\nis a place for a reason. The electoral college is a mystery to me. The electoral college\n\n10:06.840 --> 10:12.600\nwill never understand it. Why does Montana get to decide who wins the election? Because\n\n10:12.600 --> 10:17.320\nthere's less people there than there are senators or something. Nobody knows. Christy\n\n10:17.320 --> 10:20.680\nthinks that people don't know. Nobody's really ever going to have a good grasp of daylight\n\n10:20.680 --> 10:25.680\nsavings time or the electoral college. And in the last three days, we had them both.\n\n10:25.680 --> 10:31.160\nBut this is an underdog story. This is important. Like, I think it's good that we live in a\n\n10:31.160 --> 10:34.560\nnation now where Romney got elected. Yeah, because you know what? Because anything's\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:39.720\npossible. And he's not. Because he won, which is amazing, without a single woman voting\n\n10:39.720 --> 10:44.960\nfor him. And that's more than half the nation. Yeah, I mean, that just says how bad, first\n\n10:44.960 --> 10:49.240\nof all, how much women love Romney. Because you know, like, women are allowed, you know,\n\n10:49.240 --> 10:52.800\nyou're picturing your mom with the rolling pin and she's telling you like, well, what\n\n10:52.800 --> 10:57.480\nyour father says is best. But she gets to pull a curtain still. They haven't revoked\n\n10:57.480 --> 11:04.320\nthat yet. Not yet. She can actually secretly vote for Obama. And she didn't. Well, also,\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:09.040\nthey just also women just don't turn out to vote. Women don't care about the electoral\n\n11:09.040 --> 11:14.520\nprocess. They love making the little pancakes with their rolling pins. That's their vote.\n\n11:14.520 --> 11:22.240\nThey cast it every time they flip a flapjack. I vote for more griddles. I'm more disturbed\n\n11:22.240 --> 11:26.800\nthat women are still using rolling pins on pancakes because that's, well, yeah, I don't\n\n11:26.800 --> 11:34.040\nyou make them flat that way. I need a wife. Thank you. Thank you, Mitt Romney, for your\n\n11:34.040 --> 11:42.000\nnew Mormon every no husband left behind program. No pancake over an eighth of an inch program.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:48.840\nI thought I could now have 95 wives. All right, so end our political segment for tonight.\n\n11:48.840 --> 11:51.760\nLet's start. Let's let's reset. Everyone's got a bad taste of their mouth. They feel\n\n11:51.760 --> 11:56.400\nlike Mitt Romney won the election. Can we just reset it and pretend elections don't matter\n\n11:56.400 --> 11:59.680\nand start Harmontown? I'm going to do it, but I'm going to play without. I don't know.\n\n11:59.680 --> 12:04.320\nI'm looking at a song off of Zach, our tech guys iPod here. I'm going to restart the show\n\n12:04.320 --> 12:07.480\nwith the song. I don't know. All right, I'm just going to crouch. I won't even come up.\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:12.480\nOkay, let's see if we have it right.\n\n12:12.480 --> 12:27.480\nI'm a town is again in session, everybody. Please put your hands together with a guru\n\n12:27.480 --> 12:37.400\nof Harmontown. The election doesn't matter to the black, to the white, to the salt pepper\n\n12:37.400 --> 12:41.120\ngoing to fuck you tonight. I got a mustard to the ketchup. Got a ketchup to the mustard.\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:46.360\nGonna go to your mama. Got a Indian custard. Gonna battle you on the battle. The big hills\n\n12:46.360 --> 12:52.360\ngonna fuck your mama. Like your name was Lauren Hill Hill rhymes with Hill gonna take the pill\n\n12:52.360 --> 12:58.080\nlittle jagged pill. Got a Lannis Morissette references. I got a 90s man. Gonna 40 years\n\n12:58.080 --> 13:02.920\nold. I got a bad back. Don't know what I'm told. I got a motherfucker. Got a hand on my\n\n13:02.920 --> 13:07.680\nhead. I got a motherfucker. Gonna make some brand. You don't do it like a flat jack user\n\n13:07.680 --> 13:12.360\nrolling pin gonna fuck your mama. If she left one day again, gonna put it in her butt. Gonna\n\n13:12.360 --> 13:21.360\nput it in her mouth east, west, north, south. That's been Harvard town. Thank you for coming.\n\n13:21.360 --> 13:26.440\nIs that too short? No, no, that felt too too written because the fucking beat broke down\n\n13:26.440 --> 13:29.760\nwith a east, west, north side. That was too badass. I was like, wait, no, no, wait, that\n\n13:29.760 --> 13:36.800\nwas improper. I promise you, there's photographs of me not making that up on the way out. I\n\n13:36.800 --> 13:44.000\nknow that seemed awesome. Then he ruined it by over apologizing for how awesome it seemed.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:48.560\nI think I think review was of course out of breath from rapping review was that embarrassing\n\n13:48.560 --> 13:54.280\nmoment review that audio will reveal with that that was truly improvised the mustard to the\n\n13:54.280 --> 14:01.320\nketchup to the ketchup to the mustard. Mustard and ketchup makes it. Are you drunk? Adam\n\n14:01.320 --> 14:09.960\nGoldberg, can you pour me another drink? Welcome to Romney's America. Yeah. I decided to start\n\n14:09.960 --> 14:31.920\nputting him into use just now in this moment. Did you put any ice in it? No. Yes. Wow. That's\n\n14:31.920 --> 14:46.880\nmostly ice water. Adam Goldberg, everybody. Mustard to the ketchup to the mustard. It\n\n14:46.880 --> 14:54.880\nwas bad ass when I ran that with custard. Remember those fucking bad ass fucking. Condiment\n\n14:54.880 --> 15:03.320\nwrap. I can smell my own armpits right now. Is that you? I thought it was Adam. No, that's\n\n15:03.320 --> 15:12.520\nnot an onion. It smells like an anarcho punk. I took off my sweater and it was wafting through\n\n15:12.520 --> 15:17.360\nthe hole. It's about when you stink up a comic book store, that's like making dirt dirty.\n\n15:17.360 --> 15:23.760\nBut this isn't your normal level of body odor. This is souped up. It's because fucking Romney\n\n15:23.760 --> 15:28.760\nwon. It's crazy. Let's do the segment that's me complaining about things that I'm not allowed\n\n15:28.760 --> 15:34.920\nto complain about. Thank you. I'm excited about it now. Maybe that'll make it bad. I talked\n\n15:34.920 --> 15:40.080\nto my gardener. I talked to him. For those of you who are faithful listeners, one of\n\n15:40.080 --> 15:42.960\nmy problems that I wasn't allowed to complain about is that I felt like my gardener was\n\n15:42.960 --> 15:48.440\nup to no good. My grass is turning brown and it seems like he doesn't give a shit. The\n\n15:48.440 --> 15:52.400\nsame gardener that the previous owners had for 35 years, well, I'm sure not for he'd\n\n15:52.400 --> 15:59.720\nbe like a weird Kubrick, like Space Baby. But he was there for a long time. I inherited\n\n15:59.720 --> 16:10.760\nhim from, that seems politically incorrect. I indentured him, his servitude. I can't find\n\n16:10.760 --> 16:18.120\nthe right words for the truth. It's okay. Romney won, man. It's all good. Oh yeah, okay.\n\n16:18.120 --> 16:24.680\nSo I own this guy. I was like, yeah, you've been doing a great job. Continue to do it.\n\n16:24.680 --> 16:30.240\nThe grass slowly started dying away. I have a feeling, my theory is, I think the old German\n\n16:30.240 --> 16:34.040\nlady that lived there before me, I think she was out there every day. I think she loved\n\n16:34.040 --> 16:39.040\nher. Clearly, I moved into a house that was cared for by its matriarch. There were Adelweisses\n\n16:39.040 --> 16:42.920\nout there. There's just flowers everywhere. Everything's beautiful. It was beautiful.\n\n16:42.920 --> 16:50.040\nI moved in and it's dying and it's not just because I'm evil. It doesn't work that way.\n\n16:50.040 --> 16:54.120\nIt's also because I don't water them. Well, you did call it Danadoo. Isn't that kind\n\n16:54.120 --> 16:59.080\nof curses? That should be enough, in my opinion. It's just going to end up as you in a fireplace\n\n16:59.080 --> 17:04.760\nin a chair, just complete blackness. But slowly the grass is returning from green to brown.\n\n17:04.760 --> 17:09.040\nAgain, the heading of this is things I'm not allowed to complain about. So fuck you for\n\n17:09.040 --> 17:13.240\njudging me while I complain about it. What do you think the remedy for that is?\n\n17:13.240 --> 17:20.560\nWell, I talked to the gardener. And? And I said, seems like the grass is brown now.\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:32.280\nAnd he said, and kind of nodded his head and I was like, is there anything we can do to\n\n17:32.280 --> 17:43.600\nmake it green? And he said, winter seed, winter seed. There's things we could do. I was like,\n\n17:43.600 --> 17:48.280\ncould we do, I would like to do. It was 95 degrees today. It's not winter. I would like\n\n17:48.280 --> 17:51.560\nto do those things that you're talking about. He rattled off a bunch of things and it was\n\n17:51.560 --> 17:59.680\nlike, I threw in, I'll pay anything. And he said, I'll invoice you. He's like a teamster\n\n17:59.680 --> 18:05.480\nwith grass. That's what it is. He was ways leaning on me, waiting to see how much I cared.\n\n18:05.480 --> 18:09.640\nI think you're allowed to complain about that. You're just not without sounding like a fucking\n\n18:09.640 --> 18:23.160\ndick to a nation of renters. Next thing on my list. My mail program on my computer won't\n\n18:23.160 --> 18:29.600\nlet me turn it off. All right. On your computer, it won't let you quit the application?\n\n18:29.600 --> 18:35.440\nEvery time I want to shut down the computer, it says, mail won't let you quit. I used to\n\n18:35.440 --> 18:40.040\nbe, I wouldn't call myself a hacker in days of old, but I used to know how to make a fucking.\n\n18:40.040 --> 18:47.920\nI won the future business leaders of America competition in high school. For computer applications\n\n18:47.920 --> 18:52.840\nand business, I wrote a code for Commodore 64 that would run an invoice program. I was\n\n18:52.840 --> 18:58.520\ncompeting with guys I was writing in Pascal Cobalt. I won with my Commodore 64 basic program.\n\n18:58.520 --> 19:07.400\nIt was like 20 pages long. I won second place. But I was a code monkey. I don't know what\n\n19:07.400 --> 19:15.200\nthey call him. I was a programmer. I used to make these machines my bitch. You turn into\n\n19:15.200 --> 19:20.200\nyour grandpa. I remember my grandpa before he died of emphysema. I remember him fighting\n\n19:20.200 --> 19:26.400\nto the bitter end with his specs on his nose running his little Mac when they looked like\n\n19:26.400 --> 19:33.160\nthose little beige machines with a little smile face on him. He's like, how do I, I just\n\n19:33.160 --> 19:42.160\nwant to make a spreadsheet for the masons. I'm up to 33rd level. It's okay grandpa. It's\n\n19:42.160 --> 19:46.640\nbeyond you. It doesn't matter. No, I won't. I want to know. I knew how to make a fucking\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:55.880\ntruck out of sticks. I fought the Nazis and won. I deserve this.\n\n19:55.880 --> 20:01.320\nI died because no one cares about his money. Now I'm 40. I can't make these fucking things\n\n20:01.320 --> 20:06.200\nwork. It's not a warning. It's not a message. It's a complaint. It's not a complaint that\n\n20:06.200 --> 20:09.800\nyou care about. Fuck you. It's just deeply, deeply sad. It's getting very hard for me\n\n20:09.800 --> 20:14.880\nto run my computer. Are you happy kids? Is that what you wanted? You want to shut me\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:22.840\nout? Well, guess what? Guess what you're shutting out? The creator of Masterhouse. You just\n\n20:22.840 --> 20:30.920\nlost everything I could've told you on Reddit. All right, next thing. I hate writing. I hate\n\n20:30.920 --> 20:39.800\nwriting. I'm writing a bunch of things for a living and I hate writing. I hate it. Is\n\n20:39.800 --> 20:45.040\nthat what you keep getting fired from jobs? No, no sir. God damn it. No, don't make that\n\n20:45.040 --> 20:55.000\nmistake. I get fired because I love writing. Those shows when they get on the air. The\n\n20:55.000 --> 21:01.600\nprocess is painful and it's terrible. So you're inertia. A writer at rest, it's hard to get\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:05.160\nthat body in motion. Once it's in motion, it's hard to stop the writing. Here's a popular\n\n21:05.160 --> 21:12.360\nanalogy that guys, writers use that women love. It's like childbirth. Yes, it's worth\n\n21:12.360 --> 21:18.840\nit. Yes, it's wonderful. Yes, it's a miracle. Yes, therefore I like doing it. No, I don't\n\n21:18.840 --> 21:24.760\nlike doing it. It's terrible. It hurts. It's the worst. I would rather not have to do it,\n\n21:24.760 --> 21:29.680\nbut I know that if I didn't have to do it, I'd be a shitty person. I don't want to have\n\n21:29.680 --> 21:37.240\nto do it. I do want to have to do it. I hate it. Sucks. Fuck you. Hate writing. Stupid.\n\n21:37.240 --> 21:43.200\nThat's a dumb. I don't like these people who make these blogs that you run across where\n\n21:43.200 --> 21:50.120\nthey go, like, the joy of creativity. I just like to tell, I'm a mother of three and I\n\n21:50.120 --> 21:55.880\nhave a tumbler and I like to talk to you about my writing career. I'm a published author.\n\n21:55.880 --> 22:03.440\nI've had three poems about sesame seeds. I shouldn't have made her a woman because\n\n22:03.440 --> 22:08.800\nshe was a sexist. Make it a guy. Make it a guy. But keep the sesame seeds.\n\n22:08.800 --> 22:16.320\nYeah. I'm a published author. I'm a published author. I sent a thing in through an envelope\n\n22:16.320 --> 22:20.200\nand they published in the quarterly farm report. Yeah, it doesn't matter. This is how they're\n\n22:20.200 --> 22:35.800\nhere, this person. Here's my blog entries. The Forbidden Stranger. My Forbidden Stranger\n\n22:35.800 --> 22:45.000\ncomes to me in moments that I don't understand. Are you sure this is about writing?\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:48.520\nWell, that you're not supposed to know until the end. They're talking about writing, but\n\n22:48.520 --> 22:51.800\nthey make it sound like they're having an affair. Sounds like a rape fantasy. Soccer\n\n22:51.800 --> 22:59.880\npractice is canceled. The stranger's coming. It comes to that warning. I wrestle with him\n\n22:59.880 --> 23:05.400\nin the mid-afternoon. My husband wishes I wouldn't do it so much, but I have to. And\n\n23:05.400 --> 23:10.720\nit's like, oh, you're talking about writing. Hey, I'm reading your writing right now. You're\n\n23:10.720 --> 23:20.200\ndescribing you suck. You're a terrible writer. Of course, it's fun for you. Yeah, oh, I am\n\n23:20.200 --> 23:32.560\nsorry. Yes. Writing is like you are in a prison cell with God and he has his way with you\n\n23:32.560 --> 23:40.080\nand you do what you can to stay alive. You exchange whatever favors you have to exchange.\n\n23:40.080 --> 23:44.600\nYou just, it is the reality. How confident or unconfident are you that you, the next,\n\n23:44.600 --> 23:47.440\nbecause you have these two script deals coming up? Because they're both going to suck. Everything's\n\n23:47.440 --> 23:52.520\ngoing to suck. Honestly, do you think that you're going to, like, I got to eat a turd.\n\n23:52.520 --> 23:56.000\nIt's got to happen. Because community was awesome. How good are the next two things\n\n23:56.000 --> 24:01.280\ngoing to be? How, that doesn't work. That's how it works. Are you just projecting that\n\n24:01.280 --> 24:08.000\nto be, you know, like both, yes, to be, to pray to God that I can somehow squeak through,\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.560\nbut also. But you're not confident you're going to go hit these out of the park after\n\n24:10.560 --> 24:14.280\nwhat you've learned from writing on that show for three years? Yeah, how could, it just\n\n24:14.280 --> 24:19.560\ndoesn't, like, look at anybody. Like, somebody shouts somebody's name out who went from hit\n\n24:19.560 --> 24:26.120\nto hit, like, or not hit to hit. Awesome thing to awesome thing. Like, like, Charlie\n\n24:26.120 --> 24:34.240\nKaufman. No, I'm not, I'm not laughing at you, yelling at others. Babe Ruth literally\n\n24:34.240 --> 24:39.280\nwent from hit to hit. Yeah, there's just writers, just writers, just writers. Charlie\n\n24:39.280 --> 24:49.200\nCharlie Kaufman, Larry David. Yeah, all right, fine. Okay. Bar raised. I'm Charlie Kaufman,\n\n24:49.200 --> 24:56.600\nLarry David, or the next two things are going to suck a horrible giant turd shaped dick.\n\n24:56.600 --> 25:02.640\nDick shaped turd. And there's the title of our episode. Now edit it out. Make it seem\n\n25:02.640 --> 25:07.280\nlike a better writer. Turd shaped dick. It stays in. I remind you this section is called\n\n25:07.280 --> 25:12.160\nthings I'm not allowed to complain about without making people hate me. But it's not called\n\n25:12.160 --> 25:15.960\nthe section where I'm not allowed to scrutinize. No, no, no, no, no, no, I wouldn't mean you.\n\n25:15.960 --> 25:21.240\nI'm just telling them because they start, they're getting a little bummed out. But sit\n\n25:21.240 --> 25:34.600\nthrough it. Just a command. It's not a bargain. Tolerate it. So Romney did win. I have too\n\n25:34.600 --> 25:40.600\nmany TVs. Moving on. Wait, yes. Yes, you do, by the way. I have too many TVs. I was up\n\n25:40.600 --> 25:44.360\nwith Dan as an upstairs thing. Normally when you watch the movie at Dan's new place, you\n\n25:44.360 --> 25:48.680\nwash it downstairs over the TV. What was it, like a 50 inch? It was pretty big, right?\n\n25:48.680 --> 25:53.480\n60? I don't know. It was a big phone. It was a big TV. And you'd watch it down there.\n\n25:53.480 --> 25:58.160\nAnd then I went over to watch Labyrinth again before our last episode to refresh ourselves\n\n25:58.160 --> 26:04.520\nand I'm moving it down and I don't know or much like. And that's okay. It's a good living.\n\n26:04.520 --> 26:09.840\nIt's got problems. But I was sitting downstairs eating KitKats, the orange, the shitty orange\n\n26:09.840 --> 26:13.480\nHalloween KitKats. They probably taste the same, but they don't fucking taste the same\n\n26:13.480 --> 26:17.560\nbecause they're orange and it's gross. I feel like they step on them a little bit.\n\n26:17.560 --> 26:23.000\nYeah. To put it in wire terms. Also, don't convince me that chocolate can be any color\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:27.400\nand taste as good as your shitty brown chocolate. It should be brown for a reason. I feel like\n\n26:27.400 --> 26:31.720\nthere's a stringer bell of Reese's at the Reese's plant that's like, are we ready for\n\n26:31.720 --> 26:36.160\nHalloween, man? No, no, there's more kids than usual this year. They're all dressed as shit\n\n26:36.160 --> 26:42.600\nand they're all gonna, they all need Reese's. Step on it. We can't step on a chocolate, man.\n\n26:42.600 --> 26:46.000\nThe whole thing is chocolate. Put more orange chalk on it, motherfucker. I don't have to tell\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:52.200\nyou this shit. It's the wire. The wire. Timely. Most of you are nine.\n\n26:52.200 --> 26:56.080\nSo I'm downstairs waiting to watch this movie and then Aaron yells, Jeff, no, we're watching\n\n26:56.080 --> 27:01.080\nupstairs. I didn't know that you had the upstairs movie arena like all done and he's got this\n\n27:01.080 --> 27:06.560\nbig room with a big, bigger TV screen, movie screen, whatever the fuck. But there's another\n\n27:06.560 --> 27:11.040\nroom next to it, which is as large or larger and there's another giant screen in that one.\n\n27:11.040 --> 27:14.720\nNot as big as the one that we're gonna go in with a big couch, but there's a screen\n\n27:14.720 --> 27:23.560\nlike a 60-inch screen and... 80. 80? Wait, no, in the first room. That's a bar room.\n\n27:23.560 --> 27:29.560\nA 60-inch screen. I'm about to hang a hard right into a room with an 80-inch screen,\n\n27:29.560 --> 27:33.720\nbut before then, I'm bringing pizza in. I'm putting pizzas down and there's a 60-inch\n\n27:33.720 --> 27:38.960\nscreen and I'm looking at that screen and I turn around. So that screen is about, let's\n\n27:38.960 --> 27:44.920\nsay, seven feet from my face and I turn around and there's a 40-inch screen three feet from\n\n27:44.920 --> 27:50.040\nmy face. Because I moved the couch. So you have to be looking at something and then when\n\n27:50.040 --> 27:54.600\nI moved the couch, the 60-inch became obsolete. It's just above a couch now. So if you're\n\n27:54.600 --> 27:58.040\nsitting on that couch, there's just a TV behind your head. I could put like trees or something\n\n27:58.040 --> 28:03.160\nand it'd be like hanging out like, oh, it's like a future window. It's like Logan's run,\n\n28:03.160 --> 28:06.920\na girl can appear on it and go, would you like to spend the night with me? But it's\n\n28:06.920 --> 28:12.320\nnot for actual viewing. I just don't know what to do with it. I'll sell it. I don't\n\n28:12.320 --> 28:16.760\nknow. But I have too many TVs. It's enough. That's enough talking about it. It's uncharismatic.\n\n28:16.760 --> 28:22.800\nToo many TVs. I do like that Dan's got this room. When Dan first bought the house, I\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:27.000\nwas up there with him and it used to be someone like the old patriarch of the house's office.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:32.040\nIt was this giant cabinetry thing going on. It took up like a lot of the room. It was\n\n28:32.040 --> 28:37.320\na doorway that was too small. It was a giant desk in there. And I was like, maybe this\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:42.040\nis the movie room. Where would you sit? He's got them all figured out in this big, beautiful\n\n28:42.040 --> 28:46.120\nsectional couch. But there really is nowhere to set the drink.\n\n28:46.120 --> 28:47.440\nThe coffee table's coming.\n\n28:47.440 --> 28:51.000\nNo, but I thought something and you said it without me saying it. We're going to move\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:54.480\nthe couch away from the wall about three inches. We're going to put a little bar rail behind\n\n28:54.480 --> 28:56.800\nit. That's exactly what I was thinking.\n\n28:56.800 --> 29:02.960\nIf you buy a home, kids, it becomes Joan River's face. It becomes like this, or Minecraft. It\n\n29:02.960 --> 29:09.880\njust becomes like this constant, like, well, if I moved this wall back three pixels, it's\n\n29:09.880 --> 29:14.440\njust, it'll be your new thing. Or you're not a dick like me.\n\n29:14.440 --> 29:21.560\nBut I will say that you're not the most aesthetically minded person I've ever known, but your house\n\n29:21.560 --> 29:23.480\nis coming together wonderfully. It looks great.\n\n29:23.480 --> 29:27.840\nWell, you bring up my next point, my final complaint, the ending tonight segment called\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:32.920\nthings I'm not allowed to complain about. Girlfriend, not getting along with my designer.\n\n29:32.920 --> 29:45.000\nYou guys know how it is. Yeah, never from the beginning. He's not a good person. They\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:51.720\ndon't get along right. And I think they both fit into the same. If you have a designer,\n\n29:51.720 --> 29:58.400\nthis is coming into your home to do what a girlfriend would do if she moved in with you.\n\n29:58.400 --> 30:03.680\nThat sounded sexist, right? Kind of. But I don't mean that that's what women are supposed\n\n30:03.680 --> 30:08.120\nto do. I just mean that a person that you're bringing into your home to go, what kind of\n\n30:08.120 --> 30:11.960\ncouch should I get and all this stuff? They're trampling on...\n\n30:11.960 --> 30:18.200\nYou're bringing a professional male nest builder into the nest.\n\n30:18.200 --> 30:22.320\nReally me typically. Maybe this is not true for half the guys here. I shouldn't say this\n\n30:22.320 --> 30:28.240\nis a thing. But for me, I have no opinions about this stuff. So that professional nest\n\n30:28.240 --> 30:33.480\nbuilder comes in, no wrong answers from him, kind of. He is functioning as a girlfriend\n\n30:33.480 --> 30:38.440\nin that capacity because I am going, I don't know, whatever you want. I don't care about\n\n30:38.440 --> 30:42.520\nthis shit. I secretly do, but I don't know anything about it. I don't know what I'm talking\n\n30:42.520 --> 30:48.160\nabout. So it's a friction. There's a friction there. They don't like each other.\n\n30:48.160 --> 30:54.720\nHow does that manifest? He buys a pillow and she says it's itchy.\n\n30:54.720 --> 31:01.720\nIs it itchy? It's itchy. Aaron's right. But I'm not going to have\n\n31:01.720 --> 31:07.360\nAaron decorate my house. Jeff, these are things I'm not allowed to complain about.\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:09.600\nDan? Thank you.\n\n31:09.600 --> 31:15.880\nThat's the end of the... Okay, I'd like to make one more addition. I think the audience\n\n31:15.880 --> 31:21.160\nis a little too assertive with their end of the segment applause. I think you've gotten\n\n31:21.160 --> 31:26.160\na little too big for your clapping britches. You don't think I know what that means? Okay.\n\n31:26.160 --> 31:31.240\nAll right. Now we've reached an agreement. All right, I think...\n\n31:31.240 --> 31:36.120\nWhat we do need out of an audience is to be less transparent when they really want to\n\n31:36.120 --> 31:41.320\nget out of here. We've gone too long. We need it to sound more organic when an applause\n\n31:41.320 --> 31:44.560\nthing comes up because sometimes it sounds like you guys just want us to get off the\n\n31:44.560 --> 31:49.200\nstage. Don't confuse them. Don't put too much on them.\n\n31:49.200 --> 31:54.640\nLike I kind of trickle in. Have a kind of dovetail in it when an applause is... That\n\n31:54.640 --> 31:58.880\nwas spontaneous. The show is over applause. Here's an example. Throwing my designer into\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:05.200\nthe bus. He was unwrapping a plastic bag. I had a carpet in it. He said, so what are\n\n32:05.200 --> 32:14.200\nyou guys doing for the holidays? We're going to London and Amsterdam. London's dirty.\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:19.080\nIt's not a... It's a silly thing to say to somebody that just told you they're going\n\n32:19.080 --> 32:25.800\nto London. What are we supposed to do? Send an advanced team to sweep? We'll try to pick\n\n32:25.800 --> 32:30.520\nup some shit while we're there. At Christmas time, it's covered in snow. It looks gorgeous.\n\n32:30.520 --> 32:36.000\nWe won't go to London. It'll be white and beautiful.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:43.480\nJeff, what are you... Just to continue the mire that is tonight. It's like a molasses\n\n32:43.480 --> 32:48.200\nswamp that we've sunk into. It's sad. It's dark. It's a dark, dark energy. It's a terrible\n\n32:48.200 --> 32:51.240\nshow. It's awful. No, we started off... We were killing the...\n\n32:51.240 --> 32:54.480\nNo, no, no, no. Well, that political shit. It's hot button. That's John Stewart shit.\n\n32:54.480 --> 32:57.880\nIt's a child's play. He does it every week. It doesn't matter.\n\n32:57.880 --> 33:00.800\nYou keep insisting on this thing. I'm not about to complain about a thing. And then\n\n33:00.800 --> 33:04.120\nyou ended by saying that wasn't very charming of me to complain about things.\n\n33:04.120 --> 33:07.160\nYou're right. You're right. I backpedaled too much. I should fucking barrel ahead. That's\n\n33:07.160 --> 33:13.720\nmy last complaint. Myself. I handle these complaints sections too bad. Now, applaud,\n\n33:13.720 --> 33:25.960\nTazoo. All right. Moving on. What do you tip? What the fuck are you supposed to tip? I'm\n\n33:25.960 --> 33:35.800\nup to like 38% now. I don't know. You see in movies, I'm way above 20% now. And it doesn't\n\n33:35.800 --> 33:40.320\nmatter if you do a bad job or a good job. I can't risk that. I don't know, karmically,\n\n33:40.320 --> 33:44.440\nlike what I'm supposed to do. I've never... There's not a single person that has ever\n\n33:44.440 --> 33:51.960\nserved me well or served me that hasn't gotten anything under a 20% tip in the last million\n\n33:51.960 --> 33:58.640\nyears. I just... By default, it's 20% for sure. And then I'll like round up even more out\n\n33:58.640 --> 34:09.400\nof mathematical insecurity. I don't understand it. I hate to rehash the old Tarantino thing\n\n34:09.400 --> 34:14.080\nfrom the beginning of Reservoir Dogs, but it is a weird question because we've made\n\n34:14.080 --> 34:20.080\nit part of our economy and it doesn't make any sense because it's supposed to be a reward\n\n34:20.080 --> 34:26.840\nand I'm just tipping everybody. All right. That was my last complaint. What do you think\n\n34:26.840 --> 34:31.360\nit should be? I don't... No, there's no should. If you told me it should be 50%, I'd believe\n\n34:31.360 --> 34:36.880\nyou. What would make you comfortable? If you set the bar somewhere, what would you want\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:42.920\nto say? I'm telling you, I swear to God, if you raised me in a society where it was customary\n\n34:42.920 --> 34:49.120\nto tip 50% of what the thing was, I would go, okay. But I would also go, the word customary\n\n34:49.120 --> 34:54.720\ntip is kind of a weird... It spirals you into a... What is going on here? I believe that\n\n34:54.720 --> 34:57.880\neverybody should tip for services like that. It's part of their... It's part of the gig\n\n34:57.880 --> 35:01.240\nfor service bartenders, waiters, things like that. But you know they've systematized it.\n\n35:01.240 --> 35:07.760\nThey've institutionalized it. Yeah. But also, under tipping is bad. I think 20% is perfect,\n\n35:07.760 --> 35:12.200\nbut whatever you can afford. And also, over tipping is not necessary and also can be a\n\n35:12.200 --> 35:21.680\nsign of... It can be ostentatious. You shouldn't feel the need to tip 50%, 60%, 100%. Some people\n\n35:21.680 --> 35:26.560\ndo and have got money. I might do that because it just skews the whole thing. I think just\n\n35:26.560 --> 35:30.880\nbe an honest 20% tip or let's all do that. It skews what whole thing? Is there some kind\n\n35:30.880 --> 35:34.840\nof like... Should we meet on a like a skull and bones island? Did we talk about... There's\n\n35:34.840 --> 35:39.160\none bartender at Little Dom's who I've known for a long, long time and he said... Name him\n\n35:39.160 --> 35:43.160\nor it didn't happen. If I knew anybody's name on that place, I would win a fucking\n\n35:43.160 --> 35:48.920\ntip. The turnover rate is amazing, but I also don't know the names of the people that have\n\n35:48.920 --> 35:54.480\nbeen working there for three years. You friend Dave came in the other day. Dave Lyons. Yeah,\n\n35:54.480 --> 35:59.640\nDave Lyons, a great friend of ours. He was the Locations Manager for Community, right?\n\n35:59.640 --> 36:06.640\nAnd he's like, yeah, really nice guy. Great tipper. He said it to me like, you could learn\n\n36:06.640 --> 36:16.760\na couple things about Dave Lyons. I'm like... Lots of ball play. Yeah. Lots of ball play.\n\n36:16.760 --> 36:21.360\nOne of the community writers, a girl, Hilary Winston, she might be naming her because I\n\n36:21.360 --> 36:24.720\nthink this is probably in her book. Hilary Winston was a community writer season two.\n\n36:24.720 --> 36:29.680\nI'm sure she tells a story in her book because she tells everything, but she shared this\n\n36:29.680 --> 36:34.840\nstory about breaking up with a guy. It was a very amicable breakup. It was one of those\n\n36:34.840 --> 36:38.640\nvery healthy like, huh, we're breaking up. We both want to break up. Let's just break\n\n36:38.640 --> 36:43.800\nup. Like, it's cool. Like, oh, yeah, I guess we're just... It's not going to work out for\n\n36:43.800 --> 36:49.880\nboth of us. And at some point in the conversation, he's like, yeah, I think she set herself up\n\n36:49.880 --> 36:58.280\nby going like, ha, this feels so good. Any thoughts? And he's like, yeah, next time around,\n\n36:58.280 --> 37:07.480\nnext guy, a little more ball play. Awesome. Amazing. Amazing of her to ask, amazing of\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:14.120\nher to answer. Amazing answer. What, what? Good thing that broke up for sure. Wait, the\n\n37:14.120 --> 37:20.240\nidea that he's saying, we're breaking up for maybe a lot of reasons, maybe just one reason.\n\n37:20.240 --> 37:24.560\nFor this guy, yeah. I mean, if ball play is that important, and he never mentioned it,\n\n37:24.560 --> 37:28.880\nlike, what kind of... He clearly doesn't love her. It's not going to miss her if he's suggesting\n\n37:28.880 --> 37:33.320\nthat the next guy she's with gets all the ball play. Give him something. Give, please.\n\n37:33.320 --> 37:38.080\nThis is for the cause. Honor me. Give the next guy you're with all the ball play I never\n\n37:38.080 --> 37:43.240\ngot. That's why... Well, he loves her. He wants her to be happy. Yeah, be happy. And he knows\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:48.080\nthat she'll continue to get dumped if she doesn't play with your balls enough. That's\n\n37:48.080 --> 37:53.680\nwhat he's saying. Like, that's why the relationship didn't work out. It's not because I'm the\n\n37:53.680 --> 38:00.120\nkind of guy that gives notes like more ball play. It's not related to that at all. I'm\n\n38:00.120 --> 38:08.800\njust a regular guy. You, however, you are on the precipice of a life of loneliness. You just\n\n38:08.800 --> 38:16.320\ngot to play with those balls a little more. Look at them. They're perfect. There's only one more\n\n38:16.320 --> 38:20.440\nthing in my Evernote file, and then we're cast adrift, which... And then that's why we'll bring\n\n38:20.440 --> 38:29.600\nup Spencer. I love being adrift. See, you knew the Harry Potter series was over, right? No. I thought\n\n38:29.600 --> 38:32.680\nthey were done making movies, but then there's always another book that comes out, right? I don't\n\n38:32.680 --> 38:39.480\nknow. I just don't know. Nobody say anything out loud, because we exist in a fascinating vacuum\n\n38:39.480 --> 38:48.920\nhere. I'm curious how, between the two of us, who knows more about Harry Potter? I would guarantee\n\n38:48.920 --> 38:55.000\nthat you know more about Harry Potter than I did. Okay. I've never read the books. You imply\n\n38:55.000 --> 39:03.280\nthat I've read the books. You don't read books. Yeah. I have seen all of the movies once. All\n\n39:03.280 --> 39:10.920\nright. Show us. Raise your hand if you consider yourself a Harry Potter... Adam Goldberg's hand\n\n39:10.920 --> 39:15.240\nshut up. No, we didn't say stand up. He's already getting up. We didn't say stand up, but his hand\n\n39:15.240 --> 39:21.000\nwent up. We said raise your hand, and his hand is already in the air. Raise your hand if you're\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:25.880\nvery familiar with the Harry Potter books to the point. And also, if you're relatively comfortable\n\n39:25.880 --> 39:31.320\ngetting up on stage and what I would have you do is... Adam, don't be bashful now. His hand's\n\n39:31.320 --> 39:37.760\nbashfully up. We have about eight or nine hands in the air, right? I see three. Okay. One, two,\n\n39:37.760 --> 39:42.880\nthree, four, five, six. How do we choose? Well, we've been unfair to women tonight. I've heard\n\n39:42.880 --> 39:48.160\nmyself say some sketchy, possibly sexist things, so let's make it a woman. All right. So now we're\n\n39:48.160 --> 39:51.680\ndown to her. All the women. There's two that raise your hand up front. Are there other women in\n\n39:51.680 --> 39:55.720\nthe back that raise their hands as well? Well, who cares? I mean, they obviously got here too late.\n\n39:55.720 --> 40:00.040\nOf the two up front, which of you thinks you're the most confident about your knowledge?\n\n40:00.040 --> 40:08.920\nDid you call yourself a level seven Slytherin? What's your name? Fedora. Oh, Fedora. I remember\n\n40:08.920 --> 40:17.600\nthat name and that hat from the Jareth contest. All right, Fedora. Let's do five questions.\n\n40:17.600 --> 40:25.680\nIf you can think of them, don't worry about it. We'll edit it. Just ask a kind of like trivia\n\n40:25.680 --> 40:31.000\nquestion about Harry Potter and see who between me and Jeff knows. Oh, brother. And I mean,\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:37.680\nget basic at first. Okay. How hard do you want me to make this? Start off basic. Find the limits\n\n40:37.680 --> 40:44.400\nof our ignorance. Okay. I'll tell you some basic things. I bet neither of us know how many movies\n\n40:44.400 --> 40:48.480\nthere are. I do not know how many. Definitely. I don't know the number. I would be guessing\n\n40:48.480 --> 40:55.960\nbetween estimate seven or eight. I would say five. Well, I mean, yeah, but that's a that's a guess.\n\n40:55.960 --> 41:03.120\nI know I obviously know the word Slytherin. I think you I think we got a ringer. I saw I saw\n\n41:03.120 --> 41:10.880\nthe first one in the movie theater. Yeah, back when I came out nerd with my parents. Okay. How\n\n41:10.880 --> 41:15.280\nabout I start easy and make then make them slightly harder? Yeah, yeah. Dan, you want to make this\n\n41:15.280 --> 41:24.400\ninteresting? Yeah, yeah. 20 bucks. 40 40. All right, 40 bones. I'll bet you my partner, but you\n\n41:24.400 --> 41:34.280\nknow Slytherin. I'll see you a gardener and raise you a tailor. All right, even though I think that\n\n41:34.280 --> 41:38.680\nyou're I think you know more than me. I think this is a bad bet. I'll take the $40 bet. All right,\n\n41:38.680 --> 41:46.760\nwait, if I let's make it let's put it in Harmontown terms. If if if Harmontown terms, if if I win,\n\n41:46.760 --> 41:57.600\nyou have to more ball play. I was trying to think of I don't know. It's stupid. Yeah, let's make it\n\n41:57.600 --> 42:02.560\na nice friendly 40 bucks. Yeah. Here we go. I think you're going to kick my ass around the room,\n\n42:02.560 --> 42:10.240\nbut we'll see. Okay. Can you name the four Hogwarts houses from the four houses? Okay,\n\n42:10.240 --> 42:18.000\nso there's four schools of magic. I know that I know that one is Slytherin, because I said that.\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:24.520\nOne is Slytherin. I didn't know there were four houses. One's called Knuckle Muffins,\n\n42:24.520 --> 42:41.200\none's called Gravy Train, and the Lilita's Kiss, Poughkeepsie, Magic Hat, Dumbledumble,\n\n42:41.200 --> 42:49.120\nDumbledumble, Dumbledumble, and Bumper's Stumpers. No, neither of us now. Neither of us now.\n\n42:49.120 --> 42:51.400\nStart basic, we said.\n\n42:51.400 --> 42:53.160\nName them, name them, name the four.\n\n42:53.160 --> 42:57.000\nGryffindors, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:58.000\nHufflepuff.\n\n42:58.000 --> 42:59.000\nHufflepuff.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:00.000\nBumper Stumpers is close.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:01.000\nWait, no, no.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nMy first one, I said Knuckle Muffet or something.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nWe'll give that one to Jeff, though.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:06.000\nNo, we're not.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:09.000\nBumper Stumpers.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nDoes anybody remember that game show?\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:15.000\nYou had to guess what people's personalized license plates said.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nYeah, it sucked.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nHow did they come up with that idea?\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:23.680\nI was like, when you go into a development meeting and meet and greet with an executive,\n\n43:23.680 --> 43:27.320\nanother thing I'm not allowed to complain about, and they're like, we have this internal\n\n43:27.320 --> 43:31.360\nidea and it's about, you know, when you go to your tenure reunion, it's like you never\n\n43:31.360 --> 43:32.360\nknew.\n\n43:32.360 --> 43:34.880\nSo we want to develop a show, it's called Tenure Reunion, oh, how'd you come up with\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:35.880\nthat idea?\n\n43:35.880 --> 43:38.880\nYou fucking parasite.\n\n43:38.880 --> 43:39.880\nYou 28-year-old.\n\n43:39.880 --> 43:40.880\nThat's an internal idea?\n\n43:40.880 --> 43:41.880\nYou didn't have a writer?\n\n43:41.880 --> 43:47.760\nWell, since it's a reality show, you'll never need one.\n\n43:47.760 --> 43:52.200\nJust get six cameras and go fuck everybody.\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:53.200\nMakes me a little mad.\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:54.440\nI thought you hated writing.\n\n43:54.440 --> 43:58.400\nI do, but I don't want it eliminated as a job.\n\n43:58.400 --> 44:01.000\nI definitely hate watching dishes a lot more.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:02.000\nAll right.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:03.000\nKintradora.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:04.000\nQuestion number two.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:07.600\nFirst of all, do you want to know what the Four Hogwarts houses are in French, because\n\n44:07.600 --> 44:09.600\nthey're really funny?\n\n44:09.600 --> 44:10.600\nWe.\n\n44:10.600 --> 44:11.600\nYes.\n\n44:11.600 --> 44:12.600\nOkay.\n\n44:12.600 --> 44:16.400\nGryffindor is just Gryffindor for some reason.\n\n44:16.400 --> 44:18.400\nNot funny.\n\n44:18.400 --> 44:20.400\nThat's why I started with that one.\n\n44:20.400 --> 44:21.400\nOkay.\n\n44:21.400 --> 44:25.400\nSlytherin is Serpentard, which kind of makes sense.\n\n44:25.400 --> 44:26.400\nSerpentard?\n\n44:26.400 --> 44:27.400\nSerpentard?\n\n44:27.400 --> 44:28.400\nYeah.\n\n44:28.400 --> 44:29.400\nHey, Serpentard.\n\n44:29.400 --> 44:30.400\nYeah.\n\n44:30.400 --> 44:31.400\nNice wand.\n\n44:31.400 --> 44:38.960\nRavenclaw is Ceradoglu, which is kind of a direct translation that kind of makes sense.\n\n44:38.960 --> 44:40.560\nThen Hufflepuff is my absolute favorite.\n\n44:40.560 --> 44:42.560\nHufflepuff is Poof Soufflé.\n\n44:42.560 --> 44:43.560\nPoof.\n\n44:43.560 --> 44:44.560\nThat's on the nose.\n\n44:44.560 --> 44:49.800\nThey would be offended, the French would be offended if we suggested that was their first\n\n44:49.800 --> 44:50.800\nname for her.\n\n44:50.800 --> 44:51.800\nPoof Soufflé?\n\n44:51.800 --> 44:52.800\nPoof?\n\n44:52.800 --> 44:53.800\nPoof.\n\n44:53.800 --> 44:54.800\nPoof.\n\n44:54.800 --> 44:55.800\nOddly enough, that's also a literal translation.\n\n44:55.800 --> 44:56.800\nPoof Soufflé.\n\n44:56.800 --> 44:57.800\nThat's great.\n\n44:57.800 --> 44:58.800\nAll right.\n\n44:58.800 --> 44:59.800\nI love that.\n\n44:59.800 --> 45:00.800\nFour more, Fedora.\n\n45:00.800 --> 45:01.800\nOkay.\n\n45:01.800 --> 45:03.800\nCan either of you name the monster in the Chamber of Secrets?\n\n45:03.800 --> 45:04.800\nSam.\n\n45:04.800 --> 45:05.800\nAll right.\n\n45:05.800 --> 45:06.800\nAll right.\n\n45:06.800 --> 45:07.800\nAll right.\n\n45:07.800 --> 45:08.800\nGood guess.\n\n45:08.800 --> 45:09.800\nThat sounds like a good guess.\n\n45:09.800 --> 45:16.800\nI know it'll have a lot of S's in it because he's a snake monster.\n\n45:16.800 --> 45:21.560\nThere's a snake monster down there.\n\n45:21.560 --> 45:22.560\nIt's not Slytherin.\n\n45:22.560 --> 45:25.240\nThat's the house.\n\n45:25.240 --> 45:27.240\nIt's not Serpantor.\n\n45:27.240 --> 45:30.560\nThat's G.I. Joe.\n\n45:30.560 --> 45:34.360\nIt should be Serpantor.\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:35.360\nCobraCon.\n\n45:35.360 --> 45:39.360\nDon't tell her.\n\n45:39.360 --> 45:40.360\nOkay.\n\n45:40.360 --> 45:41.360\nWhat is it?\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:42.360\nWho's close?\n\n45:42.360 --> 45:43.360\nSam or CobraCon?\n\n45:43.360 --> 45:52.360\nWell, Dan, you're closer because it actually is the name of a

one.\n\n46:08.360 --> 46:10.360\nWho were the marauders?\n\n46:10.360 --> 46:11.360\nWhat?\n\n46:11.360 --> 46:12.360\nIs that part?\n\n46:12.360 --> 46:14.360\nDo you need another one?\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:15.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n46:15.360 --> 46:16.360\nAll right.\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:17.360\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:18.360\nLet's take a stab.\n\n46:18.360 --> 46:19.360\nThat's it.\n\n46:19.360 --> 46:20.360\nWho were they?\n\n46:20.360 --> 46:21.360\nYeah.\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:30.360\nThe marauders were a group of shadow creatures that serve he whose name can't be said.\n\n46:30.360 --> 46:32.360\nThat is totally wrong.\n\n46:32.360 --> 46:33.360\nWould you like another question?\n\n46:33.360 --> 46:34.360\nNo.\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:35.360\nI get to guess, too.\n\n46:35.360 --> 46:36.360\nOkay.\n\n46:36.360 --> 46:37.360\nYeah.\n\n46:37.360 --> 46:44.360\nThe marauders were those guys that came in and tried to screw up the game of the broomstick\n\n46:44.360 --> 46:45.360\nball.\n\n46:45.360 --> 46:46.360\nQuidditch.\n\n46:46.360 --> 46:47.360\nQuidditch.\n\n46:47.360 --> 46:48.360\nQuidditch.\n\n46:48.360 --> 46:51.360\nThe guys that came in and tried to steal the Quidditch sticks.\n\n46:51.360 --> 46:52.360\nOkay.\n\n46:52.360 --> 46:53.360\nWho's closer?\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:54.360\nWho's closer?\n\n46:54.360 --> 47:00.520\nI'm going to say Jeff is closer because he's thinking of the wrong things, but he does\n\n47:00.520 --> 47:02.360\nno sort of what he's talking about.\n\n47:02.360 --> 47:03.360\nI know Quidditch.\n\n47:03.360 --> 47:07.360\nQuidditch.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:08.360\nJeff too.\n\n47:08.360 --> 47:11.360\nI thought it was once, but I'm no on my ship.\n\n47:11.360 --> 47:12.360\nTwo left.\n\n47:12.360 --> 47:13.360\nOkay.\n\n47:13.360 --> 47:15.360\nI got to make the last two really easy because I think that last one was too hard.\n\n47:15.360 --> 47:18.360\nWell, also, don't give a point to somebody who just says Quidditch, Quidditch, like in\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:19.360\nthe middle of it.\n\n47:19.360 --> 47:20.360\nYeah, he was.\n\n47:20.360 --> 47:21.360\nYours had a name of a snake in it.\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:22.360\nThat was a funny name.\n\n47:22.360 --> 47:23.360\nAll right.\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:24.360\nFine.\n\n47:24.360 --> 47:25.360\nEven Steven.\n\n47:25.360 --> 47:26.360\nJeff leads two to one.\n\n47:26.360 --> 47:27.360\n$40 on the line.\n\n47:27.360 --> 47:32.360\nHe was describing a specific scene from oddly enough the right book, but just had the creature\n\n47:32.360 --> 47:33.360\ngo.\n\n47:33.360 --> 47:34.360\nOh, I'm a fan fedora.\n\n47:34.360 --> 47:35.360\nYeah.\n\n47:35.360 --> 47:36.360\nI can tell.\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:40.360\nYou're not the first woman to fall into his sociopathic web.\n\n47:40.360 --> 47:45.360\nIt sounds like he's all into whatever you're talking about.\n\n47:45.360 --> 47:49.360\nBy the way, you're going to be on the Los Feliz streets with a pair of high heels in your\n\n47:49.360 --> 47:52.360\nhand in the morning.\n\n47:52.360 --> 47:53.360\nOkay.\n\n47:53.360 --> 47:54.360\nHailing a cab.\n\n47:54.360 --> 48:01.360\nBoy, Dan, you go down one point, you turn into a misogynist asshole.\n\n48:01.360 --> 48:04.360\nCan't you see how good she looks in black?\n\n48:04.360 --> 48:06.360\nYou look great tonight, by the way.\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:07.360\nYou look wonderful.\n\n48:07.360 --> 48:08.360\nThank you.\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:09.360\nYou're really captivating.\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:10.360\nHere you go.\n\n48:10.360 --> 48:11.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n48:11.360 --> 48:12.360\nHe's a basilisk.\n\n48:12.360 --> 48:13.360\nI was distracted.\n\n48:13.360 --> 48:14.360\nIs the game over yet?\n\n48:14.360 --> 48:15.360\nTwo to one.\n\n48:15.360 --> 48:16.360\nOkay.\n\n48:16.360 --> 48:20.360\nWhat's the name of the headmaster of Hogwarts?\n\n48:20.360 --> 48:22.360\nGrumble snakes.\n\n48:22.360 --> 48:23.360\nDumbledore.\n\n48:23.360 --> 48:24.360\nDumbledore.\n\n48:24.360 --> 48:32.360\nEast side, west side, north side, south.\n\n48:32.360 --> 48:34.360\nMamas in your tinny, dicks in your mouth.\n\n48:34.360 --> 48:38.360\nMotherfucker's got another cocaine and the weak stuff.\n\n48:38.360 --> 48:39.360\nFuck you.\n\n48:39.360 --> 48:40.360\nGot to shoot you in the dick.\n\n48:40.360

48:49.360\nI knew it wasn't grumble snakes.\n\n48:49.360 --> 48:50.360\nI panicked.\n\n48:50.360 --> 48:51.360\nWow.\n\n48:51.360 --> 48:55.360\nAs in the game of quidditch that will cost you.\n\n48:55.360 --> 48:59.360\nYou pause one moment and the robot ball will not follow your broomstick.\n\n48:59.360 --> 49:00.360\nAll right.\n\n49:00.360 --> 49:02.360\nWe're tied up at two to two right now.\n\n49:02.360 --> 49:04.360\nThis is the deciding question.\n\n49:04.360 --> 49:05.360\nYeah.\n\n49:05.360 --> 49:06.360\n$40.\n\n49:06.360 --> 49:10.360\n$40 magical salamanders.\n\n49:10.360 --> 49:12.360\nSalamander notes.\n\n49:12.360 --> 49:14.360\nI should make that the last question.\n\n49:14.360 --> 49:17.360\nThe units of currency, but I'm not that mean.\n\n49:17.360 --> 49:21.360\nWe're guessing on everything except for Dumbledore.\n\n49:21.360 --> 49:24.360\nI freaked out and said grumble snakes.\n\n49:24.360 --> 49:26.360\nNo, grumble snakes

49:34.360\nI hate writing.\n\n49:34.360 --> 49:37.360\nThat's going to be, when I finally start playing Dungeons and Dragons,\n\n49:37.360 --> 49:38.360\nI think that's going to be my character name.\n\n49:38.360 --> 49:40.360\nGrumble snakes.\n\n49:40.360 --> 49:44.360\nGrumble, it's like grumble fish.\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:45.360\nYeah.\n\n49:45.360 --> 49:47.360\nOkay.

Just going to make a mental note of that.\n\n01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.360\nLet's go into the ridge between the butt's plains.\n\n01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.360\nOr above the butt's plains?\n\n01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.360\nI don't know. Some direction involving the butt's plains.\n\n01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.360\nLet's follow that path toward the ridge.\n\n01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360\nFollowing the well trodden path,\n\n01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.360\nyou reach the top of the hill,\n\n01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.360\nseeing the view from the ridge.\n\n01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.360\nYou can see the yellow tent of Yellow Camp,\n\n01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.360\nthe primary camp of Buttsalot Camp.\n\n01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.360\nWait, there were tents. How did you know that?\n\n01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360\nYeah, that's what I mean.\n\n01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360\nIt's like he just was reading the future.\n\n01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.360\nOrp can predict basic objects.\n\n01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.360\nHe's a storyteller, so am I.\n\n01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360\nTo a certain extent.\n\n01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360\nYou guys colluded before this.\n\n01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360\nBarbarians like house musicians.\n\n01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360\nYou know, you're like banana,\n\n01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.360\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360\nThere's changes and there's keys and things.\n\n01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.360\nThis guy's fucking good.\n\n01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.360\nAnd I'm pointing that out by saying\n\n01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.360\nthat he said the same thing I did.\n\n01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.360\nEdit it out.\n\n01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360\nTell me about those tents.\n\n01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360\nThey're far off. There's one central large tent.\n\n01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.360\nAnd there's a banana monster, right?\n\n01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.360\nI mean, we both would put a banana monster.\n\n01:05:28.360 -->

01:05:53.360\nBy the way, why on your guest list,\n\n01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.360\nSpencer is like, he doesn't get paid for his services here,\n\n01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.360\nbut he sends like a guest list.\n\n01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.360\nThere's always a person named Symphony.\n\n01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360\nWait, how does a dungeon master\n\n01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.360\nroll with a chick named Symphony?\n\n01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360\nHe's fucking good at it.\n\n01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360\nWhat?\n\n01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.360\nAll right, there you go.\n\n01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.360\nThank you, Symphony.\n\n01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.360\nThat was my only question.\n\n01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.360\nAll right, so he's got an entourage.\n\n01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.360\nI approached the large yellow tent in the center.\n\n01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360\nYou are a far ways away from it.\n\n01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.360\nYou can't, you can begin your approach.\n\n01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360\nI begin that approach, beginning your approach.\n\n01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.360\nI examine his approach.\n\n01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360\nExamining is your approach.\n\n01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360\nYou notice his gate seems a bit stranger\n\n01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.360\nthan when you first started adventuring.\n\n01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.360\nHey, what gives?\n\n01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.360\nI gotta hang a piss.\n\n01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:44.360\nWell, there you go.\n\n01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.360\nI take a pee and then we resume my approach\n\n01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360\ntowards the yellow tent.\n\n01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.360\nPeeing completed.\n\n01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.360\nYou see the familiar yellow tents of Yellow Camp,\n\n01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.360\nthe first of three Buttsalot encampments.\n\n01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.360\nNearby, you can see a large mound of dirt\n\n01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.360\nas if someone or some army had been digging a massive pit.\n\n01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.360\nThe closer you get, the weirder things appear.\n\n01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360\nNulls are invading Yellow Camp.\n\n01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.360\nYou see many nulls and many barbarians,\n\n01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.360\nbut they don't seem to be fighting.\n\n01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.360\nIn fact, they seem just to be hanging out\n\n01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.360\nand talking with one another.\n\n01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.360\nWait, the barbarians are Buttsalot barbarians?\n\n01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.360\nThese are the Buttsalot barbarians.\n\n01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360\nAnd there's a few armies amassed?\n\n01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.360\nYou can see barbarians from your tribe\n\n01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.360\nintermingling with nulls, large hyena like humanoids.\n\n01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.360\nAll right, so they see our approach\n\n01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.360\nand they're not reacting to it?\n\n01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.360\nWell, I'm a barbarian.\n\n01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360\nWouldn't they be compatriots of mine, friends, possibly?\n\n01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360\nYou're not in a union.\n\n01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.360\nYou certainly identify with their thoughts and feelings,\n\n01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360\nbut it's a tribe thing.\n\n01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360\nYou're not in their tribe, so.\n\n01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.360\nBut, you know, you get in their heads a bit.\n\n01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.360\nI'll let me just follow my lead, man.\n\n01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360\nI'm related to these people.\n\n01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360\nDo your thing.\n\n01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.360\nWe approach them.\n\n01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360\nYou approach them.\n\n01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.360\nDo you want, like, a parade or like an entourage\n\n01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.360\nor like a party to be sarcastic?\n\n01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.360\nI'm just approaching them and going,\n\n01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:17.360\nI hope that my presence is noted as I approach them.\n\n01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360\nAre they ignoring me?\n\n01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.360\nAs you get closer and start to wave your hellos to the barbarians,\n\n01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.360\nthey seem to take note of you before returning to ignoring you.\n\n01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.360\nIt's been a long time since you've last been at the Buttsalot expanse.\n\n01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360\nPerhaps people don't remember.\n\n01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.360\nGreet them in grand fashion.\n\n01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.360\nLet them know who you are, your lineage.\n\n01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.360\nWell, I don't want my first impression to be like a dick.\n\n01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360\nIf they're talking to their enemies.\n\n01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.360\nThey're being dicks.\n\n01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.360\nYou say hello and they just turn back at you.\n\n01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360\nThey're having some kind of summit.\n\n01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360\nI mean, these are...\n\n01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360\nThose gnolls are...\n\n01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360\nWe just killed a bunch of them in the forums.\n\n01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.360\nAll right.\n\n01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360\nLike, we go...\n\n01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.360\nThey don't know that.\n\n01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360\nI know.\n\n01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360\nOr do they?\n\n01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360\nKeep it down.\n\n01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360\nThey might know it.\n\n01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.360\nOh.\n\n01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360\nUh-oh.\n\n01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.360\nOh.\n\n01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.360\nAll right.\n\n01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360\nWe saw nothing.\n\n01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360\nWe did nothing.\n\n01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360\nJust didn't deny everything.\n\n01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360\nOkay.\n\n01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.360\nThis is like a Hope and Crasby movie.\n\n01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.360\nI moved to within three feet of them and clear my throat.\n\n01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.360\nYou clear your throat.\n\n01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.360\nA gnoll and a tall human, dressed in animal skins,\n\n01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.360\neyes you with a sum amount of suspicion.\n\n01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.360\nI give them one of these like...\n\n01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.360\nLike a poor person on a crosswalk,\n\n01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360\nlike looking at a car.\n\n01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360\nLike, what?\n\n01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.360\nAre you going to marry me?\n\n01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.360\nThe human approaches you, eyes locked.\n\n01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.360\nHe has a very aggressive look on his face.\n\n01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.360\nHe says nothing.\n\n01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360\nHe approaches.\n\n01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360\nHe gets within three feet of you.\n\n01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360\nThen two.\n\n01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.360\nHe stops at two.\n\n01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.360\nUh, greetings.\n\n01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360\nYou seem familiar.\n\n01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.360\nSomething about your features reminds me of someone I know.\n\n01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.360\nYeah, I'm a Butz.\n\n01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360\nA Butz?\n\n01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.360\nYou mean a Butz a lot?\n\n01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360\nYeah.\n\n01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360\nThe very same.\n\n01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360\nYeah.\n\n01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.360\nI am the one that didn't come back.\n\n01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.360\nThen you are a former tribesman?\n\n01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.360\nYeah.\n\n01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360\nSharpie, tell them who you are, man.\n\n01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360\nI'm Sharpie Butz a lot.\n\n01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360\nSharpie Butz a lot?\n\n01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360\nSee?\n\n01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.360\nI shouldn't have to say it.\n\n01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360\nSon of Lord Butz a lot?\n\n01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360\nI...\n\n01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.360\nWelcome.\n\n01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360\nJesus.\n\n01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360\nGuys, guys, guys.\n\n01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360\nIt's like pulling teeth with these people.\n\n01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360\nNo, it's just that Sharpie Butz a lot.\n\n01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360\nWalk up and say hello.\n\n01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360\nYou can just go up and say hi to people.\n\n01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.360\nYou're so suspicious of everybody.\n\n01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.360\nYou have to understand, I grew up in a town of 35.\n\n01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360\nYou expect a modicum of...\n\n01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.360\nYeah, but you've been gone for a long time, right?\n\n01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360\nIt's all part of their tune.\n\n01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.360\nJust tell them to say hey.\n\n01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.360\nSeveral human barbarians gather.\n\n01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.360\nWell, the gnolls slowly move away,\n\n01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360\neyeing you with suspicion and caution.\n\n01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.360\nHey, I didn't want to interrupt your summit with the gnolls.\n\n01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.360\nWell, you did.\n\n01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360\nBut I mean, that's fine.\n\n01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360\nLike, what's up?\n\n01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360\nWell, what were you talking to them about?\n\n01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360\nWhat's the beef?\n\n01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360\nWe're just, you know, discussing.\n\n01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.360\nI mean, ever since Lord Butz a lot signed the Butz Blackpaw Treaty,\n\n01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.360\nall the Blackpaw gnolls have been camping with us.\n\n01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.360\nYou see, we figure if we ally,\n\n01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.360\nwe can destroy the dwarves more handily.\n\n01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.360\nUh-oh.\n\n01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.360\nYou guys are lying with gnolls to defeat dwarves?\n\n01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.360\nYes, you see, I mean, it's been a long, long time since you've last been here,\n\n01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.360\nbut the goblins, the kobolds, the wild capybaras, they've all gone.\n\n01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.360\nIt's the gnolls, the dwarves, and the barbarians.\n\n01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.360\nAnd we're all fighting.\n\n01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.360\nAnd the dwarves are bad to you?\n\n01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360\nWe don't like them.\n\n01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360\nThey occupy the mountains to the south.\n\n01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.360\nThe mountains to the south are the last stronghold of the dwarves.\n\n01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:12.360\nIf we can take this stronghold, we'll be able to control the entire Butz Peninsula.\n\n01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:17.360\nI emerge from behind this conversation and force my way right into the center\n\n01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.360\nand say, Sharpie, it is your birthright to regain the former glory of this Butz a lot tribe.\n\n01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.360\nLet's unite with these people and go fight these dwarves.\n\n01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.360\nHold on a second. Where's my dad?\n\n01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360\nI asked this guy.\n\n01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.360\nHe should be in blue camp.\n\n01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.360\nThey're making preparations to send a special envoy to the dwarves\n\n01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360\nto negotiate the terms of surrender,\n\n01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:49.360\nseeing as how the alliance between the gnolls and the barbarians has taken hold.\n\n01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360\nThe dwarves are very, very scared.\n\n01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.360\nThey've been holding up and fortifying their defenses.\n\n01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360\nBut they want stuff.\n\n01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.360\nListen, Clark, guys, a war between humans and dwarves is not...\n\n01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.360\nThey're like the little fuckers.\n\n01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.360\nYou're a little fucker. You're a gnome.\n\n01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.360\nLook, I'm a...\n\n01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360\nYou're a self-loathing gnome.\n\n01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.360\nI'm a barbarian, too.\n\n01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.360\nYou got to ask yourself one day, are you a gnome that became a barbarian\n\n01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.360\nor a barbarian that happens to be a gnome?\n\n01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.360\nIt's from law and order. It was one of the black lawyers had to...\n\n01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360\nI don't see him.\n\n01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360\nI've never seen that show.\n\n01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.360\nIt still applies.\n\n01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:44.360\nThe bottom line is that dwarves and humans have lived in harmony in these parts for millennia.\n\n01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.360\nWell, let's go meet your father. Let's go sit down and meet your father.\n\n01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.360\nListen, how far is blue camp from yellow camp?\n\n01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.360\nJust walk out that door and then back inside.\n\n01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360\nThere's a door in the tent.\n\n01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.360\nA tent flapping an entrance portal.\n\n01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.360\nOh, so we can walk out of one flap and come right back in the same flap and it's just a blue camp?\n\n01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360\nI did.\n\n01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360\nThat's what he said.\n\n01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.360\nThat's how it would seem, yeah.\n\n01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360\nWhat?\n\n01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:15.360\nWe walk out of the yellow flap and come back in a blue flap exiting the tent.\n\n01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.360\nYou turn around to see that yellow camp has vanished, being replaced with blue camp.\n\n01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.360\nA large blue central tent stands in the middle and is flanked by smaller blue tents.\n\n01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.360\nYou don't know what sorcery has caused this, but you go back inside all the same.\n\n01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.360\nYou are now in blue camp.\n\n01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.360\nThere are only human barbarians.\n\n01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.360\nThey're dressed in slightly finer clothes than the ones in yellow camp.\n\n01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.360\nThey're discussing, sitting at tables, sipping drinks.\n\n01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.360\nYou don't see your father.\n\n01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.360\nSo I gotta find my dad.\n\n01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.360\nJust go up and introduce yourself.\n\n01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.360\nSay you're the son of the guy that runs the joints.\n\n01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.360\nSay hello.\n\n01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.360\nI feel like if we play this right, sideline between you and me, Jeff Davis, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.360\nRight.\n\n01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:04.360\nIf I make a big fuss about sitting down with my dad, who's your most famous friend that could come in and play my dad for next week's recording?\n\n01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360\nDo you want me to say?\n\n01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.360\nI don't know if he's in town or not.\n\n01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360\nYou know what I'm thinking.\n\n01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.360\nNo, but will you just tell me if you think you can get somebody?\n\n01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.360\nI will try for one person in particular.\n\n01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360\nAlright, so we'll get it.\n\n01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360\nWe'll make my dad a cameo.\n\n01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360\nI'm just taking the time out and saying that.\n\n01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360\nRight.\n\n01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360\nAlright, and he'll be the dad?\n\n01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360\nYeah.\n\n01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360\nOh, that'd be good.\n\n01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360\nYeah.\n\n01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360\nI think that'd be cool.\n\n01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.360\nAnd it's a role he's born to play.\n\n01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360\nAlright, okay.\n\n01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360\nOkay.\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360\nSpencer, you didn't hear any of that.\n\n01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360\nIt's Timothy Olofant, everybody.\n\n01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360\nNo, I'm okay.\n\n01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:41.360\nI gotta find my dad if it takes all episode.\n\n01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.360\nYou say to no one in particular?\n\n01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360\nNo, I'm saying to you.\n\n01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360\nYou say to the dungeon master?\n\n01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.360\nYeah.\n\n01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.360\nI'm saying don't find my dad this episode.\n\n01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.360\nYeah, no, I know.\n\n01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.360\nYeah, so you're hitting pause right now because the meeting with the...\n\n01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:01.360\nBut we gotta do something to bring it into the Dungeons and Dragons segment.\n\n01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.360\nIs there a little slug we can hit with our sword and win some gold pieces?\n\n01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.360\nBecause they always applaud when we kill something.\n\n01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.360\nMaybe.\n\n01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360\nYou're in blue camp, though, right now.\n\n01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360\nYou don't see your father.\n\n01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.360\nMaybe you shask around and maybe something like exposition will happen for that.\n\n01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.360\nAlright.\n\n01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.360\nI'll be fulfilled.\n\n01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360\nI examine my asking around.\n\n01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.360\nYou examine the asking around.\n\n01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360\nNothing happens.\n\n01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.360\nI step forward and say I being but a little...\n\n01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360\nWhat am I again?\n\n01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.360\nA no barbarian.\n\n01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.360\nMy friend is very shy.\n\n01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.360\nWhere is Lord Buttsalot?\n\n01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360\nLord Buttsalot.\n\n01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.360\nWe've seen him a few days ago, but we believe he's in red camp preparing for battle.\n\n01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.360\nI walk out of the blue flap and go back in the red flap.\n\n01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360\nYou walk out the blue flap.\n\n01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.360\nBehind you, you see the red tent of red camp.\n\n01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.360\nYou enter red camp.\n\n01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.360\nIt's so easy.\n\n01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360\nIt's magic, you guys.\n\n01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360\nI know, I love it.\n\n01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.360\nSometimes you need a no barbarian to get shit done.\n\n01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:13.360\nEntering red camp, you see several generals decked out in full military gear.\n\n01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360\nThey're looking at maps and pushing figures around.\n\n01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.360\nYou still don't see your father.\n\n01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.360\nWhere is Lord Buttsalot?\n\n01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.360\nYou ask, everyone turns and looks at you.\n\n01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.360\nHow did you get into red camp?\n\n01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.360\nThere's a Stratus.\n\n01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360\nThere's a series of magic flaps, you guys.\n\n01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360\nI don't know who's running security at this camp.\n\n01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.360\nWho told you of our flaps?\n\n01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.360\nWe used our keen insight and our awareness of our surroundings.\n\n01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.360\nWell, well, tis the little Buttsalot.\n\n01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360\nReturn, is it not?\n\n01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.360\nYeah, but I'm a big Buttsalot now.\n\n01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360\nYou may have noticed.\n\n01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.360\nBig Buttsalot, so Whatzalot.\n\n01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:05.360\nI remember you, Leonard.\n\n01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.360\nDead-Eyed Duncan.\n\n01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360\nWhat?\n\n01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360\nDead-Eyed Duncan.\n\n01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.360\nI remember you, Dead-Eyed Duncan.\n\n01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360\nMy Leonard was my little brother.\n\n01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:20.360\nYou were a whole family, I always thought that rhyming things constituted a touche.\n\n01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360\nEver since Grandpa Eight Eyes, we just went with it.\n\n01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360\nGrandpa Eight Eyes?\n\n01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360\nRoller Skate Eyes.\n\n01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.360\nSharpie.\n\n01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.360\nHe eyes you with a newfound respect.\n\n01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.360\nIt's that easy, you little fuckers.\n\n01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.360\nThat's why your clan's not in charge.\n\n01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360\nI pull Sharpie aside.\n\n01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.360\nSharpie, ask him if he likes Big Buttsalot.\n\n01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.360\nJesus, for that, all right.\n\n01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.360\nListen, I need to find my dad.\n\n01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:57.360\nI've been out abroad and I've been gaining experience and fighting human centipedes and\n\n01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.360\njust doing all kinds of things.\n\n01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:04.360\nI don't want the story to turn into a different thing.\n\n01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360\nI just want to find my dad.\n\n01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.360\nHe issues a grunting gurgle and the other war generals leave the premises.\n\n01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:16.360\nHe looks to his left and then to his right suspiciously before motioning you to approach closer.\n\n01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.360\nYou know what's going on?\n\n01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:24.360\nI wouldn't tell this to anyone but his own son, but Lord Buttsalot gathered 12 of our\n\n01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.360\nbravest warriors and left out last night.\n\n01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.360\nWe think he was on his way to the Dwarven and Camp, but we can't be sure.\n\n01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.360\nAll right, listen, buddy, you've come with me this far.\n\n01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.360\nI'm going to say the same thing to you when I quit the Sarah Silverman program.\n\n01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.360\nI don't expect you to follow me everywhere.\n\n01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.360\nI think we should go after your father and you should help out and be at his right hand\n\n01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360\nduring this battle against the Dwarves.\n\n01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.360\nI think we should wait until next week when possibly there will be some stunt casting.\n\n01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.360\nI'm glad you said that, but with an emphasis on, I don't think we should fight the Dwarves\n\n01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.360\nand conflicted about this.\n\n01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.360\nIt sounds like a bunch of shenanigans to me.\n\n01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.360\nThe only thing that worries me is that we just kicked a bunch of gnolls asses and your guys\n\n01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360\nare in league with the gnolls.\n\n01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.360\nThey're going to find out that we've killed a bunch of gnolls or are going to be in deep shit.\n\n01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360\nWe don't have to ever talk about that ever again.\n\n01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360\nThey're going to find out?\n\n01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360\nIt will never matter.\n\n01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.360\nThey watch law in order too, probably, don't they?\n\n01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360\nWell, at any rate, we both agree on one thing.\n\n01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:28.360\nWe're heading out on the trail of my father, father, father.\n\n01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:34.360\nAnd you head out on the trail of your father.\n\n01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.360\nAnd so ends our D&D campaign.\n\n01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360\nSpencer, everybody.\n\n01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:46.360\nSpencer.\n\n01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.360\nYeah, that one's transitional.\n\n01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360\nWe're teeing it up for next week.\n\n01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.360\nYeah, I didn't know what we were going to do in that thing, anyway.\n\n01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.360\nYeah.\n\n01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360\nI was probably too hands-on.\n\n01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.360\nBut really, I personally love Spencer and the job that he does.\n\n01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360\nI know that people on Twitter and people listening out there love Spencer.\n\n01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360\nLet's hear it for Spencer.\n\n01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360\nHe's fucking awesome.\n\n01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.360\nYou're saying the love is more genuine for him than it is for Adam Goldberg.\n\n01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.360\nI love Adam Goldberg too.\n\n01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.360\nWhat, what the fuck an A?\n\n01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360\nHow do we end the show every week?\n\n01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360\nYou can just say thank you and you can...\n\n01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360\nI can say let's hear it for Dan Harmon.\n\n01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360\nThey'll clap and we'll get out of here.\n\n01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360\nI won't do.\n\n01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360\nThese people deserve better.\n\n01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.360\nThey deserve something protracted.\n\n01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.360\nThat's your idea, Adam.\n\n01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.360\nDan Harmon won the 2012 election and he gives a thank you speech to Harmon Time.\n\n01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360\nIt's not a bad idea.\n\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.360\nSay it again on mic.\n\n01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.360\nAdam said...\n\n01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.360\nAnd now welcome your new...\n\n01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.360\nIt's hot, it's a hot mic.\n\n01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360\nIt's a hot mic.\n\n01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360\nNo, you're a hot person.\n\n01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360\nThank you.\n\n01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:55.360\nAnd now welcome the new president of the United States, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360\nAll right.\n\n01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360\nWow, I can't believe I won the election.\n\n01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.360\nHere's what I'm going to do.\n\n01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:15.360\nEvery war that we were in, we're going to stay in.\n\n01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.360\nEveryone that was poor is going to stay just as poor.\n\n01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.360\nEveryone that was rich is going to stay just as rich.\n\n01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.360\nNothing is going to change.\n\n01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:33.360\nI'll see you in three and a half years when I start inexplicably defending my position as if it ever existed.\n\n01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:42.360\nI'm a big rich asshole that lords over you and eclipses your life and convinces you that your neighbors are racist pedophiles.\n\n01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:50.360\nThank you for coming and happy 2012 to 2016.\n\n01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.360\nAll right, that was a bummer.\n\n01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360\nNo, that was good.\n\n01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360\nThat was a bummer.\n\n01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360\nAll right.\n\n01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360\nUSA.\n\n01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360\nUSA.\n\n01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360\nUSA.\n\n01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360\nUSA.\n\n01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360\nUSA.\n\n01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360\nUSA.\n\n01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360\nUSA.\n\n01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360\nUSA.\n\n01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.360\nYou trying to take this country away?\n\n01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.360\nHarmontown will remain.\n\n01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.360\nThank you everybody.\n\n01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360\nThanks guys.\n\n01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.360\nHarmontown tonight.\n\n01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.360\nI want to thank Fidora for coming up.\n\n01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.360\nAdam Goldberg is always Spencer.\n\n01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360\nAll right, Dungeon Master.\n\n01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:31.360\nKatie Levine, Zac McKeever, Emily Gordon, Daniel Kramer, Justin Marshall, Mo Fathelbab, Jenny Fine, Shahruz.Shackett.\n\n01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.360\nAnd once again, I'm Jeff Davis, the Comptroller.\n\n01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.360\nOne more time for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon, everybody.\n\n01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:44.360\nGod bless each one of us and God bless America.\n\n01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360\nGod bless you for voting.\n\n01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.360\nGod bless every state.\n\n01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360\nGod bless every...\n\n01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360\nDan Caller right now.\n\n01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360\nWho do you think wins tomorrow?\n\n01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.360\nI'm going to go ahead and call it for Obama.\n\n01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.360\nBut don't be jaded because of that.\n\n01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:03.360\nIf I turn out to be right, don't let that make you think that it doesn't matter.\n\n01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.360\nThank you all.\n\n01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:33.360\nLove you.\n\n","cpu_time":["0.003s"],"str_size":[113188]}
