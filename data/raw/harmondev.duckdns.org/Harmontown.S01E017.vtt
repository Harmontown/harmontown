00:00.000 --> 00:19.200
Hormontown once again is in session. Welcome everybody. How are you doing today? Fantastic.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.440
Welcome to Hollywood, California, the Nerdmelt Theater. And thank you for listening to us

00:23.440 --> 00:28.240
out in the podcast universe. Please put your hands together and open your hearts for the

00:28.240 --> 00:30.240
mayor of Hormontown, Dan Hormont.

00:46.880 --> 00:54.640
You guys are fab or modern, whatever that music was. Jeff, it's an important night tonight.

00:54.640 --> 01:01.920
I'm very excited, not because I'm in a good mood. I guess I am, but just narratively and

01:06.640 --> 01:13.040
like kind of a big night for stuttering. Conceptually, you just pointed out in the

01:13.040 --> 01:18.800
green room before we took the stage that we are standing at the precipice of a nexus here.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.440
I didn't know. I really don't follow the politics, but we just did the math in the green room.

01:23.440 --> 01:29.760
Even though right now, tonight in this room, we have no idea who the next president will be,

01:30.960 --> 01:37.040
when this airs, we will know. So we have an opportunity to create multiple timelines,

01:37.040 --> 01:44.080
my favorite, my favorite thing. At least we are living on a razor's edge right now.

01:44.080 --> 01:50.800
We're Schrodinger's nation. Either there's a guy that's still a president that we don't know

01:50.800 --> 01:54.640
anything about, or what happened at all, or there'll be a new guy who seems like a douchebag.

01:55.680 --> 02:01.760
He seems like, yeah, or a lovely guy if he's the president now. If he's not the president,

02:01.760 --> 02:08.880
my head is off to you, sir. Well run campaign, please. And get those jobs, people.

02:11.040 --> 02:16.240
I don't watch the news. I don't like politics. Dan and I don't know the first thing about politics.

02:16.240 --> 02:23.520
Surrender your mind. Don't even pontificate about it. Let's just leap into it. Let's do two different

02:23.520 --> 02:32.880
openings. Same audience, same enthusiasm, if you please. However you want, but like, bring me.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.400
Does somebody have a coin, a quarter? Yeah, let's do it.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.560
All right. Heads, Obama, tails, Romney? Yes. We'll do both.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.600
By the way, just to be fair, we're going to pick like an added debate. They flip coins. Let's see who goes first.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.760
Coin has been flipped. It's Heads, Obama won, so let's bring...

02:53.760 --> 02:57.280
Wait, wait. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's fine. That's fine, that's fine, that you're enthusiastic.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.400
You got him in there. He may or may not have won. He won.

03:00.400 --> 03:05.440
Yeah, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to tell you. That's not how the Electoral College works,

03:05.440 --> 03:13.840
to you guys. We're not Daibold. We don't have the power that you think we wield. We didn't

03:13.840 --> 03:17.920
invest in a bunch of voting machines. God, what if that was? John King would be out of

03:17.920 --> 03:24.440
a job. Holy shit. No, but I was just saying, hold your applause because do the whole opening.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.840
Depending on who wins, we would come down on the right side. You guys pretend that you

03:28.840 --> 03:32.280
haven't seen me yet. All right, so go back out there. Are you going to stay up or make

03:32.280 --> 03:39.280
a drink? Whatever. Okay, we'll start it again. All right.

03:39.280 --> 03:52.280
Harmontown is now in session. Put those democratic hands together for the mayor of Harmontown.

03:52.280 --> 04:08.280
We did it, motherfuckers. We did it. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.

04:08.280 --> 04:16.280
Four more years. Four more years. Fuck you. I love abortions. I mean, I don't love them,

04:16.280 --> 04:21.360
but if I want to love them, I love them. Fucking. No, I just got myself an honorary abortion

04:21.360 --> 04:25.480
last night. I'm in such a good mood tonight, Jeff, because

04:25.480 --> 04:29.360
Obama won. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, though, it was a squeaker. It was a

04:29.360 --> 04:33.040
squeaker. It's fucking weird how every four years it's a squeaker. I don't get it. It's

04:33.040 --> 04:36.880
almost like there's some weird industrial military complex pretending like we have a choice when

04:36.880 --> 04:41.000
we don't actually. Wait, Dan, Dan, Dan, are you saying that voting

04:41.000 --> 04:45.160
for one-of-two people, it was an electoral college, it creates a myth of efficacy that

04:45.160 --> 04:49.240
your vote doesn't matter at all? Jeff, that would be crazy. Who would be incentivized to

04:49.240 --> 04:54.440
do that except a higher echelon of rich people that own everything? Why would all of them

04:54.440 --> 04:59.080
who have everything in common do that to a bunch of poor people who also have everything

04:59.080 --> 05:02.960
in common and outnumber the motherfucker out of them? Why would they do that?

05:02.960 --> 05:05.400
Yeah, but what's in it for them? Why would they lie to us about it?

05:05.400 --> 05:14.440
I don't know. I just love it that Obama won! It feels good because, and here's why it feels

05:14.440 --> 05:21.880
good because that other guy was fucking creepy. I can't believe in a field of Republican candidate

05:21.880 --> 05:24.560
choices. I mean, there were some weirdos in there.

05:24.560 --> 05:30.400
They're down to Mormons now. Next year there will be a guy with a snake for a necktie.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.440
Next year? It's every year, right? Well, it will be because there's a black guy in the

05:35.440 --> 05:38.440
White House. It'll be every year now. They're going to change the rules in the Congress.

05:38.440 --> 05:42.800
I remember right up until the very moment that Pennsylvania finally got their head out of

05:42.800 --> 05:50.640
their ass and fucking just barely went through Obama because, boy, was that a swing state.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.240
But I remember thinking, this guy Romney, it always seemed like a joke that he didn't

05:54.240 --> 05:55.960
like. No, he was constantly a joke. Here's some

05:55.960 --> 06:01.720
other names that you don't remember. Steve Forbes, I don't know, just Pab Rasmussen.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.000
The name names, especially on the Republican side. I mean, there's a million on the Democrat

06:06.000 --> 06:12.680
side too, but it's so weird. We will never thank God to hear the words John McCain again.

06:12.680 --> 06:19.280
He revealed himself in the final stages to be so vile, and right at the end there, Romney

06:19.280 --> 06:24.360
just went radio silent. They just fucking turned into, that's what an alligator does,

06:24.360 --> 06:28.720
right? It just turns into a pair of eyes above swamp level.

06:28.720 --> 06:35.560
That's what a cat does right before it pounces. I thought, Jeff, for a second that something

06:35.560 --> 06:41.600
shady was about to happen, but it turns out we still live in a completely Democratic nation.

06:41.600 --> 06:46.040
What are you talking about the big dispute in Indiana? The big voter fronting in Indiana.

06:46.040 --> 06:52.080
Oh shit, that thing that happened where people thought that Obama's dick.

06:52.080 --> 06:57.000
That was a ballot. They counted his dick as a ballot.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.800
They kept punching it. It turns out 70-year-old women who fought

07:02.800 --> 07:13.080
in the World War II, dicks can be ballots to them, because back then paper was made

07:13.080 --> 07:20.880
of hemp before pot was illegal. So you were allowed to back then tattoo your presidential

07:20.880 --> 07:29.520
choice from overseas onto a slave's dick and send him to America, and it was an absentee

07:29.520 --> 07:34.240
ballot. But this is Indiana. This is all a bunch of bullshit. The point

07:34.240 --> 07:40.920
is 70% of Indiana was unaccounted for, and it was a slave. But anyways, Obama won. It

07:40.920 --> 07:44.960
was great. All right. Or did he?

07:44.960 --> 08:04.840
We'll come in. Armageddon is back in session. Put your fascist hands together for the fuel

08:04.840 --> 08:20.440
of Armageddon. 10 armors. Yeah, I don't know. Sorry. How's everyone doing in there?

08:20.440 --> 08:25.680
Four years. Four years. Let's hope this one isn't eight. Yeah, I don't know.

08:25.680 --> 08:30.680
What the fuck? I'm going to surprisingly, I'm looking at the positive side of it, though.

08:30.680 --> 08:39.360
This is very much to me. We have a new president, everybody in the White House. Mr. Metavius

08:39.360 --> 08:44.840
Romney. I think this is called him. Metavius. We should probably stop colloquializing him.

08:44.840 --> 08:50.200
He's the commander-in-chief. He deserves more respect than that. I support our troops.

08:50.200 --> 08:56.040
I support the people that don't support them. How many people here voted for Mitt? Wow, just

08:56.040 --> 08:58.360
the one. It's weird. It's weird.

08:58.360 --> 09:03.000
California's a blue state. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We barely any of us voted at all. It was fucking

09:03.000 --> 09:07.840
Pennsylvania and Indiana who did it, man. It was motherfuckers. God damn it. This is

09:07.840 --> 09:14.440
swing states. I think, you know, I'm bummed out that I can't get an abortion anymore.

09:14.440 --> 09:20.080
Obviously. Look, we've all known. I mean, this argument's been raging forever. I mean,

09:20.080 --> 09:24.360
we've known that abortions have been that coin landing on its edge every election after

09:24.360 --> 09:30.400
every election. But, Dan, as somebody that was recently fired off of a television sitcom,

09:30.400 --> 09:33.760
you're probably happy to have somebody in office whose main focus is to get you a job

09:33.760 --> 09:38.240
again, right? Yes, yes, no. I just have so much about money and the economy and the trickling

09:38.240 --> 09:43.600
down with the HMOs and the hedge funds. I've seen such a relief because the last thing

09:43.600 --> 09:49.960
you want to do in a giant nation full of people is help people. I just find that repulsive

09:49.960 --> 09:54.560
with them. I don't see how you're going to make money that way and I don't see, you

09:54.560 --> 09:59.120
know, how, obviously, his dad was very poor. But how do you feel about the fact that he

09:59.120 --> 10:04.240
lost the popular vote by 400,000 votes and still won? You know what? I mean, that system

10:04.240 --> 10:06.840
is a place for a reason. The electoral college is a mystery to me. The electoral college

10:06.840 --> 10:12.600
will never understand it. Why does Montana get to decide who wins the election? Because

10:12.600 --> 10:17.320
there's less people there than there are senators or something. Nobody knows. Christy

10:17.320 --> 10:20.680
thinks that people don't know. Nobody's really ever going to have a good grasp of daylight

10:20.680 --> 10:25.680
savings time or the electoral college. And in the last three days, we had them both.

10:25.680 --> 10:31.160
But this is an underdog story. This is important. Like, I think it's good that we live in a

10:31.160 --> 10:34.560
nation now where Romney got elected. Yeah, because you know what? Because anything's

10:34.560 --> 10:39.720
possible. And he's not. Because he won, which is amazing, without a single woman voting

10:39.720 --> 10:44.960
for him. And that's more than half the nation. Yeah, I mean, that just says how bad, first

10:44.960 --> 10:49.240
of all, how much women love Romney. Because you know, like, women are allowed, you know,

10:49.240 --> 10:52.800
you're picturing your mom with the rolling pin and she's telling you like, well, what

10:52.800 --> 10:57.480
your father says is best. But she gets to pull a curtain still. They haven't revoked

10:57.480 --> 11:04.320
that yet. Not yet. She can actually secretly vote for Obama. And she didn't. Well, also,

11:04.320 --> 11:09.040
they just also women just don't turn out to vote. Women don't care about the electoral

11:09.040 --> 11:14.520
process. They love making the little pancakes with their rolling pins. That's their vote.

11:14.520 --> 11:22.240
They cast it every time they flip a flapjack. I vote for more griddles. I'm more disturbed

11:22.240 --> 11:26.800
that women are still using rolling pins on pancakes because that's, well, yeah, I don't

11:26.800 --> 11:34.040
you make them flat that way. I need a wife. Thank you. Thank you, Mitt Romney, for your

11:34.040 --> 11:42.000
new Mormon every no husband left behind program. No pancake over an eighth of an inch program.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.840
I thought I could now have 95 wives. All right, so end our political segment for tonight.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.760
Let's start. Let's let's reset. Everyone's got a bad taste of their mouth. They feel

11:51.760 --> 11:56.400
like Mitt Romney won the election. Can we just reset it and pretend elections don't matter

11:56.400 --> 11:59.680
and start Harmontown? I'm going to do it, but I'm going to play without. I don't know.

11:59.680 --> 12:04.320
I'm looking at a song off of Zach, our tech guys iPod here. I'm going to restart the show

12:04.320 --> 12:07.480
with the song. I don't know. All right, I'm just going to crouch. I won't even come up.

12:07.480 --> 12:12.480
Okay, let's see if we have it right.

12:12.480 --> 12:27.480
I'm a town is again in session, everybody. Please put your hands together with a guru

12:27.480 --> 12:37.400
of Harmontown. The election doesn't matter to the black, to the white, to the salt pepper

12:37.400 --> 12:41.120
going to fuck you tonight. I got a mustard to the ketchup. Got a ketchup to the mustard.

12:41.120 --> 12:46.360
Gonna go to your mama. Got a Indian custard. Gonna battle you on the battle. The big hills

12:46.360 --> 12:52.360
gonna fuck your mama. Like your name was Lauren Hill Hill rhymes with Hill gonna take the pill

12:52.360 --> 12:58.080
little jagged pill. Got a Lannis Morissette references. I got a 90s man. Gonna 40 years

12:58.080 --> 13:02.920
old. I got a bad back. Don't know what I'm told. I got a motherfucker. Got a hand on my

13:02.920 --> 13:07.680
head. I got a motherfucker. Gonna make some brand. You don't do it like a flat jack user

13:07.680 --> 13:12.360
rolling pin gonna fuck your mama. If she left one day again, gonna put it in her butt. Gonna

13:12.360 --> 13:21.360
put it in her mouth east, west, north, south. That's been Harvard town. Thank you for coming.

13:21.360 --> 13:26.440
Is that too short? No, no, that felt too too written because the fucking beat broke down

13:26.440 --> 13:29.760
with a east, west, north side. That was too badass. I was like, wait, no, no, wait, that

13:29.760 --> 13:36.800
was improper. I promise you, there's photographs of me not making that up on the way out. I

13:36.800 --> 13:44.000
know that seemed awesome. Then he ruined it by over apologizing for how awesome it seemed.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.560
I think I think review was of course out of breath from rapping review was that embarrassing

13:48.560 --> 13:54.280
moment review that audio will reveal with that that was truly improvised the mustard to the

13:54.280 --> 14:01.320
ketchup to the ketchup to the mustard. Mustard and ketchup makes it. Are you drunk? Adam

14:01.320 --> 14:09.960
Goldberg, can you pour me another drink? Welcome to Romney's America. Yeah. I decided to start

14:09.960 --> 14:31.920
putting him into use just now in this moment. Did you put any ice in it? No. Yes. Wow. That's

14:31.920 --> 14:46.880
mostly ice water. Adam Goldberg, everybody. Mustard to the ketchup to the mustard. It

14:46.880 --> 14:54.880
was bad ass when I ran that with custard. Remember those fucking bad ass fucking. Condiment

14:54.880 --> 15:03.320
wrap. I can smell my own armpits right now. Is that you? I thought it was Adam. No, that's

15:03.320 --> 15:12.520
not an onion. It smells like an anarcho punk. I took off my sweater and it was wafting through

15:12.520 --> 15:17.360
the hole. It's about when you stink up a comic book store, that's like making dirt dirty.

15:17.360 --> 15:23.760
But this isn't your normal level of body odor. This is souped up. It's because fucking Romney

15:23.760 --> 15:28.760
won. It's crazy. Let's do the segment that's me complaining about things that I'm not allowed

15:28.760 --> 15:34.920
to complain about. Thank you. I'm excited about it now. Maybe that'll make it bad. I talked

15:34.920 --> 15:40.080
to my gardener. I talked to him. For those of you who are faithful listeners, one of

15:40.080 --> 15:42.960
my problems that I wasn't allowed to complain about is that I felt like my gardener was

15:42.960 --> 15:48.440
up to no good. My grass is turning brown and it seems like he doesn't give a shit. The

15:48.440 --> 15:52.400
same gardener that the previous owners had for 35 years, well, I'm sure not for he'd

15:52.400 --> 15:59.720
be like a weird Kubrick, like Space Baby. But he was there for a long time. I inherited

15:59.720 --> 16:10.760
him from, that seems politically incorrect. I indentured him, his servitude. I can't find

16:10.760 --> 16:18.120
the right words for the truth. It's okay. Romney won, man. It's all good. Oh yeah, okay.

16:18.120 --> 16:24.680
So I own this guy. I was like, yeah, you've been doing a great job. Continue to do it.

16:24.680 --> 16:30.240
The grass slowly started dying away. I have a feeling, my theory is, I think the old German

16:30.240 --> 16:34.040
lady that lived there before me, I think she was out there every day. I think she loved

16:34.040 --> 16:39.040
her. Clearly, I moved into a house that was cared for by its matriarch. There were Adelweisses

16:39.040 --> 16:42.920
out there. There's just flowers everywhere. Everything's beautiful. It was beautiful.

16:42.920 --> 16:50.040
I moved in and it's dying and it's not just because I'm evil. It doesn't work that way.

16:50.040 --> 16:54.120
It's also because I don't water them. Well, you did call it Danadoo. Isn't that kind

16:54.120 --> 16:59.080
of curses? That should be enough, in my opinion. It's just going to end up as you in a fireplace

16:59.080 --> 17:04.760
in a chair, just complete blackness. But slowly the grass is returning from green to brown.

17:04.760 --> 17:09.040
Again, the heading of this is things I'm not allowed to complain about. So fuck you for

17:09.040 --> 17:13.240
judging me while I complain about it. What do you think the remedy for that is?

17:13.240 --> 17:20.560
Well, I talked to the gardener. And? And I said, seems like the grass is brown now.

17:20.560 --> 17:32.280
And he said, and kind of nodded his head and I was like, is there anything we can do to

17:32.280 --> 17:43.600
make it green? And he said, winter seed, winter seed. There's things we could do. I was like,

17:43.600 --> 17:48.280
could we do, I would like to do. It was 95 degrees today. It's not winter. I would like

17:48.280 --> 17:51.560
to do those things that you're talking about. He rattled off a bunch of things and it was

17:51.560 --> 17:59.680
like, I threw in, I'll pay anything. And he said, I'll invoice you. He's like a teamster

17:59.680 --> 18:05.480
with grass. That's what it is. He was ways leaning on me, waiting to see how much I cared.

18:05.480 --> 18:09.640
I think you're allowed to complain about that. You're just not without sounding like a fucking

18:09.640 --> 18:23.160
dick to a nation of renters. Next thing on my list. My mail program on my computer won't

18:23.160 --> 18:29.600
let me turn it off. All right. On your computer, it won't let you quit the application?

18:29.600 --> 18:35.440
Every time I want to shut down the computer, it says, mail won't let you quit. I used to

18:35.440 --> 18:40.040
be, I wouldn't call myself a hacker in days of old, but I used to know how to make a fucking.

18:40.040 --> 18:47.920
I won the future business leaders of America competition in high school. For computer applications

18:47.920 --> 18:52.840
and business, I wrote a code for Commodore 64 that would run an invoice program. I was

18:52.840 --> 18:58.520
competing with guys I was writing in Pascal Cobalt. I won with my Commodore 64 basic program.

18:58.520 --> 19:07.400
It was like 20 pages long. I won second place. But I was a code monkey. I don't know what

19:07.400 --> 19:15.200
they call him. I was a programmer. I used to make these machines my bitch. You turn into

19:15.200 --> 19:20.200
your grandpa. I remember my grandpa before he died of emphysema. I remember him fighting

19:20.200 --> 19:26.400
to the bitter end with his specs on his nose running his little Mac when they looked like

19:26.400 --> 19:33.160
those little beige machines with a little smile face on him. He's like, how do I, I just

19:33.160 --> 19:42.160
want to make a spreadsheet for the masons. I'm up to 33rd level. It's okay grandpa. It's

19:42.160 --> 19:46.640
beyond you. It doesn't matter. No, I won't. I want to know. I knew how to make a fucking

19:46.640 --> 19:55.880
truck out of sticks. I fought the Nazis and won. I deserve this.

19:55.880 --> 20:01.320
I died because no one cares about his money. Now I'm 40. I can't make these fucking things

20:01.320 --> 20:06.200
work. It's not a warning. It's not a message. It's a complaint. It's not a complaint that

20:06.200 --> 20:09.800
you care about. Fuck you. It's just deeply, deeply sad. It's getting very hard for me

20:09.800 --> 20:14.880
to run my computer. Are you happy kids? Is that what you wanted? You want to shut me

20:14.880 --> 20:22.840
out? Well, guess what? Guess what you're shutting out? The creator of Masterhouse. You just

20:22.840 --> 20:30.920
lost everything I could've told you on Reddit. All right, next thing. I hate writing. I hate

20:30.920 --> 20:39.800
writing. I'm writing a bunch of things for a living and I hate writing. I hate it. Is

20:39.800 --> 20:45.040
that what you keep getting fired from jobs? No, no sir. God damn it. No, don't make that

20:45.040 --> 20:55.000
mistake. I get fired because I love writing. Those shows when they get on the air. The

20:55.000 --> 21:01.600
process is painful and it's terrible. So you're inertia. A writer at rest, it's hard to get

21:01.600 --> 21:05.160
that body in motion. Once it's in motion, it's hard to stop the writing. Here's a popular

21:05.160 --> 21:12.360
analogy that guys, writers use that women love. It's like childbirth. Yes, it's worth

21:12.360 --> 21:18.840
it. Yes, it's wonderful. Yes, it's a miracle. Yes, therefore I like doing it. No, I don't

21:18.840 --> 21:24.760
like doing it. It's terrible. It hurts. It's the worst. I would rather not have to do it,

21:24.760 --> 21:29.680
but I know that if I didn't have to do it, I'd be a shitty person. I don't want to have

21:29.680 --> 21:37.240
to do it. I do want to have to do it. I hate it. Sucks. Fuck you. Hate writing. Stupid.

21:37.240 --> 21:43.200
That's a dumb. I don't like these people who make these blogs that you run across where

21:43.200 --> 21:50.120
they go, like, the joy of creativity. I just like to tell, I'm a mother of three and I

21:50.120 --> 21:55.880
have a tumbler and I like to talk to you about my writing career. I'm a published author.

21:55.880 --> 22:03.440
I've had three poems about sesame seeds. I shouldn't have made her a woman because

22:03.440 --> 22:08.800
she was a sexist. Make it a guy. Make it a guy. But keep the sesame seeds.

22:08.800 --> 22:16.320
Yeah. I'm a published author. I'm a published author. I sent a thing in through an envelope

22:16.320 --> 22:20.200
and they published in the quarterly farm report. Yeah, it doesn't matter. This is how they're

22:20.200 --> 22:35.800
here, this person. Here's my blog entries. The Forbidden Stranger. My Forbidden Stranger

22:35.800 --> 22:45.000
comes to me in moments that I don't understand. Are you sure this is about writing?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.520
Well, that you're not supposed to know until the end. They're talking about writing, but

22:48.520 --> 22:51.800
they make it sound like they're having an affair. Sounds like a rape fantasy. Soccer

22:51.800 --> 22:59.880
practice is canceled. The stranger's coming. It comes to that warning. I wrestle with him

22:59.880 --> 23:05.400
in the mid-afternoon. My husband wishes I wouldn't do it so much, but I have to. And

23:05.400 --> 23:10.720
it's like, oh, you're talking about writing. Hey, I'm reading your writing right now. You're

23:10.720 --> 23:20.200
describing you suck. You're a terrible writer. Of course, it's fun for you. Yeah, oh, I am

23:20.200 --> 23:32.560
sorry. Yes. Writing is like you are in a prison cell with God and he has his way with you

23:32.560 --> 23:40.080
and you do what you can to stay alive. You exchange whatever favors you have to exchange.

23:40.080 --> 23:44.600
You just, it is the reality. How confident or unconfident are you that you, the next,

23:44.600 --> 23:47.440
because you have these two script deals coming up? Because they're both going to suck. Everything's

23:47.440 --> 23:52.520
going to suck. Honestly, do you think that you're going to, like, I got to eat a turd.

23:52.520 --> 23:56.000
It's got to happen. Because community was awesome. How good are the next two things

23:56.000 --> 24:01.280
going to be? How, that doesn't work. That's how it works. Are you just projecting that

24:01.280 --> 24:08.000
to be, you know, like both, yes, to be, to pray to God that I can somehow squeak through,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.560
but also. But you're not confident you're going to go hit these out of the park after

24:10.560 --> 24:14.280
what you've learned from writing on that show for three years? Yeah, how could, it just

24:14.280 --> 24:19.560
doesn't, like, look at anybody. Like, somebody shouts somebody's name out who went from hit

24:19.560 --> 24:26.120
to hit, like, or not hit to hit. Awesome thing to awesome thing. Like, like, Charlie

24:26.120 --> 24:34.240
Kaufman. No, I'm not, I'm not laughing at you, yelling at others. Babe Ruth literally

24:34.240 --> 24:39.280
went from hit to hit. Yeah, there's just writers, just writers, just writers. Charlie

24:39.280 --> 24:49.200
Charlie Kaufman, Larry David. Yeah, all right, fine. Okay. Bar raised. I'm Charlie Kaufman,

24:49.200 --> 24:56.600
Larry David, or the next two things are going to suck a horrible giant turd shaped dick.

24:56.600 --> 25:02.640
Dick shaped turd. And there's the title of our episode. Now edit it out. Make it seem

25:02.640 --> 25:07.280
like a better writer. Turd shaped dick. It stays in. I remind you this section is called

25:07.280 --> 25:12.160
things I'm not allowed to complain about without making people hate me. But it's not called

25:12.160 --> 25:15.960
the section where I'm not allowed to scrutinize. No, no, no, no, no, no, I wouldn't mean you.

25:15.960 --> 25:21.240
I'm just telling them because they start, they're getting a little bummed out. But sit

25:21.240 --> 25:34.600
through it. Just a command. It's not a bargain. Tolerate it. So Romney did win. I have too

25:34.600 --> 25:40.600
many TVs. Moving on. Wait, yes. Yes, you do, by the way. I have too many TVs. I was up

25:40.600 --> 25:44.360
with Dan as an upstairs thing. Normally when you watch the movie at Dan's new place, you

25:44.360 --> 25:48.680
wash it downstairs over the TV. What was it, like a 50 inch? It was pretty big, right?

25:48.680 --> 25:53.480
60? I don't know. It was a big phone. It was a big TV. And you'd watch it down there.

25:53.480 --> 25:58.160
And then I went over to watch Labyrinth again before our last episode to refresh ourselves

25:58.160 --> 26:04.520
and I'm moving it down and I don't know or much like. And that's okay. It's a good living.

26:04.520 --> 26:09.840
It's got problems. But I was sitting downstairs eating KitKats, the orange, the shitty orange

26:09.840 --> 26:13.480
Halloween KitKats. They probably taste the same, but they don't fucking taste the same

26:13.480 --> 26:17.560
because they're orange and it's gross. I feel like they step on them a little bit.

26:17.560 --> 26:23.000
Yeah. To put it in wire terms. Also, don't convince me that chocolate can be any color

26:23.000 --> 26:27.400
and taste as good as your shitty brown chocolate. It should be brown for a reason. I feel like

26:27.400 --> 26:31.720
there's a stringer bell of Reese's at the Reese's plant that's like, are we ready for

26:31.720 --> 26:36.160
Halloween, man? No, no, there's more kids than usual this year. They're all dressed as shit

26:36.160 --> 26:42.600
and they're all gonna, they all need Reese's. Step on it. We can't step on a chocolate, man.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.000
The whole thing is chocolate. Put more orange chalk on it, motherfucker. I don't have to tell

26:46.000 --> 26:52.200
you this shit. It's the wire. The wire. Timely. Most of you are nine.

26:52.200 --> 26:56.080
So I'm downstairs waiting to watch this movie and then Aaron yells, Jeff, no, we're watching

26:56.080 --> 27:01.080
upstairs. I didn't know that you had the upstairs movie arena like all done and he's got this

27:01.080 --> 27:06.560
big room with a big, bigger TV screen, movie screen, whatever the fuck. But there's another

27:06.560 --> 27:11.040
room next to it, which is as large or larger and there's another giant screen in that one.

27:11.040 --> 27:14.720
Not as big as the one that we're gonna go in with a big couch, but there's a screen

27:14.720 --> 27:23.560
like a 60-inch screen and... 80. 80? Wait, no, in the first room. That's a bar room.

27:23.560 --> 27:29.560
A 60-inch screen. I'm about to hang a hard right into a room with an 80-inch screen,

27:29.560 --> 27:33.720
but before then, I'm bringing pizza in. I'm putting pizzas down and there's a 60-inch

27:33.720 --> 27:38.960
screen and I'm looking at that screen and I turn around. So that screen is about, let's

27:38.960 --> 27:44.920
say, seven feet from my face and I turn around and there's a 40-inch screen three feet from

27:44.920 --> 27:50.040
my face. Because I moved the couch. So you have to be looking at something and then when

27:50.040 --> 27:54.600
I moved the couch, the 60-inch became obsolete. It's just above a couch now. So if you're

27:54.600 --> 27:58.040
sitting on that couch, there's just a TV behind your head. I could put like trees or something

27:58.040 --> 28:03.160
and it'd be like hanging out like, oh, it's like a future window. It's like Logan's run,

28:03.160 --> 28:06.920
a girl can appear on it and go, would you like to spend the night with me? But it's

28:06.920 --> 28:12.320
not for actual viewing. I just don't know what to do with it. I'll sell it. I don't

28:12.320 --> 28:16.760
know. But I have too many TVs. It's enough. That's enough talking about it. It's uncharismatic.

28:16.760 --> 28:22.800
Too many TVs. I do like that Dan's got this room. When Dan first bought the house, I

28:22.800 --> 28:27.000
was up there with him and it used to be someone like the old patriarch of the house's office.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.040
It was this giant cabinetry thing going on. It took up like a lot of the room. It was

28:32.040 --> 28:37.320
a doorway that was too small. It was a giant desk in there. And I was like, maybe this

28:37.320 --> 28:42.040
is the movie room. Where would you sit? He's got them all figured out in this big, beautiful

28:42.040 --> 28:46.120
sectional couch. But there really is nowhere to set the drink.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.440
The coffee table's coming.

28:47.440 --> 28:51.000
No, but I thought something and you said it without me saying it. We're going to move

28:51.000 --> 28:54.480
the couch away from the wall about three inches. We're going to put a little bar rail behind

28:54.480 --> 28:56.800
it. That's exactly what I was thinking.

28:56.800 --> 29:02.960
If you buy a home, kids, it becomes Joan River's face. It becomes like this, or Minecraft. It

29:02.960 --> 29:09.880
just becomes like this constant, like, well, if I moved this wall back three pixels, it's

29:09.880 --> 29:14.440
just, it'll be your new thing. Or you're not a dick like me.

29:14.440 --> 29:21.560
But I will say that you're not the most aesthetically minded person I've ever known, but your house

29:21.560 --> 29:23.480
is coming together wonderfully. It looks great.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.840
Well, you bring up my next point, my final complaint, the ending tonight segment called

29:27.840 --> 29:32.920
things I'm not allowed to complain about. Girlfriend, not getting along with my designer.

29:32.920 --> 29:45.000
You guys know how it is. Yeah, never from the beginning. He's not a good person. They

29:45.000 --> 29:51.720
don't get along right. And I think they both fit into the same. If you have a designer,

29:51.720 --> 29:58.400
this is coming into your home to do what a girlfriend would do if she moved in with you.

29:58.400 --> 30:03.680
That sounded sexist, right? Kind of. But I don't mean that that's what women are supposed

30:03.680 --> 30:08.120
to do. I just mean that a person that you're bringing into your home to go, what kind of

30:08.120 --> 30:11.960
couch should I get and all this stuff? They're trampling on...

30:11.960 --> 30:18.200
You're bringing a professional male nest builder into the nest.

30:18.200 --> 30:22.320
Really me typically. Maybe this is not true for half the guys here. I shouldn't say this

30:22.320 --> 30:28.240
is a thing. But for me, I have no opinions about this stuff. So that professional nest

30:28.240 --> 30:33.480
builder comes in, no wrong answers from him, kind of. He is functioning as a girlfriend

30:33.480 --> 30:38.440
in that capacity because I am going, I don't know, whatever you want. I don't care about

30:38.440 --> 30:42.520
this shit. I secretly do, but I don't know anything about it. I don't know what I'm talking

30:42.520 --> 30:48.160
about. So it's a friction. There's a friction there. They don't like each other.

30:48.160 --> 30:54.720
How does that manifest? He buys a pillow and she says it's itchy.

30:54.720 --> 31:01.720
Is it itchy? It's itchy. Aaron's right. But I'm not going to have

31:01.720 --> 31:07.360
Aaron decorate my house. Jeff, these are things I'm not allowed to complain about.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.600
Dan? Thank you.

31:09.600 --> 31:15.880
That's the end of the... Okay, I'd like to make one more addition. I think the audience

31:15.880 --> 31:21.160
is a little too assertive with their end of the segment applause. I think you've gotten

31:21.160 --> 31:26.160
a little too big for your clapping britches. You don't think I know what that means? Okay.

31:26.160 --> 31:31.240
All right. Now we've reached an agreement. All right, I think...

31:31.240 --> 31:36.120
What we do need out of an audience is to be less transparent when they really want to

31:36.120 --> 31:41.320
get out of here. We've gone too long. We need it to sound more organic when an applause

31:41.320 --> 31:44.560
thing comes up because sometimes it sounds like you guys just want us to get off the

31:44.560 --> 31:49.200
stage. Don't confuse them. Don't put too much on them.

31:49.200 --> 31:54.640
Like I kind of trickle in. Have a kind of dovetail in it when an applause is... That

31:54.640 --> 31:58.880
was spontaneous. The show is over applause. Here's an example. Throwing my designer into

31:58.880 --> 32:05.200
the bus. He was unwrapping a plastic bag. I had a carpet in it. He said, so what are

32:05.200 --> 32:14.200
you guys doing for the holidays? We're going to London and Amsterdam. London's dirty.

32:14.200 --> 32:19.080
It's not a... It's a silly thing to say to somebody that just told you they're going

32:19.080 --> 32:25.800
to London. What are we supposed to do? Send an advanced team to sweep? We'll try to pick

32:25.800 --> 32:30.520
up some shit while we're there. At Christmas time, it's covered in snow. It looks gorgeous.

32:30.520 --> 32:36.000
We won't go to London. It'll be white and beautiful.

32:36.000 --> 32:43.480
Jeff, what are you... Just to continue the mire that is tonight. It's like a molasses

32:43.480 --> 32:48.200
swamp that we've sunk into. It's sad. It's dark. It's a dark, dark energy. It's a terrible

32:48.200 --> 32:51.240
show. It's awful. No, we started off... We were killing the...

32:51.240 --> 32:54.480
No, no, no, no. Well, that political shit. It's hot button. That's John Stewart shit.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.880
It's a child's play. He does it every week. It doesn't matter.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.800
You keep insisting on this thing. I'm not about to complain about a thing. And then

33:00.800 --> 33:04.120
you ended by saying that wasn't very charming of me to complain about things.

33:04.120 --> 33:07.160
You're right. You're right. I backpedaled too much. I should fucking barrel ahead. That's

33:07.160 --> 33:13.720
my last complaint. Myself. I handle these complaints sections too bad. Now, applaud,

33:13.720 --> 33:25.960
Tazoo. All right. Moving on. What do you tip? What the fuck are you supposed to tip? I'm

33:25.960 --> 33:35.800
up to like 38% now. I don't know. You see in movies, I'm way above 20% now. And it doesn't

33:35.800 --> 33:40.320
matter if you do a bad job or a good job. I can't risk that. I don't know, karmically,

33:40.320 --> 33:44.440
like what I'm supposed to do. I've never... There's not a single person that has ever

33:44.440 --> 33:51.960
served me well or served me that hasn't gotten anything under a 20% tip in the last million

33:51.960 --> 33:58.640
years. I just... By default, it's 20% for sure. And then I'll like round up even more out

33:58.640 --> 34:09.400
of mathematical insecurity. I don't understand it. I hate to rehash the old Tarantino thing

34:09.400 --> 34:14.080
from the beginning of Reservoir Dogs, but it is a weird question because we've made

34:14.080 --> 34:20.080
it part of our economy and it doesn't make any sense because it's supposed to be a reward

34:20.080 --> 34:26.840
and I'm just tipping everybody. All right. That was my last complaint. What do you think

34:26.840 --> 34:31.360
it should be? I don't... No, there's no should. If you told me it should be 50%, I'd believe

34:31.360 --> 34:36.880
you. What would make you comfortable? If you set the bar somewhere, what would you want

34:36.880 --> 34:42.920
to say? I'm telling you, I swear to God, if you raised me in a society where it was customary

34:42.920 --> 34:49.120
to tip 50% of what the thing was, I would go, okay. But I would also go, the word customary

34:49.120 --> 34:54.720
tip is kind of a weird... It spirals you into a... What is going on here? I believe that

34:54.720 --> 34:57.880
everybody should tip for services like that. It's part of their... It's part of the gig

34:57.880 --> 35:01.240
for service bartenders, waiters, things like that. But you know they've systematized it.

35:01.240 --> 35:07.760
They've institutionalized it. Yeah. But also, under tipping is bad. I think 20% is perfect,

35:07.760 --> 35:12.200
but whatever you can afford. And also, over tipping is not necessary and also can be a

35:12.200 --> 35:21.680
sign of... It can be ostentatious. You shouldn't feel the need to tip 50%, 60%, 100%. Some people

35:21.680 --> 35:26.560
do and have got money. I might do that because it just skews the whole thing. I think just

35:26.560 --> 35:30.880
be an honest 20% tip or let's all do that. It skews what whole thing? Is there some kind

35:30.880 --> 35:34.840
of like... Should we meet on a like a skull and bones island? Did we talk about... There's

35:34.840 --> 35:39.160
one bartender at Little Dom's who I've known for a long, long time and he said... Name him

35:39.160 --> 35:43.160
or it didn't happen. If I knew anybody's name on that place, I would win a fucking

35:43.160 --> 35:48.920
tip. The turnover rate is amazing, but I also don't know the names of the people that have

35:48.920 --> 35:54.480
been working there for three years. You friend Dave came in the other day. Dave Lyons. Yeah,

35:54.480 --> 35:59.640
Dave Lyons, a great friend of ours. He was the Locations Manager for Community, right?

35:59.640 --> 36:06.640
And he's like, yeah, really nice guy. Great tipper. He said it to me like, you could learn

36:06.640 --> 36:16.760
a couple things about Dave Lyons. I'm like... Lots of ball play. Yeah. Lots of ball play.

36:16.760 --> 36:21.360
One of the community writers, a girl, Hilary Winston, she might be naming her because I

36:21.360 --> 36:24.720
think this is probably in her book. Hilary Winston was a community writer season two.

36:24.720 --> 36:29.680
I'm sure she tells a story in her book because she tells everything, but she shared this

36:29.680 --> 36:34.840
story about breaking up with a guy. It was a very amicable breakup. It was one of those

36:34.840 --> 36:38.640
very healthy like, huh, we're breaking up. We both want to break up. Let's just break

36:38.640 --> 36:43.800
up. Like, it's cool. Like, oh, yeah, I guess we're just... It's not going to work out for

36:43.800 --> 36:49.880
both of us. And at some point in the conversation, he's like, yeah, I think she set herself up

36:49.880 --> 36:58.280
by going like, ha, this feels so good. Any thoughts? And he's like, yeah, next time around,

36:58.280 --> 37:07.480
next guy, a little more ball play. Awesome. Amazing. Amazing of her to ask, amazing of

37:07.480 --> 37:14.120
her to answer. Amazing answer. What, what? Good thing that broke up for sure. Wait, the

37:14.120 --> 37:20.240
idea that he's saying, we're breaking up for maybe a lot of reasons, maybe just one reason.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.560
For this guy, yeah. I mean, if ball play is that important, and he never mentioned it,

37:24.560 --> 37:28.880
like, what kind of... He clearly doesn't love her. It's not going to miss her if he's suggesting

37:28.880 --> 37:33.320
that the next guy she's with gets all the ball play. Give him something. Give, please.

37:33.320 --> 37:38.080
This is for the cause. Honor me. Give the next guy you're with all the ball play I never

37:38.080 --> 37:43.240
got. That's why... Well, he loves her. He wants her to be happy. Yeah, be happy. And he knows

37:43.240 --> 37:48.080
that she'll continue to get dumped if she doesn't play with your balls enough. That's

37:48.080 --> 37:53.680
what he's saying. Like, that's why the relationship didn't work out. It's not because I'm the

37:53.680 --> 38:00.120
kind of guy that gives notes like more ball play. It's not related to that at all. I'm

38:00.120 --> 38:08.800
just a regular guy. You, however, you are on the precipice of a life of loneliness. You just

38:08.800 --> 38:16.320
got to play with those balls a little more. Look at them. They're perfect. There's only one more

38:16.320 --> 38:20.440
thing in my Evernote file, and then we're cast adrift, which... And then that's why we'll bring

38:20.440 --> 38:29.600
up Spencer. I love being adrift. See, you knew the Harry Potter series was over, right? No. I thought

38:29.600 --> 38:32.680
they were done making movies, but then there's always another book that comes out, right? I don't

38:32.680 --> 38:39.480
know. I just don't know. Nobody say anything out loud, because we exist in a fascinating vacuum

38:39.480 --> 38:48.920
here. I'm curious how, between the two of us, who knows more about Harry Potter? I would guarantee

38:48.920 --> 38:55.000
that you know more about Harry Potter than I did. Okay. I've never read the books. You imply

38:55.000 --> 39:03.280
that I've read the books. You don't read books. Yeah. I have seen all of the movies once. All

39:03.280 --> 39:10.920
right. Show us. Raise your hand if you consider yourself a Harry Potter... Adam Goldberg's hand

39:10.920 --> 39:15.240
shut up. No, we didn't say stand up. He's already getting up. We didn't say stand up, but his hand

39:15.240 --> 39:21.000
went up. We said raise your hand, and his hand is already in the air. Raise your hand if you're

39:21.000 --> 39:25.880
very familiar with the Harry Potter books to the point. And also, if you're relatively comfortable

39:25.880 --> 39:31.320
getting up on stage and what I would have you do is... Adam, don't be bashful now. His hand's

39:31.320 --> 39:37.760
bashfully up. We have about eight or nine hands in the air, right? I see three. Okay. One, two,

39:37.760 --> 39:42.880
three, four, five, six. How do we choose? Well, we've been unfair to women tonight. I've heard

39:42.880 --> 39:48.160
myself say some sketchy, possibly sexist things, so let's make it a woman. All right. So now we're

39:48.160 --> 39:51.680
down to her. All the women. There's two that raise your hand up front. Are there other women in

39:51.680 --> 39:55.720
the back that raise their hands as well? Well, who cares? I mean, they obviously got here too late.

39:55.720 --> 40:00.040
Of the two up front, which of you thinks you're the most confident about your knowledge?

40:00.040 --> 40:08.920
Did you call yourself a level seven Slytherin? What's your name? Fedora. Oh, Fedora. I remember

40:08.920 --> 40:17.600
that name and that hat from the Jareth contest. All right, Fedora. Let's do five questions.

40:17.600 --> 40:25.680
If you can think of them, don't worry about it. We'll edit it. Just ask a kind of like trivia

40:25.680 --> 40:31.000
question about Harry Potter and see who between me and Jeff knows. Oh, brother. And I mean,

40:31.000 --> 40:37.680
get basic at first. Okay. How hard do you want me to make this? Start off basic. Find the limits

40:37.680 --> 40:44.400
of our ignorance. Okay. I'll tell you some basic things. I bet neither of us know how many movies

40:44.400 --> 40:48.480
there are. I do not know how many. Definitely. I don't know the number. I would be guessing

40:48.480 --> 40:55.960
between estimate seven or eight. I would say five. Well, I mean, yeah, but that's a that's a guess.

40:55.960 --> 41:03.120
I know I obviously know the word Slytherin. I think you I think we got a ringer. I saw I saw

41:03.120 --> 41:10.880
the first one in the movie theater. Yeah, back when I came out nerd with my parents. Okay. How

41:10.880 --> 41:15.280
about I start easy and make then make them slightly harder? Yeah, yeah. Dan, you want to make this

41:15.280 --> 41:24.400
interesting? Yeah, yeah. 20 bucks. 40 40. All right, 40 bones. I'll bet you my partner, but you

41:24.400 --> 41:34.280
know Slytherin. I'll see you a gardener and raise you a tailor. All right, even though I think that

41:34.280 --> 41:38.680
you're I think you know more than me. I think this is a bad bet. I'll take the $40 bet. All right,

41:38.680 --> 41:46.760
wait, if I let's make it let's put it in Harmontown terms. If if if Harmontown terms, if if I win,

41:46.760 --> 41:57.600
you have to more ball play. I was trying to think of I don't know. It's stupid. Yeah, let's make it

41:57.600 --> 42:02.560
a nice friendly 40 bucks. Yeah. Here we go. I think you're going to kick my ass around the room,

42:02.560 --> 42:10.240
but we'll see. Okay. Can you name the four Hogwarts houses from the four houses? Okay,

42:10.240 --> 42:18.000
so there's four schools of magic. I know that I know that one is Slytherin, because I said that.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.520
One is Slytherin. I didn't know there were four houses. One's called Knuckle Muffins,

42:24.520 --> 42:41.200
one's called Gravy Train, and the Lilita's Kiss, Poughkeepsie, Magic Hat, Dumbledumble,

42:41.200 --> 42:49.120
Dumbledumble, Dumbledumble, and Bumper's Stumpers. No, neither of us now. Neither of us now.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.400
Start basic, we said.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.160
Name them, name them, name the four.

42:53.160 --> 42:57.000
Gryffindors, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Hufflepuff.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Hufflepuff.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Bumper Stumpers is close.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Wait, no, no.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
My first one, I said Knuckle Muffet or something.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
We'll give that one to Jeff, though.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
No, we're not.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Bumper Stumpers.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Does anybody remember that game show?

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
You had to guess what people's personalized license plates said.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Yeah, it sucked.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
How did they come up with that idea?

43:19.000 --> 43:23.680
I was like, when you go into a development meeting and meet and greet with an executive,

43:23.680 --> 43:27.320
another thing I'm not allowed to complain about, and they're like, we have this internal

43:27.320 --> 43:31.360
idea and it's about, you know, when you go to your tenure reunion, it's like you never

43:31.360 --> 43:32.360
knew.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.880
So we want to develop a show, it's called Tenure Reunion, oh, how'd you come up with

43:34.880 --> 43:35.880
that idea?

43:35.880 --> 43:38.880
You fucking parasite.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.880
You 28-year-old.

43:39.880 --> 43:40.880
That's an internal idea?

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
You didn't have a writer?

43:41.880 --> 43:47.760
Well, since it's a reality show, you'll never need one.

43:47.760 --> 43:52.200
Just get six cameras and go fuck everybody.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.200
Makes me a little mad.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.440
I thought you hated writing.

43:54.440 --> 43:58.400
I do, but I don't want it eliminated as a job.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.000
I definitely hate watching dishes a lot more.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
All right.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Kintradora.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Question number two.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.600
First of all, do you want to know what the Four Hogwarts houses are in French, because

44:07.600 --> 44:09.600
they're really funny?

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
We.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.600
Yes.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
Okay.

44:12.600 --> 44:16.400
Gryffindor is just Gryffindor for some reason.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.400
Not funny.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
That's why I started with that one.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.400
Okay.

44:21.400 --> 44:25.400
Slytherin is Serpentard, which kind of makes sense.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.400
Serpentard?

44:26.400 --> 44:27.400
Serpentard?

44:27.400 --> 44:28.400
Yeah.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.400
Hey, Serpentard.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.400
Yeah.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.400
Nice wand.

44:31.400 --> 44:38.960
Ravenclaw is Ceradoglu, which is kind of a direct translation that kind of makes sense.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.560
Then Hufflepuff is my absolute favorite.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.560
Hufflepuff is Poof Soufflé.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.560
Poof.

44:43.560 --> 44:44.560
That's on the nose.

44:44.560 --> 44:49.800
They would be offended, the French would be offended if we suggested that was their first

44:49.800 --> 44:50.800
name for her.

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
Poof Soufflé?

44:51.800 --> 44:52.800
Poof?

44:52.800 --> 44:53.800
Poof.

44:53.800 --> 44:54.800
Poof.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.800
Oddly enough, that's also a literal translation.

44:55.800 --> 44:56.800
Poof Soufflé.

44:56.800 --> 44:57.800
That's great.

44:57.800 --> 44:58.800
All right.

44:58.800 --> 44:59.800
I love that.

44:59.800 --> 45:00.800
Four more, Fedora.

45:00.800 --> 45:01.800
Okay.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
Can either of you name the monster in the Chamber of Secrets?

45:03.800 --> 45:04.800
Sam.

45:04.800 --> 45:05.800
All right.

45:05.800 --> 45:06.800
All right.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.800
All right.

45:07.800 --> 45:08.800
Good guess.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.800
That sounds like a good guess.

45:09.800 --> 45:16.800
I know it'll have a lot of S's in it because he's a snake monster.

45:16.800 --> 45:21.560
There's a snake monster down there.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.560
It's not Slytherin.

45:22.560 --> 45:25.240
That's the house.

45:25.240 --> 45:27.240
It's not Serpantor.

45:27.240 --> 45:30.560
That's G.I. Joe.

45:30.560 --> 45:34.360
It should be Serpantor.

45:34.360 --> 45:35.360
CobraCon.

45:35.360 --> 45:39.360
Don't tell her.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.360
Okay.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.360
What is it?

45:41.360 --> 45:42.360
Who's close?

45:42.360 --> 45:43.360
Sam or CobraCon?

45:43.360 --> 45:52.360
Well, Dan, you're closer because it actually is the name of a snake.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.360
Okay.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.360
What is it?

45:54.360 --> 45:55.360
What is it?

45:55.360 --> 45:56.360
It's a basilisk.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.360
All right.

45:57.360 --> 45:58.360
I'll take that point.

45:58.360 --> 45:59.360
Basilisk?

45:59.360 --> 46:00.360
Basilisk.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.360
Mine had an S in it.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.360
I'll take it.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.360
Okay.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.360
We're tied up.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.360
We're all tied up.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.360
We're tied at one.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.360
Who were the marauders?

46:10.360 --> 46:11.360
What?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.360
Is that part?

46:12.360 --> 46:14.360
Do you need another one?

46:14.360 --> 46:15.360
I'm sorry.

46:15.360 --> 46:16.360
All right.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.360
No, no, no, no.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.360
Let's take a stab.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.360
That's it.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.360
Who were they?

46:20.360 --> 46:21.360
Yeah.

46:21.360 --> 46:30.360
The marauders were a group of shadow creatures that serve he whose name can't be said.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.360
That is totally wrong.

46:32.360 --> 46:33.360
Would you like another question?

46:33.360 --> 46:34.360
No.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.360
I get to guess, too.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.360
Okay.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.360
Yeah.

46:37.360 --> 46:44.360
The marauders were those guys that came in and tried to screw up the game of the broomstick

46:44.360 --> 46:45.360
ball.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.360
Quidditch.

46:46.360 --> 46:47.360
Quidditch.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.360
Quidditch.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.360
The guys that came in and tried to steal the Quidditch sticks.

46:51.360 --> 46:52.360
Okay.

46:52.360 --> 46:53.360
Who's closer?

46:53.360 --> 46:54.360
Who's closer?

46:54.360 --> 47:00.520
I'm going to say Jeff is closer because he's thinking of the wrong things, but he does

47:00.520 --> 47:02.360
no sort of what he's talking about.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.360
I know Quidditch.

47:03.360 --> 47:07.360
Quidditch.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.360
Jeff too.

47:08.360 --> 47:11.360
I thought it was once, but I'm no on my ship.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.360
Two left.

47:12.360 --> 47:13.360
Okay.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.360
I got to make the last two really easy because I think that last one was too hard.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.360
Well, also, don't give a point to somebody who just says Quidditch, Quidditch, like in

47:18.360 --> 47:19.360
the middle of it.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.360
Yeah, he was.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.360
Yours had a name of a snake in it.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.360
That was a funny name.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.360
All right.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.360
Fine.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.360
Even Steven.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.360
Jeff leads two to one.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.360
$40 on the line.

47:27.360 --> 47:32.360
He was describing a specific scene from oddly enough the right book, but just had the creature

47:32.360 --> 47:33.360
go.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.360
Oh, I'm a fan fedora.

47:34.360 --> 47:35.360
Yeah.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
I can tell.

47:36.360 --> 47:40.360
You're not the first woman to fall into his sociopathic web.

47:40.360 --> 47:45.360
It sounds like he's all into whatever you're talking about.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.360
By the way, you're going to be on the Los Feliz streets with a pair of high heels in your

47:49.360 --> 47:52.360
hand in the morning.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.360
Okay.

47:53.360 --> 47:54.360
Hailing a cab.

47:54.360 --> 48:01.360
Boy, Dan, you go down one point, you turn into a misogynist asshole.

48:01.360 --> 48:04.360
Can't you see how good she looks in black?

48:04.360 --> 48:06.360
You look great tonight, by the way.

48:06.360 --> 48:07.360
You look wonderful.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.360
Thank you.

48:08.360 --> 48:09.360
You're really captivating.

48:09.360 --> 48:10.360
Here you go.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.360
I'm sorry.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.360
He's a basilisk.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.360
I was distracted.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.360
Is the game over yet?

48:14.360 --> 48:15.360
Two to one.

48:15.360 --> 48:16.360
Okay.

48:16.360 --> 48:20.360
What's the name of the headmaster of Hogwarts?

48:20.360 --> 48:22.360
Grumble snakes.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.360
Dumbledore.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.360
Dumbledore.

48:24.360 --> 48:32.360
East side, west side, north side, south.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.360
Mamas in your tinny, dicks in your mouth.

48:34.360 --> 48:38.360
Motherfucker's got another cocaine and the weak stuff.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.360
Fuck you.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.360
Got to shoot you in the dick.

48:40.360 --> 48:41.360
Got to shoot you in the ass.

48:41.360 --> 48:44.360
Fuck your mama and the head of the class.

48:44.360 --> 48:47.360
I got how it has been in the place to be.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.360
I knew it wasn't grumble snakes.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.360
I panicked.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.360
Wow.

48:51.360 --> 48:55.360
As in the game of quidditch that will cost you.

48:55.360 --> 48:59.360
You pause one moment and the robot ball will not follow your broomstick.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.360
All right.

49:00.360 --> 49:02.360
We're tied up at two to two right now.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.360
This is the deciding question.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.360
Yeah.

49:05.360 --> 49:06.360
$40.

49:06.360 --> 49:10.360
$40 magical salamanders.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.360
Salamander notes.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.360
I should make that the last question.

49:14.360 --> 49:17.360
The units of currency, but I'm not that mean.

49:17.360 --> 49:21.360
We're guessing on everything except for Dumbledore.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.360
I freaked out and said grumble snakes.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.360
No, grumble snakes is good.

49:26.360 --> 49:27.360
I like that.

49:27.360 --> 49:29.360
That's a better name.

49:29.360 --> 49:32.360
You should write a young adult novel series.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.360
I hate writing.

49:34.360 --> 49:37.360
That's going to be, when I finally start playing Dungeons and Dragons,

49:37.360 --> 49:38.360
I think that's going to be my character name.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.360
Grumble snakes.

49:40.360 --> 49:44.360
Grumble, it's like grumble fish.

49:44.360 --> 49:45.360
Yeah.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.360
Okay. This is it, everybody.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.360
This is the fifth and final question.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.360
Okay.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.360
There's a catch on this one.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.360
You have to pronounce it correctly.

49:56.360 --> 50:00.360
It's easy, but it's, you know, people get.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.360
What's the name of the bad guy?

50:02.360 --> 50:04.360
His real name.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.360
His real, his real alias.

50:06.360 --> 50:08.360
Not his real real name.

50:08.360 --> 50:11.360
I'm not.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.360
I know you're not allowed to say his name in the first movie,

50:14.360 --> 50:16.360
because that's the one I saw.

50:16.360 --> 50:20.360
And I know he doesn't have a nose.

50:20.360 --> 50:25.360
And I know it's not Slytherin.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.360
Azkabar, fuck it.

50:28.360 --> 50:31.360
No, no, no, no, no.

50:31.360 --> 50:37.360
Heathcliff.

50:37.360 --> 50:40.360
William Howard Taft.

50:40.360 --> 50:45.360
I went from Heathcliff to Lausanne de Garfield to our fattest president.

50:45.360 --> 50:46.360
Is that your guess, dude?

50:46.360 --> 50:47.360
I don't fucking...

50:47.360 --> 50:49.360
For $40,000. I'm shooting in the dark.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.360
No, no, no. Let me fucking...

50:51.360 --> 50:53.360
I know it's like Dumbledore, but it's like the inversion of Dumbledore.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.360
So fumble, fumble, fumble.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.360
There's people in the audience right now that are bristling.

50:57.360 --> 50:59.360
Well, of course they are, because we're not saying Darth Vader.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.360
We don't know the name of Darth Vader.

51:01.360 --> 51:04.360
Ah, shit. What the fuck is this?

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
You know, it's funny.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.360
I didn't realize it was the inversion of Dumbledore, but it kind of is.

51:08.360 --> 51:12.360
Say, just getting in the head of an inferior craftsman.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.360
There's your Dumbledore.

51:14.360 --> 51:17.360
Yeah, I'll tell you for $20.

51:17.360 --> 51:18.360
Adam, shut up.

51:18.360 --> 51:23.360
Imble. Imble, imble, imblefliff.

51:23.360 --> 51:31.360
Just counting on getting closer than Jeff. Imblefliff.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.360
I'm going to say something from a...

51:33.360 --> 51:37.360
No, that's Lord of the Rings.

51:37.360 --> 51:40.360
Yeah, I fucking almost went Voldemort on that one.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.360
$40 in my pocket, yo.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.360
Bring it over me. Don't throw it.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.360
I said Voldemort, make it rain.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.360
Fedora, everybody!

52:00.360 --> 52:03.360
I gave my $20 to this motherfucker, but I won't give up.

52:03.360 --> 52:08.360
Fedora, Fedora, everybody.

52:08.360 --> 52:13.360
All right. Spencer, get up here and set up your... set up your wares.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.360
We always do this. We always start... Spencer up too late.

52:16.360 --> 52:19.360
We always... we always torture these people.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.360
That was exciting.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.360
No sir, yeah. How about that?

52:23.360 --> 52:25.360
Me coming up with something, like, spur of the moment.

52:25.360 --> 52:27.360
Little features. I'm coming up with little features.

52:27.360 --> 52:28.360
You're like David Letterman.

52:28.360 --> 52:29.360
Yeah.

52:29.360 --> 52:32.360
Except, as if he had a writer that would come up with features for him.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.360
Yeah, but I don't.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.360
You're like your own writer, Steph.

52:36.360 --> 52:39.360
If I had a Larry Budd Melman, like Goldberg,

52:39.360 --> 52:42.360
Goldberg, well, Spencer sets up.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.360
Goldberg, come up. Adam Goldberg.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.360
Let's visit Adam Goldberg.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.360
This show runs itself. Freestyle.

52:50.360 --> 52:52.360
Adam, freestyle. Come on.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.360
Talking to Stan, who never says please.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.360
I'm back in the cold and my mic is...

52:56.360 --> 52:58.360
My mic is probably too hot.

52:58.360 --> 53:00.360
Justin, I'm sorry. My mic is too hot.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.360
I have a loud voice and I'm sorry.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.360
My mic is just too warm.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.360
It's going to crackle.

53:06.360 --> 53:08.360
Soundcheck wrap.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.360
Were you rapping or was that...

53:10.360 --> 53:12.360
He wrapped a mic check.

53:12.360 --> 53:14.360
I'm sober enough that it was intentional.

53:14.360 --> 53:18.360
But not sober enough that it was not un...

53:18.360 --> 53:20.360
Oh, can't believe Mitt won.

53:20.360 --> 53:22.360
I just...

53:22.360 --> 53:24.360
We don't know that. It's crazy.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.360
Are you up here in the Mitt Romney universe?

53:26.360 --> 53:28.360
That Mitt is one?

53:28.360 --> 53:31.360
I was ringing it up and calling it back.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.360
I was dialing up a punchline

53:33.360 --> 53:35.360
and no one was on the other side.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.360
I'm leaving a voicemail.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.360
It's a kind of voicemail where it's just...

53:39.360 --> 53:41.360
The person just leaves their number

53:41.360 --> 53:43.360
because they're too cool for their name

53:43.360 --> 53:45.360
and it might be, you know, a chick you met at a bar.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.360
It might be an insurance salesman from Milwaukee.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.360
Nobody knows.

53:48.360 --> 53:50.360
If they call back and says,

53:50.360 --> 53:52.360
I'm an insurance salesman from Milwaukee,

53:52.360 --> 53:54.360
you have a sense of it, but she could be doing a deep voice

53:54.360 --> 53:56.360
and faking it out on you.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.360
It's freestyle.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.360
I'll pass it to you.

54:00.360 --> 54:02.360
I'll say, my man, Adam Goldberg,

54:02.360 --> 54:04.360
gonna take it right now or something like that.

54:04.360 --> 54:06.360
All right.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.360
But I'll set you up.

54:08.360 --> 54:10.360
And I'll lower the bar.

54:12.360 --> 54:17.360
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

54:17.360 --> 54:19.360
Bottom to the top, side to side.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.360
I fucked your mama in her pussy

54:21.360 --> 54:23.360
and I made it extra wide.

54:23.360 --> 54:26.360
It goes to the top.

54:26.360 --> 54:28.360
Don't react.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.360
It distracts me.

54:29.360 --> 54:30.360
Tell him.

54:30.360 --> 54:32.360
Okay, sorry.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.360
Yeah, preach.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.360
Sorry.

54:35.360 --> 54:36.360
Yeah, you're my hype man?

54:36.360 --> 54:37.360
Yeah.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.360
Okay, I'll try.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
Yeah, this one goes out to the ladies.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
I'm getting distracted.

54:41.360 --> 54:46.360
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

54:46.360 --> 54:49.360
Pepper to the salt, steak to the peas.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.360
Fucked your mama so hard she fell to her knees.

54:51.360 --> 54:54.360
Big for more of a dick to...

54:54.360 --> 54:56.360
Don, I fucked it on the lawn.

54:56.360 --> 54:59.360
Fucked your mama in the backyard in the front.

54:59.360 --> 55:02.360
Fucked your mama in the seaward.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.360
Sorry, sorry.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.360
Yo, good save.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.360
Good save.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.360
Starting over.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.360
Right up in there.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.360
Okay, yo, yo, yo.

55:11.360 --> 55:14.360
With my motherfucker right now, Adam Goldberg.

55:14.360 --> 55:15.360
Gonna do it up.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.360
Gonna give you the good word.

55:17.360 --> 55:19.360
Adam Goldberg, the Jewish prodigy.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.360
Gonna take you all down to your knees.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.360
Let me set you up better.

55:24.360 --> 55:26.360
Motherfucker is like a tight sweater.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.360
Makes your titties look good for the touching.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.360
Motherfucker's gonna be like...

55:31.360 --> 55:34.360
Titties be better when I'm with them.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.360
I've got the stuff and you got the stiffen.

55:36.360 --> 55:37.360
I got a swear word.

55:37.360 --> 55:38.360
I won't say it.

55:38.360 --> 55:41.360
If this gets radio-edited, fuck, I'll pray it.

55:41.360 --> 55:44.360
Yo, I got Kirby's Vine.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.360
I got ladies in a segment that's mine to say what?

55:47.360 --> 55:51.360
I'll get your vodka spilled all over because that's how I oughta.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.360
Spencer is a very good DM.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.360
I...wim.

55:55.360 --> 55:58.360
And when things drop out, it's sometimes impressive.

55:58.360 --> 56:02.360
If I had a rap group, we'd be called the messes.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.360
All right, MC Goldberg.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.360
MC Goldberg.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.360
Extemporaneous, yo.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.360
I gotta say, that took sort of a bittersweet turn toward the end there.

56:13.360 --> 56:18.360
Because we're both...we're just wheelcharing across the finish line.

56:18.360 --> 56:20.360
Everyone's a winner.

56:20.360 --> 56:23.360
Must finish this rhyme.

56:23.360 --> 56:27.360
Just break the ribbon. Here's a scissors.

56:29.360 --> 56:31.360
Thank you, Adam.

56:31.360 --> 56:32.360
Thank you, Adam.

56:32.360 --> 56:35.360
I can't thank you enough, clearly.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.360
Adam, sit down.

56:38.360 --> 56:40.360
There you go.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.360
He's a good kid.

56:42.360 --> 56:45.360
Adam, when the little showbiz note, when someone goes,

56:45.360 --> 56:48.360
Adam Goldberg, everyone in the crowd claps,

56:48.360 --> 56:50.360
that's outro.

56:50.360 --> 56:53.360
You tip your hat and you walk out stage.

56:53.360 --> 56:58.360
My theory is that he's neurologically incapable of picking up on a social cue like that.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.360
That's my theory as a person who I also...

57:00.360 --> 57:02.360
That's also my theory.

57:02.360 --> 57:04.360
So now I'm just telling him straight up.

57:04.360 --> 57:06.360
From now on, when I say thank you, Adam Goldberg,

57:06.360 --> 57:10.360
and the crowd goes like, they make their hands make this sound.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.360
That means fuck straight off.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.360
You're really controlling tonight.

57:17.360 --> 57:21.360
I got $40 burning a hole in my pocket.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.360
All right, Spencer, how have you been doing?

57:23.360 --> 57:26.360
Right now, I'm not feeling too good, you guys.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.360
Oh, Jesus.

57:27.360 --> 57:32.360
If I underperform or pass out or projectile vomitor shit, you'll know why.

57:32.360 --> 57:35.360
I saw you before the show. I thought you were just high.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.360
No, no, I'm just not feeling too high.

57:37.360 --> 57:40.360
Oh, Jesus, Spencer, let me dungeon master for a change.

57:40.360 --> 57:42.360
All right, here.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.360
Is he going to play Sharpie?

57:44.360 --> 57:46.360
Take the dice.

57:46.360 --> 57:47.360
No, I mean, I can do it.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.360
For real?

57:48.360 --> 57:49.360
Yeah!

57:49.360 --> 57:51.360
Dan, is this a planned bit?

57:51.360 --> 57:52.360
Am I going to find out this is a planned bit?

57:52.360 --> 57:55.360
If this doesn't work, we'll put it in the Mitt Romney universe and pretend it didn't happen.

57:55.360 --> 57:56.360
Perfect.

57:56.360 --> 58:01.360
All right, so Spencer, the sixler is going to come up and play...

58:01.360 --> 58:03.360
Are you playing Sharpie?

58:03.360 --> 58:05.360
Yes.

58:05.360 --> 58:08.360
And Harmon's going to sit in and dungeon master.

58:08.360 --> 58:13.360
But this is like a what if comic, you know, like if it fucks up, if I fuck it up, it didn't happen.

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
Can I sit?

58:14.360 --> 58:16.360
Yes, you may.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.360
Make yourself fat.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.360
I'm so fat, what?

58:18.360 --> 58:22.360
You're not fat. You're quite in shape, I would say.

58:22.360 --> 58:24.360
They suck it in in public.

58:24.360 --> 58:25.360
That's true.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.360
What's wrong, Spencer? Is it serious?

58:28.360 --> 58:29.360
My fat?

58:29.360 --> 58:33.360
No, whatever, however sick you are.

58:33.360 --> 58:36.360
Oh, no, I don't even know. I'm not a hundred percent.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.360
I wouldn't say I'm even sick or anything.

58:38.360 --> 58:41.360
Well, will you pass a saving throw?

58:41.360 --> 58:43.360
Who knows?

58:43.360 --> 58:45.360
Not taking his illness seriously.

58:45.360 --> 58:51.360
All right, Harmon, I'm going to give you what are new because of Labyrinth, the Jareth Fest last week.

58:51.360 --> 58:55.360
Which is wonderful, by the way, for any of you that took part in that or were here.

58:55.360 --> 58:57.360
That really was my favorite Halloween in recent memory.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.360
It was wonderful.

58:58.360 --> 59:05.360
So I'm going to play you the new D&D theme song.

59:05.360 --> 59:16.360
After several key defeats in the area of the Goblin Kingdom

59:16.360 --> 59:22.360
and saving the forest from the forces of Admiral Darkstar

59:22.360 --> 59:27.360
the party known as Sharpie Buttsalot

59:27.360 --> 59:36.360
Quark, Maya Rudolph, whatever her name was

59:36.360 --> 59:42.360
have decided to hit the treacherous road in pursuit of the Buttsalot Shire

59:42.360 --> 59:48.360
which is reputed to be the source of Sharpie's kingdom

59:48.360 --> 59:53.360
and former reclamation of his lineage.

59:53.360 --> 01:00:00.360
After traveling very far on a well-packed, well-trodden path

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.360
you encountered a fierce bunch of gnolls

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:14.360
and quickly took them out with a flurry of spells and missiles.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:21.360
You slept the night away, shook yourselves off and proceeded along the trail

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.360
to the Buttsalot realm.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.360
You arrive into an open field.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:34.360
You see a series of tents, a village of tents laid out before you.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.360
There are watch commanders patrolling the area

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.360
as is customary in the Buttsalot Kingdom.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.360
Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.360
Alright, can we restart and have you do it? This is obviously terrible.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.360
I thought it was amazing.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.360
That was great.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.360
No, you would.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.360
Let Spencer please restart.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.360
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.360
It's only going to get worse.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:05.360
Did you hear me struggling to describe tents?

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.360
I thought you did great.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.360
That was fantastic.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.360
When we last met.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360
Yeah!

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.360
See, now you're not booing.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.360
Our heroes had been in Dark Star Ziggurat.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.360
After defeating him, they realized, or did they?

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.360
I don't know.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.360
It just happened that the Ziggurat crumbled to the ground.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:33.360
The dark forest of shadows seemed to be getting more and more safe after his vanquishing.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.360
See, this is what I'm talking about.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.360
You're making me look like an asshole.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.360
You did a great job up there and I'm not doing good now.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.360
You're doing what I'm doing, which is second-guessing yourself.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.360
That's the only un-charismatic thing.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.360
That's what I'm best at.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.360
Hitting the trail on the way to the Butts expanse.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.360
Home of the Buttsalot tribe.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.360
Our heroes encountered...

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.360
Null Raiders from the White Skull Tribe.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:07.360
After defeating the Raiders, they dusted themselves off and looked at the loot left behind by the Nulls.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.360
Now it's up to you guys.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360
All right.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.360
Oh, begin sneak.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.360
So I forget.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.360
Show me that loot again, Sharpie.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.360
Well, we have some coins.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.360
There's some tattered armors and maybe a cutlass.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.360
Definitely a cutlass.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.360
Is it better than my sword?

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.360
I've got a pretty good sword already.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.360
Is it valuable to me to have another sword?

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.360
Is there a green arrow on the interface next to his...

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.360
That's a video game reference.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.360
I'll pick up X.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.360
But yeah, it's not anywhere near as good as yours.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.360
You can tell it's a bit rusty.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.360
The guard's a bit loose.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360
Yeah?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360
Yeah, I wouldn't take it.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.360
All right, I'll leave it there.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.360
You are staring at the corpses of dead Nulls.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.360
We should probably arrange them as if they were fucking each other when they died.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.360
Just to send a message to the Nulls,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.360
because I understand them to be a very homophobic culture.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.360
What I'm strapping my fear is that that might enrage them and bring down undue wrath upon us.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.360
They need to be enraged and self-destruct.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.360
The state of the world right now, Jeff, is one in which there's only one war left.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.360
The war between the people who own property and the people that don't.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.360
These Nulls are the last of the dregs.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.360
Wait, are we still doing the Romney universe?

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.360
This is Obama.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.360
Whatever. We'll leave him be.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.360
I'll put a gold piece on each of their eyes.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.360
I examine my surroundings.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.360
You are in a rolling plains.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.360
Rolling plains surround you,

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.360
and a few trees stand on top of a hill to your west.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.360
The path bends south.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.360
What's the name of the girl that we're traveling with, Maple Leaf?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Karen Broadleaf.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.360
Karen Broadleaf.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.360
So are we close now?

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.360
We've been traveling for like three days, Karen.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.360
Yes, in fact, if I remember correctly,

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.360
the butt's plains are just over that ridge.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.360
She points to a ridge.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.360
The butt's plains are just over it.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:12.360
Karen, are all the butt's plains parted by a ridge?

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.360
Yes, you will find that in the butt's plains,

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.360
that geographic feature does exist.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.360
Interesting. Just going to make a mental note of that.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.360
Let's go into the ridge between the butt's plains.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.360
Or above the butt's plains?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.360
I don't know. Some direction involving the butt's plains.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.360
Let's follow that path toward the ridge.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.360
Following the well trodden path,

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.360
you reach the top of the hill,

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.360
seeing the view from the ridge.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.360
You can see the yellow tent of Yellow Camp,

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.360
the primary camp of Buttsalot Camp.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.360
Wait, there were tents. How did you know that?

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360
Yeah, that's what I mean.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.360
It's like he just was reading the future.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.360
Orp can predict basic objects.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.360
He's a storyteller, so am I.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.360
To a certain extent.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.360
You guys colluded before this.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.360
Barbarians like house musicians.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360
You know, you're like banana,

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.360
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360
There's changes and there's keys and things.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.360
This guy's fucking good.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.360
And I'm pointing that out by saying

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.360
that he said the same thing I did.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.360
Edit it out.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.360
Tell me about those tents.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.360
They're far off. There's one central large tent.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.360
And there's a banana monster, right?

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.360
I mean, we both would put a banana monster.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.360
You're sick and I'm fucking around.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Everyone wants to get home.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.360
Let's all go home.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360
No, Spencer, say that.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.360
Oh my god, not you.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.360
I meant them.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.360
Oh, sorry.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360
You get in for free.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.360
They won't call my bluff.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.360
Don't tell them that.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.360
All right, so yeah, yellow tent

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.360
surrounded by smaller yellow tents.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.360
By the way, why on your guest list,

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.360
Spencer is like, he doesn't get paid for his services here,

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.360
but he sends like a guest list.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.360
There's always a person named Symphony.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360
Wait, how does a dungeon master

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.360
roll with a chick named Symphony?

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360
He's fucking good at it.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
What?

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.360
All right, there you go.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.360
Thank you, Symphony.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.360
That was my only question.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.360
All right, so he's got an entourage.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.360
I approached the large yellow tent in the center.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360
You are a far ways away from it.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.360
You can't, you can begin your approach.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.360
I begin that approach, beginning your approach.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.360
I examine his approach.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.360
Examining is your approach.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.360
You notice his gate seems a bit stranger

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.360
than when you first started adventuring.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.360
Hey, what gives?

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.360
I gotta hang a piss.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:44.360
Well, there you go.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.360
I take a pee and then we resume my approach

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360
towards the yellow tent.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.360
Peeing completed.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.360
You see the familiar yellow tents of Yellow Camp,

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.360
the first of three Buttsalot encampments.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.360
Nearby, you can see a large mound of dirt

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.360
as if someone or some army had been digging a massive pit.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.360
The closer you get, the weirder things appear.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:07.360
Nulls are invading Yellow Camp.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.360
You see many nulls and many barbarians,

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.360
but they don't seem to be fighting.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.360
In fact, they seem just to be hanging out

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.360
and talking with one another.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.360
Wait, the barbarians are Buttsalot barbarians?

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.360
These are the Buttsalot barbarians.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360
And there's a few armies amassed?

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.360
You can see barbarians from your tribe

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.360
intermingling with nulls, large hyena like humanoids.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.360
All right, so they see our approach

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.360
and they're not reacting to it?

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.360
Well, I'm a barbarian.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360
Wouldn't they be compatriots of mine, friends, possibly?

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360
You're not in a union.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:45.360
You certainly identify with their thoughts and feelings,

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360
but it's a tribe thing.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360
You're not in their tribe, so.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.360
But, you know, you get in their heads a bit.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.360
I'll let me just follow my lead, man.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360
I'm related to these people.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.360
Do your thing.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.360
We approach them.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360
You approach them.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.360
Do you want, like, a parade or like an entourage

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.360
or like a party to be sarcastic?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.360
I'm just approaching them and going,

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:17.360
I hope that my presence is noted as I approach them.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360
Are they ignoring me?

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.360
As you get closer and start to wave your hellos to the barbarians,

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.360
they seem to take note of you before returning to ignoring you.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.360
It's been a long time since you've last been at the Buttsalot expanse.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.360
Perhaps people don't remember.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.360
Greet them in grand fashion.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.360
Let them know who you are, your lineage.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.360
Well, I don't want my first impression to be like a dick.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360
If they're talking to their enemies.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.360
They're being dicks.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.360
You say hello and they just turn back at you.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360
They're having some kind of summit.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.360
I mean, these are...

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360
Those gnolls are...

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360
We just killed a bunch of them in the forums.

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.360
All right.

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.360
Like, we go...

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.360
They don't know that.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360
I know.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360
Or do they?

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360
Keep it down.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360
They might know it.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.360
Oh.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.360
Uh-oh.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.360
Oh.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.360
All right.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.360
We saw nothing.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360
We did nothing.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.360
Just didn't deny everything.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.360
Okay.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.360
This is like a Hope and Crasby movie.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.360
I moved to within three feet of them and clear my throat.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.360
You clear your throat.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.360
A gnoll and a tall human, dressed in animal skins,

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.360
eyes you with a sum amount of suspicion.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.360
I give them one of these like...

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.360
Like a poor person on a crosswalk,

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360
like looking at a car.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360
Like, what?

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
What are you going to do?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.360
Are you going to marry me?

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.360
The human approaches you, eyes locked.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.360
He has a very aggressive look on his face.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.360
He says nothing.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360
He approaches.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360
He gets within three feet of you.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360
Then two.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.360
He stops at two.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.360
Uh, greetings.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360
You seem familiar.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.360
Something about your features reminds me of someone I know.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.360
Yeah, I'm a Butz.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360
A Butz?

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.360
You mean a Butz a lot?

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360
Yeah.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.360
The very same.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360
Yeah.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:20.360
I am the one that didn't come back.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.360
Then you are a former tribesman?

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.360
Yeah.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360
Sharpie, tell them who you are, man.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360
I'm Sharpie Butz a lot.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.360
Sharpie Butz a lot?

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360
See?

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.360
I shouldn't have to say it.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360
Son of Lord Butz a lot?

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360
I...

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.360
Welcome.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360
Jesus.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360
Guys, guys, guys.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360
It's like pulling teeth with these people.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360
No, it's just that Sharpie Butz a lot.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360
Walk up and say hello.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360
You can just go up and say hi to people.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.360
You're so suspicious of everybody.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.360
You have to understand, I grew up in a town of 35.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360
You expect a modicum of...

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.360
Yeah, but you've been gone for a long time, right?

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360
It's all part of their tune.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.360
Just tell them to say hey.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.360
Several human barbarians gather.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.360
Well, the gnolls slowly move away,

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360
eyeing you with suspicion and caution.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.360
Hey, I didn't want to interrupt your summit with the gnolls.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.360
Well, you did.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.360
But I mean, that's fine.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360
Like, what's up?

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360
Well, what were you talking to them about?

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360
What's the beef?

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360
We're just, you know, discussing.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.360
I mean, ever since Lord Butz a lot signed the Butz Blackpaw Treaty,

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.360
all the Blackpaw gnolls have been camping with us.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.360
You see, we figure if we ally,

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.360
we can destroy the dwarves more handily.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.360
Uh-oh.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.360
You guys are lying with gnolls to defeat dwarves?

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.360
Yes, you see, I mean, it's been a long, long time since you've last been here,

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.360
but the goblins, the kobolds, the wild capybaras, they've all gone.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.360
It's the gnolls, the dwarves, and the barbarians.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.360
And we're all fighting.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.360
And the dwarves are bad to you?

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360
We don't like them.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360
They occupy the mountains to the south.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.360
The mountains to the south are the last stronghold of the dwarves.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:12.360
If we can take this stronghold, we'll be able to control the entire Butz Peninsula.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:17.360
I emerge from behind this conversation and force my way right into the center

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.360
and say, Sharpie, it is your birthright to regain the former glory of this Butz a lot tribe.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.360
Let's unite with these people and go fight these dwarves.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:33.360
Hold on a second. Where's my dad?

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.360
I asked this guy.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.360
He should be in blue camp.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.360
They're making preparations to send a special envoy to the dwarves

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360
to negotiate the terms of surrender,

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:49.360
seeing as how the alliance between the gnolls and the barbarians has taken hold.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360
The dwarves are very, very scared.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.360
They've been holding up and fortifying their defenses.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.360
But they want stuff.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.360
Listen, Clark, guys, a war between humans and dwarves is not...

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.360
They're like the little fuckers.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.360
You're a little fucker. You're a gnome.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.360
Look, I'm a...

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360
You're a self-loathing gnome.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.360
I'm a barbarian, too.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.360
You got to ask yourself one day, are you a gnome that became a barbarian

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.360
or a barbarian that happens to be a gnome?

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.360
It's from law and order. It was one of the black lawyers had to...

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360
I don't see him.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360
I've never seen that show.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.360
It still applies.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:44.360
The bottom line is that dwarves and humans have lived in harmony in these parts for millennia.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.360
Well, let's go meet your father. Let's go sit down and meet your father.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.360
Listen, how far is blue camp from yellow camp?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.360
Just walk out that door and then back inside.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.360
There's a door in the tent.

01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.360
A tent flapping an entrance portal.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.360
Oh, so we can walk out of one flap and come right back in the same flap and it's just a blue camp?

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360
I did.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360
That's what he said.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.360
That's how it would seem, yeah.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
What?

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:15.360
We walk out of the yellow flap and come back in a blue flap exiting the tent.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.360
You turn around to see that yellow camp has vanished, being replaced with blue camp.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.360
A large blue central tent stands in the middle and is flanked by smaller blue tents.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.360
You don't know what sorcery has caused this, but you go back inside all the same.

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.360
You are now in blue camp.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:32.360
There are only human barbarians.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.360
They're dressed in slightly finer clothes than the ones in yellow camp.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.360
They're discussing, sitting at tables, sipping drinks.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.360
You don't see your father.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.360
So I gotta find my dad.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.360
Just go up and introduce yourself.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.360
Say you're the son of the guy that runs the joints.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.360
Say hello.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:55.360
I feel like if we play this right, sideline between you and me, Jeff Davis, Dan Harmon.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.360
Right.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:04.360
If I make a big fuss about sitting down with my dad, who's your most famous friend that could come in and play my dad for next week's recording?

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360
Do you want me to say?

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.360
I don't know if he's in town or not.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.360
You know what I'm thinking.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.360
No, but will you just tell me if you think you can get somebody?

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.360
I will try for one person in particular.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360
Alright, so we'll get it.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360
We'll make my dad a cameo.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.360
I'm just taking the time out and saying that.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360
Right.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360
Alright, and he'll be the dad?

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360
Yeah.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360
Oh, that'd be good.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360
Yeah.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360
I think that'd be cool.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.360
And it's a role he's born to play.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360
Alright, okay.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360
Okay.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360
Spencer, you didn't hear any of that.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
It's Timothy Olofant, everybody.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360
No, I'm okay.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:41.360
I gotta find my dad if it takes all episode.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.360
You say to no one in particular?

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360
No, I'm saying to you.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360
You say to the dungeon master?

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.360
Yeah.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.360
I'm saying don't find my dad this episode.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.360
Yeah, no, I know.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.360
Yeah, so you're hitting pause right now because the meeting with the...

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:01.360
But we gotta do something to bring it into the Dungeons and Dragons segment.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.360
Is there a little slug we can hit with our sword and win some gold pieces?

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.360
Because they always applaud when we kill something.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.360
Maybe.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.360
You're in blue camp, though, right now.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.360
You don't see your father.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.360
Maybe you shask around and maybe something like exposition will happen for that.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.360
Alright.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.360
I'll be fulfilled.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360
I examine my asking around.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.360
You examine the asking around.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360
Nothing happens.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:31.360
I step forward and say I being but a little...

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360
What am I again?

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.360
A no barbarian.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.360
My friend is very shy.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.360
Where is Lord Buttsalot?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360
Lord Buttsalot.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.360
We've seen him a few days ago, but we believe he's in red camp preparing for battle.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.360
I walk out of the blue flap and go back in the red flap.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360
You walk out the blue flap.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.360
Behind you, you see the red tent of red camp.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.360
You enter red camp.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.360
It's so easy.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360
It's magic, you guys.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360
I know, I love it.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.360
Sometimes you need a no barbarian to get shit done.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:13.360
Entering red camp, you see several generals decked out in full military gear.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360
They're looking at maps and pushing figures around.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.360
You still don't see your father.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.360
Where is Lord Buttsalot?

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.360
You ask, everyone turns and looks at you.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:26.360
How did you get into red camp?

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.360
There's a Stratus.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.360
There's a series of magic flaps, you guys.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.360
I don't know who's running security at this camp.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:38.360
Who told you of our flaps?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.360
We used our keen insight and our awareness of our surroundings.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.360
Well, well, tis the little Buttsalot.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360
Return, is it not?

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.360
Yeah, but I'm a big Buttsalot now.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360
You may have noticed.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.360
Big Buttsalot, so Whatzalot.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:05.360
I remember you, Leonard.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.360
Dead-Eyed Duncan.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360
What?

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360
Dead-Eyed Duncan.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.360
I remember you, Dead-Eyed Duncan.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360
My Leonard was my little brother.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:20.360
You were a whole family, I always thought that rhyming things constituted a touche.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360
Ever since Grandpa Eight Eyes, we just went with it.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360
Grandpa Eight Eyes?

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360
Roller Skate Eyes.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.360
Sharpie.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.360
He eyes you with a newfound respect.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.360
It's that easy, you little fuckers.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.360
That's why your clan's not in charge.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.360
I pull Sharpie aside.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.360
Sharpie, ask him if he likes Big Buttsalot.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.360
Jesus, for that, all right.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.360
Listen, I need to find my dad.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:57.360
I've been out abroad and I've been gaining experience and fighting human centipedes and

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.360
just doing all kinds of things.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:04.360
I don't want the story to turn into a different thing.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360
I just want to find my dad.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.360
He issues a grunting gurgle and the other war generals leave the premises.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:16.360
He looks to his left and then to his right suspiciously before motioning you to approach closer.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.360
You know what's going on?

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:24.360
I wouldn't tell this to anyone but his own son, but Lord Buttsalot gathered 12 of our

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.360
bravest warriors and left out last night.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.360
We think he was on his way to the Dwarven and Camp, but we can't be sure.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:36.360
All right, listen, buddy, you've come with me this far.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.360
I'm going to say the same thing to you when I quit the Sarah Silverman program.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.360
I don't expect you to follow me everywhere.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.360
I think we should go after your father and you should help out and be at his right hand

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360
during this battle against the Dwarves.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.360
I think we should wait until next week when possibly there will be some stunt casting.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.360
I'm glad you said that, but with an emphasis on, I don't think we should fight the Dwarves

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.360
and conflicted about this.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.360
It sounds like a bunch of shenanigans to me.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.360
The only thing that worries me is that we just kicked a bunch of gnolls asses and your guys

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360
are in league with the gnolls.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.360
They're going to find out that we've killed a bunch of gnolls or are going to be in deep shit.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.360
We don't have to ever talk about that ever again.

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360
They're going to find out?

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360
It will never matter.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.360
They watch law in order too, probably, don't they?

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360
Well, at any rate, we both agree on one thing.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:28.360
We're heading out on the trail of my father, father, father.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:34.360
And you head out on the trail of your father.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.360
And so ends our D&D campaign.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.360
Spencer, everybody.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:46.360
Spencer.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.360
Yeah, that one's transitional.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360
We're teeing it up for next week.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.360
Yeah, I didn't know what we were going to do in that thing, anyway.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.360
Yeah.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360
I was probably too hands-on.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.360
But really, I personally love Spencer and the job that he does.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360
I know that people on Twitter and people listening out there love Spencer.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360
Let's hear it for Spencer.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.360
He's fucking awesome.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.360
You're saying the love is more genuine for him than it is for Adam Goldberg.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.360
I love Adam Goldberg too.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.360
What, what the fuck an A?

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360
How do we end the show every week?

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.360
You can just say thank you and you can...

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360
No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360
I can say let's hear it for Dan Harmon.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
They'll clap and we'll get out of here.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.360
No, no, no.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360
I won't do.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360
These people deserve better.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.360
They deserve something protracted.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.360
That's your idea, Adam.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.360
Dan Harmon won the 2012 election and he gives a thank you speech to Harmon Time.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360
It's not a bad idea.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.360
Say it again on mic.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.360
Adam said...

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.360
And now welcome your new...

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.360
It's hot, it's a hot mic.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.360
It's a hot mic.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360
No, you're a hot person.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.360
Thank you.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:55.360
And now welcome the new president of the United States, Dan Harmon.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360
All right.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360
Wow, I can't believe I won the election.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.360
Here's what I'm going to do.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:15.360
Every war that we were in, we're going to stay in.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.360
Everyone that was poor is going to stay just as poor.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.360
Everyone that was rich is going to stay just as rich.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.360
Nothing is going to change.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:33.360
I'll see you in three and a half years when I start inexplicably defending my position as if it ever existed.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:42.360
I'm a big rich asshole that lords over you and eclipses your life and convinces you that your neighbors are racist pedophiles.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:50.360
Thank you for coming and happy 2012 to 2016.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.360
All right, that was a bummer.

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:54.360
No, that was good.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.360
That was a bummer.

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360
All right.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360
USA.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360
USA.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360
USA.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360
USA.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360
USA.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360
USA.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360
USA.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360
USA.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.360
You trying to take this country away?

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.360
Harmontown will remain.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.360
Thank you everybody.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.360
Thanks guys.

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.360
Harmontown tonight.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.360
I want to thank Fidora for coming up.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.360
Adam Goldberg is always Spencer.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360
All right, Dungeon Master.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:31.360
Katie Levine, Zac McKeever, Emily Gordon, Daniel Kramer, Justin Marshall, Mo Fathelbab, Jenny Fine, Shahruz.Shackett.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.360
And once again, I'm Jeff Davis, the Comptroller.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.360
One more time for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:44.360
God bless each one of us and God bless America.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.360
God bless you for voting.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.360
God bless every state.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360
God bless every...

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360
Dan Caller right now.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360
Who do you think wins tomorrow?

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:56.360
I'm going to go ahead and call it for Obama.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.360
But don't be jaded because of that.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:03.360
If I turn out to be right, don't let that make you think that it doesn't matter.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.360
Thank you all.

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:33.360
Love you.
