It's gonna be back!\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\nThank you.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nI'm in a very bad mood, it's gonna be a terrible show.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:59.000\nI just feel like a bad person. I've been doing a lot of stress eating, and it's because,\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:05.000\nbut also, what's making it even worse is that I went, I gave my doctor blood and said,\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:10.000\ncheck my cholesterol, and then as soon as I gave the blood, I ran back to the office\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\nand I was eating Doritos and Twinkies and stuff, because they had the blood already.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:23.000\nRight. I know it's how insane that is, but I'm just like, okay, those numbers are safe.\n\n01:23.000 --> 01:28.000\nAnd then I'm just eating pizzas and rubbing Philly cheese takes on my face.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:35.000\nAnd it's also because we're writing Rick and Morty again, and I'm not doing a good job,\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:40.000\nI'm not able to write, and I can't break the stories, they're very difficult,\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:43.000\nand I know that Justin's gotta be upset with me at this point,\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:48.000\nbut it's so fucking hard, I don't get it, I don't know what you're doing,\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:54.000\nyou break the stories and it seems like they make sense, and then you have to re-break them 50 times.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:56.000\nIs it different this season than in previous seasons?\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:00.000\nNo, it's never different. It's never, ever, ever, ever been different.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:07.000\nI spent 20 years trying to codify, that's all me going, that circle thing,\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:12.000\nit's me trying as hard as I can to please for the love of Christ,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:17.000\nto make this easier, make this by the numbers, let me phone something in,\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:23.000\nI can't fucking do it, nothing ever makes sense, and I'm very upset.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:28.000\nObviously you'd be happier if it were easier, but isn't that part of the mythology of the joy\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nof what you do, is kind of the torture of it all?\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:37.000\nWell, I hope to God that, I used to think it was possible that I was making it difficult on purpose,\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:44.000\nso I could justify a lot of narcissism, but I've crossed into a world,\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:50.000\nI've been to therapy, and I'm perfect now, and I want quality of life,\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:54.000\nand I just want to be happy, and I know I'm old and racist and sexist,\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:59.000\nand I just want to die, that's how a healthy person feels at my age,\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:03.000\nan unhealthy person would be like, I'm 25 and I'm not racist,\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:07.000\nno, I'm old and racist and I want to die, I'm not really racist,\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:13.000\nit's just better to just say that, it's healthier, you know who says they're not racist?\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:19.000\nDonald Trump, he says that, you know who said he was? Jesus Christ.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:26.000\nAnd he wasn't, he was like, it's a nice thing to say, it's the polite thing to say,\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:32.000\nI'm racist, just in case you are, it's nice, it's called tact,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:36.000\nit's like a nice thing to say, you walk into a party and say, I'm racist,\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:42.000\nwhere do I hang my coat? But don't connect those dots,\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:50.000\njust don't look at a person of color and say, where do I hang my coat?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:55.000\nDon't connect dots, just say you're racist and get through your fucking day,\n\n03:55.000 --> 04:03.000\nand don't be racist, thank you, I'm sexist too, so shut up.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.000\nDo you think you're more racist than sexist, or is it even Steven?\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:13.000\nWell, I mean, God knows I hate black women, most of all.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nSo it's kind of a Venn diagram?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:21.000\nYeah, we can draw different conclusions from that, you know, I don't know, I don't know.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:29.000\nWhat do you think black women have been getting away with?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:34.000\nLet's do a special axe grinding edition of Harmontown.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:37.000\nCan you imagine, I don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:41.000\nBut as we've talked about this before, how crazy it is that this country,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:47.000\nits legacy as far as race and gender relations, kind of can be summed up,\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:52.000\nat least in terms of the weird lunacy, in that we freed the slaves\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nand then we're like, you can vote now, and then a million years later,\n\n04:56.000 --> 05:01.000\nwe're like, you two ladies, it's weird.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:08.000\nCan you imagine being like a black woman and gaining suffrage, but not quite?\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:14.000\nYou'd be like, yay, fuck, god damn it.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:17.000\nLike, what is with these people?\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:23.000\nAnd then we'd be like, what do you mean these people?\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:27.000\nThe hunter has become the hunted.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:31.000\nJust say you're racist, it's the next party, because the jig is up, right?\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:37.000\nYou guys, I mean, you've got a Nazi running for president, like this guy,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:41.000\nlike, you know, come on, we can't keep correcting each other's language\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:45.000\nand being polite and stuff anymore, we've got to start throwing bricks at shit.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.000\nWe didn't accomplish anything with those last ten years of like,\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:54.000\nmind your peas and queues.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nAnd then all of a sudden there's a fucking pizza hut guy running for,\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:02.000\nwinning, winning, becoming president.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:07.000\nAlright, speaking of racism, I play this game Fallout Shelter on the iOS,\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nyou guys play this as a part of the thing.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\nOkay, so it's like a little buildy game where you have little people\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nand you put them in little spots and they have attributes,\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nand you're supposed to, you're encouraged to like breed them,\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nbecause you're told you're supposed to make more dwellers in your Fallout Shelter\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:27.000\nand like their attributes are hereditary.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:31.000\nSo if you breed somebody that has like high scores, like those, excuse me,\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:34.000\nthose scores like pass down to their children.\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:39.000\nSo if you're playing the game right, then you're picking like somebody\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nand you're putting them up in this special room,\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:46.000\nand also like there's different outfits that like add to your, different attributes,\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.000\nand the attribute that drives whether you make quickly or not is charisma.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:53.000\nSo, and then there's these special characters.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:57.000\nSo there's this guy, long story short.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nHow did the special characters work?\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:04.000\nThere's like these characters that are like, they're like unlockable,\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nlike you get them on cards, it's like those freemium games,\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nlike you get a car, you pick and pay and you get a card,\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:13.000\nand then sometimes the card's like, boom, you got like this special guy.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:19.000\nAnd the special guy I got is a young man.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:28.000\nHis pigmentation is darker than what you might call the caucasoid Fallout dwellers.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.000\nHis name is Eulogy Jones.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:38.000\nHis stats are through the roof across the board.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:44.000\nSo I couldn't even like, which is like, like, like, think about that.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:48.000\nI mean, like, all right, so, so, like, like, like, so I had no try,\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:55.000\nI like, I put him in like these sexy, like, like, super charisma pajamas,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nand he's just, he's just up in a special room,\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:02.000\nand then all the people in the vault, I have to like, I click on each lady and I go,\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:05.000\nlet's take a look at your, your strengths and your perception.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:10.000\nOkay, you're pretty good. Put on this nightie, you're going up to Eulogy.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:14.000\nAnd he just, boom, bang, boom, and all the women walk up.\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:18.000\nAnd everyone in the shelter, shelter's last name is Jones.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:22.000\nYou get to dress the characters, you get to pick what everybody wears as they walk around your shelter.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou change their little outfits and then the different outfits have different bonuses\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nto different attributes and charisma.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:32.000\nSo, so, so there's these like, sleepwear adds to charisma.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nSo, you literally are taking like a woman who's like working hard on like a,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:40.000\nlike a water purification room, and you, and she's wearing like combat armor\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:44.000\nbecause it gives her more strength and makes her water purifying better.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\nActually, it's perception-friendly water purification.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nAll right, knock it off.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.000\nLike, a lot of people don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:54.000\nI don't have time to get fucking accurate for the three people that do.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:59.000\nBut, but you're taking a, you're taking a woman in the prime of her working career,\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:04.000\nlike clicking on her combat armor, changing it into a slinky nightie\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nand shooting her up to this fucking dude.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:07.000\nEulogy Jones.\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.000\nYeah, to Eulogy Jones who just jumps on her and fucking like takes her in the back\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nand there's like little green smile faces and then she comes out limping and pregnant.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnd then you send her back to work.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:26.000\nIt sounds like you're like the leader of a really like awesome cult.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:29.000\nYeah, anyways.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:30.000\nAll right, so I was just-\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nIs there an option to make one of these women the high status breeder character?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nYou could put a woman up there and send men up to her.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nSure, yes.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nBut Eulogy Jones is like, there's no comparing.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.000\nLike, he's like, he has like almost like just stats.\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:47.000\nYes, you would, it would be great to, to, it would be, it would be more in keeping with\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nsort of like biological tradition, right?\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:54.000\nLike the keeper of the egg stays stationary and then you keep shooting sperm at her.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:59.000\nYou know, like insects, you know, going to the queen, you know, like, you're up, Hank.\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nYou're going up to the boss lady.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nIt's your time in the barrel today.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:08.000\nGet your dick out, you little fucking drone.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nUnfortunately, that's not how it worked out in Harmon Shelter.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:19.000\nAll right, so I got, I took an Uber because it's a great organization that deserves as\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nmuch support as possible.\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:28.000\nI picked me up and I was, I wanted to pick up, you know, a Schrab because, because he needs\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\na ride in order to do the show.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:36.000\nAnd, and I told, I'm telling the guy how to drive to the place and I go, go up here,\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\ntake a right on this street.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nAnd then what?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:44.000\nAnd then, well, then you'll take another right, which street?\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.000\nI said, I don't, I'll show you which one.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:51.000\nI think I, it's, it's just a, it's a stop sign up.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:55.000\nI said, I want to say Ambrose, but I'll show you.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:59.000\nDriving comes and gets to the street.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nIt's avocado.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nHe takes a right, I got, I got, take a right, right here.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:08.000\nHe goes, it's avocado.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nHe corrected me.\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:14.000\nI was very clear in the fact that I was not like, like sure what the street was and he\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nfucking couldn't resist.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.000\nIt's avocado.\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:18.000\nYeah.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:19.000\nI see the sign too.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nLike I said, you got me.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:25.000\nDoesn't Uber make you or require a request that you type in your destination address\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:26.000\nwhen you get in the car?\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:31.000\nNo, I do that for my own convenience, but I first, I needed to pick up Schrab and then\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:32.000\ngo to this location.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:36.000\nSo I didn't want to freak anybody out or, I don't know how that would work.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:37.000\nI don't want to put in his address.\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:38.000\nAll right.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:39.000\nThat's it.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:40.000\nThat's all I got.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:45.000\nLet's, let's, let's turn it over to some of our friends starting with, let's bring out\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:46.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n11:47.000 --> 12:14.000\nSpeaking of a sexy night wear and attributes, did you just come from Eulogy Jones's place?\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:26.000\nI was sitting on the couch with my wonderful wife and my perfect dog, watching an L.A.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:31.000\nstory and, and said, it's a good movie.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nWhat a wonderful.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:33.000\nFuck.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:38.000\nWould you please do the show?\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:44.000\nIt was like an hour before we got here.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:47.000\nWill you please do the show?\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.760\nThey like you.\n\n12:49.760 --> 12:50.760\nHe likes you too, Rob.\n\n12:50.760 --> 12:51.760\nI know.\n\n12:51.760 --> 12:52.760\nI know.\n\n12:52.760 -->

13:06.000\nwithout him having said too much, I think it's, it's, it's a rekindling of your guys's,\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nyour friendship.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nWell, here, let's do the, let's do the actual conversation.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:12.000\nOh, should I get on my phone?\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:13.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nAll right, okay.\n\n13:14.000 -->

before the batter hits\n\n13:28.240 --> 13:35.000\nthe ball, it cuts to a woman peeing all over other women.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nPut like a fire hose, like, yeah.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:39.000\nAll right.\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nWhat do you do with your phone?\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:44.000\nWhat do you, what do you text?\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:47.000\nWhat, what, what, what is the,

13:53.000\nWhat?\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nOr ourselves?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nWho, who, which part do you want?\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.000\nDealer's choice.\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:57.000\nJust start.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.000\nWhat?\n\n13:58.000 --> 13:59.000\nWell, I'll play you.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nYou play me.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:01.000\nOkay.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nOkay.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:11.000\nThis is, this was at 10 to seven tonight.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:17.000\nUh, whoop, Harmontown tonight.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:20.000\nWhoop, please.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nEveryone loves you.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:30.000\nDude, it's an hour before your show.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:35.000\nI'm not organized.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:38.000\nThere's no, there's no guests.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:40.000\nYou'll have fun.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:45.000\nLike, like that's the thing that makes me have fun or not.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nIf there's like a guest.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:51.000\nYou always get a little antsy when, you know, people come up and they want to talk about\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:56.000\ntheir illness that they're struggling with and you like turn into a six year old in church.\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:02.000\nYou know, make an armpit farts and someone's just survived some leukemia or something.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nI don't even think you can.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nI'm not organized.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nThere's no guest.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:12.000\nYou'll have fun.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nYou have two assistants.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:25.000\nRemember last we talked and I thought I said, please just come every week.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nYeah.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:40.000\nAnd you didn't tell me there wasn't a show last week.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.000\nExtra text.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:48.000\nI looked like an idiot all alone on the stage.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:55.000\nAll right, I'll tell Steve that you're a regular part of the show so he could be on top of it.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nIf you come tonight.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nIf you pick me up.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nOkay.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nAnd heart my grams.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:08.000\nOkay.\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:09.000\nI need every heart.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nI need every, every heart I can get.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:15.000\nIt's a jungle out there.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd then whoops, I kind of fucked up.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nJust called Uber now and it's 10 minutes away from my place.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:29.000\nSo we're going to be rolling into meltdown like 805.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:32.000\nOh, no.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nIs that a car?\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nIs that a you were being sarcastic, right?\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:38.000\nYeah.\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nSaints preserve us holy cow.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\n805.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:48.000\nI had to find three different kinds of pajamas.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:52.000\nLuckily I was wearing my only pair.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:54.000\nHeading to you now.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nOkay.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:56.000\nPick a pulling up.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nAll right.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:02.000\nI'm glad you guys had fun listening to that.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:03.000\nAll right.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nCan't find my pocket now.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nSo I heard you got a pedicure.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nYou told me on the car right over here.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:20.000\nWell, an ounce of prevention is worth a pedicure.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:23.000\nHey man, you picked him.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nThe kids, the kids love him.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nAnd I, you know, I just, I was in a bad mood.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:32.000\nI thought, let's bring the guy that the kids like, you know, the crazy uncle.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:47.000\nIt's like so irritable and like, I feel like Mercury's in retrograde as my, my, my, my astrology believing ex-girlfriend Robin used to say every two weeks, Mercury's in retrograde.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nYeah.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.000\nShe's like every two weeks.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nEvery time your iPad doesn't play music, it's Mercury's in retrograde.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:57.000\nIt also affects traffic and parking and like, but I do think it's interesting to have as part of your mythology.\n\n17:57.000 --> 18:02.000\nCause like sometimes, you know, you have those days you just feel sort of like you're out of, you're out of sync.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nYeah.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nLike you feel like everything you do is clumsy.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nEverything you, everything you say is like ill timed.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nLike, like every, it's like nothing's working.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:13.000\nYou're like out of sync with the Lord.\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:16.000\nThere's also a full moon yesterday too, right?\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:22.000\nWe're in all the planets aligned, didn't like all the planets aligned.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nAnd then there was a full moon.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nSomebody thought I read that all the planets were aligned.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:28.000\nLike all of them?\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:33.000\nAll, every single planet in the universe were in a straight line.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:34.000\nYeah.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:35.000\nWhat's that?\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nFebruary 2nd.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nFebruary 2nd.\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nAll the planets will be aligned.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:40.000\nEveryone?\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:41.000\nWell, they must be.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:42.000\nEvery planet will be aligned.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nEven that, even that new one they just found?\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nThey found a new planet.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nIt's going to be in the front of the line.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nYeah.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:50.000\nYeah.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.000\nBefore that, before like Mercury?\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:55.000\nOkay.\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.000\nYeah.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nWell, where did they find this new planet?\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.000\nWay the fuck out there.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nOh, okay.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nMaybe it's the other side of the line.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nOkay.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nI mean, yeah, it's the front of the line depending on which way you're, which is the front.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:09.000\nI feel like all planets are trying to get into the rest of the universe, right?\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nSo the front of the line would be out there.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nThey'd be going away.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nThey'd be going away, man.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nThey'd be going away.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:16.000\nThey don't want to be, they don't want to be by no sun.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nNo, no.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:18.000\nThey'd be going away.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nThey'd be going all the way.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:20.000\nYeah.\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:24.000\nIf I were a planet, I wouldn't want to be the first to be devoured by the gravity and the heat of the sun.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.000\nNo, no.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:26.000\nI'd hate that.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nNo.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nGod, no.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nThat wouldn't be me.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:30.000\nHowever.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nNo, I wouldn't want that either.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nWhich, which, where in line would you like to be?\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nWould you like to be the farthest one out, Rob?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nWould you like to be like?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nAh, you know, in the, the light middle.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:40.000\nI see you as kind of a Neptune kind of a guy.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nYou're out, you're out there.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nYou're big and grassy.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nYeah.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nYou're big, grassy, blue.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\nYeah.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:49.000\nIs this kind of, is this one of our little fun sketches where Rob is Neptune and.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nAnd, and then we start improvising and it's really fun and joyful.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:53.000\nNot yet.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nOkay.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nAll right.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nOkay.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nNo, no.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nAll right.\n\n19:58.000 --> 19:59.000\nWell, I just, look.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:03.000\nThe, the, the, the, the, but the, the things on the outskirts of the solar system, like,\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nlike we've, we've, we've.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:09.000\nHere's something I've always wanted to know.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:15.000\nHow come when we, when we, when we go into space, how come we've never gone down?\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:20.000\nWe're always going to the moon.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nAlways going there.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nAlways sending stuff out.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nHow come we don't go down?\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nInto, into the earth?\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nSomebody.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nWhat?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nInto the center of the earth?\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nNo.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nHe's always going.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nHow come we're always on this two dimensional plane?\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nGo to Mars.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:37.000\nThe planets.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nLike.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nWhy don't we go down?\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nIt's funny.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nWhy don't we, why don't we ever go down?\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.000\nYeah.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:46.000\nWe could go up.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nYou always go.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:48.000\nWhy do we always go?\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nWhy do we always go?\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nWell, we're going to go to, we're going to go to, we're going to go to the moon.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nAnd then we're going to go to Mars.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nAnd then maybe we'll go out this way.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nIt might be somewhere right under us.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nWe could.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nThere might be a whole other solar system right under us.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nWe never.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nIt might be like an apartment complex.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nEven, even.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nThere might be a sun under the sun.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nEven in space.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nOh, shit.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:10.000\nIt is like everybody, you see some rocket takes off.\n\n21:10.000 --> 21:11.000\nIt just goes left.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nIt doesn't go.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nWe never go down.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nYou know?\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:20.000\nAnd I think this is why the South Pole needs a, like, like a rocket.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:24.000\nThey teach you when you, when you're making those little like mobiles of the solar system,\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nit's just a flat thing.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nYeah.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:28.000\nWhy don't they ever go down?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nYeah.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nBecause then, then you'd hit a baby.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:35.000\nThat's because it's based on a mobile, mobile, mobile.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nOh, shit.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nWe're indoctrinated.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:44.000\nWe learned since childhood, even all of NASA's scientists grew up looking at the first thing\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:45.000\nthey saw.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nThat was the thing above their crib.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nAnd so we're all, we've all gone crazy.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nDo you think, do you think that's why there's the baby in 2001?\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nYeah.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nYeah.\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nYeah.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nYeah.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nHe went down.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nYeah.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nYeah.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nThe baby's down here.\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:03.000\nIn the director's cut, in the director's cut, like he's, he's like floating and he kind\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nof turns and he's looking.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nHe's going to break the fourth wall and they cut.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:13.000\nThe director's cut, he goes, we should have went, we don't go down.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nWhy don't we ever go down?\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:18.000\nAnd it pulls out and there's a crease and a big crib.\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:19.000\nYeah.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nAnd then, and then it keeps pulling out.\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nYeah.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:22.000\nAnd it's like a nursery.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nYeah.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:26.000\nAnd then it's under a big triangle eye, illuminati.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nYeah.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:35.000\nAnd then, and then it keeps pulling out and there's a Jew.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:40.000\nI'm, I'm racist.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nI think so.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nThe power, the freedom.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nSorry.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nI dropped my phone.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:51.000\nYou reacted more to my phone dropping than my anti-Semitism.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:54.000\nIt's the Trump factor.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:56.000\nWe've, we've entered a fucking new.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.000\nWhy are we so afraid of going down?\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nHis phone just went down.\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nYou saw what happened.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:03.000\nYeah.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:04.000\nIt broke.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nWe, we never, we never went down.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nI, I, I think there's something down there.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nWhy don't we bring out a resident astronomical.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nRight.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nSpokesperson, Jonah Ray.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nWhat?\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:30.000\nHey, resident astronomical spokesman.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nThis is what I look like.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nThis is what you're doing at home.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:36.000\nThis is what I was look like.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:39.000\nI was in heaven.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nAnd then.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nThese look like comfortable shoes.\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nThey're Uggs.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:45.000\nThey sure are.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:48.000\nAre you guys attracted to women in Uggs?\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:51.000\nI'd say quite the opposite.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.000\nI'm very turned on by women in tights and Uggs.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:57.000\nTight, like the combo or just either are.\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nDefinitely.\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:03.000\nI ordered from each.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:07.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nThat is yours to keep, sir.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nThat is yours to keep.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nToss it back.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nToss it back.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.000\nThank you.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nI ordered each 24.\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nI ordered each 24 of the, of like a couple of weeks ago.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:23.000\nAnd I, and I, and I was dressed like this and I went down to get my, my green leaves.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nAnd then, and then I'm signing for it.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:30.000\nAnd then the guy, as I'm signing for it, the guy goes, those are cool.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nThey should make them for guys and walk the fuck away.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nNo.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nWow.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nNo.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nThis is the guy that works at green leaves.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nWas he a Wahlberg?\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:44.000\nShould have got, should have got burgers from Wahlburgers.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nDude got Wahlberg.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nHe should have got Wahlberg.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nYou know what?\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nIt's because he was watching the entourage marathon.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nThat was happening all weekend.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nThat sucks.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nThe thing that sucks about this.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nAnd I already signed it and I already gave him a tip.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nYeah.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nAnd I was like.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nYou still would have gave him a tip even if he had said that before.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nYeah.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nYou should have said, nice joke.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:12.000\nYou, they should, you should have, wait.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nNice.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nYes, you got it.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nYou got it.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nNice.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nYou got it, Dan.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nIt was pretty much like this.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nNice joke.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:25.000\nThe first person who originally came up with it, because then it would have been, uh,\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:29.000\nforgivable due to, like, like, it would have been a spontaneous.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:34.000\nAt this point, he would have been, he would have been back to green leaves.\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nIt's, it's a hack, you know, that's the thing.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nThat's like, that's what really bums me out.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:39.000\nBut it worked.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:40.000\nThat was all bummed out.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nWas he trying to zing you?\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nWas he being like, like in general?\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.000\nI don't think he was trying to zing me, which made it worse.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nHe was being like, I said serious, like, hey, look at those queer looking, no.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:50.000\nYou got.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:53.000\nWhat would, what would make these, for God's sake?\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:54.000\nMore manly?\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nI don't know.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.000\nSpikes?\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:57.000\nThey're brown?\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nLike got, like.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nLaces?\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nWith laces?\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nYeah.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nI mean, it's more.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nSpurs?\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nIt's more clear that animals had to die to make those.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nOh, don't say that.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:07.000\nSpurs and skin.\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:08.000\nAnd rubber.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:12.000\nMaybe the green leaves guys like Dan, and when he sees those, he thinks of women and tights.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nYeah, that's the thing.\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nThis is not vegan friendly in your order from a vegan restaurant.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nOh shit.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nHe was right to call you a queer.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:20.000\nThat's probably true.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nThese aren't vegan.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:22.000\nOkay.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nI'm getting rid of these.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nThrow them back in the audience.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nYou had a chance to throw them.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nAll right.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nNo, because someone might put them on and go, these are really comfortable and then run\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:34.000\ninto a field and kill a lamb.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:35.000\nFor Valentine's Day.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nLike honey, you got to try this.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:40.000\nSpencer, Spencer, these are, these are definitely like what?\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nThey're made out of pork.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nShit.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:44.000\nAll right.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.000\nAll right.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:46.000\nI'm getting rid of them.\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:50.000\nI mean, they're sheer lamb?\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nWhat did you think they were?\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nYeah.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.000\nLike, they shear the lamb.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:58.000\nLike they pull the skin off of the lamb.\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nOkay.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:00.000\nYeah.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nBut what's wrapped around them?\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:03.000\nThe outside?\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:04.000\nMore lamb skin.\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nThat's more lamb.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nThat's leather you're wearing.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nOkay.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:11.000\nWell, I should have done my research before I did my billion Facebook posts.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nYou're bad.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nYou feel good now that your feet are at swath and had a nice lamb sandwich?\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nAll right.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nAll right.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nWho wants them?\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:19.000\nWho wants them?\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nBut now your feet are going to...\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nWhat are your feet?\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nWhat are your feet made out of?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nRoast.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nAnd that's way...\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nOh, good.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nThat's good.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nYes.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nSeparate them.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nGive them both to the same person at least.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nNo, no.\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:31.000\nNo.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nThe two different people will find them and then they'll know true love once they come\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\ntogether.\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:39.000\nTail as old as time.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:40.000\nHow much is this a card?\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nDo you think there's any wool on you?\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nLet's get you fucking naked.\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:47.000\nI hope you're covered in wool.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nLook at the tag.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:49.000\nLook at the tag.\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:50.000\nLook at the tag.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:53.000\nOh, is it all just tricking the book?\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nThere's no tag on the back of this.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nIt's just your shirt.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:57.000\nIt says pork.\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nOh, shit.\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nYeah.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nAll right.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:09.000\nWe'll strip them down of his animal products and then we'll slowly introduce him into the\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nsweatshop thing.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nYeah.\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:14.000\nWell, yeah, that's, that's a violour.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nAll right.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:20.000\nI worked at a sweatshop.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nI worked at a sweatshop down in Vernon, California.\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nOkay.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:25.000\nYeah.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:29.000\nI was, I worked with a bunch of Russian ladies and then I was fired because they, I didn't\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:30.000\nsweat enough.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:31.000\nI didn't sweat enough.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.720\nIt's because I spoke English and the guy's like, you must be good at computers.\n\n28:34.720 --> 28:38.500\nAnd then he made me try to do spreadsheets and I was real bad at Excel and then he says,\n\n28:38.500 --> 28:39.500\nyou're fucking fired.\n\n28:39.500 --> 28:41.500\nAnd you're like, pull me back with the Russian women.\n\n28:41.500 --> 28:42.500\nHe says like, wait, no.\n\n28:42.500 --> 28:45.240\nI asked, I said, I was pretty good at putting buttons on jeans.\n\n28:45.240 --> 28:47.000\nHe said, no, you weren't.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:48.000\nWow.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:51.200\nWhat, what, yeah, what, so what were you making?\n\n28:51.200 --> 28:52.200\nWhat was the product?\n\n28:52.200 --> 28:56.120\nIt was a brand that I, that I had never heard of.\n\n28:56.120 --> 29:00.480\nI think it was called Leafy's.\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:02.840\nIt was some like just like off-brand jean.\n\n29:02.840 --> 29:07.160\nAnd I was just putting on the top button above the zipper.\n\n29:07.160 --> 29:10.040\nThat was all I did all day for like eight hours.\n\n29:10.040 --> 29:11.720\nWere they riveted on or stitched on?\n\n29:11.720 --> 29:12.720\nThey were riveted.\n\n29:12.720 --> 29:14.680\nI was, I used a riveter.\n\n29:14.680 --> 29:17.040\nAnd then I, that's all, that's all I did all day.\n\n29:17.040 --> 29:22.200\nHow big was the riveter?\n\n29:22.200 --> 29:23.400\nHow big was it?\n\n29:23.400 --> 29:25.640\nIt was about as big as you mined.\n\n29:25.640 --> 29:26.640\nYeah.\n\n29:26.640 --> 29:27.640\nYeah.\n\n29:27.640 --> 29:28.640\nSo.\n\n29:28.640 --> 29:32.000\nI'm still bummed out about the whole Uggs thing.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.920\nI should have known that along, it's weird because it's such a go-to for, for people\n\n29:35.920 --> 29:38.960\nwho are defensive about, about, about the animal thing.\n\n29:38.960 --> 29:42.000\nThe first thing they, they learn to say is like, what, what do you think your shoes\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:43.000\nand your belt are made of?\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:44.000\nI know.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.720\nI got rid of all my shoes and my belt and my wallet, but I didn't think of my Uggs because\n\n29:46.720 --> 29:47.720\nI'm stupid.\n\n29:47.720 --> 29:50.200\nIs Dan going to have to carry you to the Uber like officer and a gentleman on the way out\n\n29:50.200 --> 29:51.200\nof here?\n\n29:51.200 --> 29:52.200\nGod damn it, he better.\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:53.200\nYou better.\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:57.080\nWell, I don't think you should feel that bad because I mean, it's, as much as I'm\n\n29:57.080 --> 30:01.320\nsure you'd love to have a perfect like, like no animal effect record.\n\n30:01.320 --> 30:02.320\nIt's impossible.\n\n30:02.320 --> 30:06.600\nIt's much more important to like, like, like, I mean, a reduction is good, right?\n\n30:06.600 --> 30:07.600\nYeah.\n\n30:07.600 --> 30:11.240\nBut it's just, it's, it's, it's really impossible.\n\n30:11.240 --> 30:12.240\nIt's really hard.\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:18.240\nWell, you know, we are fucking crazy super evolved monkeys that like had, I mean, we're,\n\n30:18.240 --> 30:19.840\nwe're carnivorous.\n\n30:19.840 --> 30:20.840\nWe're omnivorous.\n\n30:20.840 --> 30:25.720\nSo like, like, like we can, we can figure out how to evolve and subsist not by not hurting\n\n30:25.720 --> 30:31.120\nanimals, but like, I mean, we do live by murdering.\n\n30:31.120 --> 30:32.120\nWe do.\n\n30:32.120 --> 30:33.120\nYeah.\n\n30:33.120 --> 30:34.120\nOh, you're right.\n\n30:34.120 --> 30:37.400\nYeah, I do.\n\n30:37.400 --> 30:39.000\nPlants are, plants are alive.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.120\nThey just, you know, some plants kill.\n\n30:41.120 --> 30:42.120\nSo suddenly, yeah.\n\n30:42.120 --> 30:45.320\nThat's they, everyone's all high and mighty about plants, but they fucking murder flies.\n\n30:45.320 --> 30:46.640\nThis is fly trap.\n\n30:46.640 --> 30:47.760\nThis is, this is not me.\n\n30:47.760 --> 30:51.000\nThis is not me being a person that's saying like, oh, we might as well eat a bunch of\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:52.000\ncows.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nLike that's all.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.480\nLike I'm, I'm trying to let a guy off the hook that's given himself a hard time.\n\n30:55.480 --> 30:56.480\nI mean, you're doing it.\n\n30:56.480 --> 30:59.400\nI mean, I've been vegetarian for like 22 or three years.\n\n30:59.400 --> 31:00.400\nHere we go.\n\n31:00.400 --> 31:05.880\nBut I have one week, one weakness ribs.\n\n31:05.880 --> 31:10.520\nI have leather shoes and a belt and a wallet.\n\n31:10.520 --> 31:12.960\nSo I'm a hypocritical vegetarian all the way.\n\n31:12.960 --> 31:18.560\nYou know, I mean, I think, you know, like nobody wants to think of things in terms of\n\n31:18.560 --> 31:23.960\njust a statistics and reduction because then you're like feeling like you're like, oh,\n\n31:23.960 --> 31:29.480\nI'm the only going to kill a certain amount of things with my life, doesn't every little\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:30.480\nthing.\n\n31:30.480 --> 31:33.480\nLike, isn't it shouldn't the goal be more, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be about absolutes.\n\n31:33.480 --> 31:38.400\nIt should be about like a reduction of, so that now, now Rob's Ugg boot, Rob's Ugg\n\n31:38.400 --> 31:42.160\nboot is being passed around the audience and it just emerged with a flash of tequila inside\n\n31:42.160 --> 31:43.160\nit.\n\n31:43.160 --> 31:48.000\nIs it like a magical luck boot?\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.400\nNow it's just being passed around like a weird flask.\n\n31:50.400 --> 31:56.120\nPeople, people are drinking out of your Ugg boot, drink, drink the boot, drink the boot.\n\n31:56.120 --> 32:04.040\nEach tag, drink the boot, drink the boot, drink the boot, drink the boot.\n\n32:04.040 --> 32:06.920\nHere's the thing, we're all forgetting it's an Ugg boot and it will immediately just soak\n\n32:06.920 --> 32:07.920\nup all the booze.\n\n32:07.920 --> 32:12.040\nSo then you're going to have to squeeze the boot, squeeze the boot, find a camera, squeeze\n\n32:12.040 --> 32:13.040\nthe boot.\n\n32:13.040 --> 32:14.040\nGet up here, stand up here.\n\n32:14.040 --> 32:15.040\nWhat is your name?\n\n32:15.040 --> 32:16.040\nEthan.\n\n32:16.040 --> 32:17.040\nOf course, I know Ethan.\n\n32:17.040 --> 32:18.040\nDon't drink it like that.\n\n32:18.040 --> 32:19.040\nIt's just a coosie that way.\n\n32:19.040 --> 32:22.480\nIt showed up in a laugh and I ticked it sideways and it just fell out.\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:23.480\nFind a camera and drink the boot.\n\n32:23.480 --> 32:25.640\nYeah, look ahead at one of those cameras.\n\n32:25.640 --> 32:27.200\nYou sound like a porn director.\n\n32:27.200 --> 32:29.200\nFind the camera, drink the boot.\n\n32:29.200 --> 32:35.080\nOh yeah, it's real boot liquor.\n\n32:35.080 --> 32:37.080\nOh shit.\n\n32:37.080 --> 32:40.720\nShe snuck in here, I was there when she got in.\n\n32:40.720 --> 32:41.720\nDrink the boot.\n\n32:41.720 --> 32:44.640\nI'm actually going to go to the bathroom doing this.\n\n32:44.640 --> 32:45.640\nOkay.\n\n32:45.640 --> 32:46.640\nI don't believe it.\n\n32:46.640 --> 32:48.960\nYou're going to go to the bathroom with no shoes on?\n\n32:48.960 --> 32:49.960\nThat's so gross.\n\n32:49.960 --> 32:50.960\nWow.\n\n32:50.960 --> 32:52.200\nYou're just going to soak up pee in your socks.\n\n32:52.200 --> 32:55.920\nThis was your moment and Schrab just decided to leave.\n\n32:55.920 --> 32:56.920\nAlright, thank you.\n\n32:56.920 --> 32:57.920\nThank you.\n\n32:57.920 --> 32:58.920\nPass the boot around.\n\n32:58.920 --> 32:59.920\nPass the boot.\n\n32:59.920 --> 33:00.920\nWhat do you want?\n\n33:00.920 --> 33:01.920\nThe boot.\n\n33:01.920 --> 33:06.320\nSchrab's going to walk back on with like piss sticky feet.\n\n33:06.320 --> 33:08.920\nIt's going to be fucking sick.\n\n33:08.920 --> 33:10.920\nWell, are we going to...\n\n33:10.920 --> 33:18.280\nYou know, this is as good as Schrab.\n\n33:18.280 --> 33:22.080\nAre we going to applaud his vegan values or are we going to...\n\n33:22.080 --> 33:23.560\nAre we going to piss foot shame him?\n\n33:23.560 --> 33:24.560\nI mean, like this is...\n\n33:24.560 --> 33:26.240\nWhy can't we do both?\n\n33:26.240 --> 33:29.640\nWe're reliving the fall from grace to humanity.\n\n33:29.640 --> 33:34.280\nI would rather Rob have animals on his feet than walk through pee-pee town with the socks\n\n33:34.280 --> 33:35.280\non.\n\n33:35.280 --> 33:39.160\nAs long as he got eyes wide open about that, so, okay, let's kill animals so our lives\n\n33:39.160 --> 33:40.160\naren't gross.\n\n33:40.160 --> 33:41.920\nI mean, that is the deal we made.\n\n33:41.920 --> 33:42.920\nAnd then we...\n\n33:42.920 --> 33:45.880\nAnd then the slippery slope as we started going, what about poor people?\n\n33:45.880 --> 33:46.880\nWho?\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:52.040\nI mean, they sound like they're mooing to me.\n\n33:52.040 --> 33:59.320\nI guess it's just I have my penthouse apartment, but all I hear is a kind of drone.\n\n33:59.320 --> 34:00.320\nIt sounds like a moo.\n\n34:00.320 --> 34:04.720\nI mean, you know, I'm not saying eat them.\n\n34:04.720 --> 34:05.880\nWe got all this pork.\n\n34:05.880 --> 34:10.160\nBut what if we ate their happiness?\n\n34:10.160 --> 34:11.160\nYes.\n\n34:11.160 --> 34:17.080\nWhat if most of them killed themselves and each other because we just leached their fucking\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:18.160\nenergy off of them?\n\n34:18.160 --> 34:22.480\nYou know that feeling when you walk by a homeless person that you don't give any money to?\n\n34:22.480 --> 34:24.680\nAnd then when that feeling of guilt goes away?\n\n34:24.680 --> 34:27.720\nThat's the best feeling in the world.\n\n34:27.720 --> 34:37.600\nIf we could bottle that with sociopolitical anal beads, it's better on the way out.\n\n34:37.600 --> 34:42.720\nCausing trauma to just...\n\n34:42.720 --> 34:44.760\nThere must be like a way to yank.\n\n34:44.760 --> 34:48.360\nBecause it's always such a slow process, you've got to pat their fake pockets and you walk\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:51.360\nby and then it's a block later, you're kind of feel a little bit of relief.\n\n34:51.360 --> 34:54.520\nHow do you yank it on a skateboard?\n\n34:54.520 --> 34:56.080\nLike a skateboard pass to a homeless guy?\n\n34:56.080 --> 34:57.080\nI can't...\n\n34:57.080 --> 34:58.080\nWhoa!\n\n34:58.080 --> 34:59.080\nYeah.\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:00.080\nYeah.\n\n35:00.080 --> 35:01.080\nGoing in, not so fun on the way out.\n\n35:01.080 --> 35:02.080\nBoy, oh boy.\n\n35:02.080 --> 35:07.640\nDid I tell you about my friend who used to work in the Returns Department at a sex toy\n\n35:07.640 --> 35:08.640\nshop?\n\n35:08.640 --> 35:09.640\nNo.\n\n35:09.640 --> 35:10.640\nIs that allowed?\n\n35:10.640 --> 35:14.800\nYeah, my two friends of mine actually worked in the Returns Department at a sex toy shop.\n\n35:14.800 --> 35:16.800\nThey needed two people on that job.\n\n35:16.800 --> 35:19.800\nThere's a flood of people coming in.\n\n35:19.800 --> 35:24.240\nLook, apparently they would work late nights and people would bring, stuff would come back\n\n35:24.240 --> 35:30.480\nand clearly having been re-boxed, meaning they tried it on or in for size.\n\n35:30.480 --> 35:32.840\nAnd now they're like, this wasn't what I wanted.\n\n35:32.840 --> 35:34.720\nBut that's illegal.\n\n35:34.720 --> 35:35.720\nI would imagine.\n\n35:35.720 --> 35:36.720\nIt's a biohazard.\n\n35:36.720 --> 35:41.240\nBut they also worked in the sex shop, and my friend, Israel, worked in the shop.\n\n35:41.240 --> 35:47.200\nAnd Gargamel would mop the peep booths.\n\n35:47.200 --> 35:51.760\nAnd they said that a guy came in late night, there was also a store front.\n\n35:51.760 --> 35:57.440\nThere was the brick and mortar front of the shop that you could go in and buy sex toys.\n\n35:57.440 --> 36:00.760\nAnd a guy pulls up late at night, and they hated this job more than anything as you\n\n36:00.760 --> 36:01.760\ncan imagine.\n\n36:01.760 --> 36:04.920\nAnd this guy pulls up in a fancy sports car with a hot drunk chick out in the car, and\n\n36:04.920 --> 36:05.920\nhe comes in.\n\n36:05.920 --> 36:08.920\nAnd he's like, hey, I want to get some sex toys.\n\n36:08.920 --> 36:09.920\nCome on.\n\n36:09.920 --> 36:12.600\nAnd they're like, oh, Jeff, you tried anal bees.\n\n36:12.600 --> 36:13.600\nAnd no, what do those do?\n\n36:13.600 --> 36:17.960\nYou know, you have her put these into your butt, and right as you're about to come to\n\n36:17.960 --> 36:23.680\nher, tell her to pull them out as hard as she can and scream Geronimo.\n\n36:23.680 --> 36:26.720\nHe's like, really?\n\n36:26.720 --> 36:27.720\nThat works like gas.\n\n36:27.720 --> 36:28.720\nThey did that.\n\n36:28.720 --> 36:30.720\nI'm hoping that guy's alive still.\n\n36:30.720 --> 36:33.720\nIsn't that what you're supposed to do?\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:34.720\nYelcheronimo?\n\n36:34.720 --> 36:38.800\nWell, I mean, you're not supposed to pull them out like you're starting a lawn mower.\n\n36:38.800 --> 36:39.800\nYou're not?\n\n36:39.800 --> 36:40.800\nNo.\n\n36:40.800 --> 36:43.800\nI thought, everything I know about anal bees, I learned from stand-up comics.\n\n36:43.800 --> 36:51.120\nI love that book.\n\n36:51.120 --> 36:55.400\nChicken soup for the fleshlight.\n\n36:55.400 --> 37:02.200\nMy friend, he worked at a video store that was 15% regular new release movies, and then\n\n37:02.200 --> 37:07.120\nthe rest, porn, just porn and sex toys, and he said there was one movie that was consistently\n\n37:07.120 --> 37:13.000\nrented along as if he was going there for this movie, and then he would get a porn\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:14.000\njust because it was there.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:19.200\nOh, it's the Colgate toothpaste of the pantyhose fetishist at Albertsons.\n\n37:19.200 --> 37:20.200\nYou want to know what it was?\n\n37:20.200 --> 37:21.920\nIt's like, toothpaste is like right in the right spot.\n\n37:21.920 --> 37:23.520\nI need some toothpaste and some pantyhose.\n\n37:23.520 --> 37:27.120\nI might as well just like.\n\n37:27.120 --> 37:35.120\nAnd that toothpaste was a league of their own.\n\n37:35.120 --> 37:38.800\nI had to go to the market yesterday because I was taping a hoose line and I've learned\n\n37:38.800 --> 37:42.240\nthat I sweat a lot to my armpits and I wear suits and I don't want to sweat through them.\n\n37:42.240 --> 37:46.240\nSo I've learned from a wardrobe lady that you put maxi pads in your t-shirt and like\n\n37:46.240 --> 37:49.320\nlittle penny lanners in there and it works like, it works a charm.\n\n37:49.320 --> 37:50.720\nDoes it look like you have puffy pits though?\n\n37:50.720 --> 37:54.120\nI don't know because they're little skinny guys that go right, you stick them on in the\n\n37:54.120 --> 37:58.400\ninside of your armpit of your t-shirt and you put them in there and you're good to go.\n\n37:58.400 --> 38:00.040\nIt's like a wardrobe secret.\n\n38:00.040 --> 38:03.160\nBut it was the first time I walked up and I forget what else I bought but it was a pretty\n\n38:03.160 --> 38:04.160\nfunny egg.\n\n38:04.160 --> 38:07.320\nI got some peanut butter cups.\n\n38:07.320 --> 38:17.240\nYeah, I get so much like, yeah, it was like, I give them more scotch tape, I don't know.\n\n38:17.240 --> 38:20.240\nYou never just go in and say, fuck it, I'm just going to go pantyhose straight across\n\n38:20.240 --> 38:24.760\nthe board and you don't ever do like a beard purchase on that?\n\n38:24.760 --> 38:25.760\nNo.\n\n38:25.760 --> 38:30.840\nThere was one time, this is all pre-Amazon days, so really if you were going to be a\n\n38:30.840 --> 38:38.200\ncreep with a nylon fetish and no girlfriend and you were going to have an indulge yourself\n\n38:38.200 --> 38:43.480\nwith your mannequin leg, you were on some level you were going to have a face-to-face\n\n38:43.480 --> 38:52.760\nencounter and I remember going into like a boutique on a large month, you know, a fancy\n\n38:52.760 --> 38:53.760\nplace.\n\n38:53.760 --> 38:54.760\nLike a lingerie or something.\n\n38:54.760 --> 39:11.280\nI was just like, I got caught so off guard that I was like, I was so used to like, oh.\n\n39:11.280 --> 39:18.560\nI know Rob, the plastics industry ain't no same either.\n\n39:18.560 --> 39:21.880\nThe carbon literal footprint of what you're wearing right now.\n\n39:21.880 --> 39:30.320\nYeah, you know they still use cattle to drive the plastic mills.\n\n39:30.320 --> 39:33.560\nRob has plastic bags on his feet right now, for our homelessness.\n\n39:33.560 --> 39:40.960\nHey, tell him to subscribe to the video feed, for our homeless listeners, Rob's having\n\n39:40.960 --> 39:43.600\nsome beautiful plastic bags on his feet.\n\n39:43.600 --> 39:47.520\nAnd Jonah feels great about having walked away from you.\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:54.000\nAnyways, so I walked into this boutique and I was so used to the larger kind of Albertsons\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:57.560\nenergy where I was like, okay, I'm going to walk around, I'm going to browse, I'm going\n\n39:57.560 --> 40:03.880\nto walk out of here with a few sundries and notions and among them maybe perhaps a hosiery\n\n40:03.880 --> 40:04.880\nproduct.\n\n40:04.880 --> 40:06.600\nYeah, for the wife, back home.\n\n40:06.600 --> 40:11.080\nI don't know why, but it's a tiny little store and there were like three women who were really\n\n40:11.080 --> 40:19.800\nhelpful and I was browsing this rack of like a panty house and it all happened so quickly.\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:23.920\nI just walked in, where are you?\n\n40:23.920 --> 40:27.920\nYou're not allowed to, you've just, that was also the beginning of the story.\n\n40:27.920 --> 40:29.840\nHe's in a boutique on Larchmont for panty house.\n\n40:29.840 --> 40:30.840\nYeah, I mean, fine.\n\n40:30.840 --> 40:36.560\nThat's all you had to say, that's all you had to say, now I can be quiet and listen.\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:40.280\nListen to that while you were on the stage, presumably listening.\n\n40:40.280 --> 40:41.280\nI wasn't listening.\n\n40:41.280 --> 40:46.000\nAnd you came in with, you came in here like Gallagher with shit on your feet, like, wait,\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nwait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nIt's my favorite Gallagher.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nI took it in stride.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:53.360\nI don't know, don't think I can hear what you guys are saying about me when I'm walking\n\n40:53.360 --> 40:54.360\nout there.\n\n40:54.360 --> 40:55.360\nWhat the fuck are you asking questions?\n\n40:55.360 --> 40:59.080\nYou guys are walking out, you guys, I'm walking out there and I'm going to the bathroom and\n\n40:59.080 --> 41:01.360\nso you go, he's going to get pee on his foot.\n\n41:01.360 --> 41:06.680\nHe's like, I'm such a fucking joke, I've got a piece of shit to you.\n\n41:06.680 --> 41:09.960\nNobody can hear anything when you walk with plastic bags on your feet.\n\n41:09.960 --> 41:16.440\nYou can feel like a fucking jackass all the time, feel like a piece of shit, piss all\n\n41:16.440 --> 41:19.080\nover me.\n\n41:19.080 --> 41:22.000\nThanks for having me on, man.\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:32.520\nYou make me look like a jerk in front of my wife, dog.\n\n41:32.520 --> 41:38.480\nSo these three ladies come over and they're trying to help you out.\n\n41:38.480 --> 41:40.560\nThey're just like immediately like, can I help you?\n\n41:40.560 --> 41:45.000\nAnd I was like standing by the pantyhose when they asked that and I was like, no, I'm just\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:50.200\nlooking and they're like at pantyhose and I was like, yeah, and they're like for your\n\n41:50.200 --> 41:55.000\ngirlfriend and I'm like, yep, it just kept on from there until I mean, I had to make\n\n41:55.000 --> 42:00.480\nthis whole fictional girlfriend and like, I was like shopping for like, why am I buying\n\n42:00.480 --> 42:05.560\nher pantyhose and how tall is she and it was a whole thing, it's not like a hugely entertaining\n\n42:05.560 --> 42:06.560\nstory dialogue line.\n\n42:06.560 --> 42:07.560\nI'm sorry, I interrupted then.\n\n42:07.560 --> 42:26.040\nYou got to take notes.\n\n42:26.040 --> 42:31.640\nSo anyways, Jonah, we are label mates in this new venture called CISO.\n\n42:31.640 --> 42:32.640\nCISO.\n\n42:32.640 --> 42:33.640\nCISO.\n\n42:33.640 --> 42:38.960\nI have a couple of questions.\n\n42:38.960 --> 42:40.200\nYou have CISO questions.\n\n42:40.200 --> 42:43.880\nWhy is it called CISO when there's only one ring in it?\n\n42:43.880 --> 42:45.800\nIf you see something, say something.\n\n42:45.800 --> 42:46.800\nSay something.\n\n42:46.800 --> 42:47.800\nIsn't it C?\n\n42:47.800 --> 42:48.800\nNo, you get it.\n\n42:48.800 --> 42:49.800\nIf you see something, say something.\n\n42:49.800 --> 42:50.800\nNo one knows why.\n\n42:50.800 --> 42:51.800\nDo you know why?\n\n42:51.800 --> 43:01.360\nHe says like it's, if you don't believe that you can get good comedy for $4.99 a month,\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:03.640\nsee, so you get it.\n\n43:03.640 --> 43:06.760\nI think that, I mean, it's not good, but that's what it is.\n\n43:06.760 --> 43:07.760\nThat's what it is.\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:08.760\nYeah.\n\n43:08.760 --> 43:09.760\nCISO for yourself.\n\n43:09.760 --> 43:12.160\nI think that, well, I'll tell you, I have the answer to your question, but I think the\n\n43:12.160 --> 43:18.080\nbottom line is probably that as with, that the goal is always to come up with gibberish\n\n43:18.080 --> 43:21.080\nbecause that's the all that's left available.\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:24.800\nAnd it has to be gibberish that when you hear it, you know how to spell it.\n\n43:24.800 --> 43:29.680\nBut I think the logic behind the etymology as has been told to me is that you see something\n\n43:29.680 --> 43:36.320\nso you tell someone, it's summarizing the primal experience of word of mouth advertising.\n\n43:36.320 --> 43:37.320\nWow.\n\n43:37.320 --> 43:38.320\nCISO.\n\n43:38.320 --> 43:44.760\nI see Monty Python archives, so I'm telling Jonah Ray, you go to CISO.\n\n43:44.760 --> 43:45.760\nBut I'm already there.\n\n43:45.760 --> 43:46.760\nYeah, that's true.\n\n43:46.760 --> 43:49.480\nJonah, when does your show drop?\n\n43:49.480 --> 43:51.760\nI think June, I think.\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:52.760\nJune is, when is yours?\n\n43:52.760 --> 43:53.760\nWhen does yours go?\n\n43:53.760 --> 43:54.760\nSpring.\n\n43:54.760 --> 43:55.760\nApril.\n\n43:55.760 --> 43:56.760\n2006.\n\n43:56.760 --> 43:57.760\nJeff, Jeff's in an episode of my show.\n\n43:57.760 --> 43:59.760\nWhat's it called again?\n\n43:59.760 --> 44:00.760\nHidden America.\n\n44:00.760 --> 44:01.760\nHidden America with Jonah Ray.\n\n44:01.760 --> 44:02.760\nIt's great.\n\n44:02.760 --> 44:03.760\nYeah, I got to be in one episode.\n\n44:03.760 --> 44:04.760\nYeah, to be in an episode.\n\n44:04.760 --> 44:05.760\nAwesome.\n\n44:05.760 --> 44:06.760\nDo you think it's good?\n\n44:06.760 --> 44:07.760\nMy show?\n\n44:07.760 --> 44:10.400\nI don't like anything I do.\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:15.360\nI like one thing I've done, Harmon Quest, coming soon to CISO.\n\n44:15.360 --> 44:16.360\nWhen does that come out?\n\n44:16.360 --> 44:17.360\nSpring.\n\n44:17.360 --> 44:18.360\n2016.\n\n44:18.360 --> 44:19.360\nDo you like it?\n\n44:19.360 --> 44:20.360\nIt's really good.\n\n44:20.360 --> 44:21.360\nI really love it.\n\n44:21.360 --> 44:22.360\nI like mine too.\n\n44:22.360 --> 44:23.360\nI like mine too then.\n\n44:23.360 --> 44:24.360\nOkay.\n\n44:24.360 --> 44:27.360\nI don't know how to, I don't like ego and bravado.\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:30.960\nSo to say I like something I did feels a bit too forward.\n\n44:30.960 --> 44:32.760\nUnless you make something amazing.\n\n44:32.760 --> 44:33.760\nThat's true.\n\n44:33.760 --> 44:34.760\nI don't think.\n\n44:34.760 --> 44:37.280\nThen you're just being humble by going, whoa, I made that.\n\n44:37.280 --> 44:38.280\nDo you do that often?\n\n44:38.280 --> 44:40.080\nNo, just with Harmon Quest.\n\n44:40.080 --> 44:43.520\nComing soon to CISO.\n\n44:43.520 --> 44:46.880\nCommunity seasons one through six all sucked.\n\n44:46.880 --> 44:50.560\nRick and Morty can suck my balls.\n\n44:50.560 --> 44:53.360\nHarmon Quest is the one thing I'm proud of.\n\n44:53.360 --> 44:54.360\nWow.\n\n44:54.360 --> 44:55.440\nThat's great.\n\n44:55.440 --> 44:58.400\nSo if that interests you, tune in.\n\n44:58.400 --> 44:59.400\nThat does.\n\n44:59.400 --> 45:01.680\nSo it's because all these people are going like, well, I love those things.\n\n45:01.680 --> 45:04.880\nThe guy who made it thinks they suck, this Harmon Quest going to be the best.\n\n45:04.880 --> 45:05.880\nYeah.\n\n45:05.880 --> 45:08.880\nIt's a little misguided.\n\n45:08.880 --> 45:15.600\nIt was remarkable the extent to which like seeing that whole thing come together because\n\n45:15.600 --> 45:20.680\nI was like, when I was watching the Ricky Gervais show on HBO, I was like, I fucking\n\n45:20.680 --> 45:26.960\nlove it when people are saying shit in audio off the cuff and then animators are illustrating\n\n45:26.960 --> 45:33.840\nit in the exact, it is the thing that makes me laugh until I cry all the time.\n\n45:33.840 --> 45:39.360\nIf the guy is Carl Pilkington and the artist, those artists, if you strive for that, you\n\n45:39.360 --> 45:41.680\ncan make me laugh until I cry in that format.\n\n45:41.680 --> 45:45.840\nSo I was like, yeah, there's got to be a way to like the D&D thing to do that and that's\n\n45:45.840 --> 45:49.680\nbeen like years and years in the making and seeing it actually come together now.\n\n45:49.680 --> 45:52.680\nI hear all your friends are a part of it.\n\n45:52.680 --> 45:53.680\nYep.\n\n45:53.680 --> 45:57.520\nJust the funny ones.\n\n45:57.520 --> 46:00.200\nYeah.\n\n46:00.200 --> 46:01.200\nThat's cool.\n\n46:01.200 --> 46:03.240\nThat's cool that you got them all together.\n\n46:03.240 --> 46:04.240\nYeah.\n\n46:04.240 --> 46:06.680\nIt must have been hard because they're so busy.\n\n46:06.680 --> 46:09.480\nBut you don't like games famously.\n\n46:09.480 --> 46:10.480\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:10.480 --> 46:11.480\nThat's right.\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:13.480\nOh, you hate playing games.\n\n46:13.480 --> 46:16.480\nOh, shit.\n\n46:16.480 --> 46:18.960\nOh, wow.\n\n46:18.960 --> 46:19.960\nYeah.\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:25.960\nI hate seeing you eat crow by your own pitard.\n\n46:25.960 --> 46:30.840\nThat's a real saying.\n\n46:30.840 --> 46:34.360\nThat crow hoist captain pitard up high enough.\n\n46:34.360 --> 46:38.000\nYou fucking pitard.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:41.520\nNot a big laugh on that one.\n\n46:41.520 --> 46:42.520\nYou were almost there.\n\n46:42.520 --> 46:44.640\nI think you almost held that one.\n\n46:44.640 --> 46:45.640\nAnyways.\n\n46:45.640 --> 46:49.880\nYou kind of did that, though, on, there's two episodes of Rick and Morty that are kind\n\n46:49.880 --> 46:53.640\nof like that with improvised dialogue and then the animated stuff.\n\n46:53.640 --> 46:54.640\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:54.640 --> 46:55.640\nYeah.\n\n46:55.640 --> 46:59.360\nWell, Justin was doing that in House of Cosby's, like the whole internet dimensional cable\n\n46:59.360 --> 47:00.360\nthing.\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:01.360\nYeah.\n\n47:01.360 --> 47:05.280\nJustin goes in the booth and like makes crazy shit up and then the animators like draw it.\n\n47:05.280 --> 47:06.280\nYeah.\n\n47:06.280 --> 47:07.280\nIt's pretty great.\n\n47:07.280 --> 47:10.760\nYou know, I think it's a good time for House of Cosby's to just be put up on YouTube.\n\n47:10.760 --> 47:14.640\nIt's like, money-wise, I'm sure he's spread a bit thin.\n\n47:14.640 --> 47:15.640\nYeah.\n\n47:15.640 --> 47:17.920\nI have a feeling he's not going to come after us.\n\n47:17.920 --> 47:22.520\nHis legal department has a lot of thumbs and a lot of pies right now.\n\n47:22.520 --> 47:23.520\nYeah.\n\n47:23.520 --> 47:24.520\nPut in pies.\n\n47:24.520 --> 47:27.920\nGod, to go back, to go back in fucking time when we were getting those cease and desist\n\n47:27.920 --> 47:28.920\nletters for a fucking...\n\n47:28.920 --> 47:29.920\nSeesaw and desist letters.\n\n47:29.920 --> 47:30.920\nSeesaw and desist letters.\n\n47:30.920 --> 47:31.920\nWhy do they call it?\n\n47:31.920 --> 47:36.200\nLove to just write a letter back to the lawyer, sending the cease and desist and go, I think\n\n47:36.200 --> 47:42.680\nwe both know that you have bigger fish to fry.\n\n47:42.680 --> 47:46.040\nI think we both know you have 47 fish to fry.\n\n47:46.040 --> 47:48.120\nOh, my God.\n\n47:48.120 --> 47:49.880\nIf only God...\n\n47:49.880 --> 47:54.600\nI now think that is the way I would use time travel if I stumbled onto it.\n\n47:54.600 --> 48:00.080\nThere'd be like portals like open of like, I could push Hitler in the shower.\n\n48:00.080 --> 48:02.320\nI could like make him break his neck.\n\n48:02.320 --> 48:07.520\nI could like, I can't riff a bunch of examples of benevolent ways to use time travel.\n\n48:07.520 --> 48:10.000\nJust riff your own later with your own room.\n\n48:10.000 --> 48:18.320\nAnd then there's just, I'm going to shame Bill Cosby for his crime against me.\n\n48:18.320 --> 48:19.320\nHumanity.\n\n48:19.320 --> 48:28.000\nBecause that's the thing he did that really gets my fucking dander up.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.880\nI just went back and watched all the House of Cosby's.\n\n48:29.880 --> 48:30.880\nThey're pretty funny.\n\n48:30.880 --> 48:31.880\nThey're great.\n\n48:31.880 --> 48:32.880\nYeah.\n\n48:32.880 --> 48:37.440\nYeah, yeah, they were real good.\n\n48:37.440 --> 48:38.440\nYou were in those, Rob.\n\n48:38.440 --> 48:40.200\nI was in a, I was in a couple.\n\n48:40.200 --> 48:41.880\nRob, you were a big Bill Cosby fan.\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:42.880\nI was.\n\n48:42.880 --> 48:45.480\nWe haven't really talked about the impact that these allegations of...\n\n48:45.480 --> 48:46.480\nNow, you've had...\n\n48:46.480 --> 48:50.000\n...applications have had on you.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:55.760\nWhat, I'm bummed out about it, you know, as much as anybody that was inspired by him.\n\n48:55.760 --> 48:59.400\nYou think it will forever color, like if you go back and listen to his records, it'll\n\n48:59.400 --> 49:00.400\nalways like...\n\n49:00.400 --> 49:01.400\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n49:01.400 --> 49:02.400\nYeah.\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:03.400\nI mean, how couldn't it?\n\n49:03.400 --> 49:04.400\nExactly.\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:05.400\nYeah, because why is a trip to the dentist that funny now?\n\n49:05.400 --> 49:06.400\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:06.400 --> 49:08.960\nHe's, he's now more...\n\n49:08.960 --> 49:09.960\nSmobic.\n\n49:09.960 --> 49:10.960\nSmobic.\n\n49:10.960 --> 49:14.200\nHe's now more known for rape than being funny.\n\n49:14.200 --> 49:16.680\nSo yeah, try to get that out of your head.\n\n49:16.680 --> 49:18.360\nDoesn't, it's not easy.\n\n49:18.360 --> 49:21.360\nSo you, you, you won't, you can't separate the art from the artist.\n\n49:21.360 --> 49:24.920\nOh, I thought you were doing a bit.\n\n49:24.920 --> 49:30.360\nI was just trying to think of a real pretentious thing to say in the light of a...\n\n49:30.360 --> 49:31.360\nIn this case...\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:35.360\nYou can't separate the rape from the rapist.\n\n49:35.360 --> 49:39.200\nIt's interesting, if you listen to like, as I do, like I'll flip on channels on my car\n\n49:39.200 --> 49:41.720\non the satellite, like XM Sirius...\n\n49:41.720 --> 49:42.720\nOoh.\n\n49:42.720 --> 49:43.720\nOh yeah.\n\n49:43.720 --> 49:47.840\nI drive a car at your house.\n\n49:47.840 --> 49:49.160\nOh no.\n\n49:49.160 --> 49:50.680\nMy car only goes terrestrial.\n\n49:50.680 --> 49:51.680\nBut like...\n\n49:51.680 --> 49:55.160\nTell me about your space car, Jeff.\n\n49:55.160 --> 49:59.120\nWell, it goes like up to like, like a hundred miles an hour.\n\n49:59.120 --> 50:04.200\nThere's like four or five comedy channels and once in a while you...\n\n50:04.200 --> 50:05.200\nWhat do you...\n\n50:05.200 --> 50:06.200\nI'm just redecorating right now.\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:07.200\nNo, no.\n\n50:07.200 --> 50:08.200\nThis is what I do.\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:09.200\nAre you going to flash?\n\n50:09.200 --> 50:10.200\nAre you going to sit like Casey Slater?\n\n50:10.200 --> 50:11.200\nNo.\n\n50:11.200 --> 50:12.200\nOh.\n\n50:12.200 --> 50:14.200\nAre you about to break it down for real?\n\n50:14.200 --> 50:15.200\nNo, no.\n\n50:15.200 --> 50:17.840\nAre you about to give me counseling advice when I'm in eighth grade?\n\n50:17.840 --> 50:23.200\nYou guys did literally all of these bits the last time I turned my chair around.\n\n50:23.200 --> 50:25.200\nGuys, don't overreact.\n\n50:25.200 --> 50:32.000\nHe only stood up on a stage where there's only four things to look at and one of them\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.000\nis you.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:36.440\nYeah, yeah, everyone's overreacting.\n\n50:36.440 --> 50:40.040\nWe're all a bunch of mental fucking mittens.\n\n50:40.040 --> 50:44.880\nYou guys are all acting like you don't always see a guy in pajamas with plastic bags on\n\n50:44.880 --> 50:45.880\nhis feet.\n\n50:45.880 --> 50:49.000\nGet up and do arbitrary set design.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nLet's have some more of this.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:52.000\nLet's take it easy.\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nTeacher's trying to tell us something.\n\n50:54.000 --> 51:02.440\nLet's have Rob talk about the importance of veganism for three minutes while the three\n\n51:02.440 --> 51:08.440\nof us do normal things that you'd be an asshole for being distracted by.\n\n51:08.440 --> 51:11.440\nNobody's an asshole.\n\n51:11.440 --> 51:16.440\nI felt like I was slouching too much and I thought that was taking focus.\n\n51:16.440 --> 51:22.440\nSorry, I was dreaming of, I was on a bicycle.\n\n51:22.440 --> 51:23.440\nIt happens.\n\n51:23.440 --> 51:25.440\nWhat's the biggie do we?\n\n51:25.440 -->

doing too different.\n\n52:12.440 --> 52:17.440\nAlright, so CISO, Harmon Quest, Rob is...\n\n52:17.440 --> 52:22.440\nI was saying XM Radio, you were flipping through the channel and once in a while you will still hear them play a clip from Cosby\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:28.440\nand I don't know if that's them being provocative or maybe that's just old programming stuff.\n\n52:28.440 --> 52:30.440\nThey forgot to expand.\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:31.440\nThat's weird.\n\n52:31.440 --> 52:35.440\nIt's an interesting... I don't know.\n\n52:35.440 --> 52:43.440\nRight after the first allegations started coming out, after the Hannibal Burris stuff and all the first wave of the women coming out\n\n52:43.440 --> 52:49.440\nsaying that they had been assaulted by him, they would play and they would talk about it, the Spanish fly bit,\n\n52:49.440 --> 52:52.440\nwhich is like... that's the first thing I thought of.\n\n52:52.440 --> 52:55.440\nI just heard that a few weeks ago.\n\n52:55.440 --> 52:59.440\nBut this stuff has been around ten years prior to Hannibal.\n\n52:59.440 --> 53:01.440\nThey were doing bits about it on SNL.\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:05.440\nWell that was the big outrage was that there was a conspiracy of...\n\n53:05.440 --> 53:08.440\nI thought it was a very insightful observation.\n\n53:08.440 --> 53:10.440\nI heard about it, I was bummed out about it.\n\n53:10.440 --> 53:12.440\nBobcat joked around about it.\n\n53:12.440 --> 53:14.440\nPeople talked about it.\n\n53:14.440 --> 53:20.440\nYou would hear things about it and then that was... I thought that was an astute observation.\n\n53:20.440 --> 53:22.440\nWell the crowd laughs when Hannibal Burris says it.\n\n53:22.440 --> 53:24.440\nThe crowd laughs with recognition.\n\n53:24.440 --> 53:28.440\nThey laugh because it's something that people have already... it's already been in the ether a bit.\n\n53:28.440 --> 53:36.440\nAnd then for some weird fascinating reason about our national psyche because he is a young black man and a comic.\n\n53:36.440 --> 53:40.440\nRight? That has something to do with it, right? Am I crazy?\n\n53:40.440 --> 53:44.440\nThat was the think pieces that were written about it.\n\n53:44.440 --> 53:50.440\nHannibal Burris had to say something before people started dog piling.\n\n53:50.440 --> 53:54.440\nHe had even recorded that set long before it was ever released.\n\n53:54.440 --> 53:59.440\nIt was in Philly which is why he brought it up because that's where Cosby was from.\n\n53:59.440 --> 54:03.440\nI think it just happened to be maybe a slow news day that some guy was like,\n\n54:03.440 --> 54:07.440\nI'm gonna post this, make an article about it and then it blew up.\n\n54:07.440 --> 54:12.440\nFor rightfully so and it's great for what happened and people get in recognition from it.\n\n54:12.440 --> 54:18.440\nBut I think it was just a happenstance that some guy at HuffPo decided to write an article about it.\n\n54:18.440 --> 54:20.440\nHuffPo.\n\n54:20.440 --> 54:26.440\nI get all my hip news from the HuffPo.\n\n54:26.440 --> 54:28.440\nWhat's the dealio?\n\n54:28.440 --> 54:30.440\nI don't have time to say...\n\n54:30.440 --> 54:35.440\nLet me right click on that HuffPo.\n\n54:35.440 --> 54:38.440\nWhat's the weather today, HuffPo?\n\n54:38.440 --> 54:44.440\nOh, it's a Bombay 65 with a windshield.\n\n54:44.440 --> 54:47.440\nProfessor Schrab, can you please just teach us once?\n\n54:47.440 --> 54:54.440\nOh my gosh.

I believe the universe is 6 trillion years old.\n\n56:31.440 --> 56:36.440\nI don't cotton to all that bullshit with these fucking evangelical people,\n\n56:36.440 --> 56:40.440\nbut I believe that man and dinosaur lived at the same time.\n\n56:40.440 --> 56:45.440\nDoes that mean that women are a descendant of man fucking a dinosaur?\n\n56:45.440 --> 56:49.440\nNo, women so hot.\n\n56:49.440 --> 56:52.440\nYes, yes, yes.\n\n56:52.440 --> 56:56.440\nYou guys know that there's like dino porn.\n\n56:56.440 --> 56:59.440\nDon't say it so matter-of-factly.\n\n56:59.440 --> 57:02.440\nYeah, but did you hear that fucking, yeah.\n\n57:02.440 --> 57:05.440\nThat's my crowd.\n\n57:05.440 --> 57:09.440\nYeah, there's like a series of books.\n\n57:09.440 --> 57:14.440\nThey're sort of like self-starters turned like huge popular things.\n\n57:14.440 --> 57:17.440\nThey're fiction.\n\n57:17.440 --> 57:21.440\nIt's women being kind of ravished by dinosaurs.\n\n57:21.440 --> 57:23.440\nDo the dinosaurs have feathers?\n\n57:23.440 --> 57:26.440\nYou have every question that I have.\n\n57:26.440 --> 57:29.440\nAs far as we got was like pulling up some of the covers online,\n\n57:29.440 --> 57:31.440\nand then like, yeah, I guess it's like just sort of a,\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:34.440\nit's something that's like a generated out-of-fan fiction,\n\n57:34.440 --> 57:36.440\nand then became like the genre.\n\n57:36.440 --> 57:41.440\nIs it CG dinosaurs, like slash, like, these are dinosaurs fucking?\n\n57:41.440 --> 57:43.440\nWell, yeah, it's CG.\n\n57:43.440 --> 57:45.440\nOh, people, well, it's live action.

It's just literature.\n\n57:47.440 --> 57:48.440\nOh, literature.\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:51.440\nI'm saying it's like stories about, we skimmed through.\n\n57:51.440 --> 57:55.440\nThere'll be like stories about like a dinosaur,\n\n57:55.440 --> 57:59.440\nand then it's sexualizing dinosaurs.\n\n57:59.440 --> 58:02.440\nAre you looking at this? Are you looking it up right now?\n\n58:02.440 --> 58:03.440\nAre you looking it up?\n\n58:03.440 --> 58:07.440\nWait, so are dinosaurs like just forcing themselves?\n\n58:07.440 --> 58:08.440\nThat's what we don't know.\n\n58:08.440 --> 58:10.440\nJustin heard about it, and then he drew on the whiteboard\n\n58:10.440 --> 58:13.440\nthis amazing picture of like a T-rex with a big hard-on and,\n\n58:13.440 --> 58:15.440\nand then a woman kind of perched on it,\n\n58:15.440 --> 58:17.440\nlike sort of like rubbing his nipples.\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:19.440\nA rape tour?\n\n58:19.440 --> 58:22.440\nIt could have been consensual.\n\n58:22.440 --> 58:24.440\nBut I think it's sort of like-\n\n58:24.440 --> 58:26.440\nbecause that was my first question is,\n\n58:26.440 --> 58:29.440\nare they raptor size? Because that's- who cares?\n\n58:29.440 --> 58:33.440\nLike, well, raptors are like, you know,\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:35.440\nthey're regular size, so that's like-\n\n58:35.440 --> 58:38.440\nWhere's the

Aaron.\n\n58:53.440 --> 58:56.440\nBecause there is such a thing as bestiality,\n\n58:56.440 --> 59:00.440\nand we have beasts on this earth that raptors are the same size as.\n\n59:00.440 --> 59:02.440\nI think it's very interesting because I've never heard of that,\n\n59:02.440 --> 59:06.440\nlike the idea that you could sexualize such a giant prehistoric lizard.\n\n59:06.440 --> 59:09.440\nI wanted to be very clear on that.\n\n59:09.440 --> 59:12.440\nI was like, are we talking about Godzilla-sized like fucking things?\n\n59:12.440 --> 59:13.440\nAnd then how do they

in\n\n01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.240\nsituations with regular-sized women, right?\n\n01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.640\nI really, I just need to remember the name of this guy and then we'll have like a million\n\n01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.440\nexcellent titles to draw from.\n\n01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440\nChuck Tingle.\n\n01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.440\nChuck Tingle.\n\n01:02:51.440 -->

01:03:32.440\nHe's been a national treasure.\n\n01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.440\nIf butts start learning how to fuck themselves, we're all out of a fucking job.\n\n01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440\nYeah.\n\n01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440\nLife finds a way.\n\n01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440\nI know.\n\n01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440\nYou and me and every dinosaur we

01:04:44.440\nWell, I just don't, I just don't want to fall into like a thing.\n\n01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.440\nLike if this is like a Piranha movie thing where it's like, I don't want this guy to\n\n01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440\nbe in on the joke.\n\n01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.440\nI want him to be.\n\n01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440\nThat's what it looks like though.\n\n01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.440\nBut we don't know that he makes his own artwork.\n\n01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.440\nA lot of the story is about him being so surprised that it's actually his own butt.\n\n01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.440\nHow do you know?\n\n01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440\nI've read it.\n\n01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.440\nIs this Chuck Tingle though?\n\n01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440\nIs this the guy?\n\n01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.440\nIs this the model?\n\n01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.440\nIs this guy too ripped and handsome to be Chuck Tingle?\n\n01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440\nNo, that's not Chuck.\n\n01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440\nI think we're finding out Spencer is Chuck Tingle.\n\n01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.440\nDon't roll your eyes.\n\n01:05:13.440 -->

that might have been him.\n\n01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.440\nAll right.\n\n01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.440\nWell, I, yeah, I wanted to, but here's the thing.\n\n01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.440\nI only

among\n\n01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.440\nwomen who were like, I want to do it with a dinosaur.\n\n01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440\nAnd they were like expressing themselves.\n\n01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.440\nI didn't know it was like some anonymous guy who's like, and then the dinosaur fucks\n\n01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440\nthe lady.\n\n01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440\nAnd everyone's like,

like new blossoming\n\n01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.440\nlike, like, like things that couldn't have been possible if the internet hadn't like,\n\n01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.440\nlike, like, you know, existed that, that people can find each other and then find their audience\n\n01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.440\nso that, that you can, if, you know, rule 34 meets the human psyche and like, like

thought it was like, there was this thing that was like this biosphere\n\n01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.440\nwhere it was like, did you know that there, that, that women like, like certain small subset\n\n01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.440\nof a subset of a subset of women, like, like they, when they look at a t-rex, they like,\n\n01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440\nthey get a little bit tingly.\n\n01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440\nThey get a little tingly.\n\n01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.440\nAnd that some of them are like really good writers and that, and that, and that

person.\n\n01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:29.440\nI'm not saying, I just saying like the mythology I created in my head is a disappointment.\n\n01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440\nIt's like, I had a

say, this is the citizen cane of movies about a guy with\n\n01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:39.440\na burn, burgy, like burn scars on his back doing a sex scene with a woman and a fucking\n\n01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.440\ncrazy ass, like psychological experiment that involves taking two cameras together.\n\n01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440\nThat is weird though.\n\n01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.440\nWhen you see the movie, it's a, everyone saw the room and Tommy Wiseau shows up and he's\n\n01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440\nvery, he's very playing about how much he loves it.\n\n01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440\nBut it has anyone ever seen it?\n\n01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440\nI know, Schrab, you've seen it.\n\n01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.440\nI think you say, get, get, get, get, get it in.\n\n01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440\nHave you guys seen Gettaven?\n\n01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440\nOh yeah.\n\n01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.440\nI've seen Gettaven.\n\n01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.440\nGettaven is a movie called Get Even.\n\n01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:04.440\nBut in the title shot, the words are too close together, so everyone just calls the movie\n\n01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.440\nGettaven.\n\n01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.440\nIt's a guy, it's a, it's a, it's a, he's a Tommy Wiseau type.\n\n01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440\nHe's a self-made, like he, movie star, he made his own.\n\n01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440\nHe looked like Dr. Phil kind of.\n\n01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440\nYes.\n\n01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.440\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440\nAnd he made, he made a movie about him.\n\n01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.440\nHe's a lawyer.\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.440\nHe's a lawyer in Los Angeles.\n\n01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.440\nAnd so he funded and wrote and directed and starred.\n\n01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440\nAnd sang in.\n\n01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440\nAnd sang in his own movie.\n\n01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440\nOh yeah.\n\n01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.440\nBut like we, we, me and Deanna saw it at Cine Family and he showed up.\n\n01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440\nEveryone's like, it's like, what do you think he's going to be like now?\n\n01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.440\nWhen did you see that?\n\n01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.440\nUm, you made it two years ago?\n\n01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440\nYou were there, right?\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440\nOh yeah.\n\n01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.440\nThat was after, um, wasn't that after my birthday?\n\n01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440\nYour birthday was right before it?\n\n01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440\nOh yeah.\n\n01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.440\nAnd do you remember he showed up and he was wearing a windbreaker suit, a two piece windbreaker suit\n\n01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.440\nand brought in his own igloo cooler full of, uh, natural light.\n\n01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.440\nAnd then when everyone asked about the movie, they're like, it's like, so tell us about,\n\n01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440\nuh, how you made the movies.\n\n01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.440\nLike, well, you know, I want, I set out to make, uh, the best action movie ever.\n\n01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.440\nAnd I, I think we got pretty close.\n\n01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440\nYep.\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.440\nAnd then everyone, it's like, you've, you've heard a room full of people laughing, but\n\n01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.440\nyou've never heard of a room of people trying not to laugh.\n\n01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440\nSo really, I mean, that's, that's an interesting new phenomenon too.\n\n01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.440\nLike, uh, like everybody go see, uh, what was it, worst, worst, what's it called?\n\n01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440\nWorst, best movie.\n\n01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440\nWorst, best movie.\n\n01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.440\nBecause it examines that, that, that phenomenon really closely.\n\n01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.940\nCause the movie troll too is like this, like insanely horrible movie and there's like these\n\n01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.940\nactors in it.\n\n01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.440\nAnd like, it's, it is interesting this thing that we do where, uh, like, like we celebrate.\n\n01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440\nWe go like, that's the fucking movie's the best.\n\n01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440\nI'm so into this movie because it's so horrible.\n\n01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.440\nAnd then like where, like, like what we, our definitions of like, uh, when you're being\n\n01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.440\nmean by doing that and are you supposed to, anyways, Molly, what's your, um, uh, what's,\n\n01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.440\nwhat's like a issue or anything that I can solve for you with a rap?\n\n01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.440\nLike a, like a, like a social issue or a topic in the news right now or a personal thing\n\n01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440\nfor you.\n\n01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.440\nI'm, I'll make it all better with a rap or I'll dress it at least.\n\n01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.440\nI'll get to the bottom of it.\n\n01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.440\nOkay.\n\n01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440\nI have an answer for you.\n\n01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.440\nUh, I work with dogs in a city.\n\n01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:26.440\nI work in a dog with dogs in a city and you people who live in cities, stop getting dogs\n\n01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440\nplease.\n\n01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440\nAll right.\n\n01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.440\nBecause those poor dogs just live inside all day and you go to work and you leave them\n\n01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440\nalone and they're bored.\n\n01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440\nYou're mean.\n\n01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440\nYeah.\n\n01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440\nStop doing that.\n\n01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440\nI take my dog to work.\n\n01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440\nWell, that's nice.\n\n01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440\nThank you.\n\n01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440\nNo.\n\n01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.440\nIs it also inside when

We care about\n\n01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:14.200\nYou guys a caucus has a faction within a within a legislative body that pursues its interest through the legislative process\n\n01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.880\nUm, that means nothing. That meant nothing smarty pants\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.480\nOr a meeting of party leaders just elect candidates elect\n\n01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440\nTrump pale in 2016\n\n01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.280\nIt really makes no difference\n\n01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080\nHoly shit\n\n01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080\nI'm\n\n01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.960\nRob, who do you who do you like in the uh for the uh for the g.o.p. nomination?

Yes\n\n01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.800\nIt's a multi-day situation a week a week\n\n01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:26.760\nHey, could somebody hand me that bag of multiple potato chips\n\n01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.040\nYeah, it's like a it's like a it's like a it's like a quorum\n\n01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.120\nIt's like a it's like a meeting about to make a decision that ultimately is done\n\n01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.200\nBy a show of hands or accounting votes, but also there's a bunch of conversation. It's not like a like a popular\n\n01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.800\nIt's like a caucus. It's like a clusterfuck.

Why does Iowa?\n\n01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.520\nThey decided to go first you could just decide to go first really yeah\n\n01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:08.680\nExcept and that's like I think nevato is like we want to go first and then they like now they're third or some shit\n\n01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.840\nI don't know but like yes states are just they did a really bad job of deciding to go first\n\n01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.840\nIf they're well, it's not bad at first. So who said we'll go third. Did they go first who?\n\n01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:29.400\nI mean if they why don't they take a rocket down. Yeah senator pajamas.

Can I ask you a question?\n\n01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.800\nThat reminds me this has been something I've ever said came on stage Rob Rob\n\n01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.880\nI got one thing in my mind\n\n01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.160\nI'm glad that you're thinking about that. Yes\n\n01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200\nso\n\n01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.200\nI\n\n01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.280\nThat was not intentional\n\n01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.840\nJust I just I just did dim conway right there\n\n01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.800\nUh\n\n01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:08.120\nRob are you finding it harder to uh be creative as you get older? Uh, I think we've proven just now\n\n01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:14.440\nYeah, yeah, definitely. It's harder to definitely be I I don't know if it's just because it's a depleting thing\n\n01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:20.040\nOr maybe because you've already done stuff. So then you're like, you know, this should like shouldn't be that easy\n\n01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.240\nI don't know\n\n01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.280\nWell, it's like I think you you you're you're not only competing with everybody else around you\n\n01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.800\nBut you're competing with the last thing you did. So, you know, if if you know, you did something that was like\n\n01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960\nWell, that's the best thing I've ever did\n\n01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.400\nYeah, you know, you're gonna have to outdo the best thing you ever did in order to feel that same feeling\n\n01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.440\nI feel like I feel I feel like it's always just like like I just want the shit to make sense\n\n01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.160\nAnd it's just like so hard. It never makes sense. Like isn't that why uh, Schrabbing works\n\n01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.480\nIt is like\n\n01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.520\nMeaning what wait, wait, I didn't like it doesn't make any sense\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.400\nOh, yeah, because well, yeah, it's a release from yeah\n\n01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:03.720\nSchrab definitely represents for a lot of us the the liberation from making fucking sense. Yes\n\n01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.240\nFor sure. Yes, it you can't\n\n01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.440\nLou I can't the new kind of comedy. Yes\n\n01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.240\nThe new kind of comedy\n\n01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:20.040\nI'm the face of the new kind of comedy. What's the new kind of comedy the new kind of comedy\n\n01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.280\nWhat comedy where where you're where I just say things\n\n01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.000\nThat's my bit. I should I should have I should have been a who's bid is that I should have I should have\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.080\nI should have said like I'm a director and so I said I'm a writer. It's fucking hard\n\n01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.000\nIt's hard being a director. Yeah, come on. If you're a director\n\n01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.240\nWhy don't you you could do that put the camera in there and then put it there\n\n01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:48.040\nAnd you don't even have to use if that's wrong. You put it put it everywhere. Dan put the camera everywhere. You just directed. Yeah\n\n01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.560\nPut it everywhere\n\n01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.800\nAnd then say do this I've been saying that I've been saying that for years. Dan you should be directing\n\n01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.160\nDirectors get to like rewrite scripts too. So it's like the easiest part of writing, right? Yeah\n\n01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.800\nAnd everybody thinks that they make the movie. Yeah\n\n01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.960\nIt's so insane and I just like they couldn't be a dumber species\n\n01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.680\nThe directors. Yeah, they're just like yep. Yep. That's definitely true\n\n01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.960\nEven dumber than actors get me out of here uber\n\n01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.200\nYes, you know what yes, yes\n\n01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.960\nBecause actors are smart enough no matter how dumb they are that they're like\n\n01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:33.960\nI you know what I should stay under these lights and like like like like work hard to like pretend to be someone else\n\n01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.120\nAnd a director could just be like\n\n01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120\naction\n\n01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.280\nDo it different\n\n01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.240\nCan we get it did I forget to say cut that's what the second 80s for\n\n01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360\nAction again do it different\n\n01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:59.720\nLet's do a series do a different five times action action action action action action action action action action I'm going home\n\n01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.000\nHoly shit. Can you please direct something soon?\n\n01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.120\nI want to see if you actually did that if you actually\n\n01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:14.920\nIt's a Dan Harmon's first feature film and then you get there and you literally just go action. No, no, no, no\n\n01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:23.640\nAnd then all of it all it is is just like an experiment to see what the actors do when you just make fart noises at them\n\n01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.880\nit's gonna\n\n01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.880\nTo be like a crisp and Glover movie\n\n01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.440\nNo, it'd be really good. You should be directing you you should have been directing a long time ago\n\n01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:41.400\nBut you you don't want to I've got a perfect writing first like why would you direct until you knew how to write?\n\n01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.680\nLike it doesn't make any sense like I was like it's a fucking it's hard to write already and then either was like\n\n01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:51.000\nOh, I should I should add directing to this. So we'll finish writing this and then I'll fucking blow\n\n01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.720\nSorry, uh, keep you guys keep writing it. I'm gonna go shoot what we do\n\n01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:01.080\nIt's already bad because I can't finish making it good. So are there no are there no directors that you like?\n\n01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.160\nYou know, I really like Justin Lin\n\n01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.800\nHe's he's he's he's pretty good\n\n01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.240\nHe's good.

the singularity.\n\n01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960\nIt wasn't about intelligence.\n\n01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960\nIt was about economy.\n\n01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.960\nIt was like the singularity

slash Rick and Morty.\n\n01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.960\nJust type in Dan Harmon and AIDS.\n\n01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.960\nTo scroll down past all the Chevy Chase voicemails.\n\n01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.960\nAnd you'll come to a thing.\n\n01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.960\n$10 every time you $10 gets you a chance at fucking, there's a thing.\n\n01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.960\nAnd you could be a voice on Rick and Morty.\n\n01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:53.960\nAnd you'll cure AIDS.\n\n01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:54.960\nThat should be enough.\n\n01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.960\nThat should be enough.\n\n01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.960\nYou selfish fucking AIDS lovers.\n\n01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.960\nWhat's in it for me?\n\n01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.960\nYou can be in a cartoon.\n\n01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.960\nIt's like fucking AIDS will be running down the street.\n\n01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.960\nUnfettered.\n\n01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.960\nAre you going to make the winner appear as an anthropomorphic AIDS virus?\n\n01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.960\nThey were AIDS.\n\n01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.960\nThe bitter irony.\n\n01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.960\nThat would be a great bad guy, right?\n\n01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.960\nIt's supposed to be a villain, right?\n\n01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.960\nI'm AIDS.\n\n01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:24.960\nCan I get you?\n\n01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.960\nSo we're probably not going to role play.\n\n01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.960\nYou know, we do what we want here at Harmontown.\n\n01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.960\nYou do you.\n\n01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.960\nOh, that's what we always say is you do you at Harmontown.\n\n01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.960\nI'm so glad that we're not in Florida anymore.\n\n01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.960\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960\nWait, I missed that.\n\n01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.960\nI was doing another thing.\n\n01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.960\nThere was a guy that came up.\n\n01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960\nI was here.\n\n01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.960\nA guy punched a guy on stage.\n\n01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.960\nAnd that was probably the best thing that happened.\n\n01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960\nI beg your pardon.\n\n01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.960\nYeah, it was it was Florida, man.\n\n01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.960\nDon't go there.\n\n01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.960\nDid we find out that was a stunt or an actual thing?\n\n01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960\nOh, it was a stunt.\n\n01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.960\nYeah.\n\n01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.960\nI mean, some people's friendships are stunts.\n\n01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.960\nYep.\n\n01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.960\nI say to the millions of people.\n\n01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.960\nWell, there weren't millions of people at that convention,\n\n01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.960\nbut these are the sweetest.\n\n01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:16.960\nMillions.\n\n01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.960\nMost wonderful people in the world and all of them were really nice\n\n01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.960\nand all of them are constantly apologizing for being from Florida,\n\n01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:23.960\nwhich is not.\n\n01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:24.960\nThat's insane.\n\n01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.960\nThey're from Wisconsin.\n\n01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.960\nI was like, like, like, like that's not, it doesn't define you.\n\n01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.960\nLike, like, like the Armenians in Miami are identical to the,\n\n01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.960\nto the Angelino ones except for the two guys.\n\n01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.960\nAre you pretty proud of your home?\n\n01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.960\nAre you pretty proud of your home state after making a murder?\n\n01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960\nYes.\n\n01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960\nYes.\n\n01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.960\nYeah.\n\n01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:42.960\nAn hour's drive from my house.\n\n01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.960\nIt's crazy that there's a whole documentary and then you find out\n\n01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:51.960\nlike he really did it.\n\n01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.960\nIt's like death of a salesman,\n\n01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.960\nbut it wasn't in the title.\n\n01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.960\nI was like, but it was because it's making a murderer.\n\n01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.960\nYeah.\n\n01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.960\nAnd you're like, oh, he's a murderer.\n\n01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.960\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.960\nThe guy murdered that girl.\n\n01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960\nCrazy.\n\n01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.960\nIt's so nuts.\n\n01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.960\nAnd then it was like, he didn't do it.\n\n01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.960\nAnd then you watched the whole thing.\n\n01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.960\nYou're like, he fucking did it.\n\n01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.960\nSee, I thought so too, but Rob disagrees.\n\n01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:16.960\nRob thinks he didn't do it.\n\n01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.960\nHe thinks a brother did it.\n\n01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.960\nI think one of his brothers.\n\n01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.960\nBut why isn't that in the documentary?\n\n01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.960\nThat's racist.\n\n01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960\nIt wasn't about that.\n\n01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.960\nWell, first of all, well, there's a part of it.\n\n01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.960\nI didn't make the documentary as the documentarians,\n\n01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.960\nbut I think one of his brothers.\n\n01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.960\nDocumentarians?\n\n01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.960\nSo you're defending a guy who burnt a cat to death?\n\n01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.960\nNo, I'm not defending him.\n\n01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.960\nBecause if anyone burns a cat to death,\n\n01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:38.960\nput him in jail for murder.\n\n01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.960\nI don't care.\n\n01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.960\nBut a guy who wears Ugg boots wouldn't understand that.\n\n01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.960\nSit down, Jonah.\n\n01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.960\nSit down.\n\n01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.960\nSorry.\n\n01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.960\nUgg boots make me so angry on lots of levels.\n\n01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.960\nPeople aren't ready for your content right now.\n\n01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:54.960\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.960\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.960\nYour content is too real.\n\n01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.960\nI just can't.\n\n01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.960\nI'm glad that I feel like they front loaded that cat burning thing.\n\n01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.960\nSo because I was watching the whole thing with my girlfriend\n\n01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.960\nand like I kept like, like every roller coaster dip\n\n01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.960\nwhere you were like, your heart would sink.\n\n01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.960\nAnd I would just grab each other's hands and go,\n\n01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.960\nhe burnt a cat.\n\n01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.960\nHe burnt a cat.\n\n01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.960\nDoesn't matter.\n\n01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:16.960\nNow they downplay it.\n\n01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.960\nHe did like, he doused it with like, I don't know, gas.\n\n01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.960\nI just threw it on the fire.\n\n01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.960\nHe did more than that.\n\n01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.960\nHe poured kerosene on top of the cat.\n\n01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:27.960\nHe threw it in the fire.\n\n01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.960\nHe did say that in the documentary.\n\n01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:30.960\nThey sure the fuck did it.\n\n01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.960\nIt's a trick.\n\n01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:32.960\nYeah.\n\n01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.960\nIf you research it, you find out he did much more of that.\n\n01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:36.960\nAnd I mean, it sucks.\n\n01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.960\nHe should have definitely, he definitely needed to go to jail for that.\n\n01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.960\nYeah.\n\n01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.960\nI mean, people that kill things should be in jail.\n\n01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960\nProbably cause they'll kill things.\n\n01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.960\nBut especially cats though, because cats mind their own fucking business.\n\n01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.960\nEven, even the shittiest cats in the world mind their own business.\n\n01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.960\nYeah.\n\n01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.960\nLike there's no such thing as a cat that like comes in your window and it's like, hey,\n\n01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:58.960\nI'm a cat.\n\n01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960\nI'm going to fuck with you.\n\n01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.960\nLike they, they might meow and say, feed me or pay attention to me, but no cat has ever\n\n01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.960\nlike made you, made their problem.\n\n01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.960\nThe only reason cats ever whine or meow or paw at you is because you have them trapped\n\n01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960\ninside your house.\n\n01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:17.960\nLike everyone that's irritated by a cat is only because they're inside and you won't\n\n01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.960\nlet them out.\n\n01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.960\nI don't think that's true.\n\n01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.960\nI have a story about a cat.\n\n01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.960\nOh shit.\n\n01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.960\nThat's fine.\n\n01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:26.960\nCause Molly brought the dog things.\n\n01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.960\nAre you an indoor cat person?\n\n01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.960\nCause cats shouldn't be let out because then they spread FIV and they get all fucked up\n\n01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.960\nand eaten by coyotes.\n\n01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.960\nI know your cat has that, but doesn't she?\n\n01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960\nYeah.\n\n01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960\nWell, that's gross.\n\n01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:40.960\nGo to omaze.com.\n\n01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.960\nGo to omaze.com to have a voice.\n\n01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:44.960\nGo to omaze.com.\n\n01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:45.960\nThat's right.\n\n01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.960\nOh, that's all right.\n\n01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.960\nWell, I mean,\n\n01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.960\nHe's shamed my cat.\n\n01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.960\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.960\nEpisode title.\n\n01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:02.960\nWhat do you expect from a manic panic pixie dream girl?\n\n01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.960\nBut, but, but what's your position on cats?\n\n01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.960\nWell, one time, well, I just have a story about a cat one time where I was sleeping in\n\n01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.960\na basement in the house that I was renting and the door, the window was open.\n\n01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.960\nBut it opened up into the ground floor and so I was sleeping and I heard this noise in\n\n01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:25.960\nmy room and I thought it was a robber or a raccoon, which are both equally awful to\n\n01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.960\nend up in your room in the dark.\n\n01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.960\nLike it's really scary.\n\n01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960\nYou don't have to mime.\n\n01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.960\nAll she knows is that it had a black mask over its eyes.\n\n01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.960\nYeah, but it was a black cat.\n\n01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.960\nSo I was pretty pissed.\n\n01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:48.960\nSo what's the crux of that story is that cats are bad?\n\n01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.960\nNo, I'm just saying that it doesn't always mean that cats do one thing.\n\n01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.960\nThey're not always indoor versus outdoor cats.\n\n01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:56.960\nSometimes they're indoor.\n\n01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.960\nSometimes they're outdoor and they come indoor unexpectedly and they scare the shit out of you.\n\n01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.960\nTrue.\n\n01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.960\nThat's very true.\n\n01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960\nWe should keep that in mind.\n\n01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960\nNewsflash.\n\n01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.960\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960\nPlease be open-minded about it.\n\n01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.960\nNewsflash.\n\n01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.960\nLadies and gentlemen, newsflash.\n\n01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.960\nSometimes.\n\n01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.960\nIt's the same with the fervor of the transgender movement.\n\n01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.960\nWe need to fucking stop.\n\n01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.960\nWhy are you putting fucking indoor and outdoor on me?\n\n01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.960\nI'm a fucking door cat.\n\n01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.960\nIf there's a door, I go in and I go out and I'm fucking sick of this shit.\n\n01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.960\nCenter pajamas has the floor.\n\n01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.960\nGavel, gavel, gavel, gavel.\n\n01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.960\nAre you an indoor cat?\n\n01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:41.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.960\nI'm fucking, how about an Instagram of me crying because you asked.\n\n01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.960\nHow about you fucking hurt me by asking and meow the fucker.\n\n01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960\nMeow the fucker.\n\n01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960\nThat tried too hard.\n\n01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.960\nMeow the fucker.\n\n01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.960\nI feel bad for dogs that are pent up, but then the opposite applies.\n\n01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.960\nPeople tend to, culturally, we consider cats these things that you open the door and let\n\n01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.960\nthem out into the world.\n\n01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.960\nBut then we also talk about how that's inhumane because the cats go out and they shouldn't\n\n01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.960\nthat the cats should be indoors.\n\n01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.960\nSomething to think about.\n\n01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.960\nHere's the thing.\n\n01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:25.960\nPeople get their faces scratched by cats.\n\n01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.960\nKids are bitten by cats.\n\n01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.960\nAnd then everyone's like, that's just a cat.\n\n01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.960\nWhen a dog barks at a kid from across the street, everyone's like, put it down.\n\n01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:34.960\nYeah, they kill it.\n\n01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:35.960\nKill the dog.\n\n01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960\nIt's ridiculous.\n\n01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960\nPeople are too nice to cats.\n\n01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.960\nOh, come on.\n\n01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960\nI agree.\n\n01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:40.960\nI agree.\n\n01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:41.960\nWait a minute.\n\n01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.960\nThat's why the guy felt comfortable burning the cat alive, this anti-cat stigma.\n\n01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.960\nThat's why I think he didn't kill the girl.\n\n01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.960\nIf a cat scratches somebody, it's because if somebody got in a cat's face, if a dog bites\n\n01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:57.960\nsomebody, well, first of all, a dog can snap a two by four in half with its jaws descended\n\n01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:58.960\nfrom wolves.\n\n01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.960\nCats are fucking descended from Egyptian cats.\n\n01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:01.960\nNo.\n\n01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.960\nThey can't do shit but sit in your lap.\n\n01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.960\nEgyptian cats, Egyptians put a lot of people into slavery.\n\n01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:10.960\nThat's way worse than biting a two by four.\n\n01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:15.960\nThe cat, the cat's not, doesn't own the Egyptian sin.\n\n01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960\nThey fucking made statues of them.\n\n01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:18.960\nThey praised them.\n\n01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.960\nThe cats didn't make the statues.\n\n01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.960\nHow do you know we weren't around?\n\n01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960\nInteresting.\n\n01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.960\nTune in to Jonah Ray's...\n\n01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.960\nThese questions answered in more on Hidden America.\n\n01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.960\nJonah Ray's running for Ben Carson's vice president.\n\n01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:36.960\nAll right.\n\n01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.960\nHow do we close the show?\n\n01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.960\nIn song, fucker.\n\n01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:40.960\nNo.\n\n01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.960\nWe've tried that.\n\n01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.960\nYeah, the last one did real good.\n\n01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.960\nThat was great.\n\n01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.960\nIt was a real good one.\n\n01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960\nThanks, guys.\n\n01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:52.960\nI mean like a song, we are the world kind of celebrity kind of thing.\n\n01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.960\nYou all pick a celebrity character that you want to be in.\n\n01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:03.960\nWe do like an awareness raising, fundraising kind of thing.\n\n01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:04.960\nHands across America.\n\n01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:05.960\nThat's fun.\n\n01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:06.960\nFarm-aid kind of shit.\n\n01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.960\nAre you literally lifting something from whose line?\n\n01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960\nIs it anyway?\n\n01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:12.960\nYes.\n\n01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.960\nOkay.\n\n01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:14.960\nOh.\n\n01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:15.960\nOh.\n\n01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960\nNo.\n\n01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:22.960\nI've been moved by the spirit right now of what's going on.\n\n01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.960\nBut that does sound like a whose line game.\n\n01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.960\nIs that a whose line game?\n\n01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:26.960\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.960\nYour voice is real high.\n\n01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:32.960\nLast night, on taping a whose line, me and Wayne Brady and Joey Fatone from NSYNC\n\n01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.960\nsing a boy band song to a dude.\n\n01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.960\nIt was pretty good.\n\n01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:38.960\nBut is there a whose...\n\n01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.960\nThere's not a whose line game where it's like USA for Africa.\n\n01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.960\nNo, there's not.\n\n01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.960\nAnd there's different celebrities and then Wayne Brady does the clumps.\n\n01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.960\nNo.\n\n01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.960\nOkay.\n\n01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:49.960\nNow that's funny.\n\n01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.960\nThat's some content I want to see.\n\n01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.960\nYou know, you'd be pleased to know I just signed him for eight mobasodes.\n\n01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.960\nCan I get it on my razor phone?\n\n01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:04.960\nWait for that.\n\n01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:05.960\nNo, okay.\n\n01:50:05.960 -->

geofence.\n\n01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.960\nYeah.\n\n01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960\nIt's shaped like a fucking dragon's tail.\n\n01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.960\nIs there a part of the Pacific Ocean that I can get to that maybe I can catch it?\n\n01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:27.960\nEveryone, if you're in Canada and you exist in a swath of land that AT&T is about to invade,\n\n01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.960\nyou can watch three episodes of Money Python.\n\n01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:32.960\nYeah.\n\n01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.960\nIt's the biggest hit in midway.\n\n01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.960\nBoy, that geofencing.\n\n01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.960\nThat's good.\n\n01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.960\nBoy.\n\n01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960\nYeah, geofencing, man.\n\n01:50:41.960 -->

bags.\n\n01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.960\nWhat did you do to your bag?\n\n01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:54.960\nWe're ending the show.\n\n01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:55.960\nWe're trying to end the show.\n\n01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960\nYou can go ahead and end the show.\n\n01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:58.960\nI'm going to go change it.\n\n01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.960\nYou're part of the ending, you

them?\n\n01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:21.960\nI don't know.\n\n01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:22.960\nLet's just pick something we're benefiting.\n\n01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.960\nAll right.\n\n01:51:23.960 -->

feet.\n\n01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:38.960\nYeah.\n\n01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:39.960\nLet's benefit them.\n\n01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:40.960\nYeah.\n\n01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.960\nBecause they complain and we feel terrible for them.\n\n01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.960\nYeah.\n\n01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.960\nRight.\n\n01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.960\nYeah.\n\n01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.960\nOh,

Lexus.\n\n01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:59.960\nYeah.\n\n01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.960\nYo.\n\n01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.960\nYeah.\n\n01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:02.960\nPeep this.\n\n01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:05.960\nPut that in your eucalyptus soup for one minute while Dan breaks it down.\n\n01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.960\nRight now, there's people out there.\n\n01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.960\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\n01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.960\nThey don't have eucalyptus soup.\n\n01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960\nYeah.\n\n01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.960\nThey're too busy focusing on what's on their feet to the street.\n\n01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.960\nYeah.\n\n01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.960\nYo.\n\n01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.960\nOh, wait, but it's not a rap, though.\n\n01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.960\nIt's a song, isn't it?\n\n01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.960\nThere's a time for everyone to get together.\n\n01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:30.960\nEvery bird has some fun, but also has another bird with a feather.\n\n01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:34.960\nAnd when you look down at the thing that should cover your feet,\n\n01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.960\nyou don't want to see bags.\n\n01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.960\nBut some people see bags.\n\n01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:42.960\nBags on the feet, because we are the people.\n\n01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.960\nHello, I'm Mr. Jones.\n\n01:52:44.960 -->

01:53:00.960\nBrother.\n\n01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.960\nThat rhyme was predictable.\n\n01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.960\nBut this next one is delectable.\n\n01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.960\nYeah, that's

--> 01:53:54.960\nYou don't control Mr. Jones.\n\n01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:57.960\nMr. Jones makes his own tones.\n\n01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:00.960\nI also invented cell phones.\n\n01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.960\nAnd ring tones.\n\n01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.960\nDrive fast, take chances.\n\n01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.960\nThank you so much.\n\n01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.960\nDid you get any of
