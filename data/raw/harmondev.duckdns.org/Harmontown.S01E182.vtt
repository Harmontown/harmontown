00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
From Hollywood, California, Veldown Comics, Harmontown, now in session!

00:12.000 --> 00:31.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden in, everybody!

00:31.000 --> 00:41.000
And special kicking a giant shit backstage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon!

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello, Los Angeles! It's gonna be back!

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Thank you.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm in a very bad mood, it's gonna be a terrible show.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
I just feel like a bad person. I've been doing a lot of stress eating, and it's because,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
but also, what's making it even worse is that I went, I gave my doctor blood and said,

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
check my cholesterol, and then as soon as I gave the blood, I ran back to the office

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
and I was eating Doritos and Twinkies and stuff, because they had the blood already.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
Right. I know it's how insane that is, but I'm just like, okay, those numbers are safe.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
And then I'm just eating pizzas and rubbing Philly cheese takes on my face.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
And it's also because we're writing Rick and Morty again, and I'm not doing a good job,

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm not able to write, and I can't break the stories, they're very difficult,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
and I know that Justin's gotta be upset with me at this point,

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
but it's so fucking hard, I don't get it, I don't know what you're doing,

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
you break the stories and it seems like they make sense, and then you have to re-break them 50 times.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Is it different this season than in previous seasons?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
No, it's never different. It's never, ever, ever, ever been different.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
I spent 20 years trying to codify, that's all me going, that circle thing,

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
it's me trying as hard as I can to please for the love of Christ,

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
to make this easier, make this by the numbers, let me phone something in,

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I can't fucking do it, nothing ever makes sense, and I'm very upset.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Obviously you'd be happier if it were easier, but isn't that part of the mythology of the joy

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
of what you do, is kind of the torture of it all?

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
Well, I hope to God that, I used to think it was possible that I was making it difficult on purpose,

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
so I could justify a lot of narcissism, but I've crossed into a world,

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
I've been to therapy, and I'm perfect now, and I want quality of life,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
and I just want to be happy, and I know I'm old and racist and sexist,

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
and I just want to die, that's how a healthy person feels at my age,

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
an unhealthy person would be like, I'm 25 and I'm not racist,

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
no, I'm old and racist and I want to die, I'm not really racist,

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
it's just better to just say that, it's healthier, you know who says they're not racist?

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Donald Trump, he says that, you know who said he was? Jesus Christ.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
And he wasn't, he was like, it's a nice thing to say, it's the polite thing to say,

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm racist, just in case you are, it's nice, it's called tact,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
it's like a nice thing to say, you walk into a party and say, I'm racist,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
where do I hang my coat? But don't connect those dots,

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
just don't look at a person of color and say, where do I hang my coat?

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
Don't connect dots, just say you're racist and get through your fucking day,

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
and don't be racist, thank you, I'm sexist too, so shut up.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Do you think you're more racist than sexist, or is it even Steven?

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, I mean, God knows I hate black women, most of all.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So it's kind of a Venn diagram?

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, we can draw different conclusions from that, you know, I don't know, I don't know.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
What do you think black women have been getting away with?

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Let's do a special axe grinding edition of Harmontown.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Can you imagine, I don't know what I'm talking about.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
But as we've talked about this before, how crazy it is that this country,

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
its legacy as far as race and gender relations, kind of can be summed up,

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
at least in terms of the weird lunacy, in that we freed the slaves

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
and then we're like, you can vote now, and then a million years later,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
we're like, you two ladies, it's weird.

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
Can you imagine being like a black woman and gaining suffrage, but not quite?

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
You'd be like, yay, fuck, god damn it.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Like, what is with these people?

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
And then we'd be like, what do you mean these people?

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
The hunter has become the hunted.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Just say you're racist, it's the next party, because the jig is up, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
You guys, I mean, you've got a Nazi running for president, like this guy,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
like, you know, come on, we can't keep correcting each other's language

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
and being polite and stuff anymore, we've got to start throwing bricks at shit.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
We didn't accomplish anything with those last ten years of like,

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
mind your peas and queues.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And then all of a sudden there's a fucking pizza hut guy running for,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
winning, winning, becoming president.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Alright, speaking of racism, I play this game Fallout Shelter on the iOS,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
you guys play this as a part of the thing.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay, so it's like a little buildy game where you have little people

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
and you put them in little spots and they have attributes,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
and you're supposed to, you're encouraged to like breed them,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
because you're told you're supposed to make more dwellers in your Fallout Shelter

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
and like their attributes are hereditary.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
So if you breed somebody that has like high scores, like those, excuse me,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
those scores like pass down to their children.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
So if you're playing the game right, then you're picking like somebody

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
and you're putting them up in this special room,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
and also like there's different outfits that like add to your, different attributes,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
and the attribute that drives whether you make quickly or not is charisma.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
So, and then there's these special characters.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
So there's this guy, long story short.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
How did the special characters work?

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
There's like these characters that are like, they're like unlockable,

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
like you get them on cards, it's like those freemium games,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
like you get a car, you pick and pay and you get a card,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
and then sometimes the card's like, boom, you got like this special guy.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
And the special guy I got is a young man.

07:19.000 --> 07:28.000
His pigmentation is darker than what you might call the caucasoid Fallout dwellers.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
His name is Eulogy Jones.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
His stats are through the roof across the board.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
So I couldn't even like, which is like, like, like, think about that.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I mean, like, all right, so, so, like, like, like, so I had no try,

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
I like, I put him in like these sexy, like, like, super charisma pajamas,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
and he's just, he's just up in a special room,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
and then all the people in the vault, I have to like, I click on each lady and I go,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
let's take a look at your, your strengths and your perception.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Okay, you're pretty good. Put on this nightie, you're going up to Eulogy.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
And he just, boom, bang, boom, and all the women walk up.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
And everyone in the shelter, shelter's last name is Jones.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
You get to dress the characters, you get to pick what everybody wears as they walk around your shelter.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
You change their little outfits and then the different outfits have different bonuses

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
to different attributes and charisma.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
So, so, so there's these like, sleepwear adds to charisma.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
So, you literally are taking like a woman who's like working hard on like a,

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
like a water purification room, and you, and she's wearing like combat armor

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
because it gives her more strength and makes her water purifying better.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Actually, it's perception-friendly water purification.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
All right, knock it off.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Like, a lot of people don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
I don't have time to get fucking accurate for the three people that do.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
But, but you're taking a, you're taking a woman in the prime of her working career,

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
like clicking on her combat armor, changing it into a slinky nightie

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and shooting her up to this fucking dude.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Eulogy Jones.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, to Eulogy Jones who just jumps on her and fucking like takes her in the back

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
and there's like little green smile faces and then she comes out limping and pregnant.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
And then you send her back to work.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
It sounds like you're like the leader of a really like awesome cult.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, anyways.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
All right, so I was just-

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Is there an option to make one of these women the high status breeder character?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You could put a woman up there and send men up to her.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Sure, yes.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
But Eulogy Jones is like, there's no comparing.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Like, he's like, he has like almost like just stats.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Yes, you would, it would be great to, to, it would be, it would be more in keeping with

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
sort of like biological tradition, right?

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Like the keeper of the egg stays stationary and then you keep shooting sperm at her.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
You know, like insects, you know, going to the queen, you know, like, you're up, Hank.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You're going up to the boss lady.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
It's your time in the barrel today.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Get your dick out, you little fucking drone.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Unfortunately, that's not how it worked out in Harmon Shelter.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
All right, so I got, I took an Uber because it's a great organization that deserves as

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
much support as possible.

10:21.000 --> 10:28.000
I picked me up and I was, I wanted to pick up, you know, a Schrab because, because he needs

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
a ride in order to do the show.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
And, and I told, I'm telling the guy how to drive to the place and I go, go up here,

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
take a right on this street.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
And then what?

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And then, well, then you'll take another right, which street?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
I said, I don't, I'll show you which one.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
I think I, it's, it's just a, it's a stop sign up.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I said, I want to say Ambrose, but I'll show you.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Driving comes and gets to the street.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
It's avocado.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
He takes a right, I got, I got, take a right, right here.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
He goes, it's avocado.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
He corrected me.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
I was very clear in the fact that I was not like, like sure what the street was and he

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
fucking couldn't resist.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It's avocado.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
I see the sign too.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Like I said, you got me.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
Doesn't Uber make you or require a request that you type in your destination address

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
when you get in the car?

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
No, I do that for my own convenience, but I first, I needed to pick up Schrab and then

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
go to this location.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
So I didn't want to freak anybody out or, I don't know how that would work.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I don't want to put in his address.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
All right.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
That's it.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
That's all I got.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Let's, let's, let's turn it over to some of our friends starting with, let's bring out

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Rob Schrab.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Rob Schrab.

11:47.000 --> 12:14.000
Speaking of a sexy night wear and attributes, did you just come from Eulogy Jones's place?

12:14.000 --> 12:26.000
I was sitting on the couch with my wonderful wife and my perfect dog, watching an L.A.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
story and, and said, it's a good movie.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
What a wonderful.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Fuck.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
Would you please do the show?

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
It was like an hour before we got here.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Will you please do the show?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.760
They like you.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.760
He likes you too, Rob.

12:50.760 --> 12:51.760
I know.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.760
I know.

12:52.760 --> 12:53.760
I love him.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.760
Dan never won.

12:54.760 --> 13:01.000
Dan, in a moment of weakness, told me that he really enjoys you in the show, and I think

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
without him having said too much, I think it's, it's, it's a rekindling of your guys's,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
your friendship.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Well, here, let's do the, let's do the actual conversation.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh, should I get on my phone?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
All right, okay.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Wait, wait, wait.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Don't go yet.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
So you, this is exactly.

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
If you scroll up high enough, Rob, yeah, Rob always, he sent me a, a, some kind of video

13:23.000 --> 13:28.240
of a slow motion of someone throwing a baseball at a batter and just before the batter hits

13:28.240 --> 13:35.000
the ball, it cuts to a woman peeing all over other women.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Put like a fire hose, like, yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
All right.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
What do you do with your phone?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
What do you, what do you text?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
What, what, what, what is the, what do you do?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Okay.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
So I'll, I'll, I'll, should do you want to play each other?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
What do you?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
What?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Or ourselves?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Who, who, which part do you want?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Dealer's choice.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Just start.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
What?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Well, I'll play you.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
You play me.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Okay.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Okay.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
This is, this was at 10 to seven tonight.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
Uh, whoop, Harmontown tonight.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Whoop, please.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Everyone loves you.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
Dude, it's an hour before your show.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm not organized.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
There's no, there's no guests.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
You'll have fun.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
Like, like that's the thing that makes me have fun or not.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
If there's like a guest.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
You always get a little antsy when, you know, people come up and they want to talk about

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
their illness that they're struggling with and you like turn into a six year old in church.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
You know, make an armpit farts and someone's just survived some leukemia or something.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I don't even think you can.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm not organized.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
There's no guest.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
You'll have fun.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
You have two assistants.

15:15.000 --> 15:25.000
Remember last we talked and I thought I said, please just come every week.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah.

15:26.000 --> 15:40.000
And you didn't tell me there wasn't a show last week.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Extra text.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
I looked like an idiot all alone on the stage.

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
All right, I'll tell Steve that you're a regular part of the show so he could be on top of it.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
If you come tonight.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
If you pick me up.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And heart my grams.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
Okay.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I need every heart.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I need every, every heart I can get.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
It's a jungle out there.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
And then whoops, I kind of fucked up.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Just called Uber now and it's 10 minutes away from my place.

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
So we're going to be rolling into meltdown like 805.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Oh, no.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Is that a car?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Is that a you were being sarcastic, right?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Saints preserve us holy cow.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
805.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
I had to find three different kinds of pajamas.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Luckily I was wearing my only pair.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Heading to you now.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Okay.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Pick a pulling up.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
All right.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
I'm glad you guys had fun listening to that.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
All right.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Can't find my pocket now.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
So I heard you got a pedicure.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
You told me on the car right over here.

17:10.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, an ounce of prevention is worth a pedicure.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Hey man, you picked him.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
The kids, the kids love him.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
And I, you know, I just, I was in a bad mood.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I thought, let's bring the guy that the kids like, you know, the crazy uncle.

17:32.000 --> 17:47.000
It's like so irritable and like, I feel like Mercury's in retrograde as my, my, my, my astrology believing ex-girlfriend Robin used to say every two weeks, Mercury's in retrograde.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Yeah.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
She's like every two weeks.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Every time your iPad doesn't play music, it's Mercury's in retrograde.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
It also affects traffic and parking and like, but I do think it's interesting to have as part of your mythology.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
Cause like sometimes, you know, you have those days you just feel sort of like you're out of, you're out of sync.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Like you feel like everything you do is clumsy.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Everything you, everything you say is like ill timed.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Like, like every, it's like nothing's working.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
You're like out of sync with the Lord.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
There's also a full moon yesterday too, right?

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
We're in all the planets aligned, didn't like all the planets aligned.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
And then there was a full moon.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Somebody thought I read that all the planets were aligned.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Like all of them?

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
All, every single planet in the universe were in a straight line.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Yeah.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
What's that?

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
February 2nd.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
February 2nd.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
All the planets will be aligned.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Everyone?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, they must be.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Every planet will be aligned.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Even that, even that new one they just found?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
They found a new planet.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
It's going to be in the front of the line.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Yeah.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Before that, before like Mercury?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Well, yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Okay.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, where did they find this new planet?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Way the fuck out there.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh, okay.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Maybe it's the other side of the line.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Okay.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
I mean, yeah, it's the front of the line depending on which way you're, which is the front.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Well, yeah.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I feel like all planets are trying to get into the rest of the universe, right?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So the front of the line would be out there.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
They'd be going away.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
They'd be going away, man.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
They'd be going away.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
They don't want to be, they don't want to be by no sun.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No, no.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
They'd be going away.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
They'd be going all the way.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
If I were a planet, I wouldn't want to be the first to be devoured by the gravity and the heat of the sun.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
No, no.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
I'd hate that.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
No.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
God, no.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
That wouldn't be me.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
However.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
No, I wouldn't want that either.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Which, which, where in line would you like to be?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Would you like to be the farthest one out, Rob?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Would you like to be like?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Ah, you know, in the, the light middle.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I see you as kind of a Neptune kind of a guy.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
You're out, you're out there.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
You're big and grassy.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Yeah.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
You're big, grassy, blue.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Is this kind of, is this one of our little fun sketches where Rob is Neptune and.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
And, and then we start improvising and it's really fun and joyful.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Not yet.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Okay.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
All right.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Okay.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
No, no.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
All right.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Well, I just, look.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
The, the, the, the, the, but the, the things on the outskirts of the solar system, like,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
like we've, we've, we've.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
Here's something I've always wanted to know.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
How come when we, when we, when we go into space, how come we've never gone down?

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
We're always going to the moon.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Always going there.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Always sending stuff out.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
How come we don't go down?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Into, into the earth?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Somebody.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
What?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Into the center of the earth?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
No.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
No, no, no.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
He's always going.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
How come we're always on this two dimensional plane?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Go to Mars.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
The planets.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Like.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Why don't we go down?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
It's funny.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Why don't we, why don't we ever go down?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
We could go up.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
You always go.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Why do we always go?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Why do we always go?

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
Well, we're going to go to, we're going to go to, we're going to go to the moon.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
And then we're going to go to Mars.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And then maybe we'll go out this way.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It might be somewhere right under us.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
We could.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
There might be a whole other solar system right under us.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
We never.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
It might be like an apartment complex.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Even, even.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
There might be a sun under the sun.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Even in space.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Oh, shit.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
It is like everybody, you see some rocket takes off.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
It just goes left.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
It doesn't go.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
We never go down.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
You know?

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
And I think this is why the South Pole needs a, like, like a rocket.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
They teach you when you, when you're making those little like mobiles of the solar system,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
it's just a flat thing.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Why don't they ever go down?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Because then, then you'd hit a baby.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
That's because it's based on a mobile, mobile, mobile.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh, shit.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
We're indoctrinated.

21:38.000 --> 21:44.000
We learned since childhood, even all of NASA's scientists grew up looking at the first thing

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
they saw.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
That was the thing above their crib.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And so we're all, we've all gone crazy.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Do you think, do you think that's why there's the baby in 2001?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Yeah.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
He went down.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Yeah.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
The baby's down here.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
In the director's cut, in the director's cut, like he's, he's like floating and he kind

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
of turns and he's looking.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
He's going to break the fourth wall and they cut.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.000
The director's cut, he goes, we should have went, we don't go down.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Why don't we ever go down?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
And it pulls out and there's a crease and a big crib.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
And then, and then it keeps pulling out.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
And it's like a nursery.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
And then it's under a big triangle eye, illuminati.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
And then, and then it keeps pulling out and there's a Jew.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm, I'm racist.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I think so.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
The power, the freedom.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Sorry.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I dropped my phone.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
You reacted more to my phone dropping than my anti-Semitism.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
It's the Trump factor.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
We've, we've entered a fucking new.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Why are we so afraid of going down?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
His phone just went down.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
You saw what happened.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It broke.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
We, we never, we never went down.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I, I, I think there's something down there.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Why don't we bring out a resident astronomical.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Right.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Spokesperson, Jonah Ray.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
What?

23:16.000 --> 23:30.000
Hey, resident astronomical spokesman.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
This is what I look like.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
This is what you're doing at home.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is what I was look like.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
I was in heaven.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
And then.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
These look like comfortable shoes.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
They're Uggs.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
They sure are.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Are you guys attracted to women in Uggs?

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
I'd say quite the opposite.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm very turned on by women in tights and Uggs.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Tight, like the combo or just either are.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Definitely.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
I ordered from each.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
That is yours to keep, sir.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
That is yours to keep.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
No, no, no.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Toss it back.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Toss it back.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Thank you.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I ordered each 24.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I ordered each 24 of the, of like a couple of weeks ago.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
And I, and I, and I was dressed like this and I went down to get my, my green leaves.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And then, and then I'm signing for it.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
And then the guy, as I'm signing for it, the guy goes, those are cool.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
They should make them for guys and walk the fuck away.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
No.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Wow.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
No.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
This is the guy that works at green leaves.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
Was he a Wahlberg?

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
Should have got, should have got burgers from Wahlburgers.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Dude got Wahlberg.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
He should have got Wahlberg.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
You know what?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It's because he was watching the entourage marathon.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
That was happening all weekend.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
That sucks.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
The thing that sucks about this.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
And I already signed it and I already gave him a tip.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And I was like.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
You still would have gave him a tip even if he had said that before.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
You should have said, nice joke.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
You, they should, you should have, wait.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Nice.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yes, you got it.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
You got it.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
No, no, no.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
Nice.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
You got it, Dan.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It was pretty much like this.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Nice joke.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
The first person who originally came up with it, because then it would have been, uh,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
forgivable due to, like, like, it would have been a spontaneous.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
At this point, he would have been, he would have been back to green leaves.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It's, it's a hack, you know, that's the thing.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
That's like, that's what really bums me out.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
But it worked.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
That was all bummed out.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Was he trying to zing you?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Was he being like, like in general?

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't think he was trying to zing me, which made it worse.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
He was being like, I said serious, like, hey, look at those queer looking, no.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
You got.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
What would, what would make these, for God's sake?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
More manly?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I don't know.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Spikes?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
They're brown?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Like got, like.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Laces?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
With laces?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
I mean, it's more.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Spurs?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It's more clear that animals had to die to make those.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Oh, don't say that.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Spurs and skin.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
And rubber.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Maybe the green leaves guys like Dan, and when he sees those, he thinks of women and tights.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Yeah, that's the thing.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
This is not vegan friendly in your order from a vegan restaurant.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Oh shit.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
He was right to call you a queer.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
That's probably true.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
These aren't vegan.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
Okay.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm getting rid of these.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Throw them back in the audience.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
You had a chance to throw them.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
All right.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
No, because someone might put them on and go, these are really comfortable and then run

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
into a field and kill a lamb.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
For Valentine's Day.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Like honey, you got to try this.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Spencer, Spencer, these are, these are definitely like what?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
They're made out of pork.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Shit.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
All right.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
All right.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I'm getting rid of them.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
I mean, they're sheer lamb?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
What did you think they were?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
What does that mean?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Like, they shear the lamb.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Like they pull the skin off of the lamb.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Okay.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yeah.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
But what's wrapped around them?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
The outside?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
More lamb skin.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
That's more lamb.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
That's leather you're wearing.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Okay.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Well, I should have done my research before I did my billion Facebook posts.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
You're bad.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
You feel good now that your feet are at swath and had a nice lamb sandwich?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
All right.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
All right.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Who wants them?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Who wants them?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
But now your feet are going to...

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
What are your feet?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
What are your feet made out of?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Roast.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
And that's way...

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Oh, good.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
That's good.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yes.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Separate them.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Give them both to the same person at least.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
No, no.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
No.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
The two different people will find them and then they'll know true love once they come

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
together.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Tail as old as time.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
How much is this a card?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Do you think there's any wool on you?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Let's get you fucking naked.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
I hope you're covered in wool.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Look at the tag.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Look at the tag.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Look at the tag.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Oh, is it all just tricking the book?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
There's no tag on the back of this.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
It's just your shirt.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
It says pork.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, shit.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
All right.

28:00.000 --> 28:09.000
We'll strip them down of his animal products and then we'll slowly introduce him into the

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
sweatshop thing.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
Well, yeah, that's, that's a violour.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
All right.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I worked at a sweatshop.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I worked at a sweatshop down in Vernon, California.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Okay.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
I was, I worked with a bunch of Russian ladies and then I was fired because they, I didn't

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
sweat enough.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
I didn't sweat enough.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.720
It's because I spoke English and the guy's like, you must be good at computers.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.500
And then he made me try to do spreadsheets and I was real bad at Excel and then he says,

28:38.500 --> 28:39.500
you're fucking fired.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
And you're like, pull me back with the Russian women.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
He says like, wait, no.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.240
I asked, I said, I was pretty good at putting buttons on jeans.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.000
He said, no, you weren't.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Wow.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.200
What, what, yeah, what, so what were you making?

28:51.200 --> 28:52.200
What was the product?

28:52.200 --> 28:56.120
It was a brand that I, that I had never heard of.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.480
I think it was called Leafy's.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.840
It was some like just like off-brand jean.

29:02.840 --> 29:07.160
And I was just putting on the top button above the zipper.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.040
That was all I did all day for like eight hours.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.720
Were they riveted on or stitched on?

29:11.720 --> 29:12.720
They were riveted.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.680
I was, I used a riveter.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.040
And then I, that's all, that's all I did all day.

29:17.040 --> 29:22.200
How big was the riveter?

29:22.200 --> 29:23.400
How big was it?

29:23.400 --> 29:25.640
It was about as big as you mined.

29:25.640 --> 29:26.640
Yeah.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.640
Yeah.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.640
So.

29:28.640 --> 29:32.000
I'm still bummed out about the whole Uggs thing.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.920
I should have known that along, it's weird because it's such a go-to for, for people

29:35.920 --> 29:38.960
who are defensive about, about, about the animal thing.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.000
The first thing they, they learn to say is like, what, what do you think your shoes

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
and your belt are made of?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I know.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.720
I got rid of all my shoes and my belt and my wallet, but I didn't think of my Uggs because

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
I'm stupid.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.200
Is Dan going to have to carry you to the Uber like officer and a gentleman on the way out

29:50.200 --> 29:51.200
of here?

29:51.200 --> 29:52.200
God damn it, he better.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.200
You better.

29:53.200 --> 29:57.080
Well, I don't think you should feel that bad because I mean, it's, as much as I'm

29:57.080 --> 30:01.320
sure you'd love to have a perfect like, like no animal effect record.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.320
It's impossible.

30:02.320 --> 30:06.600
It's much more important to like, like, like, I mean, a reduction is good, right?

30:06.600 --> 30:07.600
Yeah.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.240
But it's just, it's, it's, it's really impossible.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.240
It's really hard.

30:12.240 --> 30:18.240
Well, you know, we are fucking crazy super evolved monkeys that like had, I mean, we're,

30:18.240 --> 30:19.840
we're carnivorous.

30:19.840 --> 30:20.840
We're omnivorous.

30:20.840 --> 30:25.720
So like, like, like we can, we can figure out how to evolve and subsist not by not hurting

30:25.720 --> 30:31.120
animals, but like, I mean, we do live by murdering.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
We do.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.120
Yeah.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.120
Oh, you're right.

30:34.120 --> 30:37.400
Yeah, I do.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.000
Plants are, plants are alive.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.120
They just, you know, some plants kill.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
So suddenly, yeah.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.320
That's they, everyone's all high and mighty about plants, but they fucking murder flies.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.640
This is fly trap.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.760
This is, this is not me.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.000
This is not me being a person that's saying like, oh, we might as well eat a bunch of

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
cows.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Like that's all.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.480
Like I'm, I'm trying to let a guy off the hook that's given himself a hard time.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
I mean, you're doing it.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.400
I mean, I've been vegetarian for like 22 or three years.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
Here we go.

31:00.400 --> 31:05.880
But I have one week, one weakness ribs.

31:05.880 --> 31:10.520
I have leather shoes and a belt and a wallet.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.960
So I'm a hypocritical vegetarian all the way.

31:12.960 --> 31:18.560
You know, I mean, I think, you know, like nobody wants to think of things in terms of

31:18.560 --> 31:23.960
just a statistics and reduction because then you're like feeling like you're like, oh,

31:23.960 --> 31:29.480
I'm the only going to kill a certain amount of things with my life, doesn't every little

31:29.480 --> 31:30.480
thing.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.480
Like, isn't it shouldn't the goal be more, it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be about absolutes.

31:33.480 --> 31:38.400
It should be about like a reduction of, so that now, now Rob's Ugg boot, Rob's Ugg

31:38.400 --> 31:42.160
boot is being passed around the audience and it just emerged with a flash of tequila inside

31:42.160 --> 31:43.160
it.

31:43.160 --> 31:48.000
Is it like a magical luck boot?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.400
Now it's just being passed around like a weird flask.

31:50.400 --> 31:56.120
People, people are drinking out of your Ugg boot, drink, drink the boot, drink the boot.

31:56.120 --> 32:04.040
Each tag, drink the boot, drink the boot, drink the boot, drink the boot.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.920
Here's the thing, we're all forgetting it's an Ugg boot and it will immediately just soak

32:06.920 --> 32:07.920
up all the booze.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.040
So then you're going to have to squeeze the boot, squeeze the boot, find a camera, squeeze

32:12.040 --> 32:13.040
the boot.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.040
Get up here, stand up here.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.040
What is your name?

32:15.040 --> 32:16.040
Ethan.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.040
Of course, I know Ethan.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.040
Don't drink it like that.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.040
It's just a coosie that way.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.480
It showed up in a laugh and I ticked it sideways and it just fell out.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.480
Find a camera and drink the boot.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.640
Yeah, look ahead at one of those cameras.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.200
You sound like a porn director.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.200
Find the camera, drink the boot.

32:29.200 --> 32:35.080
Oh yeah, it's real boot liquor.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.080
Oh shit.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.720
She snuck in here, I was there when she got in.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.720
Drink the boot.

32:41.720 --> 32:44.640
I'm actually going to go to the bathroom doing this.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.640
Okay.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.640
I don't believe it.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.960
You're going to go to the bathroom with no shoes on?

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
That's so gross.

32:49.960 --> 32:50.960
Wow.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.200
You're just going to soak up pee in your socks.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.920
This was your moment and Schrab just decided to leave.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.920
Alright, thank you.

32:56.920 --> 32:57.920
Thank you.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.920
Pass the boot around.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.920
Pass the boot.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.920
What do you want?

33:00.920 --> 33:01.920
The boot.

33:01.920 --> 33:06.320
Schrab's going to walk back on with like piss sticky feet.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.920
It's going to be fucking sick.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.920
Well, are we going to...

33:10.920 --> 33:18.280
You know, this is as good as Schrab.

33:18.280 --> 33:22.080
Are we going to applaud his vegan values or are we going to...

33:22.080 --> 33:23.560
Are we going to piss foot shame him?

33:23.560 --> 33:24.560
I mean, like this is...

33:24.560 --> 33:26.240
Why can't we do both?

33:26.240 --> 33:29.640
We're reliving the fall from grace to humanity.

33:29.640 --> 33:34.280
I would rather Rob have animals on his feet than walk through pee-pee town with the socks

33:34.280 --> 33:35.280
on.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.160
As long as he got eyes wide open about that, so, okay, let's kill animals so our lives

33:39.160 --> 33:40.160
aren't gross.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.920
I mean, that is the deal we made.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.920
And then we...

33:42.920 --> 33:45.880
And then the slippery slope as we started going, what about poor people?

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
Who?

33:46.880 --> 33:52.040
I mean, they sound like they're mooing to me.

33:52.040 --> 33:59.320
I guess it's just I have my penthouse apartment, but all I hear is a kind of drone.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.320
It sounds like a moo.

34:00.320 --> 34:04.720
I mean, you know, I'm not saying eat them.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.880
We got all this pork.

34:05.880 --> 34:10.160
But what if we ate their happiness?

34:10.160 --> 34:11.160
Yes.

34:11.160 --> 34:17.080
What if most of them killed themselves and each other because we just leached their fucking

34:17.080 --> 34:18.160
energy off of them?

34:18.160 --> 34:22.480
You know that feeling when you walk by a homeless person that you don't give any money to?

34:22.480 --> 34:24.680
And then when that feeling of guilt goes away?

34:24.680 --> 34:27.720
That's the best feeling in the world.

34:27.720 --> 34:37.600
If we could bottle that with sociopolitical anal beads, it's better on the way out.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.720
Causing trauma to just...

34:42.720 --> 34:44.760
There must be like a way to yank.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.360
Because it's always such a slow process, you've got to pat their fake pockets and you walk

34:48.360 --> 34:51.360
by and then it's a block later, you're kind of feel a little bit of relief.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.520
How do you yank it on a skateboard?

34:54.520 --> 34:56.080
Like a skateboard pass to a homeless guy?

34:56.080 --> 34:57.080
I can't...

34:57.080 --> 34:58.080
Whoa!

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
Yeah.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
Yeah.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
Going in, not so fun on the way out.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.080
Boy, oh boy.

35:02.080 --> 35:07.640
Did I tell you about my friend who used to work in the Returns Department at a sex toy

35:07.640 --> 35:08.640
shop?

35:08.640 --> 35:09.640
No.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.640
Is that allowed?

35:10.640 --> 35:14.800
Yeah, my two friends of mine actually worked in the Returns Department at a sex toy shop.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.800
They needed two people on that job.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.800
There's a flood of people coming in.

35:19.800 --> 35:24.240
Look, apparently they would work late nights and people would bring, stuff would come back

35:24.240 --> 35:30.480
and clearly having been re-boxed, meaning they tried it on or in for size.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.840
And now they're like, this wasn't what I wanted.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.720
But that's illegal.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.720
I would imagine.

35:35.720 --> 35:36.720
It's a biohazard.

35:36.720 --> 35:41.240
But they also worked in the sex shop, and my friend, Israel, worked in the shop.

35:41.240 --> 35:47.200
And Gargamel would mop the peep booths.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.760
And they said that a guy came in late night, there was also a store front.

35:51.760 --> 35:57.440
There was the brick and mortar front of the shop that you could go in and buy sex toys.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.760
And a guy pulls up late at night, and they hated this job more than anything as you

36:00.760 --> 36:01.760
can imagine.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.920
And this guy pulls up in a fancy sports car with a hot drunk chick out in the car, and

36:04.920 --> 36:05.920
he comes in.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.920
And he's like, hey, I want to get some sex toys.

36:08.920 --> 36:09.920
Come on.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.600
And they're like, oh, Jeff, you tried anal bees.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.600
And no, what do those do?

36:13.600 --> 36:17.960
You know, you have her put these into your butt, and right as you're about to come to

36:17.960 --> 36:23.680
her, tell her to pull them out as hard as she can and scream Geronimo.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.720
He's like, really?

36:26.720 --> 36:27.720
That works like gas.

36:27.720 --> 36:28.720
They did that.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.720
I'm hoping that guy's alive still.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.720
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

36:33.720 --> 36:34.720
Yelcheronimo?

36:34.720 --> 36:38.800
Well, I mean, you're not supposed to pull them out like you're starting a lawn mower.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
You're not?

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
No.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.800
I thought, everything I know about anal bees, I learned from stand-up comics.

36:43.800 --> 36:51.120
I love that book.

36:51.120 --> 36:55.400
Chicken soup for the fleshlight.

36:55.400 --> 37:02.200
My friend, he worked at a video store that was 15% regular new release movies, and then

37:02.200 --> 37:07.120
the rest, porn, just porn and sex toys, and he said there was one movie that was consistently

37:07.120 --> 37:13.000
rented along as if he was going there for this movie, and then he would get a porn

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
just because it was there.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.200
Oh, it's the Colgate toothpaste of the pantyhose fetishist at Albertsons.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.200
You want to know what it was?

37:20.200 --> 37:21.920
It's like, toothpaste is like right in the right spot.

37:21.920 --> 37:23.520
I need some toothpaste and some pantyhose.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.120
I might as well just like.

37:27.120 --> 37:35.120
And that toothpaste was a league of their own.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.800
I had to go to the market yesterday because I was taping a hoose line and I've learned

37:38.800 --> 37:42.240
that I sweat a lot to my armpits and I wear suits and I don't want to sweat through them.

37:42.240 --> 37:46.240
So I've learned from a wardrobe lady that you put maxi pads in your t-shirt and like

37:46.240 --> 37:49.320
little penny lanners in there and it works like, it works a charm.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.720
Does it look like you have puffy pits though?

37:50.720 --> 37:54.120
I don't know because they're little skinny guys that go right, you stick them on in the

37:54.120 --> 37:58.400
inside of your armpit of your t-shirt and you put them in there and you're good to go.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.040
It's like a wardrobe secret.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.160
But it was the first time I walked up and I forget what else I bought but it was a pretty

38:03.160 --> 38:04.160
funny egg.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.320
I got some peanut butter cups.

38:07.320 --> 38:17.240
Yeah, I get so much like, yeah, it was like, I give them more scotch tape, I don't know.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.240
You never just go in and say, fuck it, I'm just going to go pantyhose straight across

38:20.240 --> 38:24.760
the board and you don't ever do like a beard purchase on that?

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
No.

38:25.760 --> 38:30.840
There was one time, this is all pre-Amazon days, so really if you were going to be a

38:30.840 --> 38:38.200
creep with a nylon fetish and no girlfriend and you were going to have an indulge yourself

38:38.200 --> 38:43.480
with your mannequin leg, you were on some level you were going to have a face-to-face

38:43.480 --> 38:52.760
encounter and I remember going into like a boutique on a large month, you know, a fancy

38:52.760 --> 38:53.760
place.

38:53.760 --> 38:54.760
Like a lingerie or something.

38:54.760 --> 39:11.280
I was just like, I got caught so off guard that I was like, I was so used to like, oh.

39:11.280 --> 39:18.560
I know Rob, the plastics industry ain't no same either.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.880
The carbon literal footprint of what you're wearing right now.

39:21.880 --> 39:30.320
Yeah, you know they still use cattle to drive the plastic mills.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.560
Rob has plastic bags on his feet right now, for our homelessness.

39:33.560 --> 39:40.960
Hey, tell him to subscribe to the video feed, for our homeless listeners, Rob's having

39:40.960 --> 39:43.600
some beautiful plastic bags on his feet.

39:43.600 --> 39:47.520
And Jonah feels great about having walked away from you.

39:47.520 --> 39:54.000
Anyways, so I walked into this boutique and I was so used to the larger kind of Albertsons

39:54.000 --> 39:57.560
energy where I was like, okay, I'm going to walk around, I'm going to browse, I'm going

39:57.560 --> 40:03.880
to walk out of here with a few sundries and notions and among them maybe perhaps a hosiery

40:03.880 --> 40:04.880
product.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.600
Yeah, for the wife, back home.

40:06.600 --> 40:11.080
I don't know why, but it's a tiny little store and there were like three women who were really

40:11.080 --> 40:19.800
helpful and I was browsing this rack of like a panty house and it all happened so quickly.

40:19.800 --> 40:23.920
I just walked in, where are you?

40:23.920 --> 40:27.920
You're not allowed to, you've just, that was also the beginning of the story.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.840
He's in a boutique on Larchmont for panty house.

40:29.840 --> 40:30.840
Yeah, I mean, fine.

40:30.840 --> 40:36.560
That's all you had to say, that's all you had to say, now I can be quiet and listen.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.280
Listen to that while you were on the stage, presumably listening.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.280
I wasn't listening.

40:41.280 --> 40:46.000
And you came in with, you came in here like Gallagher with shit on your feet, like, wait,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
It's my favorite Gallagher.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
I took it in stride.

40:49.000 --> 40:53.360
I don't know, don't think I can hear what you guys are saying about me when I'm walking

40:53.360 --> 40:54.360
out there.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.360
What the fuck are you asking questions?

40:55.360 --> 40:59.080
You guys are walking out, you guys, I'm walking out there and I'm going to the bathroom and

40:59.080 --> 41:01.360
so you go, he's going to get pee on his foot.

41:01.360 --> 41:06.680
He's like, I'm such a fucking joke, I've got a piece of shit to you.

41:06.680 --> 41:09.960
Nobody can hear anything when you walk with plastic bags on your feet.

41:09.960 --> 41:16.440
You can feel like a fucking jackass all the time, feel like a piece of shit, piss all

41:16.440 --> 41:19.080
over me.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.000
Thanks for having me on, man.

41:22.000 --> 41:32.520
You make me look like a jerk in front of my wife, dog.

41:32.520 --> 41:38.480
So these three ladies come over and they're trying to help you out.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.560
They're just like immediately like, can I help you?

41:40.560 --> 41:45.000
And I was like standing by the pantyhose when they asked that and I was like, no, I'm just

41:45.000 --> 41:50.200
looking and they're like at pantyhose and I was like, yeah, and they're like for your

41:50.200 --> 41:55.000
girlfriend and I'm like, yep, it just kept on from there until I mean, I had to make

41:55.000 --> 42:00.480
this whole fictional girlfriend and like, I was like shopping for like, why am I buying

42:00.480 --> 42:05.560
her pantyhose and how tall is she and it was a whole thing, it's not like a hugely entertaining

42:05.560 --> 42:06.560
story dialogue line.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.560
I'm sorry, I interrupted then.

42:07.560 --> 42:26.040
You got to take notes.

42:26.040 --> 42:31.640
So anyways, Jonah, we are label mates in this new venture called CISO.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.640
CISO.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.640
CISO.

42:33.640 --> 42:38.960
I have a couple of questions.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.200
You have CISO questions.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.880
Why is it called CISO when there's only one ring in it?

42:43.880 --> 42:45.800
If you see something, say something.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.800
Say something.

42:46.800 --> 42:47.800
Isn't it C?

42:47.800 --> 42:48.800
No, you get it.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
If you see something, say something.

42:49.800 --> 42:50.800
No one knows why.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.800
Do you know why?

42:51.800 --> 43:01.360
He says like it's, if you don't believe that you can get good comedy for $4.99 a month,

43:01.360 --> 43:03.640
see, so you get it.

43:03.640 --> 43:06.760
I think that, I mean, it's not good, but that's what it is.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.760
That's what it is.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.760
Yeah.

43:08.760 --> 43:09.760
CISO for yourself.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.160
I think that, well, I'll tell you, I have the answer to your question, but I think the

43:12.160 --> 43:18.080
bottom line is probably that as with, that the goal is always to come up with gibberish

43:18.080 --> 43:21.080
because that's the all that's left available.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.800
And it has to be gibberish that when you hear it, you know how to spell it.

43:24.800 --> 43:29.680
But I think the logic behind the etymology as has been told to me is that you see something

43:29.680 --> 43:36.320
so you tell someone, it's summarizing the primal experience of word of mouth advertising.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.320
Wow.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
CISO.

43:38.320 --> 43:44.760
I see Monty Python archives, so I'm telling Jonah Ray, you go to CISO.

43:44.760 --> 43:45.760
But I'm already there.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.760
Yeah, that's true.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.480
Jonah, when does your show drop?

43:49.480 --> 43:51.760
I think June, I think.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.760
June is, when is yours?

43:52.760 --> 43:53.760
When does yours go?

43:53.760 --> 43:54.760
Spring.

43:54.760 --> 43:55.760
April.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.760
2006.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.760
Jeff, Jeff's in an episode of my show.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.760
What's it called again?

43:59.760 --> 44:00.760
Hidden America.

44:00.760 --> 44:01.760
Hidden America with Jonah Ray.

44:01.760 --> 44:02.760
It's great.

44:02.760 --> 44:03.760
Yeah, I got to be in one episode.

44:03.760 --> 44:04.760
Yeah, to be in an episode.

44:04.760 --> 44:05.760
Awesome.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.760
Do you think it's good?

44:06.760 --> 44:07.760
My show?

44:07.760 --> 44:10.400
I don't like anything I do.

44:10.400 --> 44:15.360
I like one thing I've done, Harmon Quest, coming soon to CISO.

44:15.360 --> 44:16.360
When does that come out?

44:16.360 --> 44:17.360
Spring.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.360
2016.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.360
Do you like it?

44:19.360 --> 44:20.360
It's really good.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.360
I really love it.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.360
I like mine too.

44:22.360 --> 44:23.360
I like mine too then.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.360
Okay.

44:24.360 --> 44:27.360
I don't know how to, I don't like ego and bravado.

44:27.360 --> 44:30.960
So to say I like something I did feels a bit too forward.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.760
Unless you make something amazing.

44:32.760 --> 44:33.760
That's true.

44:33.760 --> 44:34.760
I don't think.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.280
Then you're just being humble by going, whoa, I made that.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.280
Do you do that often?

44:38.280 --> 44:40.080
No, just with Harmon Quest.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.520
Coming soon to CISO.

44:43.520 --> 44:46.880
Community seasons one through six all sucked.

44:46.880 --> 44:50.560
Rick and Morty can suck my balls.

44:50.560 --> 44:53.360
Harmon Quest is the one thing I'm proud of.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.360
Wow.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.440
That's great.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.400
So if that interests you, tune in.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.400
That does.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.680
So it's because all these people are going like, well, I love those things.

45:01.680 --> 45:04.880
The guy who made it thinks they suck, this Harmon Quest going to be the best.

45:04.880 --> 45:05.880
Yeah.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.880
It's a little misguided.

45:08.880 --> 45:15.600
It was remarkable the extent to which like seeing that whole thing come together because

45:15.600 --> 45:20.680
I was like, when I was watching the Ricky Gervais show on HBO, I was like, I fucking

45:20.680 --> 45:26.960
love it when people are saying shit in audio off the cuff and then animators are illustrating

45:26.960 --> 45:33.840
it in the exact, it is the thing that makes me laugh until I cry all the time.

45:33.840 --> 45:39.360
If the guy is Carl Pilkington and the artist, those artists, if you strive for that, you

45:39.360 --> 45:41.680
can make me laugh until I cry in that format.

45:41.680 --> 45:45.840
So I was like, yeah, there's got to be a way to like the D&D thing to do that and that's

45:45.840 --> 45:49.680
been like years and years in the making and seeing it actually come together now.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.680
I hear all your friends are a part of it.

45:52.680 --> 45:53.680
Yep.

45:53.680 --> 45:57.520
Just the funny ones.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.200
Yeah.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.200
That's cool.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.240
That's cool that you got them all together.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.240
Yeah.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.680
It must have been hard because they're so busy.

46:06.680 --> 46:09.480
But you don't like games famously.

46:09.480 --> 46:10.480
Oh, yeah.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.480
That's right.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.480
Oh, you hate playing games.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.480
Oh, shit.

46:16.480 --> 46:18.960
Oh, wow.

46:18.960 --> 46:19.960
Yeah.

46:19.960 --> 46:25.960
I hate seeing you eat crow by your own pitard.

46:25.960 --> 46:30.840
That's a real saying.

46:30.840 --> 46:34.360
That crow hoist captain pitard up high enough.

46:34.360 --> 46:38.000
You fucking pitard.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.520
Not a big laugh on that one.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.520
You were almost there.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.640
I think you almost held that one.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
Anyways.

46:45.640 --> 46:49.880
You kind of did that, though, on, there's two episodes of Rick and Morty that are kind

46:49.880 --> 46:53.640
of like that with improvised dialogue and then the animated stuff.

46:53.640 --> 46:54.640
Oh, yeah.

46:54.640 --> 46:55.640
Yeah.

46:55.640 --> 46:59.360
Well, Justin was doing that in House of Cosby's, like the whole internet dimensional cable

46:59.360 --> 47:00.360
thing.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.360
Yeah.

47:01.360 --> 47:05.280
Justin goes in the booth and like makes crazy shit up and then the animators like draw it.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.280
Yeah.

47:06.280 --> 47:07.280
It's pretty great.

47:07.280 --> 47:10.760
You know, I think it's a good time for House of Cosby's to just be put up on YouTube.

47:10.760 --> 47:14.640
It's like, money-wise, I'm sure he's spread a bit thin.

47:14.640 --> 47:15.640
Yeah.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.920
I have a feeling he's not going to come after us.

47:17.920 --> 47:22.520
His legal department has a lot of thumbs and a lot of pies right now.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
Yeah.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.520
Put in pies.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.920
God, to go back, to go back in fucking time when we were getting those cease and desist

47:27.920 --> 47:28.920
letters for a fucking...

47:28.920 --> 47:29.920
Seesaw and desist letters.

47:29.920 --> 47:30.920
Seesaw and desist letters.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
Why do they call it?

47:31.920 --> 47:36.200
Love to just write a letter back to the lawyer, sending the cease and desist and go, I think

47:36.200 --> 47:42.680
we both know that you have bigger fish to fry.

47:42.680 --> 47:46.040
I think we both know you have 47 fish to fry.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.120
Oh, my God.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.880
If only God...

47:49.880 --> 47:54.600
I now think that is the way I would use time travel if I stumbled onto it.

47:54.600 --> 48:00.080
There'd be like portals like open of like, I could push Hitler in the shower.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.320
I could like make him break his neck.

48:02.320 --> 48:07.520
I could like, I can't riff a bunch of examples of benevolent ways to use time travel.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.000
Just riff your own later with your own room.

48:10.000 --> 48:18.320
And then there's just, I'm going to shame Bill Cosby for his crime against me.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.320
Humanity.

48:19.320 --> 48:28.000
Because that's the thing he did that really gets my fucking dander up.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.880
I just went back and watched all the House of Cosby's.

48:29.880 --> 48:30.880
They're pretty funny.

48:30.880 --> 48:31.880
They're great.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.880
Yeah.

48:32.880 --> 48:37.440
Yeah, yeah, they were real good.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.440
You were in those, Rob.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.200
I was in a, I was in a couple.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.880
Rob, you were a big Bill Cosby fan.

48:41.880 --> 48:42.880
I was.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.480
We haven't really talked about the impact that these allegations of...

48:45.480 --> 48:46.480
Now, you've had...

48:46.480 --> 48:50.000
...applications have had on you.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.760
What, I'm bummed out about it, you know, as much as anybody that was inspired by him.

48:55.760 --> 48:59.400
You think it will forever color, like if you go back and listen to his records, it'll

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
always like...

49:00.400 --> 49:01.400
Yeah, absolutely.

49:01.400 --> 49:02.400
Yeah.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.400
I mean, how couldn't it?

49:03.400 --> 49:04.400
Exactly.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.400
Yeah, because why is a trip to the dentist that funny now?

49:05.400 --> 49:06.400
Yeah, yeah.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.960
He's, he's now more...

49:08.960 --> 49:09.960
Smobic.

49:09.960 --> 49:10.960
Smobic.

49:10.960 --> 49:14.200
He's now more known for rape than being funny.

49:14.200 --> 49:16.680
So yeah, try to get that out of your head.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.360
Doesn't, it's not easy.

49:18.360 --> 49:21.360
So you, you, you won't, you can't separate the art from the artist.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.920
Oh, I thought you were doing a bit.

49:24.920 --> 49:30.360
I was just trying to think of a real pretentious thing to say in the light of a...

49:30.360 --> 49:31.360
In this case...

49:31.360 --> 49:35.360
You can't separate the rape from the rapist.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.200
It's interesting, if you listen to like, as I do, like I'll flip on channels on my car

49:39.200 --> 49:41.720
on the satellite, like XM Sirius...

49:41.720 --> 49:42.720
Ooh.

49:42.720 --> 49:43.720
Oh yeah.

49:43.720 --> 49:47.840
I drive a car at your house.

49:47.840 --> 49:49.160
Oh no.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.680
My car only goes terrestrial.

49:50.680 --> 49:51.680
But like...

49:51.680 --> 49:55.160
Tell me about your space car, Jeff.

49:55.160 --> 49:59.120
Well, it goes like up to like, like a hundred miles an hour.

49:59.120 --> 50:04.200
There's like four or five comedy channels and once in a while you...

50:04.200 --> 50:05.200
What do you...

50:05.200 --> 50:06.200
I'm just redecorating right now.

50:06.200 --> 50:07.200
No, no.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.200
This is what I do.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.200
Are you going to flash?

50:09.200 --> 50:10.200
Are you going to sit like Casey Slater?

50:10.200 --> 50:11.200
No.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.200
Oh.

50:12.200 --> 50:14.200
Are you about to break it down for real?

50:14.200 --> 50:15.200
No, no.

50:15.200 --> 50:17.840
Are you about to give me counseling advice when I'm in eighth grade?

50:17.840 --> 50:23.200
You guys did literally all of these bits the last time I turned my chair around.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.200
Guys, don't overreact.

50:25.200 --> 50:32.000
He only stood up on a stage where there's only four things to look at and one of them

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
is you.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.440
Yeah, yeah, everyone's overreacting.

50:36.440 --> 50:40.040
We're all a bunch of mental fucking mittens.

50:40.040 --> 50:44.880
You guys are all acting like you don't always see a guy in pajamas with plastic bags on

50:44.880 --> 50:45.880
his feet.

50:45.880 --> 50:49.000
Get up and do arbitrary set design.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Let's have some more of this.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Let's take it easy.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Teacher's trying to tell us something.

50:54.000 --> 51:02.440
Let's have Rob talk about the importance of veganism for three minutes while the three

51:02.440 --> 51:08.440
of us do normal things that you'd be an asshole for being distracted by.

51:08.440 --> 51:11.440
Nobody's an asshole.

51:11.440 --> 51:16.440
I felt like I was slouching too much and I thought that was taking focus.

51:16.440 --> 51:22.440
Sorry, I was dreaming of, I was on a bicycle.

51:22.440 --> 51:23.440
It happens.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.440
What's the biggie do we?

51:25.440 --> 51:28.440
What's the biggie do we?

51:28.440 --> 51:32.440
I coined it and you're all going to be saying it tomorrow.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.440
Hey everybody, it's Dan Harmon.

51:34.440 --> 51:36.440
What's the biggie do we?

51:36.440 --> 51:43.440
We'll be right back.

51:43.440 --> 51:52.440
I'm an adorable 43 year old fat white man adopted by aliens and I just keep going.

51:52.440 --> 51:53.440
What's the biggie do we?

51:53.440 --> 51:56.440
Dan, we got to send you back to where you are actually from.

51:56.440 --> 51:59.440
You don't know their cultures but we're just going to let you figure it out.

51:59.440 --> 52:04.440
What's the biggie do we?

52:04.440 --> 52:07.440
Good, start with that.

52:07.440 --> 52:12.440
Sorry, we're doing too different.

52:12.440 --> 52:17.440
Alright, so CISO, Harmon Quest, Rob is...

52:17.440 --> 52:22.440
I was saying XM Radio, you were flipping through the channel and once in a while you will still hear them play a clip from Cosby

52:22.440 --> 52:28.440
and I don't know if that's them being provocative or maybe that's just old programming stuff.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.440
They forgot to expand.

52:30.440 --> 52:31.440
That's weird.

52:31.440 --> 52:35.440
It's an interesting... I don't know.

52:35.440 --> 52:43.440
Right after the first allegations started coming out, after the Hannibal Burris stuff and all the first wave of the women coming out

52:43.440 --> 52:49.440
saying that they had been assaulted by him, they would play and they would talk about it, the Spanish fly bit,

52:49.440 --> 52:52.440
which is like... that's the first thing I thought of.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.440
I just heard that a few weeks ago.

52:55.440 --> 52:59.440
But this stuff has been around ten years prior to Hannibal.

52:59.440 --> 53:01.440
They were doing bits about it on SNL.

53:01.440 --> 53:05.440
Well that was the big outrage was that there was a conspiracy of...

53:05.440 --> 53:08.440
I thought it was a very insightful observation.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.440
I heard about it, I was bummed out about it.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.440
Bobcat joked around about it.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.440
People talked about it.

53:14.440 --> 53:20.440
You would hear things about it and then that was... I thought that was an astute observation.

53:20.440 --> 53:22.440
Well the crowd laughs when Hannibal Burris says it.

53:22.440 --> 53:24.440
The crowd laughs with recognition.

53:24.440 --> 53:28.440
They laugh because it's something that people have already... it's already been in the ether a bit.

53:28.440 --> 53:36.440
And then for some weird fascinating reason about our national psyche because he is a young black man and a comic.

53:36.440 --> 53:40.440
Right? That has something to do with it, right? Am I crazy?

53:40.440 --> 53:44.440
That was the think pieces that were written about it.

53:44.440 --> 53:50.440
Hannibal Burris had to say something before people started dog piling.

53:50.440 --> 53:54.440
He had even recorded that set long before it was ever released.

53:54.440 --> 53:59.440
It was in Philly which is why he brought it up because that's where Cosby was from.

53:59.440 --> 54:03.440
I think it just happened to be maybe a slow news day that some guy was like,

54:03.440 --> 54:07.440
I'm gonna post this, make an article about it and then it blew up.

54:07.440 --> 54:12.440
For rightfully so and it's great for what happened and people get in recognition from it.

54:12.440 --> 54:18.440
But I think it was just a happenstance that some guy at HuffPo decided to write an article about it.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.440
HuffPo.

54:20.440 --> 54:26.440
I get all my hip news from the HuffPo.

54:26.440 --> 54:28.440
What's the dealio?

54:28.440 --> 54:30.440
I don't have time to say...

54:30.440 --> 54:35.440
Let me right click on that HuffPo.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.440
What's the weather today, HuffPo?

54:38.440 --> 54:44.440
Oh, it's a Bombay 65 with a windshield.

54:44.440 --> 54:47.440
Professor Schrab, can you please just teach us once?

54:47.440 --> 54:54.440
Oh my gosh. Hey, HuffPo, what are some of the funny cartoons I can look at?

54:54.440 --> 54:55.440
HuffPo.

54:55.440 --> 54:56.440
Oh, really, really.

54:56.440 --> 54:58.440
HuffPo Wheeljack, Silver Streak.

54:58.440 --> 55:03.440
The Decepticons are attacking.

55:03.440 --> 55:05.440
HuffPo.

55:05.440 --> 55:06.440
HuffPo.

55:06.440 --> 55:14.440
You know, back in my day, it was called the Huffington Po.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.440
What about Grandpappy's Day?

55:16.440 --> 55:22.440
Grandpappy's Day, it was the Huffington Post Office.

55:22.440 --> 55:24.440
Oh, yeah.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.440
They had all the time in the world back then.

55:26.440 --> 55:31.440
Yeah, you didn't know back in his day that it was the Huffington Post Office.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
What do the cavemen call it?

55:33.440 --> 55:38.440
They called the cavemen called it.

55:38.440 --> 55:48.440
Back in their day, they called it the Huffington Post Office Choir.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
Choir?

55:49.440 --> 55:50.440
Choir.

55:50.440 --> 55:53.440
Oh, it was just pre-linguistic gibberish.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.440
It was like primal prints.

55:55.440 --> 56:00.440
Well, they didn't have the margin set, so the rest of the title went right off of the stone.

56:00.440 --> 56:05.440
What you're hearing during that word is someone seeing a dinosaur and running.

56:05.440 --> 56:08.440
I'll finish this later.

56:08.440 --> 56:15.440
There's things you call shit, and then there's running from a dinosaur!

56:15.440 --> 56:22.440
Dinosaurs and men existed at the same time, but not women.

56:22.440 --> 56:27.440
That's my very controversial point of view.

56:27.440 --> 56:31.440
I believe in the Big Bang. I believe the universe is 6 trillion years old.

56:31.440 --> 56:36.440
I don't cotton to all that bullshit with these fucking evangelical people,

56:36.440 --> 56:40.440
but I believe that man and dinosaur lived at the same time.

56:40.440 --> 56:45.440
Does that mean that women are a descendant of man fucking a dinosaur?

56:45.440 --> 56:49.440
No, women so hot.

56:49.440 --> 56:52.440
Yes, yes, yes.

56:52.440 --> 56:56.440
You guys know that there's like dino porn.

56:56.440 --> 56:59.440
Don't say it so matter-of-factly.

56:59.440 --> 57:02.440
Yeah, but did you hear that fucking, yeah.

57:02.440 --> 57:05.440
That's my crowd.

57:05.440 --> 57:09.440
Yeah, there's like a series of books.

57:09.440 --> 57:14.440
They're sort of like self-starters turned like huge popular things.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.440
They're fiction.

57:17.440 --> 57:21.440
It's women being kind of ravished by dinosaurs.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.440
Do the dinosaurs have feathers?

57:23.440 --> 57:26.440
You have every question that I have.

57:26.440 --> 57:29.440
As far as we got was like pulling up some of the covers online,

57:29.440 --> 57:31.440
and then like, yeah, I guess it's like just sort of a,

57:31.440 --> 57:34.440
it's something that's like a generated out-of-fan fiction,

57:34.440 --> 57:36.440
and then became like the genre.

57:36.440 --> 57:41.440
Is it CG dinosaurs, like slash, like, these are dinosaurs fucking?

57:41.440 --> 57:43.440
Well, yeah, it's CG.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.440
Oh, people, well, it's live action. It's not like-

57:45.440 --> 57:47.440
No, it's fiction. It's just literature.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.440
Oh, literature.

57:48.440 --> 57:51.440
I'm saying it's like stories about, we skimmed through.

57:51.440 --> 57:55.440
There'll be like stories about like a dinosaur,

57:55.440 --> 57:59.440
and then it's sexualizing dinosaurs.

57:59.440 --> 58:02.440
Are you looking at this? Are you looking it up right now?

58:02.440 --> 58:03.440
Are you looking it up?

58:03.440 --> 58:07.440
Wait, so are dinosaurs like just forcing themselves?

58:07.440 --> 58:08.440
That's what we don't know.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.440
Justin heard about it, and then he drew on the whiteboard

58:10.440 --> 58:13.440
this amazing picture of like a T-rex with a big hard-on and,

58:13.440 --> 58:15.440
and then a woman kind of perched on it,

58:15.440 --> 58:17.440
like sort of like rubbing his nipples.

58:17.440 --> 58:19.440
A rape tour?

58:19.440 --> 58:22.440
It could have been consensual.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.440
But I think it's sort of like-

58:24.440 --> 58:26.440
because that was my first question is,

58:26.440 --> 58:29.440
are they raptor size? Because that's- who cares?

58:29.440 --> 58:33.440
Like, well, raptors are like, you know,

58:33.440 --> 58:35.440
they're regular size, so that's like-

58:35.440 --> 58:38.440
Where's the imagination?

58:38.440 --> 58:41.440
Where's the sense of whimsy?

58:41.440 --> 58:43.440
I can get into that though.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.440
Blow my mind.

58:44.440 --> 58:48.440
Don't put me- confine me in such a raptor-shaped box.

58:48.440 --> 58:50.440
That's why I think it's interesting.

58:50.440 --> 58:53.440
Let's get some stegosaur, Aaron.

58:53.440 --> 58:56.440
Because there is such a thing as bestiality,

58:56.440 --> 59:00.440
and we have beasts on this earth that raptors are the same size as.

59:00.440 --> 59:02.440
I think it's very interesting because I've never heard of that,

59:02.440 --> 59:06.440
like the idea that you could sexualize such a giant prehistoric lizard.

59:06.440 --> 59:09.440
I wanted to be very clear on that.

59:09.440 --> 59:12.440
I was like, are we talking about Godzilla-sized like fucking things?

59:12.440 --> 59:13.440
And then how do they sexualize them?

59:13.440 --> 59:15.440
I don't know, I didn't read- it's not like-

59:15.440 --> 59:22.440
You're saying it's dino, like it's reptile on women action?

59:22.440 --> 59:24.440
Does anybody know more about this?

59:24.440 --> 59:26.440
She's got- she just brought it up.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.440
Well, yeah, but she's shot her hand down.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.440
But the fastest hand that I've ever seen raised happened.

59:31.440 --> 59:33.440
Get up here and read us from Dinoporn.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.440
What did you, madam?

59:34.440 --> 59:36.440
What is your name?

59:36.440 --> 59:38.440
She's the same one who put the booze in the booze.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.440
Please be America's foremost author of Dinoporn.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.440
No, he actually has a name, and he's on-

59:44.440 --> 59:49.440
He's on Amazon.com, many a book.

59:49.440 --> 59:52.440
I don't remember his name, though.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.440
Well, now I don't like it.

59:53.440 --> 59:54.440
It's like Chris-

59:54.440 --> 59:55.440
It's Christy Soot.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.440
That's how I- I thought it was a woman.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.440
No.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.440
And I was like, it's Danielle Steele.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.440
There's a couple different ones.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.440
He had an excellent Reddit AMA one time,

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.440
and he likes to put businessmen in suits,

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.440
fucking dinosaurs, or dinosaurs in suits,

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440
fucking-

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.440
We'll see though.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.440
I can't get into the reality anymore.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440
No, I'm turned on.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.440
That's also-

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.440
Now you got a fan.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.440
I'm turned on by dinosaurs in suits.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440
Yeah.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440
I'll fuck a dinosaur in a suit.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.440
I'm sorry, what's your name, young lady?

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.440
My name's Molly.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.440
Molly, so these are man-sized dinosaurs?

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.440
No, they might be dinosaurs.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440
Man-sized.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.440
And dinosaurs-shaped size.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.440
But there's also-

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.440
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440
I'm saying-

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440
Wait, say that.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440
I didn't get that.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.440
This is the stage of the show where I'm getting a little drunk.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.440
Pretend to scale very well.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440
Me too.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.440
So, yeah, they're like dinosaur size, like big ones.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.440
The dinosaurs range in size.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.440
Like, is there ever a story where Wayne Knight fucks a spitter?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.440
I don't-

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.440
Don't encourage him.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.440
I do not know what that is.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.440
I think we know how it ends.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.440
Good thing, mostly, everyone else does.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.440
You know, I have a bumper sticker that says,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.440
Good Dilapasauruses don't spit.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440
Anyways.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.440
Would you like to know, please?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.440
Dilapasaurus.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.440
My favorite is dinosaurs fucking cars.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440
What?

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440
Okay.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440
Yes.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.440
Are the cars, like Pixar cars, like they're like-

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440
Ow!

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.440
No.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440
All the cars have to be-

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.440
They're like straight up like mechanical cars with no faces.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440
Not humanized at all.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.440
Just like giant dinosaurs.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.440
Are they put in a dick like in the muffler or in the trunk, I guess?

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
Oh, no.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440
Sorry, I got it wrong.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440
It's not dinosaurs.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440
It's dragons.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440
Dragons with wings.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440
Dragons fucking cars.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440
Yes.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440
Okay.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.440
What the fuck?

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.440
Go back.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440
Dragons?

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.440
It's a whole subreddit.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440
It's a whole subreddit.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.440
Dragons fucking cars.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.440
Now, is this just people having fun or is not people jerking off actively?

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.440
That sounds like a white-winged policy.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440
All right.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.440
That's a question.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.440
I'm out.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.440
I'm out.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.440
I'm out.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440
All right.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.440
Everybody-

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.440
Can I have my tequila back?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440
Yeah.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.440
All right.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440
Now, we know.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440
Okay.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.440
Let me get a little Donahue control here.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:24.440
Donahue was a guy who hosted a talk show before Geraldo.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.440
What?

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.440
Okay.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.440
Well, you can have one.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.440
So, Molly-

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.440
Yes, Dan.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:40.240
You mentioned in passing, some of these stories are dinosaur-sized dinosaurs sexualized in

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.240
situations with regular-sized women, right?

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.640
I really, I just need to remember the name of this guy and then we'll have like a million

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.440
excellent titles to draw from.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.440
Chuck Tingle.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.440
Chuck Tingle.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.440
Chuck Tingle.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440
It's Chuck Tingle.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.440
So, does Chuck Tingle write Chuck human-sized dinosaurs but dinosaur-sized humans?

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.940
Okay, so there's definitely an excellent title that something has to do with his butt

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.440
fucking his own butt.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.440
Wait, what?

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
Oh, yeah.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.440
His own butt fucking his own butt?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.440
That's like where his ass fucks him, right?

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440
Okay, all right.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440
Let's go.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440
It's nice work if you can get it.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Author.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:24.440
Chuck Tingle wrote a story about his own butt fucking his own butt.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.440
Yeah, like his butt shows up and it's like-

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440
Is he a genius?

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440
Yeah, I'd say.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.440
Yes, he literally is a genius.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.440
He's been a national treasure.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.440
If butts start learning how to fuck themselves, we're all out of a fucking job.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440
Yeah.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440
Life finds a way.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440
I know.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
You and me and every dinosaur we know.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.440
So, the first title that comes up is My Ass is Haunted by the Gay Unicorn, Colonel.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440
Too long.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440
Colonel.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440
His name is Colonel?

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440
Colonel, like with the O's in it.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.440
Colonel.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440
Okay.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.440
Colonel.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440
All right, so a lot of these people, a lot of his, a lot of his-

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440
Okay, here, space raptor butt invasion.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440
All right.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440
Okay.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
Is that like one of a series of space raptors?

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.440
Oh, oh, oh.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.440
That's like the third one, space raptor three, butt invasion.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.440
Space raptor in the hood.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.440
They did three of those.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.440
Space raptor out west.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:24.440
They did one space raptor in space and three in the hood.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
Okay, so here's the one I was thinking of.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.440
Pounded in the butt by my own butt.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440
Okay.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440
This sounds like one of my raps.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.440
Yeah.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.440
Can we get, can we put the, can we put out the Harmontown bat signal and get Chuck Tingle

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.440
on the show?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.440
I've read that.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.440
That story.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.440
That's good.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.440
Well, I just don't, I just don't want to fall into like a thing.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.440
Like if this is like a Piranha movie thing where it's like, I don't want this guy to

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440
be in on the joke.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.440
I want him to be.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440
That's what it looks like though.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.440
But we don't know that he makes his own artwork.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.440
A lot of the story is about him being so surprised that it's actually his own butt.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.440
How do you know?

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
I've read it.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.440
Is this Chuck Tingle though?

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440
Is this the guy?

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.440
Is this the model?

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.440
Is this guy too ripped and handsome to be Chuck Tingle?

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440
No, that's not Chuck.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440
I think we're finding out Spencer is Chuck Tingle.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.440
Don't roll your eyes.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440
What?

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440
I mean, roll your eyes?

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.440
I guess I roll my eyes.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.440
You're as, he's holding up the cover of, of, of my butt, pounded my own butt.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.440
It's like clearly a guy.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.440
My is on the title twice.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.440
You don't think he would put himself on the cover?

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:32.440
When you walk past a Harlequin novel, do you think that Angela Harlequin is the woman on

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.440
the cover?

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440
She's not.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.440
Is she not?

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.440
I really did think it and I feel dumb now.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440
Thanks.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:46.440
He thought Harlequin was just some lady who's always good to go.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.440
I thought that might have been him.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.440
All right.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.440
Well, I, yeah, I wanted to, but here's the thing.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.440
I only brought it up because I, so like may as the self loathing male in me, I thought,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:04.440
I thought, I thought it was like, I thought it was like a, a, a new like culture among

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.440
women who were like, I want to do it with a dinosaur.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440
And they were like expressing themselves.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.440
I didn't know it was like some anonymous guy who's like, and then the dinosaur fucks

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440
the lady.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440
And everyone's like, yay.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440
So you thought the, the, the authors were female?

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.440
I thought it was like a phenomenon, like with like a new, like one of many like new blossoming

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.440
like, like, like things that couldn't have been possible if the internet hadn't like,

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.440
like, like, you know, existed that, that people can find each other and then find their audience

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:34.440
so that, that you can, if, you know, rule 34 meets the human psyche and like, like people

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.440
going like, yeah, I, you know what, I have this one thing that I'm really, really, really

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.440
obsessed with and I'm really, really passionate about it.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.440
And then everyone going, yes, yes, yes.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.440
I like that too.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.440
Like, I mean, there's only 500 of us, but I'll give you $30 for a t-shirt.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.440
And like, like, that's what I love about the internet.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.440
And I thought, I thought it was like, there was this thing that was like this biosphere

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:58.440
where it was like, did you know that there, that, that women like, like certain small subset

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.440
of a subset of a subset of women, like, like they, when they look at a t-rex, they like,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440
they get a little bit tingly.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440
They get a little tingly.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:11.440
And that some of them are like really good writers and that, and that, and that people

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.440
like flooding to their work and going like, this is amazing.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440
Like, that's how I, right?

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.440
But isn't it possible that, that is like, that he's writing for like, that his stuff lands

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440
on the people?

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440
Maybe he's really good.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440
Yeah.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.440
I'm not, I'm not judging the guy.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440
I, I, I don't know anything about, about this person.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:29.440
I'm not saying, I just saying like the mythology I created in my head is a disappointment.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440
It's like, I had a thing.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.440
You're disappointed in dinosaur porn.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440
No.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.440
So it matters a lot to him whether or not people actually get off on it or not.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.440
Right.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.440
Yeah.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.440
It doesn't really matter.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.440
Yeah.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.440
It's, we can just laugh at it too.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.440
Yeah.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.440
I mean, I guess I have a, I have a relationship now where it's like, we open up the laptop,

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.440
we watch the porn, the acting's bad.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440
Like we can, we can search for jokes.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.440
We can search for whatever.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440
We laugh that all of a sudden someone's jerking off.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440
Then we're fucking whatever.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.440
Like, like, it's like, like, I guess that's fine.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:04.440
But the piranha movie thing, I just don't want to be part of someone else's joke.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.440
Yeah.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440
No, no, I get that.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.440
It's when someone's in on the joke, it makes it.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
Like, be passionate about your shit.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440
Yeah.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.440
Don't laugh with me when I'm laughing at your thing.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.440
Yeah.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:20.440
You fucking say out of my joy, making fun of you.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.440
Yeah.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.440
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't repackage the room as a comedy, Tommy Wiseau.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.440
Yeah.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.440
Fucking stand your ground and say, this is the citizen cane of movies about a guy with

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:39.440
a burn, burgy, like burn scars on his back doing a sex scene with a woman and a fucking

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.440
crazy ass, like psychological experiment that involves taking two cameras together.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.440
That is weird though.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.440
When you see the movie, it's a, everyone saw the room and Tommy Wiseau shows up and he's

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440
very, he's very playing about how much he loves it.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440
But it has anyone ever seen it?

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440
I know, Schrab, you've seen it.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.440
I think you say, get, get, get, get, get it in.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.440
Have you guys seen Gettaven?

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440
Oh yeah.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.440
I've seen Gettaven.

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.440
Gettaven is a movie called Get Even.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:04.440
But in the title shot, the words are too close together, so everyone just calls the movie

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.440
Gettaven.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.440
It's a guy, it's a, it's a, it's a, he's a Tommy Wiseau type.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.440
Yeah.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.440
He's a self-made, like he, movie star, he made his own.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440
Yeah.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
He looked like Dr. Phil kind of.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440
Yes.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.440
And he made, he made a movie about him.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.440
He's a lawyer.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.440
He's a lawyer in Los Angeles.

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.440
Yeah.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.440
And so he funded and wrote and directed and starred.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440
And sang in.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440
And sang in his own movie.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440
Oh yeah.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:30.440
But like we, we, me and Deanna saw it at Cine Family and he showed up.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440
Everyone's like, it's like, what do you think he's going to be like now?

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.440
When did you see that?

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.440
Um, you made it two years ago?

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.440
Yeah.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440
You were there, right?

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.440
Oh yeah.

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:43.440
That was after, um, wasn't that after my birthday?

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440
Your birthday was right before it?

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440
Yeah.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440
Yeah.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440
Oh yeah.

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.440
And do you remember he showed up and he was wearing a windbreaker suit, a two piece windbreaker suit

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.440
and brought in his own igloo cooler full of, uh, natural light.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.440
And then when everyone asked about the movie, they're like, it's like, so tell us about,

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440
uh, how you made the movies.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:06.440
Like, well, you know, I want, I set out to make, uh, the best action movie ever.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.440
And I, I think we got pretty close.

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440
Yep.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.440
And then everyone, it's like, you've, you've heard a room full of people laughing, but

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.440
you've never heard of a room of people trying not to laugh.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.440
So really, I mean, that's, that's an interesting new phenomenon too.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.440
Like, uh, like everybody go see, uh, what was it, worst, worst, what's it called?

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.440
Worst, best movie.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
Worst, best movie.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.440
Because it examines that, that, that phenomenon really closely.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.940
Cause the movie troll too is like this, like insanely horrible movie and there's like these

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:37.940
actors in it.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.440
And like, it's, it is interesting this thing that we do where, uh, like, like we celebrate.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440
We go like, that's the fucking movie's the best.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440
I'm so into this movie because it's so horrible.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.440
And then like where, like, like what we, our definitions of like, uh, when you're being

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.440
mean by doing that and are you supposed to, anyways, Molly, what's your, um, uh, what's,

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.440
what's like a issue or anything that I can solve for you with a rap?

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.440
Like a, like a, like a social issue or a topic in the news right now or a personal thing

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440
for you.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.440
I'm, I'll make it all better with a rap or I'll dress it at least.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.440
I'll get to the bottom of it.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.440
Okay.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440
I have an answer for you.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.440
Uh, I work with dogs in a city.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:26.440
I work in a dog with dogs in a city and you people who live in cities, stop getting dogs

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440
please.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440
All right.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.440
Because those poor dogs just live inside all day and you go to work and you leave them

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.440
alone and they're bored.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440
You're mean.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440
Yeah.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440
Stop doing that.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440
I take my dog to work.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440
Well, that's nice.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440
Thank you.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440
No.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.440
Is it also inside when you're at work?

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440
Do you work in a park where it can run around?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440
No.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.440
But I'd stay inside all day too.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.440
All right.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.440
Give me a beat.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440

You got a best friend.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.440
He's been with you from the beginning to the end.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.440
He's got four little paws and a tail.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440
Yo.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.440

There's a letter from me.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.440
I wrote it with a little blood and pee because I'm trapped in the fourth ring of hell and

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:37.440
I'm telling you, you got to get your dog and sell it to a park so it can run around.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440
That's cool.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.440
Ok.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440
Alright.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.440
Thank you.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440
Yeah.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440
Look if you can wrap it up.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440
Yeah.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.440
Yeah.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.280
That's just jealous.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.240
Let's get we should unless it gets better if I get back on it.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:13:02.840
just get a second verse gets better because a different character comes in.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.840
Yo.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.040

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:25.040
I fucking, fuck you. Just give me a second. There's a third character comes in. What?

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:37.040
Dogs living in seclusion, in side houses, indoor dogs. There should be no such thing.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:49.040
My name's Vincent Price. I take it I had to tell you that from your reaction.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:55.040
I'm Vincent Price and I'm here to say now I'm the one that gets to rap today.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:03.040
I usually do the talking part in the middle. But I'm Vincent Price. I play the fiddle.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:14.040
I put sausage on the griddle. I love Malcolm in the middle. He does, I bet.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:24.040
Well, I hope that was exactly when the track ended. You brought that right into the station, Dan.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.040
That was very nice. I feel like you guys could have helped out better.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:35.040
What would you want us to do? Just throw in a what? Do you want to do it again?

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.040
No, I had to throw somebody under the bus. I was a little embarrassed.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:41.040
So you threw all of us under the bus?

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:45.040
It was a big bus. I failed pretty hard. A lot of room under there.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:52.040
What are you talking about? I don't feel like I really learned a whole lot about dog rights and the dogs in the city.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.040
Just don't keep them indoors, like Molly said.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.040
You know what? Bring that beat back. One more time, Dan.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.040
You want the same beat? Jonah, are you going to get up and lay it down?

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:06.040
Fuck no. I'll throw in some what?

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:11.040
You want some what? We can fail together.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:22.040
Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow.

I can't get my dick in her so I just rub it in the place outside from her

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.560
Until I come put it on her foot and then I run

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.800
The tunnel that is where all the dogs go after they fuck women and they run in the snow

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.840
Lick at the frog you gotta do it. That's the cost of being a dog

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.840
You be a dog

You gotta do it. That's the cost of being a dog. Then the frog. Be a dog. Say what? Be a dog

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:06.280
Paw print in the north fucked your mama so hard still look at Peter north north browns up north and north and north

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.280

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.600
Oh

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.600
You got the rep to the teams like a donut dog

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.680
Can I cheat to go for the deep because you get up deep to get the air in the tea

In the bag of the 9-11 gonna hate them over to the Donald Trump. Well, no new taxes, but you don't dance

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You gotta hate those guys a little raised leg

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:38.120
That's why you don't want to go down to the town with the dog and the frown of the being a dog

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.680
They said they see the dog

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:47.240

Why do you like him state of california says they're illegally married now? Well

01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.360
We can do something about that. I need to know if you love me though. If you don't then I don't like you

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.320
I feel like our relationship is kind of hitting a plateau

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.720
Then get out of my trunk. I didn't want to be in your trunk

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.680
Get out of it then

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.400

I'm closing the trunk in five seconds

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:24.280
I can't I'm out of your trunk. You can't get out. I'm out of your trunk. Oh, you're out leaving walking away. Well, I'm getting in it

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.800

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.160
Wow

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.440
That was very good. That was called mr. Jones and me. Yeah

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:43.720
We're gonna be real big stars. It's a socio political commentary on urban dog having

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.720
Yeah, I got crazy

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:55.080
Well, let's check back in with uh spencer. What's what's going on in the world of politics? Oh, let me tell you guys

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.160
The iowa caucuses are upon us people are caucusing

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:07.480
They're out there hitting the pavements real shoe leather work by the the real working men and women of iowa

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:11.000
Gentlemen, what do you think the difference is between the white caucus and the black caucus?

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.480
Probably the color

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.960
Oh, wait, wait, wait caucuses vote would be voting like this

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:30.520
And I don't think I have to show you what the black caucus but it's like, but I think we want to see it very free and easy

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.680
I think we want to see it. Well, it's just like

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.880
Yeah

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920
And this is done

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.040
It's just very simple and elegant. Yeah, it's nice

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.440
my wife

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.880
What

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.640
What's going on over there?

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.640
I just realized I forgot my keys

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:56.360
I want to make sure kate's awake when I come back home. Otherwise, I'm going to be standing outside with plastic bags

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.760
At a bathroom until your neighbors are going to come out and go she clearly doesn't want to see you right now

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.800
What is a caucus?

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:12.680
It's uh, you know how like we vote like for the person we want in california other places. They don't

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:17.560
That's that's all I got. What's what is a caucus?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.600
I guess I could have helped a little

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.840
Isn't it like well, it's more like a representative democracy where instead of one person one vote

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.080
It's like we get a bunch of delegates and then those delegates get their delegates or something like

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.200
Trump make america great again

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200
Yeah

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:45.640
It's I was so happy to see that snl sketch where trump was like the straight man and was like

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:52.360
Sarah pale. It's crazy. I'm gonna be the new president and snl's all ready for it. Like they're ready. They're ready for eight years of

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040
I have bummed me out so much

01:21:56.040 --> 01:22:01.960
snl seems like the only comedy property that actually seems legitimately excited for a trump presidency

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:07.000
Yeah, like most other comedies are like, yeah, it's a joke, but come on. We care about

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:14.200
You guys a caucus has a faction within a within a legislative body that pursues its interest through the legislative process

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.880
Um, that means nothing. That meant nothing smarty pants

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.480
Or a meeting of party leaders just elect candidates elect

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440
Trump pale in 2016

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.280
It really makes no difference

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080
Holy shit

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080
I'm

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.960
Rob, who do you who do you like in the uh for the uh for the g.o.p. nomination? Oh, don't do this

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.160
Who do you like rob?

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:43.720
Who don't do who you're feeling right now? Who do you feel who's got the smart money right now? Man? I don't know

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.040
senator pajamas

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.040
Yes, anybody that's got pajamas

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.920
Are you part of the pajama caucus? I am

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.360
That is a caucus, huh? What is a caucus? It's a bunch of people getting together to decide

01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:01.400
A party strategy and select their leaders and kind of like who supports so it's a pretty well

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.320
It's a who

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.040
Multi hours like hours

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440
Yeah, we got a word for it, man

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.480
They have a quicker way of saying yeah

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:19.240
It was like an hour, but like a lot of them hours. Yes

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.800

Hey, could somebody hand me that bag of multiple potato chips

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.040
Yeah, it's like a it's like a it's like a it's like a quorum

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.120
It's like a it's like a meeting about to make a decision that ultimately is done

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:44.200
By a show of hands or accounting votes, but also there's a bunch of conversation. It's not like a like a popular

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.800
It's like a caucus. It's like a clusterfuck. Yes

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:53.000
Oh, what do we give us about Iowa like it's like what why did that? Why does Iowa have to be so important to the rest of the

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I don't know Joe. Why does Iowa?

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.520
They decided to go first you could just decide to go first really yeah

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:08.680
Except and that's like I think nevato is like we want to go first and then they like now they're third or some shit

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.840
I don't know but like yes states are just they did a really bad job of deciding to go first

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.840
If they're well, it's not bad at first. So who said we'll go third. Did they go first who?

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:29.400
I mean if they why don't they take a rocket down. Yeah senator pajamas. You do not have the floor

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.520
Wow

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.360
Are you finding out I've got I've got like are you about to wax rhapsodic right now? Are you?

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:10.120
No, no, no, I've got my couch situation is crazy in my living room

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.960
Tell us about this couch situation. Oh my gosh one's long one short. It's not working

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.640
It's got a table that doesn't match the drapes

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:28.360
If you know what I mean, are you finding it speaking of which Molly? Can I ask you a question?

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.800
That reminds me this has been something I've ever said came on stage Rob Rob

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.880
I got one thing in my mind

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.160
I'm glad that you're thinking about that. Yes

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200
so

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.200
I

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.280
That was not intentional

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.840
Just I just I just did dim conway right there

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.800
Uh

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:08.120
Rob are you finding it harder to uh be creative as you get older? Uh, I think we've proven just now

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:14.440
Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's harder to definitely be I I don't know if it's just because it's a depleting thing

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:20.040
Or maybe because you've already done stuff. So then you're like, you know, this should like shouldn't be that easy

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.240
I don't know

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.280
Well, it's like I think you you you're you're not only competing with everybody else around you

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.800
But you're competing with the last thing you did. So, you know, if if you know, you did something that was like

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960
Well, that's the best thing I've ever did

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.400
Yeah, you know, you're gonna have to outdo the best thing you ever did in order to feel that same feeling

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.440
I feel like I feel I feel like it's always just like like I just want the shit to make sense

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.160
And it's just like so hard. It never makes sense. Like isn't that why uh, Schrabbing works

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.480
It is like

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.520
Meaning what wait, wait, I didn't like it doesn't make any sense

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.400
Oh, yeah, because well, yeah, it's a release from yeah

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:03.720
Schrab definitely represents for a lot of us the the liberation from making fucking sense. Yes

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.240
For sure. Yes, it you can't

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.440
Lou I can't the new kind of comedy. Yes

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.240
The new kind of comedy

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:20.040
I'm the face of the new kind of comedy. What's the new kind of comedy the new kind of comedy

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:24.280
What comedy where where you're where I just say things

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.000
That's my bit. I should I should have I should have been a who's bid is that I should have I should have

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.080
I should have said like I'm a director and so I said I'm a writer. It's fucking hard

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.000
It's hard being a director. Yeah, come on. If you're a director

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.240
Why don't you you could do that put the camera in there and then put it there

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:48.040
And you don't even have to use if that's wrong. You put it put it everywhere. Dan put the camera everywhere. You just directed. Yeah

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.560
Put it everywhere

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.800
And then say do this I've been saying that I've been saying that for years. Dan you should be directing

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.160
Directors get to like rewrite scripts too. So it's like the easiest part of writing, right? Yeah

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.800
And everybody thinks that they make the movie. Yeah

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.960
It's so insane and I just like they couldn't be a dumber species

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.680
The directors. Yeah, they're just like yep. Yep. That's definitely true

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.960
Even dumber than actors get me out of here uber

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.200
Yes, you know what yes, yes

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.960
Because actors are smart enough no matter how dumb they are that they're like

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:33.960
I you know what I should stay under these lights and like like like like work hard to like pretend to be someone else

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.120
And a director could just be like

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120
action

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.280
Do it different

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.240
Can we get it did I forget to say cut that's what the second 80s for

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.360
Action again do it different

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:59.720
Let's do a series do a different five times action action action action action action action action action action I'm going home

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.000
Holy shit. Can you please direct something soon?

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.120
I want to see if you actually did that if you actually

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:14.920
It's a Dan Harmon's first feature film and then you get there and you literally just go action. No, no, no, no

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:23.640
And then all of it all it is is just like an experiment to see what the actors do when you just make fart noises at them

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.880
it's gonna

01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.880
To be like a crisp and Glover movie

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:34.440
No, it'd be really good. You should be directing you you should have been directing a long time ago

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:41.400
But you you don't want to I've got a perfect writing first like why would you direct until you knew how to write?

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.680
Like it doesn't make any sense like I was like it's a fucking it's hard to write already and then either was like

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:51.000
Oh, I should I should add directing to this. So we'll finish writing this and then I'll fucking blow

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:55.720
Sorry, uh, keep you guys keep writing it. I'm gonna go shoot what we do

01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:01.080
It's already bad because I can't finish making it good. So are there no are there no directors that you like?

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.160
You know, I really like Justin Lin

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.800
He's he's he's he's pretty good

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.240

Good luck with that.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.960
Good luck with that.

01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.960
It's super easy.

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:19.960
It's so easy.

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.960
Good luck.

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.960
It's super easy.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.960
Good luck.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.960
And that's how Ciso was born.

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.960
We'll probably cut that out from the ashes of Yahoo.

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:36.960
Ciso.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.960
Don't yaw.

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:38.960
See.

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.960
Who?

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960
So.

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.960
That's who.

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960
Yes.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:43.960
Ciso.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.960
Slee Stack.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.960
You guys on Slee Stack, $3.99 a month.

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.960
All the land of the lost you can get.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:52.960
Wait.

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:53.960
Plus Garth Merengue's Dark Place.

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.960
Faulty Tower.

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.960
A new stand-up special by Aziz.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:02.960
Are you saying I can get all the Slee Stacks I want for $3.99 a month?

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:03.960
Yeah.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.960
Plus Aziz in Aziz Stack.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:13.960
Imagine the Pasa Azizates.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.960
What's going on with Slee Stacks?

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.960
Did you hear that Aziz just launched Azizo?

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.960
Yes.

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.960
You Aziz it, so you zone.

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.960
I zone that.

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:26.960
All right.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:28.960
Everybody calm down.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.960
Hey, Dan, we tried our best.

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.960
We're all going to die.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.960
There's no way to monetize the Internet.

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.960
We're all going to die.

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.960
That was the singularity.

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.960
The Internet was the singularity.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960
It wasn't about intelligence.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:44.960
It was about economy.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.960
It was like the singularity is everything is free.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.960
And we're like, wait, how do I work?

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.960
And the Internet's like, you don't.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960
No.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960
That's the thing.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.960
Most comedians haven't been making comedy the past five years.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.960
They've been making content.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:08.960
Yeah, the comics listening back home will really dig that one.

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.960
Hey, Jonah, I really loved your last content special.

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.960
Thank you so much.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.960
You know, being a stand-up contentian.

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.960
All right, AIDS.

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.960
What good are they?

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.960
It's bad, so go to omaze.com.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.960
Marty, I think if it's still like so.

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:29.960
Maybe not mumble this part.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960
Well, I can't remember the web address.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:35.960
I think it's omaze.com slash Rick and Morty.

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.960
Just type in Dan Harmon and AIDS.

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.960
To scroll down past all the Chevy Chase voicemails.

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.960
And you'll come to a thing.

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.960
$10 every time you $10 gets you a chance at fucking, there's a thing.

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.960
And you could be a voice on Rick and Morty.

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:53.960
And you'll cure AIDS.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:54.960
That should be enough.

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.960
That should be enough.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.960
You selfish fucking AIDS lovers.

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.960
What's in it for me?

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.960
You can be in a cartoon.

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.960
It's like fucking AIDS will be running down the street.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.960
Unfettered.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.960
Are you going to make the winner appear as an anthropomorphic AIDS virus?

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.960
They were AIDS.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.960
The bitter irony.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.960
That would be a great bad guy, right?

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.960
It's supposed to be a villain, right?

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.960
I'm AIDS.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:24.960
Can I get you?

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.960
So we're probably not going to role play.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.960
You know, we do what we want here at Harmontown.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.960
You do you.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.960
Oh, that's what we always say is you do you at Harmontown.

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.960
I'm so glad that we're not in Florida anymore.

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.960
Jesus Christ.

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960
Wait, I missed that.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:46.960
I was doing another thing.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.960
There was a guy that came up.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.960
I was here.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.960
A guy punched a guy on stage.

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.960
And that was probably the best thing that happened.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960
I beg your pardon.

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.960
Yeah, it was it was Florida, man.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.960
Don't go there.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.960
Did we find out that was a stunt or an actual thing?

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.960
Oh, it was a stunt.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.960
Yeah.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.960
I mean, some people's friendships are stunts.

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.960
Yep.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.960
I say to the millions of people.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.960
Well, there weren't millions of people at that convention,

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.960
but these are the sweetest.

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:16.960
Millions.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.960
Most wonderful people in the world and all of them were really nice

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.960
and all of them are constantly apologizing for being from Florida,

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:23.960
which is not.

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:24.960
That's insane.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.960
They're from Wisconsin.

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:28.960
I was like, like, like, like that's not, it doesn't define you.

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.960
Like, like, like the Armenians in Miami are identical to the,

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.960
to the Angelino ones except for the two guys.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.960
Are you pretty proud of your home?

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.960
Are you pretty proud of your home state after making a murder?

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960
Yes.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960
Yes.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:41.960
Yeah.

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:42.960
An hour's drive from my house.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.960
It's crazy that there's a whole documentary and then you find out

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:51.960
like he really did it.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.960
It's like death of a salesman,

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.960
but it wasn't in the title.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.960
I was like, but it was because it's making a murderer.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.960
Yeah.

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:01.960
And you're like, oh, he's a murderer.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.960
The guy murdered that girl.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.960
Crazy.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.960
It's so nuts.

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.960
And then it was like, he didn't do it.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:08.960
And then you watched the whole thing.

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.960
You're like, he fucking did it.

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.960
See, I thought so too, but Rob disagrees.

01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:16.960
Rob thinks he didn't do it.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.960
He thinks a brother did it.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.960
I think one of his brothers.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.960
But why isn't that in the documentary?

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:21.960
That's racist.

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960
It wasn't about that.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.960
Well, first of all, well, there's a part of it.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.960
I didn't make the documentary as the documentarians,

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.960
but I think one of his brothers.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.960
Documentarians?

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.960
So you're defending a guy who burnt a cat to death?

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.960
No, I'm not defending him.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.960
Because if anyone burns a cat to death,

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:38.960
put him in jail for murder.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.960
I don't care.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:40.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.960
But a guy who wears Ugg boots wouldn't understand that.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.960
Sit down, Jonah.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.960
Sit down.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.960
Sorry.

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.960
Ugg boots make me so angry on lots of levels.

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.960
People aren't ready for your content right now.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:54.960
You're right.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.960
You're right.

01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.960
Your content is too real.

01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.960
I just can't.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.960
I'm glad that I feel like they front loaded that cat burning thing.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.960
So because I was watching the whole thing with my girlfriend

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.960
and like I kept like, like every roller coaster dip

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.960
where you were like, your heart would sink.

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.960
And I would just grab each other's hands and go,

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.960
he burnt a cat.

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:14.960
He burnt a cat.

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:15.960
Doesn't matter.

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:16.960
Now they downplay it.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.960
He did like, he doused it with like, I don't know, gas.

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:22.960
I just threw it on the fire.

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.960
No, no, no.

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.960
He did more than that.

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.960
He poured kerosene on top of the cat.

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:27.960
He threw it in the fire.

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.960
He did say that in the documentary.

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:30.960
They sure the fuck did it.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.960
It's a trick.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:32.960
Yeah.

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.960
If you research it, you find out he did much more of that.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:36.960
And I mean, it sucks.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.960
He should have definitely, he definitely needed to go to jail for that.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:41.960
Yeah.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.960
I mean, people that kill things should be in jail.

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960
Probably cause they'll kill things.

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.960
But especially cats though, because cats mind their own fucking business.

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.960
Even, even the shittiest cats in the world mind their own business.

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.960
Yeah.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:57.960
Like there's no such thing as a cat that like comes in your window and it's like, hey,

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:58.960
I'm a cat.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:43:59.960
I'm going to fuck with you.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:03.960
Like they, they might meow and say, feed me or pay attention to me, but no cat has ever

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.960
like made you, made their problem.

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.960
The only reason cats ever whine or meow or paw at you is because you have them trapped

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960
inside your house.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:17.960
Like everyone that's irritated by a cat is only because they're inside and you won't

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.960
let them out.

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.960
I don't think that's true.

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.960
I have a story about a cat.

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.960
Oh shit.

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.960
That's fine.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:26.960
Cause Molly brought the dog things.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.960
Are you an indoor cat person?

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.960
Cause cats shouldn't be let out because then they spread FIV and they get all fucked up

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:32.960
and eaten by coyotes.

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.960
I know your cat has that, but doesn't she?

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960
Yeah.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960
Well, that's gross.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:44.960
Go to omaze.com.

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:45.960
That's right.

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.960
Oh, that's all right.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:48.960
Well, I mean,

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.960
He's shamed my cat.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:52.960
That's crazy.

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.960
Episode title.

01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:02.960
What do you expect from a manic panic pixie dream girl?

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.960
But, but, but what's your position on cats?

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.960
Well, one time, well, I just have a story about a cat one time where I was sleeping in

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.960
a basement in the house that I was renting and the door, the window was open.

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:19.960
But it opened up into the ground floor and so I was sleeping and I heard this noise in

01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:25.960
my room and I thought it was a robber or a raccoon, which are both equally awful to

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.960
end up in your room in the dark.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.960
Like it's really scary.

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960
You don't have to mime.

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.960
All she knows is that it had a black mask over its eyes.

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.960
Yeah, but it was a black cat.

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:40.960
So I was pretty pissed.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:48.960
So what's the crux of that story is that cats are bad?

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.960
No, I'm just saying that it doesn't always mean that cats do one thing.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.960
They're not always indoor versus outdoor cats.

01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:56.960
Sometimes they're indoor.

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.960
Sometimes they're outdoor and they come indoor unexpectedly and they scare the shit out of you.

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:01.960
True.

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:02.960
That's very true.

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:03.960
We should keep that in mind.

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:04.960
Newsflash.

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.960
Here's the thing.

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960
Please be open-minded about it.

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.960
Newsflash.

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.960
Ladies and gentlemen, newsflash.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.960
Sometimes.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.960
It's the same with the fervor of the transgender movement.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.960
We need to fucking stop.

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.960
Why are you putting fucking indoor and outdoor on me?

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.960
I'm a fucking door cat.

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.960
If there's a door, I go in and I go out and I'm fucking sick of this shit.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.960
Center pajamas has the floor.

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.960
Gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel.

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.960
Are you an indoor cat?

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:41.960
I don't know.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:45.960
I'm fucking, how about an Instagram of me crying because you asked.

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:51.960
How about you fucking hurt me by asking and meow the fucker.

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960
Meow the fucker.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960
That tried too hard.

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.960
Meow the fucker.

01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:05.960
I feel bad for dogs that are pent up, but then the opposite applies.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:10.960
People tend to, culturally, we consider cats these things that you open the door and let

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.960
them out into the world.

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.960
But then we also talk about how that's inhumane because the cats go out and they shouldn't

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.960
that the cats should be indoors.

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.960
Something to think about.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.960
Here's the thing.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:25.960
People get their faces scratched by cats.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.960
Kids are bitten by cats.

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.960
And then everyone's like, that's just a cat.

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:33.960
When a dog barks at a kid from across the street, everyone's like, put it down.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:34.960
Yeah, they kill it.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:35.960
Kill the dog.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:36.960
It's ridiculous.

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:37.960
People are too nice to cats.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:38.960
Oh, come on.

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960
I agree.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:40.960
I agree.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:41.960
Wait a minute.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.960
That's why the guy felt comfortable burning the cat alive, this anti-cat stigma.

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.960
That's why I think he didn't kill the girl.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.960
If a cat scratches somebody, it's because if somebody got in a cat's face, if a dog bites

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:57.960
somebody, well, first of all, a dog can snap a two by four in half with its jaws descended

01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:58.960
from wolves.

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.960
Cats are fucking descended from Egyptian cats.

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:01.960
No.

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.960
They can't do shit but sit in your lap.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.960
Egyptian cats, Egyptians put a lot of people into slavery.

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:10.960
That's way worse than biting a two by four.

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:15.960
The cat, the cat's not, doesn't own the Egyptian sin.

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960
They fucking made statues of them.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:18.960
They praised them.

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.960
The cats didn't make the statues.

01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.960
How do you know we weren't around?

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960
Interesting.

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.960
Tune in to Jonah Ray's...

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.960
These questions answered in more on Hidden America.

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.960
Jonah Ray's running for Ben Carson's vice president.

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:36.960
All right.

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.960
How do we close the show?

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:39.960
In song, fucker.

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:40.960
No.

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.960
We've tried that.

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.960
Yeah, the last one did real good.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.960
That was great.

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.960
It was a real good one.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960
Thanks, guys.

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:52.960
I mean like a song, we are the world kind of celebrity kind of thing.

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.960
You all pick a celebrity character that you want to be in.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:03.960
We do like an awareness raising, fundraising kind of thing.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:04.960
Hands across America.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:05.960
That's fun.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:06.960
Farm-aid kind of shit.

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.960
Are you literally lifting something from whose line?

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960
Is it anyway?

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:12.960
Yes.

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.960
Okay.

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:14.960
Oh.

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:15.960
Oh.

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960
No.

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:22.960
I've been moved by the spirit right now of what's going on.

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.960
But that does sound like a whose line game.

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:25.960
Is that a whose line game?

01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:26.960
No, it's not.

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.960
Your voice is real high.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:32.960
Last night, on taping a whose line, me and Wayne Brady and Joey Fatone from NSYNC

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.960
sing a boy band song to a dude.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.960
It was pretty good.

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:38.960
But is there a whose...

01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.960
There's not a whose line game where it's like USA for Africa.

01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.960
No, there's not.

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.960
And there's different celebrities and then Wayne Brady does the clumps.

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:47.960
No.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.960
Okay.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:49.960
Now that's funny.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:53.960
That's some content I want to see.

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:59.960
You know, you'd be pleased to know I just signed him for eight mobasodes.

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.960
Can I get it on my razor phone?

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:04.960
Wait for that.

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:05.960
No, okay.

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.960
In Seattle and Argentina.

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:08.960
Yes.

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:10.960
Just one specific state?

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:12.960
Very specifically shaped geofence.

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.960
Yeah.

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960
It's shaped like a fucking dragon's tail.

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:19.960
Is there a part of the Pacific Ocean that I can get to that maybe I can catch it?

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:27.960
Everyone, if you're in Canada and you exist in a swath of land that AT&T is about to invade,

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.960
you can watch three episodes of Money Python.

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:32.960
Yeah.

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.960
It's the biggest hit in midway.

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.960
Boy, that geofencing.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.960
That's good.

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.960
Boy.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.960
Yeah, geofencing, man.

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:42.960
All right.

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:43.960
Shit.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.960
Well, do we have a track that we could do?

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:52.960
I got to change my bags.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.960
What did you do to your bag?

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:54.960
We're ending the show.

01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:55.960
We're trying to end the show.

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.960
You can go ahead and end the show.

01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:58.960
I'm going to go change it.

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:03.960
You're part of the ending, you fucking asshole.

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:04.960
No, no, no.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:06.960
I got to change my bags.

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.960
I'm not doing it.

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:09.960
Okay.

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:14.960
And what's the cause?

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.960
Outdoor dogs, indoor cats.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.960
So we're benefiting both of them?

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:21.960
I don't know.

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:22.960
Let's just pick something we're benefiting.

01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.960
All right.

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:24.960
What?

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.960
Butts on butts.

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:26.960
Butts, fucking butts?

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.960
Self fucking butts?

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:32.960
Bag flip?

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.960
Bag feet.

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:34.960
Okay, bag feet.

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.960
There's people out there with bags on their feet.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:38.960
Yeah.

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:39.960
Let's benefit them.

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:40.960
Yeah.

01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.960
Because they complain and we feel terrible for them.

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.960
Yeah.

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.960
Right.

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.960
Yeah.

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:49.960
Oh, yeah.

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:50.960
Gaville, gaville.

01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:57.960
Hope you're all enjoying your eucalyptus soup.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:58.960
And your Lexus.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:59.960
Yeah.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.960
Yo.

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.960
Yeah.

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:02.960
Peep this.

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:05.960
Put that in your eucalyptus soup for one minute while Dan breaks it down.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.960
Right now, there's people out there.

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.960
You know what I'm saying?

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.960
They don't have eucalyptus soup.

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960
Yeah.

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.960
They're too busy focusing on what's on their feet to the street.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.960
Yeah.

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.960
Yo.

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.960
Oh, wait, but it's not a rap, though.

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.960
It's a song, isn't it?

01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:24.960
There's a time for everyone to get together.

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:30.960
Every bird has some fun, but also has another bird with a feather.

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:34.960
And when you look down at the thing that should cover your feet,

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:36.960
you don't want to see bags.

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.960
But some people see bags.

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:42.960
Bags on the feet, because we are the people.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.960
Hello, I'm Mr. Jones.

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:47.960
Dibble, dibble, dibble, dibble.

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.960
Dibble, dibble, dibble.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:51.960
Get the fuck out of here.

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.960
Dibble, dibble, dibble.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:56.960
We belong to each other.

01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:59.960
Every sister, every uncle and brother.

01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.960
Brother.

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.960
That rhyme was predictable.

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.960
But this next one is delectable.

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:07.960
Yeah, that's impressive.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.960
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.960
I wrote a missing picture.

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.960
Like an old, timey letter writer.

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:18.960
Fuck your mama so hard that her pussy got tighter.

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:20.960
Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:21.960
What?

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:23.960
Rob Schwab.

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:31.960
Molly, the age cat shamer.

01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:33.960
Spencer Crittenden.

01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:35.960
Jonah Ray.

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.960
I'm Jeff Davis.

01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:40.960
You're mayor once again, Mr. Dan Harmon.

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:48.960
Dibble, dibble, dibble, dibble.

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:49.960
Get out of here.

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:51.960
You're not a real artist.

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:52.960
You just make tones.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.960
You don't control Mr. Jones.

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:57.960
Mr. Jones makes his own tones.

01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:00.960
I also invented cell phones.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.960
And ring tones.

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.960
Drive fast, take chances.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.960
Thank you so much.

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.960
Did you get any of that?

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:31.960
It's a good show.
