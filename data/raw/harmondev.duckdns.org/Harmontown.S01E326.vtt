WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, shall we?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Harmontown is now in session.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Let's also bring out Brandon Johnson.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Brandon Johnson to...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
And just for good measure at Harmontown,

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown,

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
the prime of town, Dan Harmon.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
You rocked into the beat, going downstairs,

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
saw your momma, said, hey, here, here, here.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
I got excited, but then I got,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
and then I got just, something happened.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I don't know, I got terrified.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I didn't want to rap all of a sudden, like really fast.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Like I went from wanting to rap really bad

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
to not wanting to rap really fast.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Because you didn't feel the flow?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, I think the flow got a little clogged,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
and then I just panicked.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
How do we unclog that flow?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Like, I mean, I'm being for real right now.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
A hot towel.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Is there a flow, a hot towel?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Yeah.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Welcome back, Spencer.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Thanks, man.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Spencer is back.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh, I got a couch.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I see you've accepted my demands for one couch,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
and one pointed polished pyramid.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, we don't, we typically don't air

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
our contract renegotiations here at Harmontown,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
you know, the grievances, and we keep a line there.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Everything else is transparency and stuff,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
but it is rough.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
His contract was up, you know,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
and it was like, I should have never signed you

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
to a one plus one.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, it was weird, because like I wanted to agree,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
but like the Spencer's Guild was like, no.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
It's got its own guild.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
At the authorized to strike.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
How are the Spencer's Guild and producer guild negotiations going?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
It's hard to tell who's talking about anything.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Right.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Like what stance anyone's taking.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Because you're also a producer.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm on both sides of the table,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
and like it's hard.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
So it's always in my own benefit.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
How's Harmon Quest?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Oh, it's so good.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I know.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
I don't know.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Sometimes I'm getting real mad,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
and then I'm like, this is bad.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
It's the best job in the world.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
It's like you should be getting mad.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
What are you getting mad at?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Just like at the boards, all these boards.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm like, oh, just like things that need to be.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah, it's just yeah, but it's so fun.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Holy shit.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I mean, you talked about it in the last episode.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I heard I was like, hell yeah.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
He's lying about the show.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
And you know, Cody, like, not only has never seen it before,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
but she's watching an animatic.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
She's watching a thing with her fiance's ex-wife in it.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Not that she doesn't have any pettiness there,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
but I'm just saying like, there's a lot of English on that ball.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
It's not predisposed to like it.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
But she was like, and she's never seen the first season.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
So all of these things, she was like, oh my god,

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
that's so great.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
She was like really into it.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Like I understood all the jokes.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't care about no D&D, but it was like Aaron's really funny

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
and everything's like working really good.

03:26.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah, the only thing is I just like, I'm not going to like

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
obsess over it.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
But I just, I can't believe the lethargy on my face

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
like in the beginning.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
It's like crazy.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
The first season, I guess because we're like, oh, how do we do it?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So then we did like a bunch of takes where I was like,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
John Oliver, oh, it's Harmon Quest.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
You know, like, which you do need to do because the camera takes away

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
10 pounds of energy.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
So this time around, like I...

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Which energy is really light in the first place.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I just remember being like, oh, I'm real chill.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
It's like, it's just Harmon Quest.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
It's like, let's just have some fun.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And I'm watching, I'm like, am I blind?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I look like I'm blind.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
That's true.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, you're not like looking at any single thing.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
And it's really off-putting.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
So here's the thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, it is. Everyone hated it.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Like, I wish somebody would have hit me with a stick and said,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
we're doing another take.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
You gotta...

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
But here's the thing about those cameras.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Like, it's one thing to, you know, if you have stage fright versus like,

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
oh, I'm comfortable.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
People looking at me, I'll be fine.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
And then there's another layer where you do like a single camera work

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
or it's like, okay, there's a camera over here or right here or whatever,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
but it's one camera and my job is to ignore it.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
My job is to focus on the cookies because my character...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Right, you can never look at it.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
And then there's this, that live four cam thing where...

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, your solo camera, the tally light comes on in your camera too.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
That's your camera.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
But it's not even like, because we're not doing it live,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
so it's not even like the red light comes on.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
It's more like the director says to you, hey, Dan,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
when you're gonna look at the camera, that's your camera

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
and points at one of the cameras.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
And so the thing that freaks me out is I go,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
okay, so I know it's not live.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
They're not editing in board.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
So it's sort of like, it puts it in my head that it's like,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I have control over whether it cuts to me.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
And so then I'm like, well,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm never gonna make the decision for it to cut to me.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
So then I'm like staring at a table.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, that's how I feel.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
It's just a weird thing.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It doesn't matter how talented a performer

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
or how comfortable in your own skin you might be.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
It's a totally different talent, I think, section,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
the idea of not being thrown by this idea.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
On whose line, there's tally lights where the red light comes on.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
They're just doing it like in a fake live edit.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
And then seven or eight cameras are all rolling at the same time.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
So they're all good to go.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
No matter where you're looking, that camera is rolling.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
But on Harmon Quest, there's no tally light.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
The red light doesn't come on and says,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
this is the one that's on you right now.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But you can take a camera take to any camera at any time,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and that can be in the edit.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You can also get the fuck out of there the same way.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
So if you know that a camera is covering you,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
that you don't particularly agree with the take on,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
you can throw the take.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Thus, rendering the camera that's on you,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
this take is gonna suck,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
because I fucked up the line straight to camera.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, but all this is showmanship you guys are talking about.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
That's the membrane I'm talking about.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Spencer and I are over here on this side of like,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
the top of our game is like,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I'm the world's most comfortable nerd.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
I'm no longer going to vomit by being in front of people

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
or even a camera.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But then on the other side of that line is just like,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
oh, while you're playing make believes ease,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
you're also like, boy, Karen's hogging the spotlight tonight.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
There's calculations going on,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
and I was never good at the long form improv,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
because I was just a bad listener.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I would just be like,

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I just sort of start thinking about like,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
oh, I should come in as a crab or something.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
And then I'm like, I'm writing a crab thing in my head

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
that other people are gonna fuck up when I come in,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
because it's the improv you moron.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And for the 30 seconds that I'm sitting there going like,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
oh, the crab's gonna come in.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
This is what I'm gonna do.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
There's things I'm supposed to be listening to.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
For me, like Harmon Quest, I take copious notes

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
and I'm writing things down,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
because I want to remember the name of the thing

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
that Spencer said, the name of the town.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
All the names.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
But then while you're...

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Spencer's laying down all this detail,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
and I'm writing that down,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
but while it's happening,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
something improv is happening,

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
and I'm not listening to that.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
So I've got the detail,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
but not the moment that just happened.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So it's a hard line to walk.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, baby.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, let's refine some of our chops tonight.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
We could do some drills.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
All right.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
All right.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Why don't we just play some good old-fashioned D&D

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
with Spencer right now?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Oh, shit.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Is that what you meant, Dan?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
The audience wasn't that enthused.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Oh, God.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I didn't mean like that.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
And the crowd goes...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm trying to get to know you guys.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
What did you mean precisely, Dan?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I was just high.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
You wanted to sit.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
He goes, get it.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I was just going like,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
well, let's do some dumb improv bits.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
All right.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
No, let's do dumb improv,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
but let's walk the line

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
between thinking ahead

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
and being in the moment.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, I'm not going to...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'm only going to be in the moment.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
You're only in the moment.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You're not going to think about the crab character

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
that's going to come in later on.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
All right.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So Spencer, be Dungeon Master for us

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
and give us like a scene on us.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
All right.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Can I get a suggestion?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
A spaceship.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
You're on a spaceship.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Okay.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Snip, snip.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm a crab.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
No.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I hope no one's to the left,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
the direction I move.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Well...

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Captain Friend-Tester,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
why did you let your crab out of the tank?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
You know that it's against...

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Academy regulations to leave

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
wild animals on the spaceship.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
The Academy had it their way.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
This ship would be made of regulations.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
As far as whether Herman

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
is allowed to roam the cabin,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I think he's been on a few more missions

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
than you, Nurse Falco.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
But away he goes.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Oh, damn.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Crab alert.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Crab alert.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Crab alert.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
There's a crab alert installed on the ship.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Destroying crab.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
No!

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
No!

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Herman destroyed.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
You don't remember last week when you asked me

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
to put in that crab software?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Because you told me you need all these lasers

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
and some of these drinks to be poured on crabs.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Marcus, what are you...

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm talking to you over the telescreen, right?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
You just...

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Aye, Captain.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Aye.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
You're down in the mechanic bay.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
That's where I smoke weed.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
You can do just about anything with those computer tools.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Can't you, Marcus?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Oh, man.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Dental hygiene.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Air conditioning.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
I can tune up a cat.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Anyway, going back to what you were doing,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
I just wanted to know, was it successful?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Was my crab thing like a convention?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Was it good?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Do you like it?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes, it killed my crab.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Awesome.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm distraught.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I better...

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm gonna come down and see you, Marcus.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Oh, man.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I gotta clean this place up first.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Hey, please, come down, Captain, please.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Over and out.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Nurse Falco.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yes?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Uh, I'm gonna find it hard to believe

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
you didn't know that was gonna happen.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
I tend to know exactly what's going on aboard the ship.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
It is my job as the spaceship nurse.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
Well, I have a little bit of a scrape

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
on one of my fingers.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Okay.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Let me attend to that.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh, oh, oh.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
It's my middle one.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Your middle finger.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm holding up my middle one.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Are you being ironic, or are you just telling me to fuck off?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Man the helm, Falco.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm going to talk to Marcus.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Falco.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Falco, pick up.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Falco, it's Marcus.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Pick up.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Falco.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Falco.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yes?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Look, Captain's on his way down,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
and I'm not gonna be able to see you tonight.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Okay.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
So, look.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Listen, as far as he's concerned,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
we've never met, we don't ever,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
we don't ever have anything going on.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Okay.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I just, I was gonna, you know,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I was gonna put the good shoes on,

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
just so you know.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
All right.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Okay.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
There you go.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I'll call you back.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Jesus, it smells like a skunk down here.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Boy, you can take the city out of the astronaut.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Or wait, you can't.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You can't.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
You can take the astronaut out of the city.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's what you can do.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And what we did do.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
What we failed to realize we could never do

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
was remove the city from your bones.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
You urban magical.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
Whoa.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Look, just sit down, man.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
All right.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I'm glad you're here, Captain.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
You know, I don't really get a lot of time,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
you know, chance to spend with the higher up.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
So I'm glad you came down.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Did I offend you?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
No, no, no, no.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
You want a couple of noodles?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Well, I'll tell you the truth.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Wouldn't mind a little of that sticky wiki

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
that I'm smelling everywhere.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I have no idea what you're talking about,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
officer, but it's right here.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Uh-huh.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
Do you have to press the button five times or what?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
You can shake it back and forth

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
just to make the setting for yourself if you want.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Right?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Smells like Cheetos.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Fuck.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I probably got too high.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Meh.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Meh.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Meh.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
That's a signal three.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Uh, Captain Frantaster, we have an incoming message

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
from your arch enemy, Diablos.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Put the weapons on standby.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Charge the shields.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I'll be right up.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Okay.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Oh, fuck.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Shields charged.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, I can't see.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Is anyone there?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Johnson, are they on?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Oh, wait.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
It's me, Diablos.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Surrender your spaceship.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
No.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Yes.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Johnson, I can't see.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I'm sorry, man.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Let me raise up the hailing shields.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
No, no.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
What?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
No.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Oh, God.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
What?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Put those back down.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Why can't you see?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Those are shields.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Yes, but you want to be able to see, right?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Okay.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Putting on vision mode.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
What?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Vision mode enhanced.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Marcus, you have to be the captain.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm too high.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Where my hat?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
No, no.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Just do it.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Just do it.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I'll tell everyone.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I'll tell everyone you got me high.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Okay.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Okay.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Snark ass, snitch ass, snark.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
All right.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Shields up.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
We need to get ready for evasive procedures.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Captain Diablos, it is I.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Captain, what exactly do you want from us?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Space ship.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
What?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
I want it.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Okay.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Hold on for a second.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I got you.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Hold on for a second.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
What do you say?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
He want the space ship.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Do it's a whole thing.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
We're in it.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Sorry.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I'm nurse Falco.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I think that we shouldn't put the shields up.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
We should put the shields back down too.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Like he just did.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
I think we should.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
There should be a shields down situation.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Are they on when they're up or down?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
I thought down was up yet.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Well, what shields down?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
You're the captain Marcus.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
God damn it.

15:59.000 --> 16:05.000
I leave the shields halfway up halfway down so we can peer over them and see the enemy Diablo.

16:05.000 --> 16:12.000
Do you think the vernacular of the shield technicians is more rooted in the handheld

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
shields being raised for infantry or the old Haggar the horrible thing coming down over

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
the head?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I think it's like an engineering thing like cuts the lights.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Or is it does it come down like up and down together?

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
What are the states of the shield that are available?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
We have shields.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
We have weapon shields and we have vision shields that you see through a through a shield.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
It's not a perfect system.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It looks like their shields are down.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I could see the button.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Maybe we should just fire on them.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Fire Diablo.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Shields up.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh fuck.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Oh, we're hit.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
God damn it.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
And I was looking at these cheetos.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
All right.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Look, we've been hit under my leadership, which is some bullshit.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
By the way, thank you fucking the worst time to make me captain Diablo.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
There are two ships.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
There are two ships.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh shit.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
That's right.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
And this one is injured.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
So you will have our other ship.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
That sounds perfect.

17:16.000 --> 17:25.000
Now let us pass and get to safety so we can tell you about that other ship.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
All right.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I'll do that.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
And then I'll monologue.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Excellent.

17:29.000 --> 17:43.000
I became Diablos 2000 years ago at the peaks of Mount Olympus on earth dot dot dot.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh no.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
Oh, he's in the background now.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
He put himself on the background.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
He became so engaged.

17:54.000 --> 18:00.000
The baby captain look next to you.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Oh red bull.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Drink it.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Okay.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Drink the red bull captain.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
I just don't think.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I mean it's not like I'm gonna drink the red bull.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
It gives me heartburn.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
It'll make you come back.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Okay.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
We need your sage leadership.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I tried to lead the ship, but I was too high.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
You did great.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
You got rid of the guy.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
What are you talking about?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
They blew the West Wing off.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
They did and I cried.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Anyway, get back upstairs and show us why you're the captain captain.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Okay.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Then I went back in there and I said I'd like my job back.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Nurse Falco, I'm back from the mechanic.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Diablos monologue completed.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Lower all shields.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I knew it.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Lower all shields.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Captain that puts us in a very vulnerable situation.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Does it?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Yes.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
That's how ships work.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
All shields lowered.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Diablos.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
As you can see, we are quite vulnerable over here.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Right.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
We have no other ship to give you.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
What?

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Why was I just monologuing all this time?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Because you're a fool.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
A damned fool.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
No.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
No.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You floated over to a section of space.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
What?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Called the fantabulan zone.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
But that would mean that I'm getting fantabulous.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
If you thrust your engines, your entire ship will explode from the chain reaction,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
from the anti-dark matter.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
No one tells Diablos how to fly.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
No.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Boom.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
What really happened?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It actually happened.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Captain Francesca, I can't believe that worked.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
He really fell for that hook line and sinker.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I mean, it kind of didn't work because I was bluffing.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
So my bluff failed miserably because it turns out he was actually in the anti-matter space

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
and really blew up.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I thought you knew that.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
That was your plot.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
No, I was making it up.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Couldn't tell.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Snap, snap.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
I'm a ghost.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Oh, no.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
It's Diablos's ghost.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Diablos's ghost.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
No, it's the crab.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
Marcus.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yes.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
I'm a crab.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh, he came back as a crab.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
All right.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
That felt like it.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yay.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Everyone loves us.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Dan, you were very in the moment there.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
I spent more time listening than usual.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
I usually don't listen as much as I was.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Because you were what?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
You're thinking about the next 10 seconds ahead.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Yeah.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah, I tried not to do that this time.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Happy?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, very, very happy.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
We had a good time.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
I had a good time.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Are you happy Spencer is back with us?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Yeah.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, everyone loves it.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
I had to come back because you said you could do the show without me.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
So I was like, oh, OK.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, explain yourself now.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Were you just busy?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
You said you were bummed out at one point.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah, I've been depressed.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I've been not feeling great.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
I also, I talked about this a little bit, but I have a hip thing.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
This couch is great, actually, but it had been not great to sit for a long time and,

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
you know, to drive and then sit and then drive and then also just all snowballs.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I don't do things for one reason.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I do them for 30.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
But yeah, no, I don't know.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
It was just, yeah.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
How are you feeling now?

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Oh, yeah, I resigned to my life.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
No, I'm kidding.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Are you still in pain?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
No, but this couch is actually really nice.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I think I'm going to get surgery.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
It'll be great.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
People love it.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Oh boy.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
I hope my leg doesn't fall out.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I feel if I was sitting in that position, I would, my back would start to get sore.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I, my back could take it.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
It's doing a lot of work lately.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
You know, when your body's messed up, the rest of your body gets messed up trying to help.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Brandon, do you have back pain or anything like that?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
No, not yet.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
That's great.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Have you guys been to Lumbar in Silver Lake?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Oh, yeah.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Oh, Lumbar.

22:34.000 --> 22:40.000
Well, you get, you get a, I like the synovial fluid teeny.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
It's great.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It's a, yeah, it's, it's part of a new fad.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
It's like a ergonomic cocktail culture.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Do you, does it have things like anis root in it and like it's very healthy?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
It's sort of there.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
They're like mind drugs because they're all natural elixirs.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Is that the sort of situation?

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
No, it's just the furniture is designed by like chiropractors and then the drinks are

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
normal pretty much.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
They have dumb names like.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Like the Lumbargarita.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Nice.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
The list goes on and on.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
The thoracic.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
Actually, a lot of their drinks are just named like S1, S2, S3, S4.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Well, chiropractor.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Yeah.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
What the hell are they doing back there?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm sure your chiropractors are different.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
All of them are voodoo people.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
They, but the weird thing is like which, what, how much voodoo did they get from the latest

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
chiropractor convention where it's like high tech voodoo and then how many of them are

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
like DIY voodoo and they're like, which like you, you, you mentioned a guy who was like.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Oh yeah.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
My parents used to go to a chiropractor who thought like he could tell if you had allergies

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
or something.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And what he did is he had a little pack, like a suitcase lily thing that you open up and

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
had all these little vials of I think, what do you call it?

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Like homeopathic water that was charged with essences or whatever the fuck.

24:01.000 --> 24:08.000
And so presumably these vials had allergens in them and he would hold the allergen near

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
you and then he would do this with his fingers.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Like you're, you're doing like a, give me some change kind of hand sign with your fingers

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
and he would say that he was tracking the resistance on his fingers because when you

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
would sweat his hands would cause resistance in his hands.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
So if the, the allergen was, was close to you and you were allergic, it would make him

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
sweat more, which meant you were allergic.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
This sounds like the first act of Wizard of Oz.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Oh, it is.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
And then the tornado came.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
It's, it's all the, and the high tech stuff is just that, except it's like plastic crap

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
that they bought at a booth number.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
So it's like, like, like my guy would like scan my back with a thing that was like basically

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
like it looked like a handheld paper scanner.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Yeah.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
And I was like, and you would hear, and he would like press a foot pedal and a voice

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
would go, as one, as two, as three.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And he was like, like, measuring.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
And then he'd like, it's all, it's all like muscle tension and sweat and stuff.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And they go, you put your fingers in here.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
It's all.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That sounds fucking.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Scientologists use.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
That sounds dumb.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That sounds dumb.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It is dumb.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh yeah.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
It's incredibly dumb.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't think it's real.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I don't think it's accredited science or anything.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
You know, I think they're just like, hey, let's I put a bunch of wires in a box.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
I went, I absolutely screwed my back playing terrible golf in Florida once and I couldn't

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
even lift up a pencil off the table without like, like weeping and pain.

25:39.000 --> 25:46.000
And I went to a cat that a church has gone to and he just like instantly fixed me like

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
he's a bad motherfucker.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah, I'll tell you what these guys are good at relieving back pain.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Well, there there are.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
They're they're bad at being content with that station.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
So like physiotherapy, there are real things.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
And so I assume all chiropractors have like cobbled together collections of real and

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
fake tools.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
They're just they're just some of them work.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
They're they're like, God damn it.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
They're like, Siri, how often does the average American want their back cracked?

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
I'm looking that up at six months to three years.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
God damn it.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I'm going to go broke in this motherfucker.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
And then they so then they just have to put up posters.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
It's like Siri.

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
Can you say s one flu s two flu seasons coming and remember all immunodeficiencies

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
originate in the spinal column like that?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
You know, it's just like this whole culture.

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
It's every everything that a chiropractor can possibly do that will that the AMA won't

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
like find them for it.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
I don't I know not of what I speak of how that works, but I don't know if it works

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
like fines or if they just jump in your window.

26:53.000 --> 27:01.000
Like I remember this the Simpsons, the chiropractor guild like coming over and trashing his trash

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
can and then he hits the garage door closes and then they because they're chiropractors

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
they bend back or it's and keep running out the garage.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
So great.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Just peak Simpsons.

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
Anyways, boy, what a joyful that's not like like what a what a great time to be in a

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
writer's room that must have been like this is like like like Homer Homer is a dented trash

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
can and it turns out to be like a chiropractic miracle like people are coming over to get

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
your bags crack.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
That's such a crazy like just episode.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
It's so satisfying.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
What season was that like?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I don't know.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't know.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
I didn't really start watching the Simpsons until I moved to LA in syndication.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
I would watch the Simpsons and X files back to back.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
And then I found some navel lint the other day.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
What is this show?

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
Well, no one's no one's waiting for me to bring out a parrot.

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
I've been doing a lot of composing in a garage band fucking poop song on Instagram.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah, your Saturday Sunday pooping song was pretty good.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
That's pretty good, man.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I just threw that one away.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Okay, Kenny Loggins.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Don't brag too much.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
But I have like I have a couple of garage band compositions that aren't there.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
They're too soulful to be funny.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
So I just listened to him on a loop.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Can we can we hear one?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
We should laugh at those.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Yes.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
We'll be the judge of whether or not I live right near you.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I can come over and do backup harmonies.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Now don't make fun of me.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I mean, I guess on one hand it's like, okay.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
The reason why I like doing music is because I'm not supposed to be good at it.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
So I can relax and just put myself into it.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
But I'm getting to a stage now where I'm going to get my feelings heard if people make fun of me.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
That's like when Vin Diesel does his kind of like karaoke videos.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
He's like everyone's loving it, but we can't tell him what we think.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I don't know anything about that.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Well, it's easy.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
He's a delight.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Vin Diesel like sings.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And he's tender about his.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
He's loving it.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh, he's loving it.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
He's loving it.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
But is he good or is he terrible?

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
No, he's not.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
But as far as he's concerned, he's rocking it out.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Right.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Who's going to tell him that?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
That's why I like karaoke.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
I go into karaoke.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It's a good thing.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
It's a place in Nashville, Tennessee with Chip, and it's called Santa's Pub.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
And it's a Christmas decorated double wide trailer.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
As far as I remember, in the middle of fucking nowhere.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
It's like a perfect place to get a divorce.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
It's beer only and you cannot bring your drink up on stage.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
And there's a sign that says no swearing on stage, no cursing on stage.

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
And after I sang my second or third song, I believe I brought the house down.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Or the trailer down.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
And I went, I fucking love this place.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
No swearing on stage, man.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But he wasn't being a jerk about it.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
It was the greatest place.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
It was the most like Tennessee shit I've ever seen.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
It was so good.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Okay.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Here's one of my songs.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
We got mics on this.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Oh, yeah.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Oh, great strings.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
I rub the screen myself for the strings.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
A little bit of lunacy.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Good.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Sounds like somebody just scored another Alan Ball movie, huh?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
That's great.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
It's good.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
It's great.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, now, I'm not making fun of you here.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Are you playing keys on it?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Like you're actually putting down the...

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Not in real time, because I wouldn't know how to play.

31:15.000 --> 31:24.000
But I, like, no, there's like various apps that let you like map out melodies in a...

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I found this really cool app that...

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
You're playing chordal stuff in there too.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
There's a couple of clams in there.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
There's a couple of notes that go over there.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It's a combination of apps.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Now, let's play it again and let's put some words to that.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Let's...

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Do you want to sing a song of that, Dan?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Because you know the movement.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Or do you want to do it, Brandon?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
No, no, no, we're good.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
I wonder if there's...

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Should we pick from two?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
Because it's, you know...

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Wait, but real quick.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Did you say oof in the beginning when that first, like, sour note happened?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Because that sour note was part of my style.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Yeah.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
It was like a...

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Yeah, you're Tom Waits.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
The piano's been drinking.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
You're fucking out there, yeah.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
I like that sound.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
I was like, it's like a simple plan score.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
All right.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Do you have...

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Do you want to hear more?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh, the cats in trouble.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
How many more do you have?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
What?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Oh, I have one more.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Let's hear both.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
I think that now we start putting the book to those musics.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Okay.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
No lyrics for this one either, but yeah, but...

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah, but...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Here we go.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
This one's more delightful.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
This is like some forest gun shit.

32:47.000 --> 32:58.000
Oh, my baby ducks are in a fucking roll.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh, my baby ducks.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Oh, my baby ducks.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Okay.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Baby ducks.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Who knew?

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
Who knew that you had all that joy inside you?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That's all from scratch.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
It's fucking great.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
None of that is like, oh, you hit this button and it gives you like a thing.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
That's like all from scratch.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
You don't want to play piano.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
How does the app work?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Were you making chords?

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
You just poke the screen at the spot where you wanted.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
It's different from playing piano.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
You just put a note in a grid.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
And then it gives you the little fill-in notes in the past notes.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
No.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Don't say that.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
I don't know.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm asking you.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Well, no.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm just saying, like, there's no...

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
On that, there's no...

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
All those chords are...

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
That's all from scratch.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
You did all that.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
And a MIDI.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Now, let's go back to the first one.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Including the guitar.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Like, I'm playing a MIDI...

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I'm playing an iPad guitar in there.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
The first one to me is the more...

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
The first one to me is the more interesting musically one.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Like, it's got that kind of weird...

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
That's my favorite one, too.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
It's got strings and it's got that weird kind of out there kind of quality.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
And it sounds a little like maybe it would...

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
The second one is like, it's going straight to like aviation museums like tour video.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
I mean, I flatter myself.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
But, like, that it would be used professionally.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
But I'm saying, like, it's not...

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
It's not a...

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Nobody...

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
The B-16 was the...

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Nobody started crying during the second one.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
But during the first one, if you listened to it a bunch and if you made it,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I think you have to have made it.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
All right.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Now, play the second one.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
But I want you to do voiceover at the Aviation Museum,

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
even though you probably don't know a whole lot about aviation.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
Wait, oh, you want the second one played again with that?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Okay.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Yeah.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
So, like, we're walking under the tour of the Vintage Aviation Museum,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
and this is the music, and then you're doing voiceover.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
Welcome aboard.

34:56.000 --> 35:06.000
Whether you got here by car, boat, foot, or our preferred mode of travel,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
you just found a second home.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
For the next three hours,

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
the blinking lights on the floor will lead you through a labyrinth of educational

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
and sometimes amusing exhibits.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah!

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
We love exhibits.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
Morgan Freeman, what are you doing here?

35:32.000 --> 35:42.000
Our lawyers require us to tell you that there are no such thing as ghosts.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
If you see a pilot with unfinished business,

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
he's probably a rapist.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Exhibit one.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Kitty Hawk, 1911.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
If you were getting pasta in Nebraska in 1911,

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
you probably weren't thinking about Orville and Wilbur Wright.

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
Even though their father was the Pesto King of Nebraska, I think I said,

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
those two boys had their eyes on a bigger prize.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Hey, excuse me.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
Oh, is this a tour or a fossil?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
Proppy, get out of here.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I'm trying to give the tour.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
You need to blow away.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I'll be back in exhibit three.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Proppy, behave yourself.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Hi, folks.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
We're going to take a different form of the tour.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
I'm changing the blinking lights to proppy color.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
Don't follow the same old tour.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
You're going to follow mine.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
You're going to have fun.

36:58.000 --> 37:06.000
Pizza, rock and roll, aviation history.

37:06.000 --> 37:13.000
Pregnant women should follow the emergency exit

37:13.000 --> 37:19.000
in an emergency along with non-pregnant women and men.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Sorry, my wife is currently pregnant,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
and I, at the time of recording this,

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
you're hearing it.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
My kid's probably eight years old.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I'm not even part of the tour.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I'm just the emergency exit speaker.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Exhibit two.

37:36.000 --> 37:44.000
Oh, Cloris, pass me that butternut.

37:44.000 --> 37:50.000
Oh, Einstein, what are you going to do with it?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
More mathematics?

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Oh, it's a living.

37:56.000 --> 38:04.000
In the 1936s, gravity was only on a few people's mind,

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
even though the planes were working.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
You know what?

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
Sorry, I got to go.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Hey, man.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Hey.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Yeah?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Come over here, man.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I was sleeping over here.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Touch this.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Touch this.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
I'm Amelia Earhart.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Touch it.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Touch my dick.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Okay.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
You were warned.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
Before you put it away, are we going to do that second thing?

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah, the second thing, we're going to do the first one,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
but that one needs some Leonard Cohen lyrics to it.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
That's got some angular soul to it.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Yeah, I really feel like I could, yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
That should be the album title.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Angular soul?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Angular soul.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
On Phantabilon Records.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I don't know if I have the lyrical gumption.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
You're going to make up lyrics for it?

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
No, you're going to do it.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah, but let me hear it through.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
Yeah, that word.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
That's what I want.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
I adjusted the velocity and some of the things.

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
You're laying it down, you know, because you're mad at your dad.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
All right, that's the title of the song.

39:42.000 --> 39:52.000
I'm so mad at my dad.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
I also have that entire pedal next to you.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Oh, yeah, the robot voice.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, well, I don't think you want to do the heavy lifting.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Let's play it again.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Because we're not familiar with it.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
You're going to take a first pass?

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
Let's listen to it.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Do you want me to give you a suggestion and you're going to improvise lyrics?

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
No, I have written down lyrics to your song.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Whoa, why don't you just read them?

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Do you want me to give you a silly suggestion?

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Tell me what you think that music lends itself to.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
He's being mad at his dad.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Titually, and I'll try my worst to make it good.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
All right, when I hear this song, I think about...

40:39.000 --> 40:57.000
Concrete dead leaves.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
He agrees.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
It's official.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
So far, the dry leaf lobby is here.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Concrete and dead leaves so far, right?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
To me, it's like...

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I was getting nervous. I thought I was going to have to come up there.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
It's like someone angry who's going on a tear, like someone who's going on a rant.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
This is the song.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
Yeah, because it has this driving kind of bounciness to it,

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
but then the discord notes and stuff, they imply anger.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Spencer, I don't want to put you on the spot.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Would you try singing one?

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Okay, no. I mean, I'll do some of it, but you guys have to help.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
You're coming in with more...

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Oh yeah, I'm the master. Let's do it.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
So we've got concrete and dead leaves. Anything else, Harmon?

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
What else does it talk to you?

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
You know, just...

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Down a little, I think.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
All right, we've got a Rob Schrab in the house.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
It's good. This is good.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah, I don't want to over-leber it. Let's see what we've got.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Concrete and dead leaves.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Spencer, why don't you drive?

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
Okay.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
I can't take this anymore.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
My dad, he is killing me.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
Concrete, dry leaves.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
I can't break any of these.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
I will not do this chore.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
My dad will ask me no more.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
These damn leaves.

42:36.000 --> 42:46.000
And my goddamn father leaves.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
Yeah, I don't know.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
See, you see how I had something for a little bit,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
and then if someone really took it,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
it would have just seemed like I was a real genius.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
But then you started to see the seams a little bit.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Brandon and I should have come in on the harmonic.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
On the harmonic kind of backup vocal kind of thing.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
I didn't mean that as a no.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I just meant as like how good I did.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
No, you killed...

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
You fucking destroyed it. It was fantastic.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Oh, yeah. No, everyone loves me.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I heard the part where you knew you were killing it,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
and then you had to wonder,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
like, oh, am I supposed to bring it into the station?

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Like, as far as...

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Like, is it going to end soon?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
And then that threw you.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I certainly was done at a point.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And yet the music played.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Wow, that was good.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
I never... I mean, that's the magic of collaboration.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
You want to try one down?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
The same song?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
I'll give you a suggestion.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
I'll kind of give you a poetical idea

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
for you to sing to that melody.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Okay.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
All right.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Make your cocktail.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
What are you drinking there?

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
You get two guesses, audience.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
I think it's kind of funny.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
All right. So, Dan, same melody.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
Let's do...

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I've been on the road a lot,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
and there's this repetition that happens

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
of going from hotel to hotel to theater

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
to hotel to hotel to theater to hotel.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
And there's a moment of amnesia that happens

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
where you wake up and your eyes are still closed

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
and you're not totally sure what room you're in.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Are you at home?

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Are you on the road?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
And if you're on the road,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
what possibly, when you open your eyes,

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
would you see?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Okay.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Great.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Yeah.

44:40.000 --> 44:52.000
That's cool.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
I don't know what room I'm in.

44:57.000 --> 45:03.000
I don't know what state I'm living in.

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
I want to do more improv on airplanes, hotels, theaters,

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
hotels, airplanes, airplanes.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
I just want my mommy back.

45:16.000 --> 45:29.000
I just want my lover in me.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
These are the struggles on the road.

45:31.000 --> 45:39.000
Yes.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
You just miss me when I'm on the road

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
because you want me inside you.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Yeah.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
All right, Brandon, your turn.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Oh, brother.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Dan, lay a title on Brandon.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Church you want to do one, too?

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
You're a singer.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Nope.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Church loves you.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Nope.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Well, all right.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
You want a suggestion?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Sure.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
You want an area?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Thanksgiving.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Okay.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
You ready?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
People like that suggestion.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
Yeah.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
Mama comes down the stairs.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
Oh, she's stuck in her underwear.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I'm going to cook some turkey soup.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
Turkey soup, turkey soup, turkey soup.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
Grandpa dead at the foot of the table.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
Ravie hot, not lumpy, quite able.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
Turkey soup, turkey soup, turkey soup, soup.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
Turkey soup, turkey soup, soup, soup.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Turkey soup.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
Did Grandpa leave a foot at the table?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
He was dead.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
He was dead at the foot of the table.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
At the foot.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
I thought he left a foot.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I was like, did he die last year?

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
And there's just, I thought it was like a foot.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Thanksgiving, not your Thanksgiving.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Turkey soup.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Jeff Davis, bring us home.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
We're all going to go around the room

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
and all of us are going to do one.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
That could be good.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
I'll try one.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
Okay, Jeff.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I can't follow turkey soup.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
And yet you must.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Yeah, I know.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Spencer, give Jeff a suggestion.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Spencer, you later.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Like if you go to the Google headquarters and stuff,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
they have like all these cafeterias

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
that have private chefs,

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
and it's just awesome.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
It's like a wonderland.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
Does that, is that something?

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It's something.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
Google office catering wonderland over in Venice,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
and you know how the traffic is.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
And so this is the actual thing in Venice.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Oh yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Okay.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
All right.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
I've been there.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
I've had omelettes.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
All right.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Do you go there to wait?

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
You just go to the Google office to.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Oh yeah.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Best omelettes in the house.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
No, no.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
I had a friend who worked there,

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
and it's like a it's kind of like a clubhouse.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
They got surfboards.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
The Google, I went to speak at Google

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
and they told me a story about somebody

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
that had been just sort of living there for a while.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
That was me.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Yeah.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
They got sleep pods and healthy snacks.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Okay, Jeff, are you ready for your song?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Yeah.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Okay.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Here we go.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I mean, also let me know if you want like a metronome

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
so that you can take advantage of that wasted real estate

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
in the beginning of the song.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I'm going to dive right in.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
All right.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Here we go.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
One, two, one, two.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
I can't count it off because I don't know the tempo.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Let's just start.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
One, two, one, two, three, five.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Okay.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
We've heard enough.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Here we go.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
We've heard enough.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
What am I going to get?

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
The omelette.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm hungry and still yet.

49:11.000 --> 49:16.000
I don't know why am I...

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
Thirst is still wet.

49:21.000 --> 49:28.000
When I download tasty treats, Google style,

49:28.000 --> 49:39.000
I want a gigabyte of sandwiches to make me smile.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
Right inside my office, I want something.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Something.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Farmed a table, no.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
Farmed, farmed, too.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
Orphous.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Almond butter.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
All right.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
A little bit of Jeff Bowie in this motherfucker.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Church, get up here and do it.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Yeah.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
No, I'm sorry.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
That was...

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
That's fair.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
It's hard to argue with that logic.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
It's really scary because you got to destroy yourself

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
like right into the...

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
To sing?

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
All right.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Now we do one, but the four of us, we do like a boys to men

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
kind of full on.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Yeah, people are saying.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
The theme is going to be real simple

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
so that we can pretty much know what we're doing.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
All right.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
We'll have to look at each other's mouths.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
With the lights on.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Dan, you'd be like the lead OJ and the rest of us

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
would be like the other OJs.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
You'd be the...

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I see what's going on.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
You'd be the gladdest knight to our pips or whatever.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So we'll fill in on the side.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
I will do Sonic Augmentation.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
I want to be the Yoko Ono.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Oh, no.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Oh, yes.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
See how that works?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I'll be the Shakira.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
This is going to be good.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Wait, but am I like...

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
I'll be the pit bull.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
You'll do all the hard work.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
No, no, no.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
I thought we were just undercutting you.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
We were like a group that kind of works together.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
No, no.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
We all work together.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
No, no, no.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
I say we all help at the same time.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Okay, like it's like Bellevue DeVoe,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
like somebody's got to do a little bit.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
We could do an A.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
They don't just sing in unison the whole time.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
A, B, A, B.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
That could be easier.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Well, no, I mean...

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
We'll just throw to each other.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
I like the idea of you guys harmonizing and stuff.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
I mean, that's going to be...

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
I say we just...

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Anybody wants to take the wheel, you take the wheel.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Let's not...

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Okay.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Let's not overthink it.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Okay, here we go.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
And what's it about?

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
What's it about?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Oh, it's about...

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Let's go from the audience.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Human man.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Human man.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
I like that.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Okay.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
What?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Pyramid man.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Pyramid man.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Shout out to Rob Schrab.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Pyramid man.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Pyramid man.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Where's Pyramid man?

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
Oh, Pyramid man.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Oh, Pyramid man.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Here we go.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
I just want my pyramid...

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Pyramid man.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
I just want my slaves to build in...

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
I just want my pyramid...

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Pyramid man.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
I just need my slaves to build in...

52:09.000 --> 52:12.160
Took a million slaves to build a pyramid.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.000
Dogs on top.

52:15.000 --> 52:15.920
We gotta start over.

52:15.920 --> 52:16.760
Yeah.

52:18.760 --> 52:21.560
First of all, I put the phone away from the mic.

52:21.560 --> 52:22.600
Can we give you another mic?

52:22.600 --> 52:23.720
I can't do two things at once.

52:23.720 --> 52:24.560
Okay, new suggestion.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.520
And then Brandon handed me a microphone.

52:26.520 --> 52:27.920
All right, church, if you're not gonna sing.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.660
Church, if you're not gonna sing, give us a title.

52:30.660 --> 52:37.660
Like, like some kind of Nick Cavey or Warren Ellisey.

52:43.420 --> 52:47.860
How about hot dog water like a limb biscuit?

52:49.420 --> 52:50.260
Really?

52:50.260 --> 52:51.660
Trigger word, limb biscuit.

52:51.660 --> 52:53.420
Church, you got something or no?

52:53.420 --> 52:54.700
Hot dog water?

52:54.700 --> 52:55.780
You know, I'm just trying to help.

52:55.780 --> 52:56.620
Hot dog water.

52:56.620 --> 52:57.460
Hot dog water.

52:57.460 --> 52:58.300
I'm just trying to help.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.140
Hot dog water's exactly what it looks like.

52:59.140 --> 53:00.860
This is exactly why I left.

53:00.860 --> 53:03.300
Hot dog water.

53:05.300 --> 53:07.460
Gotta cook those dogs.

53:09.300 --> 53:11.700
Hot dog water.

53:11.700 --> 53:13.260
Full of nitrates and salt.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.180
You guys, all right.

53:17.180 --> 53:18.020
That's what you had.

53:18.020 --> 53:19.180
That's what you forced it.

53:19.180 --> 53:21.180
But no, I like, I thought we were doing.

53:21.180 --> 53:22.620
The methodology is the problem.

53:22.620 --> 53:25.220
What was pitched to me was everybody was like doing a thing

53:25.220 --> 53:26.060
at the same time.

53:26.060 --> 53:26.900
Otherwise, why would I do a six?

53:26.900 --> 53:28.900
Suddenly what was pitched to you was you doing

53:28.900 --> 53:29.740
all the work.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.580
Try to watch each other's mouths

53:30.580 --> 53:32.260
and actually harmonize on what Dan is saying.

53:32.260 --> 53:34.140
Dude, would you get here by bus?

53:34.140 --> 53:34.980
All right.

53:37.140 --> 53:37.980
It was your idea.

53:37.980 --> 53:40.340
I know, I mean, I thought that was more complicated.

53:40.340 --> 53:43.100
Well, yeah, that's why we already did all this stuff.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.220
All right, okay, let's, let's,

53:44.220 --> 53:45.740
we've tried the easy stuff.

53:45.740 --> 53:46.580
Okay.

53:46.580 --> 53:47.420
All right.

53:47.420 --> 53:48.260
We need any title.

53:48.260 --> 53:49.180
So you like.

53:49.180 --> 53:50.020
Australia?

53:50.020 --> 53:52.180
No, we did too much Australia.

53:52.180 --> 53:53.020
Capitalism.

53:53.020 --> 53:53.860
Capitalism.

53:53.860 --> 53:54.700
Capitalism.

53:54.700 --> 53:55.540
Okay, nice.

53:55.540 --> 53:56.380
All right, so we're gonna watch Dan

53:56.380 --> 53:57.220
and we're gonna harmonize.

53:57.220 --> 53:58.060
Okay, here we go.

53:58.060 --> 53:58.900
Oh.

53:58.900 --> 53:59.760
Oh.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.780
Oh.

54:00.780 --> 54:03.540
Yeah, just think about it.

54:03.540 --> 54:05.360
Oooh.

54:05.360 --> 54:06.300
Oooh.

54:06.300 --> 54:07.620
Oh.

54:07.620 --> 54:08.720
$0.6.

54:12.780 --> 54:13.580
ount.

54:15.140 --> 54:16.700
Then sense.

54:16.700 --> 54:19.900
There is nothing better than an unplanned harmonization.

54:19.900 --> 54:21.260
Here.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.800
The music is hard.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.540
You think it's harder That's because

54:25.540 --> 54:26.700
we are comedians.

54:26.700 --> 54:31.800
Can we play? I can't blame the methodology. That's gonna help. I pitched to an A

54:31.800 --> 54:36.560
B. Well, no, jump Brandon and I jumped on Brandon's pitch of A B A B. I think that

54:36.560 --> 54:41.200
might have been a bit more. I don't we don't need to do those right now. I think

54:41.200 --> 54:44.800
Dan was right and I misunderstood him. I think it's better that we all try to

54:44.800 --> 54:49.520
really fucking isn't that what we just were trying to do? Yeah, but once we're

54:49.520 --> 54:52.640
all singing, we're louder than the music and then we can't hit the tempo or the

54:52.640 --> 54:56.840
fucking root is it's all over. All right. Well, I can air. I can text you the song.

54:56.840 --> 55:03.200
Oh hell. Thank you. That'll fix everything. Thank you. Thank you. There's probably no

55:03.200 --> 55:08.160
signal in here. We should just move on to the other thing that I have. No, we could

55:08.160 --> 55:14.640
do it. It'll be why it'll be Bluetooth. I think so it should work. Davis. Well, I

55:14.640 --> 55:19.240
didn't air drop it yet, but I'll try that next. I just kind of I'm like a I'm like a

55:19.240 --> 55:23.440
Gen X pre air drop baby. It's hard to use air drop. It really doesn't work as

55:23.440 --> 55:26.440
it's supposed to be. You know, it's like it doesn't always. It's not always there.

55:26.440 --> 55:32.160
You know, that's what I'm saying. Brandon, what you drinking? I'm drinking. I'm

55:32.160 --> 55:36.520
drinking on them. They're quakes. Oh yeah. What flavor is that? Tangerine? I'll date.

55:36.520 --> 55:42.720
Hell yeah. I'll date. I got my air drop son. Do you want to just know that's got

55:42.720 --> 55:47.560
essential oils get the text. There is supposed to be a. Oh, it hasn't sent

55:47.560 --> 55:50.560
us already. I'll try it. I can. In the meantime, I can try air drop and there's

55:50.560 --> 55:55.080
no harm in that. Huh? Wow. All right. If you're just joining us, it's the best

55:55.080 --> 55:58.600
podcast ever. We can plug it in. We can plug it in with this thing that Zach

55:58.600 --> 56:01.800
dropped off. Right. You just give me your phone. I can just I can just plug it in.

56:04.320 --> 56:09.520
You got to go. You could die to Dan or you could like pass it. Is it an audio or is

56:09.520 --> 56:12.920
it a lightning because these are one of these lightning. Oh, if you need the

56:12.920 --> 56:17.560
adapter, you want to adapt it in? I don't know. We should cut this out of the

56:17.560 --> 56:24.560
podcast. No, we leave it in the stays. Okay. I just just the thought. How's

56:24.560 --> 56:28.520
everyone doing? I'm doing good. I'm fucking thirsty. I'm parched. I'm gonna

56:28.520 --> 56:32.960
go backstage and grab a water. I am a thirsty fucker right now. Can you get

56:32.960 --> 56:38.280
me my half drinking coke? Oh yeah, the half drinking coke of it's still out

56:38.280 --> 56:43.880
there. I drank in half of it when house or when are we going to see? When are

56:43.880 --> 56:46.560
we going to see the end of your process? Like how much longer do you have on

56:46.560 --> 56:52.680
Harmon quest? What? Oh, we got two episodes left to cut and that animation

56:52.680 --> 56:56.480
happens. I expect it by the end of the year. I don't know if we have a date or

56:56.480 --> 56:59.920
anything, but it should be before the next year. I know that they are all your

56:59.920 --> 57:03.600
favorite children. Do you have any favorite episodes? Right? I we just cut

57:03.600 --> 57:08.800
episode eight that had Jess McKenna from off book the musical podcast. She's so

57:08.800 --> 57:12.480
good. She was a lawyer. We wanted to have an episode that was kind of like the

57:12.480 --> 57:15.960
episode. Thank you so much where Matt gorelly came on our podcast and was

57:15.960 --> 57:20.080
the skeleton Gary, the lawyer, but we couldn't get him for that episode. So we

57:20.080 --> 57:24.640
had a different court case episode and I was really worried because if you guys

57:24.640 --> 57:27.880
listen to the podcast, Matt gorelly really killed that episode and he really

57:27.880 --> 57:32.640
nailed it. Just throwing. Is he from Orange is the new black Mac gorelly? No,

57:32.640 --> 57:38.760
he's from U. C. B. Awesome. I don't know exactly what he's. That's perfect. Matt

57:38.760 --> 57:43.360
girl. He's a yeah, but he was. He played skeleton Gary and he did an awesome job

57:43.360 --> 57:48.240
on this on on Harmontown, the podcast, and so we wanted to recreate that and

57:48.240 --> 57:51.280
then we couldn't get him booked for that episode because I think it was doing

57:51.280 --> 57:55.680
cool stuff and so we got Jess McKenna and I was really worried because it's like

57:55.680 --> 58:00.440
well Matt gorelly did something unique unique that's unreplicatable. How could

58:00.440 --> 58:04.720
anyone else do this and just did if anything like a way a way better job. It

58:04.720 --> 58:08.160
was she just was a tour de force and knocked it out of the park. Holy shit.

58:08.160 --> 58:11.040
That one's great. They're all great, but that was the one I just did. That's

58:11.040 --> 58:15.160
awesome. Oh yeah. Matt girlie is my friend since seventh grade. Oh, sorry. I

58:15.160 --> 58:18.480
interrupted applause on what you're doing. No, no, please. Yeah. Matt girlie,

58:18.480 --> 58:22.800
but best buddy from seventh grade. Yeah. And we have him in episode one. He

58:22.800 --> 58:26.800
kicks the season off in style and he was the end of the season two right in the

58:26.800 --> 58:31.800
end of season one. Season one. Oh yeah. He's the best. A classic season. Matt

58:31.800 --> 58:36.440
girlie. Matt girlie. I walk around the house and I and I Matt girlie and I

58:36.440 --> 58:38.920
because we went to high school together in junior high school together. I walk

58:38.920 --> 58:44.080
around talking like Matt girly. Like I speak a certain Matt girly language or

58:44.080 --> 58:49.160
you just try to say the stupidest thing. But we need a demonstration before you

58:49.160 --> 58:55.400
lose your friendship. It's hard to do, but I just walk around and just think of

58:55.400 --> 58:59.240
names because if you listen to Super Ego, any Super Ego fans out there or

58:59.240 --> 59:03.000
pistol shrimps. Yeah. A pistol shrimps. God damn it. So names. I'm not going to

59:03.000 --> 59:08.240
try to do it. Him and Jeremy Carter and Mark, Mark McConville fucking absolutely

59:08.240 --> 59:12.520
hilarious. He's hanging out with Michelle Obama now. He's never. Oh yeah. He's

59:12.520 --> 59:17.720
in Milwaukee, right? He's doing Conan O'Brien. Conan needs a friend or what's

59:17.720 --> 59:22.640
it called? Yep. Conan needs a friend. Yeah. A co-production with Ear Wolf. It's

59:22.640 --> 59:26.560
not by Ear Wolf. It's a co-production. All right. Are we do we need to? We do

59:26.560 --> 59:29.080
need doing this. We're going to fucking make this work. So what's the

59:29.080 --> 59:33.680
methodology if you need to get levels or something? Yeah. Let's do a sound check

59:33.680 --> 59:38.240
on this so we can get this right. That's better. A little more. What's the

59:38.240 --> 59:41.480
methodology? Are we going to get it in the morning? I know it's good for the

59:41.480 --> 59:50.480
house, but more in the monitor. I can't take this anymore. There we go. Yeah.

59:50.480 --> 59:56.840
Is that good? Is that good for you guys? All right. Human man. No, it's pyramid man.

59:56.840 --> 59:59.560
What was the suggestion? We're going to get a new one because we're going to start

59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.160
afresh. Thank you. All right. So we got our levels right. We did our sound check

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.080
and now we're ready to go and we're going to do a hum. Are we doing Brandon's

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.800
idea of the ABAB kind of thing? Well, whatever. Let's just agree on it. Meaning

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.280
like a who's lying hoedown. All right. Let's get that out of

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.560
our system. I would like to create something magical after that. Okay. Well,

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.960
we don't have to. I just want to know on a good process. That's all. Let's get

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.920
let's do this thing. It'll help us. Do you mystify the audio blah, blah, blah,

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:39.720
blah, blah, a blah, blah, blah, B blah, blah, blah, blah, A, blah, blah,

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.000
probably when we're done. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Here we go. Easy.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.560
We'll set each other up beautifully. All right. Oh, yeah. We need a suggestion.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:58.160
Oh, self care. Self care. What was yours, madam? Self care and BDSM. I heard BDSM.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.560
That's what I heard. The same thing. The bondage domination. Yeah. Yeah. That's

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.680
because that's the acronym. Initialism. Okay. You ready?

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.960
Start again. I want to start right off the bat. Can I give you a let me give you

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.360
a little count in? Just just just start it and I'll go give the count in. All right.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.040
Well, but you don't know what he's starting it here. Maybe if there's a

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.400
metronome, let me just give you a little count in. You know, I had to do a tool.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.880
That is to say give him a county. You got to rhyme me. Thanks, Brandon.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.200
You got to rhyme Brandon. Yeah. And then and then we're going to keep going like

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.720
round robin here. We'll just try and see what then we'll get it out of our system.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:45.600
Yeah. Okay. I don't know if you'll get a count in. It's just no count in.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:57.000
Sorry. I've heard it 40 times now. I'm a professional musician. The comedic timing.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.200
Just starting to fuck her over. I love the metronome sound great though, huh?

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:08.320
That was really funny though. That was so good. That's like a Smothers Brothers bit. Yeah, for sure.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:16.280
But I really meant it. I mean, I am a smother. I'm certain of it. I'm a smother.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:24.040
Okay. All right. Here we go. Jeff, are you ready? I am. One, two. Oh wait. Sorry.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.120
I'm holding it up to the mic, but it's plugged into the box. Okay. Oh, yeah, that's true.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:39.680
You did it last time too. All right. Okay. Here we go. And strapped in latex upside down.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:49.040
It's the best thing I can do for myself. This ain't no circus. Where are the clowns?

01:02:49.040 --> 01:03:03.440
I'm just a dominatrix. Dark elf. Casting spells on you. Hope they make you feel so good.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:16.800
Discount on Elmer's glue. I'll inflict the pain that I should. B to the D to the S to the M self

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:27.320
care. Put myself in it ain't fair. Follicles, follicles, follicles, follicles make hair.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:38.360
Okay. Yeah. Follicles. All right. All right. All right. That was the that was the what we

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:45.480
just did was the like worst. The Leonard Coen version of Whose Lines I Was Drinking song.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:52.320
Oh, yeah. All right. Right. Now we worked it out. Now we're warmed up. Right. Now we're

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.320
fucking warmed up. And now we're going to take the full nasty plunge into the deep end of the

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.120
musical. And I want us to sound like Belle Biv DeVaux. Yeah. Okay. We are using a track

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.520
that is not reminiscent of the famous BBB DDD. It shouldn't matter. I mean, we've had we've had

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.680
30 more years than them to think about this. Or we had, I mean, what's that? What's that?

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.040
DeVaux song where it's like, where it's just acapella. And they're just like the whole time

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:32.120
they're like, well, it's not going to sound familiar me doing it. Are you thinking of boys

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:41.920
to men boys to men? Yeah. Oh, like, like, what was it? What's the song? How's it going? God damn

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:49.400
it. I ain't helping nobody. No, no, no. End of the road is what you're thinking. What

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.160
now we've come to the end of the road. I will be sure something of the friend. Yeah, something

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:05.920
about a friend. That's actually right. That is a friend for yesterday. For yesterday. That is

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:15.520
shy. It's what that's shy. It's wait. Wait. Oh, right. Is that wait? You're saying that's

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:22.160
not velvet devote or boys to men. So we're as racist as I thought I was on the first leg of

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.480
this track. I fucking finished photo finished with all of my honky homies. So hard to say

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:33.880
goodbye to yesterday shy. I don't even remember that name. That's velvet. I'm doing

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.800
velvet. Really? That's somebody before boys to men. Do you are not alone at all? I don't think

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.000
they made that song, but they do a version of it. Let's do Oak Ridge Boys. Nope. Just play a

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.920
little penis. A little penis. Put a lemonade on the camel's back. I'm rocking and rolling. Put

01:05:49.920 --> 01:06:01.080
another straw. Incredible Hulk and a laffer jack. All right. So are we do what are we doing? We're

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:11.480
gonna. We're gonna. We're gonna. We're gonna. We're gonna. We're gonna. We're gonna sound like

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.560
that band that I never heard of shy. Yeah. Okay. All right. That's what we're gonna do. We're

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:22.760
gonna do that. What they do in that song. Okay. But to this music. Yes. Oh, I'm keep holding it

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:28.160
up to the microphone. And yeah, and we're gonna and we're improvising. Okay. Okay. So new

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:35.240
suggestion. Brandon. Yeah. What? Oh, yeah. A new topic. That's a topic, a title, a title of a song

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:43.560
that you. Factory. Reach reject. Dildos. No, let's get that. We're close. We're close. Look,

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.320
it's due because it's gonna be this is about harmony. So who cares about a suggestion? Okay,

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.920
factory. We just thank you, madam for having the courage to yell that out in the public. Yes,

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:59.520
it's fine. Thank you. It's okay. Here we go. All right. Factory. But don't let me get more than

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.800
three syllables out before you know we're gonna fucking come in. We're gonna be all over your

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.480
thing. Yeah, we're gonna be on. I'm not hanging out here to so I don't know what you guys are

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.640
talking about musical styling. So if you were just to say like potato, what would that sound

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:15.880
like translated through the sound so I can hope to replicate it along with fellas show

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:29.240
them our R&B. Okay. You see how good we are. Yeah. I just want to yeah. We just all

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.280
yes. It was like very Gordy's about to come out. Yeah, it's gonna be fucking big. No,

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:39.640
word. This is good. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Factory reject. Dildos. Yeah. Oh, factory.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:51.640
ree. over. Oh. What do you know how to do? No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.560
That you put

01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:00.200
inside your clothes. I tempo. I want to,

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.840
shrimpy ass, sticky. Ready to start

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.720
Slow, then go fast, fast, fast

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.160
Back to the beginning

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.320
I'm getting erect

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.720
Sticking inside me

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.640
I don't know why somebody tried to hide me in your butthole

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.560
But I want to come out again

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.760
Then go back in, then go back out

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.000
And go back in again and again and again and again

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.160
Okay, so we fucking did it, yeah

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.360
We fucking did it!

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.040
Very much like Bellevue de Barreau

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.160
That could be a fucking record!

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.560
Very much.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.040
Where's Jack White?

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.400
We need Jack White or fucking Rick Rubin

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.440
If Rick Rubin were here right now, he'd fucking go

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.520
Imagine how many takes that shy group did to do that song

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.120
And then at the end of it, no one knows their name

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.600
No.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.200
People that mistake them for Bellevue de Vue

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.040
are mistaking them for boys' demand

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.800
I don't know if... Yeah.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.960
That's obscure!

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.960
Also, the fact that right now, because we're live streaming

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.320
that somebody's already taken this into a fucking, like, to AMI

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.240
or fucking, like, capital records

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.160
and already stolen our song

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.760
But you know, I don't care, because we can do this...

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.800
We could do 100 of these

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.160
No, I shit this stuff out

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.800
Brandon's got the flavor right now

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.800
That song.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:36.200
Uh...

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.040
That was the song you were thinking of

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.000
I forgot were the best podcasts of all podcasts

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.160
Yeah.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:56.240
I've been house hunting with Cody looking for an upgrade, taking my time.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240
That's it.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.240
That's all there is to that.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:03.920
I went to another house that makes you wear booties, but I kind of got over it this time.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:04.920
Is it like JPL?

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.640
Like they were making a spaceship or something?

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.640
Yeah, I know.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640
Well, I don't...

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.640
Yeah, I was offended by it the first time, but this time I was like, whatever.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640
Why'd you bring your own booties?

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.240
You got to bring your own booties, man.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240
Here's the thing, like...

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.720
You've never been house hunting before?

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.520
You can't just roll up with no booties at a house hunt?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520
Here's the thing.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520
Come on, man.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.520
What the fuck are you doing?

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.520
Where do you think you going?

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520
You fucking first house hunt?

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520
No booties having, motherfucker.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520
Yeah, you got to fucking...

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520
You don't show up booty-less.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520
I feel like that's our next song.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.520
You got to bring that booty.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:42.520
I'm going to tell you guys a couple things about open house booties.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.520
They're filthy.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.520
Oh, yeah.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520
They're tattered.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.320
That's why you got to bring your own booties, Jackson.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:58.440
And 40% of the house touring consumer is going to put on those booties, under fucking duress,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.760
shuffle around your already dirty ass house, who you kidding?

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:11.600
And by the way, I want to see your backyard, bitch.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.000
What do I got to schedule my feet for?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.600
I'm trying to give you millions of dollars.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.080
I want to flow around.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.600
That's part of the whole house experience.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600
That's what you got to bring your...

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.360
When I go into the living room...

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.480
You got to bring your own booties.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480
You got to bring them.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480
No, it doesn't.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.640
You're not hearing me.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640
Booties don't matter.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.040
They're called shoes.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.360
Your feet go where your heart goes or you're not buying a house.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.800
They had two baskets of booties at this place, the front door and the back door.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800
I went in the backyard.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.960
I was like, oh, it's a saltwater pool.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.560
I got the booties out.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:52.760
I'm not going to walk out to see the pool, unless I forget the most important thing that

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.400
you want to be on my mind is my feet and my booties.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.200
So I can put them in the outgoing basket.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:08.240
I have my freedom around the backyard, collecting all kinds of AIDS grass and dog shit.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:13.400
Oh, no, my dirty, dirty human society feet.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.760
Oh, your backyard's all over my feet.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.640
And then you're supposed to go like, oh, I'm going to go, let's go back in and let's look

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.920
at that laundry room again.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.960
Don't forget to scrub up for surgery.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.120
Of course I did it wrong.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.840
I went all around the backyard in the booties.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840
Everyone does that.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.680
I was going to say half of the people do that.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.200
By the way, the other half of the people, why are you so experienced at house hunting?

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.240
Just buy a fucking house.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.440
Not the most valued customers.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.560
You know who you want coming to your open house?

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.480
Someone who goes to so few open houses, they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480
You know why?

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.200
Because that motherfucker buys houses.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.960
So he don't go to a lot open once.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960
I want to know.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.400
He's too busy living in them and buying them.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.680
So he ain't got no booty etiquette.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.560
That's my favorite Sir Mix-a-Lot song.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.640
You got to put some papers down for that booty brown, that booty brown.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640
Booty etiquette.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.320
I like to put the tissue cover on my shoes.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.600
What's the dopest thing you've seen in a house and what's the shittiest, like most

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.480
low budget shit that you've seen somebody try to ask for?

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.200
I haven't.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:38.440
I've just seen some stuff where we looked at a house today and I was like, this man

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.040
is gay and Hispanic.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.120
There was no photos or anything.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.000
Like super upper class.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.560
I was just like, it's amazing how your house can express the amount of anxiety you're under

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.400
even while being incredible.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.560
The expression of floor space and like the work you've had done in your house and stuff.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560
I don't know.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560
I can't.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.360
But like when you open the door and going straight back to a pool that has like a waterfall

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.160
like pouring, you know, like one of those like waterfall things, it's just sort of like,

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160
like.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.080
It just screams Hispanic.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.720
Well, well, no, that wasn't that.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720
I'm sorry.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.360
I'm sorry I hit that hot button by identifying people.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.960
My point was that I was like conjuring this person in my head because I was like the neighborhood

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.520
that we're in is so stressful.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.640
If you, it's like these beautiful houses, but then you were like on Hollywood Boulevard.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.920
So imagine going to work every day and like you, like you're like 15 minutes, oh, it takes

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.680
me 15 minutes to get to Burbank or whatever.

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.960
And then you like your first stop is Hollywood Boulevard where you're just like, it could

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.560
be seven minutes before you can make a left turn.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:00.440
I just, and then, and then, so then the houses that are in some of these places, you're like,

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440
oh, okay.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.200
So that's all that stress is manifesting itself.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.720
It's like popping like popcorn inside of here.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.360
And then I, and then I project a few things like I, yes, I went ethnic because I was thinking

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.120
like Catholic and like, I was just thinking like this person's exploding inside and I

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.080
wonder where they're moving to and I don't want their house because I don't want to wear

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080
no booties.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.560
Wait, this is a booty house?

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560
No, it wasn't actually a booty house.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.360
What's the, have you seen somebody who's been trying to patch up shit?

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.000
Have you seen any houses where they're like clearly off asking for too much money and they've

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.800
duct taped like a jacuzzi to a back wall?

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800
No.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800
No.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.840
Are people out there fairly, are they being fair or are they being like just trying to

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.000
get this money right now?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.380
Our favorite place is like, has been on the market for hundreds of days.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.000
So we keep on going like, well, what, who got murdered there?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.680
Like what's the, what's the ghost?

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.880
You know, like, um, and yeah, but that's, there's nothing apparent.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.200
My house, the last one, you bring inspectors in and they don't find anything, but then

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:09.480
you still find out you're fucked, uh, uh, termites and I mean inspectors can find that

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:16.200
shit, but like, whatever, why, how close, how close are you to, uh, are you tired yet?

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.640
Are you like, no, I would look for a house forever because I'm like, I like my, I like

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.800
the house I have now and I keep going like, I know I'm counting on my fingers.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.440
I want to get mad at my house.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.400
If I move into a house from what I'm in, I'm 46 years old, the next house I move into,

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.320
it's not, you know, it's not like overwhelmingly possible I'm going to die in it, but like

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:43.760
if it's cool enough, like maybe I could like, like, and I would like to get like mad at

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.760
my house.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.000
Like I would like to experience like, what the fuck, where the fuck did I put the goddamn

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.720
scissors?

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.360
How many goddamn hallways are there in this goddamn, you know, I just want to feel a little

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.920
bit of like over, oh, I got too much house.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.760
Like a little too much house.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760
Right.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.920
Do you want rooms that you don't even use?

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:12.040
Like just like, like, just, I'm going to use them, you know, with VR be anything.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.360
You know, you're going to end up, that's a room right there, you know, burn a, burn a

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:23.840
room, everybody, your next house needs an extra room, VR is coming, coming strong.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:32.800
Now, by my count, because here, Cody and I, we, here's our dream, this is what we want.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.240
We want a master bedroom that we're going to, it's going to be like a, it's just for

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:45.040
us, it's so, so far this tracks, yeah.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:51.000
But it's not our, our personal bedrooms, it's our hotel room, where we spend all of our

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.600
time as a couple, you know, we, we watch Netflix in there, we do everything that we're doing

01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.320
in our master bedroom right now, but like, because Cody will now be moving in with me

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:08.920
officially, like we want to, we want to weatherproof that, that concept.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:16.680
So we'll each have bedrooms that contain all our clothes, and I, and it has to have a bed,

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.680
because otherwise it's not a bedroom, like, like, like, because the, this, the master

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.520
bedroom has to be like a place that you're not necessarily, you, you don't necessarily

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.120
have to be, and then, super dope to devote a part of your house to straight intimacy

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.040
and togetherness is great, because then if Cody's like, oh, what is this, a wrapper from

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.920
your protein bar or whatever, I, like, I won't be like, oh, god damn it, mom, like, it's

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.200
like, because when you're staying in a hotel, it's easier to, to just feel like you're

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:52.280
both on the same team, like no, neither person is like, well, I'm going to work some shit

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.160
out now, you know, it's like you're both, both in this space that's like designed for

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160
your comfort.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.320
If I had my way, I'd be like, like Jackie Gleason and all the, like the honeymooners,

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.480
they all lived in penthouses in New York hotels, where they were making the honeymoon,

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:11.160
and they just lived in hotels, and the whole top floor was their crib, and every day they

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.080
go to work, they come back, sheets are clean, everything's good to go.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.760
I would love that, like just a hotel living, because I'm never home.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.600
I have an apartment that I pay a fortune for, and I'm never there.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Burglars.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600
Is that right?

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.600
Oh, god damn it.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.600
Oh, Jesus.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.160
Back doors always unlocked, just get right in there.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.400
When that guy, like, drove through my garage and my insurance company put me up in a hotel

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.280
for a couple of weeks, it was like, yeah, it was fun.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.800
I got a taste of that life.

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.320
Like we left with a couple of days available, though, we were kind of like, okay, we can

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.080
go home now, they fixed the garage, we're like, should we just stay here?

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.000
I guess it would be weird if we stayed here, but.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:01.600
That's where we did the Rob Schrab with Mike Ravelo's photography song.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:14.400
And if I haul all of my bags up the stairs, I will bring them to you.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:24.720
And if you call, you call on my bag service, because I am bringing those bags to you.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.600
All right, all right, we're close.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.600
We have.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.600
I'll take it.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600
Yeah, I'll take it.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600
We'll get there.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.320
It's crazy when we actually learn the words to these songs.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.320
It's the bag service.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.680
We can't afford that shit.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.680
The bag service.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.680
They're called bell hops.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.680
Bellman.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.680
Okay.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.800
Well, bag service, look, global warming.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800
I think it's a lie.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:56.920
This is terrible times we live in where people are just too tired to be to laugh.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.720
They're like, that might be true.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.320
I give up.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.680
If I talked about my beefs about hotel rooms, little things that I say in a lot of hotels,

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.240
have I talked about the toilet paper thing?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240
Yeah.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.040
You don't like the folding the little air out.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.520
And now they got the thing where you go into the fucking tissue paper and they put a million

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.000
things and make a big like Magnolia Blossom.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Like there's 11 tissues that you've just handled after cleaning somebody else's poop, but I'm

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.400
not going to use any of these.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.760
You're always wasting them.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.800
I'm sure there's a difference that could be split, but if the alternative is that new

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:38.360
role where you're in charge of unshucking the fucking, you know what I'm talking about

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360
girls.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.360
Then you take that off.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.400
You got to fucking claw that shit like a cat.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.880
Have I talked about the fucking do not disturb thing that falls off?

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.520
Most doors and hotels have this fucking smooth, curvilinear kind of thing.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.720
And you put the do not disturb on because I don't want, I don't need the housekeeping

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720
to come.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.040
I've been there for two or three days.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.040
I don't need new towels.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.040
I'm fine.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.160
Like I need one disgusting, gross, gross person, disgusting.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.560
No, I'm sleeping the street like a fucking tidy.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560
I'm tidy.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.080
And it's called being green, by the way.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.080
It's called being homeless.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.640
You're a fucking monster and you fucking put the do not disturb thing on so you don't

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.320
have to waste anybody's time or energy and cleansers and water to wash the things and

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.320
all the shit.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.320
And then you leave.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.600
Who has ever been like all the hotel waters was making this drought for real hotels.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600
Waste tons of water.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.600
Okay.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.600
Oh yeah.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.600
We can't get enough.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.600
Yeah.

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.600
They fucking love water.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600
And you close.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.600
They thirsty.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.600
And you close the door.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.280
You put the fucking do not disturb thing on the thing, which is a round little hole on

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:45.320
a curvy thing handle and you'd leave and the door shuts and it falls off every fucking

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320
time.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.320
Yeah, it really does.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.320
And then when you shut the door is like, is the do not disturb thing on the ground

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.720
saying please come in.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720
Yeah.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720
You gotta fucking check it.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.560
It fucking is like just make a do not disturb thing that hangs on the goddamn door.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560
Yeah.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:01.320
A lot of times they do, but like then the handle designs aren't like they're like, yeah, this

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.320
is good.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.880
Also, fucking hotel TV remotes can go fuck themselves forever in a day that they don't

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880
work.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.440
It's a travel hack that you could bring your own remote sometimes and they just use it

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.240
your own remote, which is a weird thing if I know I'm going to a Marriott, I bring my

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240
Marriott remote.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.240
Oh yeah.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240
Okay.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240
That's the fix.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.240
Yeah.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.960
I wish I could go back to that one city that had the vending machines that were all

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.320
linked by a Tony Stark credit network.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320
What was that call?

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320
Do you remember?

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320
Denver?

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320
Where was it?

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320
It wasn't PayPal.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.120
It was like you could buy an account to an app and you were just like subscribed to all

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.520
vending machines in the city.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.200
You're like snack Tarzan.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.400
You could just walk around and vending machines and be like, hey, you want some candy?

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:55.160
Like, like you can have it like no transaction necessary just like it's on your tab.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.920
Was it pay range?

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.480
That sounds familiar because there's this one soda machine in Griffith Park that uses

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.160
pay range and it's oh boy.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.920
Sometimes I'll drive out there just to get myself a nice Pepsi.

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920
Hmm.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.080
It's a beautiful drive.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.720
I see a coyote just to get a Pepsi.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:19.080
I kick its ass also there's a new culture and hotels in my experience is that everyone

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.160
you walk through and there's 11 valet guys.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160
There's 11 Bellman.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.120
There's 11 hotel like receptionists.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.840
There's 3000 people standing by the elevator and every one of them, every time you walk

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.680
by, even if you just went past them a second ago, they all have to say good morning or

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.040
good afternoon or hello to you and it's like, can we just dispense with that?

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.520
Like I don't need to have to have to touch base with 40 people every time I go this way

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520
or that way.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.320
These are my problems.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.560
I like it.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.000
Meanwhile, the world is on fire.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:03.280
I think that all hotels, bars should be open from ever six a.m. to two a.m.

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.280
Yeah.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280
Not in Tennessee.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.280
Tennessee.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.280
They don't even fuck it.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.920
They don't open until like, like never on Sunday, like you can't get a bloody drink.

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.960
You're like going, you're selling me a bed.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.040
So if you're going to have a bar in your place, then it would stand to reason that it shouldn't

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.080
be like baker's hours.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.640
Like your bar should be like part of the, like you're in the pillowcase business.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.680
You're in the toilet paper business.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.680
You touch the stuff that touches my butthole.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.000
Your bar should be open.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.960
It should be the reason I don't go out in Denver tonight.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.320
I got a hotel to come back to and I totally approve.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.800
Make it all fucking a card only swipey swipe.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.400
You know, no one's going to come to your fucking hotels bar to get drunk when they live in

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400
your city.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400
Stop.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.000
Stop trying to make that business happen.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.040
It's like when you go to a Starbucks and they don't have a bathroom and you're like,

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.120
you sell something that makes people piss and shit.

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.520
Have you lost your mind?

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:12.280
Please have one guy or lady or, well, it doesn't matter anything.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280
That was very welcome.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.280
Thank you.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.280
Thank you.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.280
You're welcome is what I should be saying.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280
Why am I saying thank you?

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280
You're welcome.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.800
Look what I did.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:28.680
Have a person who is there like hotels are the darkest part of your life.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.560
They're transitory.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.320
You wake up with a head wound.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.400
You don't know where you're going.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.480
You don't know where you've been.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.440
You might have scabies the next day.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.120
You're only in a hotel because your life is like it's moving.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.600
It's moving, baby.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.480
The bar, every bar needs to be open.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.160
You need to be able to sidle up to it.

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.360
It's just a living wage.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.560
Give the one person a living wage for two shifts so that there's always a person there.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.280
Yes, it's true.

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.520
Sometimes for hours on end, no one will be there wanting to drink.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.560
That's what's cool about a bar is when you get to it, it's empty but it's already open

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:19.320
and there's just a creepy dude washing a glass and it's like the open bar and you walk up

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.320
to it.

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.600
You've become Dennis Wolfberg right now.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.200
I don't know if no one's going to get that reference but Google Dennis Wolfberg or YouTube

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.200
rather.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.200
I agree.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:33.000
So airports, airports, your bar should be open 24 motherfucking hours a day.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.320
Wait, aren't they on the VIPs?

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320
Huh?

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320
Aren't the VIP bars?

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320
Usually.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.120
The VIP lounges, Brandon, let me tell you what a VIP lounge is.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.320
You walked into a fucking bear trap here, Brandon.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:55.360
A VIP lounge is three Canadian flight attendants asking you for eight forms of ID so that you

01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:02.800
can maybe have some pop off vodka with your olives, six hours from now, when the fucking

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:17.440
bar opens and it's not a bar, it's a salad bar, but VIP lounges can orally minister my

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.440
privates.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.680
Can I get an amen?

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.680
We'll get back to that.

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:33.520
If any of you all here in the crowd or anyone that listens to us over the listener thingies,

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.560
if you ever fly out of Burbank and it's an early flight, I almost hate to tell you this.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:46.800
The only thing I like about Guy Fieri is that his fucking bar, Burp, sorry, my Lacroix

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.800
Burp there.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.800
Lacroix, how do you say?

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800
Sure.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.080
Or is it Guy Fieri?

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.080
Is he French?

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.080
Guy Fieri.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.080
Or Fieri.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080
Right.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.120
Because it's Guy de Mopassant, but it's Guy Fieri.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120
This one.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120
Yeah.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:08.320
So the guys, there's both terminals and the two little tiny terminals at the Burbank airport

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.600
have guys.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.480
They're open at seven and they fucking serve booze and they have Frenette Bronca and if

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.000
you get a Bloody Mary, say no garnish because if you get it with garnish, there's no alcohol

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.040
in it because there's 9,000 things inside it.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.560
So that's what I will give to you, our Harmontown listeners.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.240
If you fly out of Burbank, go straight to Guy's Crack-a-Don, it's open and you can get

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.560
fucking wasted.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.600
And I wouldn't eat the food because you're probably going to have popcorn and shrimp

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.280
and someone's going to yell at you and have spiky blonde hair.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.280
That's great fun.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.320
Some people don't understand the point of a bar.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:49.560
If you watch The Shining, hear him out everybody.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.720
Let the man talk.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:30:03.720
Then Mr. Shining, Jack Torrance, goes to the bar and he has a conversation with the

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:09.200
British guy and then he's like, I don't know where, and the British guy is like, but you've

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:16.200
always been here and you'll always be, I always, when I watch that I'm like, I'm thirsty.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.520
I know it's supposed to be creepy, but it's like, the bars are supposed to be, it's

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:31.560
supposed to be about, it's like a self-imposed, one of those things, what do they call those

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:37.320
things in the center of like a puritan town where you put your hands in your head.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.840
It's like a self-imposed stock.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.840
Pillaring.

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:51.000
You go like, I'm going to, I'm a bad person, I'm in a dark place.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.680
I'm never going to be in a light place and then you go to the bar and then you park it

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:04.520
and then you like, you wind down the gears that would otherwise, who knows what they

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.520
would do.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.520
We don't even know.

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.360
Thank God for bars.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360
There's none.

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.360
We're all doomed.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:17.520
I feel like the Rustic and you Rustic in the old drawing room, that's the bar from, we

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520
don't shut them out.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.520
Do we not shut them out?

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520
No.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520
Okay.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.520
Damn.

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:27.720
They got go wings, though you guys have those wings, but I feel like those places are like

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.520
that is kind of the creepy bar where you feel at home.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.040
What's going on with this place next door?

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.040
Are they going to be?

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.040
They were open before the show.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.320
Are they going to be open after the show?

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320
I'm sure they are.

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.760
It's catching them when they're open.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:47.560
We've been trying to coordinate a thing where I know it was like there was a, but do you

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.800
know if they're going to be open?

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800
Okay.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800
God damn it.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800
Steve might know.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.800
Steve Levy might know.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.800
Why are you so happy?

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.240
You're so happy that you're excited to do it.

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.040
Yeah, because I know in the past they've been trying to coordinate a thing where we all

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.240
go over there afterwards or whatever.

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.320
Yeah, because now we're not drawing room adjacent anymore.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.360
Because there's no place to go over here.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.320
If anyone ever goes to Vegas and people talk shit about going to Vegas because Vegas can

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.160
be a nightmare, there's a little bar way off this trip called Champagne's Cafe.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.320
It used to be called Tony's Champagne's Cafe.

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.240
I think it's just called Champagne's.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.480
It's like the drawing room and it's 24 hours a day and it's always just chill.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.080
It's fucking great.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.800
You walk in there, you can go in there at 4 a.m. and it's just like there's eight people

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.800
there.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.800
It's not ever crazy.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.120
I love it.

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.520
There was a double down if you want to really get it down.

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.520
The double down?

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520
Tell the story about going in.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.400
You know the double down saloon in Vegas?

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.800
Anybody?

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.800
One person raised their hand?

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.800
Yeah.

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.800
It's instead of clapping.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.800
I like that choice.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.360
It's a 24-hour dive bar.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.120
I went in there one time at 3 or 4 a.m. by myself in a suit, sat down at the bar, I'm

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.120
like, this is going to be a bummer.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.120
I've been here a hundred times.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.120
It's always been fun.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.080
This is going to be the one night where it's going to suck ass.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.240
It's graffiti and there's punk rock music and the men's room is really just terrible.

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:19.320
It's like being like an episode of Locked Up Abroad.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.160
A dude comes in and he's driven in a Bentley.

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.440
He looked like Daniel Craig, but like a little heftier and...

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.080
Oh, Robert Kraft.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080
Too soon.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:39.480
And he comes in with a bunch of great-looking girls, puts a bunch of hundreds on the bar,

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:49.320
a sandwich bag of cocaine, a ziplock bag of coke, and just passes out.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.720
He thought it was the police station?

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.240
He walked in and he goes, this is money for them.

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.240
Here's all the coke.

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.640
I'm going to fucking take a little nappy time.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:04.400
And he's wearing a fucking bitching suit and outside he had like a Bugatti or a Bentley,

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.800
something awesome outside.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.120
And he's like with four or five just like screaming hot girls.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.840
And the bartender very casually just took the coke and put it behind the bar, took the

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840
money.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840
He's like, what would you like?

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840
And they all ordered drinks.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.840
There's a corking fee.

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840
Exactly.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.240
And then there was only like maybe before they had all walked in, there was probably six

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.240
other people at the bar.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.080
It's like kind of like a square kind of horseshoe shaped bar, and if that makes sense.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.640
And a few minutes later, he poured all the drinks and then gave everybody a black cocktail

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:41.360
napkin with a giant rail of coke on it and put it all out for everybody at the bar.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.920
Me, that guy over there, that lady over there, all the girls.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:53.400
I'm talking about like a golf pencil size rail of coke.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.400
And it was for everybody.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.400
Yeah.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.840
And so the guy's just fucking fast asleep right next to me and we have a good time and

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.880
he wakes up about like two hours later and we're all having the time of our lives.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:06.000
And he goes, all right, let's go back to my place then.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.240
And we all get into cars.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.680
Wait, now you're with the guy?

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.680
He went with you.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.440
You're with Rip Van Winkle?

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.640
He needed his fucking Daniel Craig James Bond.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.320
You like inserted yourself into his memento movie.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.560
I was simply sitting at the seat next to where he sat down and this all played out.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560
Then we went to his crib.

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.120
Yeah, but that's the part that I'm saying, like, yeah, you would, you know, he invited

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.280
everybody there because there was like eight of us and he goes like, oh, fucking, we're

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.280
going back to my place.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280
Let's have a good time.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.440
And you're like, and he gets in his Bentley.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.440
That's when I realized he's driving like a like $400,000 car outside.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:41.840
You had me at driving.

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840
Yeah.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840
What does he do?

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.160
He's the guy that was asleep.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.160
He took a nap.

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.520
He was too drunk to be awake.

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.040
No, he was tired, Dan.

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.840
And now he's awake and now he's ready to drive.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.120
So now we all fuck off to his place.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.120
It's like a respawn.

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.080
And it's like, it's like, I don't know, like five or six minutes off the strip.

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.280
We get into the place.

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.560
It's a penthouse and I'm not joking.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.600
This sounds like one of those Jeff Davis stories that people are going to say didn't

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.600
happen.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:05.600
Does it?

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.880
He had an indoor pool and an outdoor pool on the roof of the goddamn building.

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.400
His place was the entire roof of the building and there was a full like, like a pool the

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.560
size of the stage and then an outdoor pool.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:24.640
And we just fucking like did blow and drank and like, like until noon and I don't know

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.640
his name.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.640
I don't remember.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:32.480
Why didn't you ask?

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.120
I think, I think he composed for Black Panther.

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.120
No.

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.120
I do.

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.560
He was certainly wealthy.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.360
But I'm saying like, that's a good bar.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.040
The drawing room at 3 a.m.

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.640
The drawing room just, I went another time in the drawing room, double down, I mean,

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640
the double down in Vegas.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.640
I went in there again.

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.640
3 a.m.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.040
You want, you want, you want to let the bar marinate.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.040
Don't go there before midnight.

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.680
Like go, like go there after two o'clock after the bars or the bands are done.

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680
I went in there, sat alone again.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.360
This is not going to be fun.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.920
Like 20 roller derby lesbians came in and they were selling t-shirts and they just were

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:12.040
harassing me and mad at me because I was like a straight guy and they were just talking

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.880
shit and like just throwing ice cubes at me or whatever.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.880
This is in Nevada.

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.880
Yeah.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.880
This is Las Vegas.

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.880
It's a town in Nevada.

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.960
And I don't know why I like I'm a fed.

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960
Was this in Nevada?

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.960
No.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.960
No.

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.960
I mean, he is snitching though.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.760
It's important.

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.760
Was it in Nevada?

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.760
No.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.760
This is a bar.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.480
All we have to do is track down a house with two pools in it and this motherfucker going

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480
to jail.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.840
It's a bar in Logan, Utah.

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.280
No, it's a bar in between like the hard rock and the airport.

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.280
You could walk to either.

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.280
I thought I might have been drawing there a bunch.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280
Yeah, the double down.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.080
We lost Dino for two days there once.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.080
We didn't lose him.

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.040
We went somewhere other than there and when we came back he was there.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.840
We called at Dino like, Dino, where are you?

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.400
And he goes, I'm still here.

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.400
I'm ugly.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.440
And he was just, he was crying at the bar because he was ugly.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.240
It is like, you've been at a bar for 48 hours.

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.400
So all these roller derby lesbians from whatever Vegas team, maybe they're from out of town,

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.560
like there was a tournament or whatever.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.120
I don't know how, I bought a t-shirt, then we were friends.

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:27.480
I woke up at like the fucking Mandalay Bay or where the fuck was I saying?

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480
In the Shark Tank.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480
Oh God.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.560
I woke up at the Mandalay Bay and they were all there.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.560
I was covered in roller derby lesbians just like, it was like, I was Hugh Hefner, if

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.720
Hugh Hefner was into not getting laid.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:43.920
I wish it was just a bunch of drunk lesbians on top of me and they got up in the morning,

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.560
we all had breakfast together and it was the fucking best time.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.640
Again, double down saloon, best bar in the world.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.880
Why did we not put all of that in the song?

01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.600
I waited in the fucking men's room one time and there was, it was, I'll just start the

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:07.720
story by saying in the men's room it was exceptionally unclean and I used the ladies

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:13.080
room instead and I come out and a tough little punk rock chick with a wife beat her on, like

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.080
half my height.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.960
She's like, you motherfucker, you don't get to fucking use the ladies room, you got your

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.880
own fucking ladies room and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's screaming at me, she wants

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:27.160
to fucking punch me and I said, hang on, hang on, and I opened up the men's room and there

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:34.160
is an inch and a half of brown poop water on the floor and she goes, oh, I'm so sorry,

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.240
can I buy you a drink?

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.320
She thought, she thought you were just like, I mean, did she think your threshold was just

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.720
not high enough?

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.000
Or just taking advantage of, like the women's rooms are normally nicer than the men's rooms.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.560
Yeah, like someone was in there and you just hopped into the women's room.

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:54.400
Yeah, I know, I'm just kind of wondering what her, if you opened the door and it was like

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.120
a regular men's room, which is also disgusting if she would have been like, no, that's the

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:03.040
point, I know why you use the women's room and you're cheating, but because there was

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.960
actual doo-doo, she's like, oh, but that's sort of like a fascinating thing because it's

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.120
kind of like, if we have any deal breakers, can we get some bathroom police in this place?

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.880
I was sitting there playing pool and the pool tables, they have like sand traps and water

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.960
hazards on them, they're the worst pool tables of all time, they're the most lopsided pool

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.680
tables of all time and I was playing with these two gals and friends of mine and there

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:33.840
was these big biker dudes at the bar, like Hell's Angels looking guys and there was four

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.680
or five people, like three girls, two guys or vice versa and they were sitting at a table

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.080
and about as far as I am from a Spencer, which is like 15 feet, like 18 feet.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.160
Yeah, like 15.

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:51.280
There was a trash can and they had a table with like 20 Corona empties on it and they

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.640
were just throwing them into the trash can and trying to bank them off the wall and make

01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:03.720
a bank shot and just bing, like this is all so loud, just clang and then someone goes all

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.440
over the floor and now there's just bottles everywhere and the bouncer is a big tough

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.680
guy and all the bikers just keep looking over the shoulder, kind of rolling their eyes and

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:18.400
they're just throwing glass like across the room and missing half the time and making

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:26.560
a ton of noise and finally one breaks and the big old like gray bearded like duck dynasty

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:36.000
looking bouncer, the biker that whose street name is caveman or yeah or do socrates.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:45.080
So yeah, he gets up and he just kind of reluctantly walks over and he goes, your taxis outside.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.680
Oh, shit, Socrates.

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.680
Like not fuck you.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680
You're thrown out.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.800
It's like we called you a car and the people are like, oh, thank you.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.680
We've been throwing bottles for 20 minutes.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.640
That's very nice of you that bar.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.960
It's hard to get thrown out of the double down.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.000
And just when they're about to throw you out, all you got to do is double down.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Yeah.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
There's a sign.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
There's a bunch of signs.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.640
One sign says you you puke, you clean and that's that's if you puke, you got to fuck

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640
in.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.160
They give you the fucking mop and the rag and the thing and you got to clean it up.

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.680
But at the site next to it says $20 puke insurance, which if you think you're going to puke or

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.000
you think your friends are going to puke, you can buy $20 insurance.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.360
And if your friend pukes or you puke the bar cleans, does it does the price go up after

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.360
the if you didn't buy it before?

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.640
It's like insurance on a bet and blackjack.

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.800
Well, then I'm saying if it's the same price after you puke that it if you just turned

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:48.120
it in, this is shark tank.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.160
They should charge 60 bucks if you didn't buy it.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.160
I think you got it.

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.560
I think you can't buy it at the point.

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.240
You just clean it insurance.

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.600
It's it's it's you puke you clean as before you as if you didn't pay insurance, $20 buys

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.600
you puke insurance.

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.600
The bar will clean up after you before.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:03.600
I know.

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.600
Yeah.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.480
But what if you puke and then pay $20?

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:07.480
Is that legal?

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.720
No, no, I think you have to right.

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.720
Yeah, that's what I had.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.960
There used to be asked juice.

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.360
Now asked juice.

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.360
I'm sorry.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.360
Right there.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.600
There used to be dreams in the sky.

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:30.480
The ass to me a couple of ass to I will not play this on play this on play this on almost

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.480
there.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.480
They used to do a thing.

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:39.640
I think it used to be the bar mat, the little bar mat, whatever spilled in there.

01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.920
You could for like whatever I don't know if they've even charged you for it.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.160
You had to pay five bucks for it.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.440
They would just empty the bar mat into a glass and you drank that.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.400
But now I think it's they any bottle that gets below a shot, like the like the drag

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.760
of any any bottle could be vodka, whiskey, Kahlua, you know, grenadine, whatever.

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.400
They just marry it into the opaque bottle so you have no idea what's in there.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.320
And they also have bacon martini, which is just bacon fat floating and vodka, which

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.280
I think breaks five laws.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.280
Like like from the FDA.

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.600
I've had a couple of those if you've had the bacon martini there.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:20.720
I think if you do an anastasia shot, a bacon martini and eat a slim Jim, you get a free

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.720
t-shirt.

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.200
Whoa, what a deal.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:33.680
But if you have just you have just one for losing, right, the t-shirt just says like

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:38.440
it's not it's the t-shirt definitely doesn't get you anything.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.800
I want to I want to even people who know what the t-shirt represents are like something

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.040
like I drink as juice at the devil.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.440
Yeah, like I did the following three things.

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440
What are you doing?

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:57.040
Yeah, I was playing pool with two with these two gals and they were they were good looking

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.280
and they're not great at pool and neither am I, but I'm better than they were.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.920
And we were playing for drinks, but you should talk and then they weren't that good.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.840
I mean, I'm not that great either, but I was better a little better than they were.

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.200
So I'm beating them and there's all these biker dudes at the bar and they're the only

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.080
two gals in the bar and all these big tough house angels looking dudes are up there like

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.080
Mongols or whatever.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:26.640
And then so I go to the bar to get a drink and I say it and then the toughest looking

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.120
dude there goes, hey man, what's the stakes over there?

01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.360
I said the stakes are high and he goes, what are you playing for?

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:41.720
I go if I win, I got a kiss and he goes win one for us.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720
He was on my side.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720
It was very nice.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.560
They're like lost boys.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.560
They're adorable.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.480
Let's let's all just get in a big bus and go there right now.

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.480
All right.

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.480
Okay.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.480
All right.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480
Spencer.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.480
Have you ever been there?

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.480
Oh yeah.

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.120
When I was there, I ordered a drink and then a girl came in and was like, well, what are

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.120
you drinking?

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.400
That's a weird question.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.320
She was like, yeah, that is, and then I told her why I was drinking.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.040
I thought I could do a Jeff story.

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.040
Wait for it.

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.040
Wait for it.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:17.320
And then she said, thank you, right?

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:23.560
Does anybody, did anybody on my recommendation start watching Love After Lockup?

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.560
Fuck you guys.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.840
I'm sure plenty of people did, but not here today.

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.240
I listened back to my recommendation and I was like, what are you doing?

01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.840
You sound like a crackhead.

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.280
I guess I was just like extra stammery that night.

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.280
I don't know what, it wasn't really a sales pitch that should be successful.

01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.280
Tell me about it.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.280
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280
It's just a great reality show.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.800
It's people who are pen pals with prisoners and then they're getting out and they're

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.720
going to marry them and it's just insane, man.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.160
Does it often work out or what's the batting average on that?

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.680
No, it's chaos.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.880
It's just chaos because even the people that work out, you're like, that's not working

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.600
them out.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.920
And then most of the time you're like, get out of there, girl.

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:05.920
Get out of there.

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.400
And then the girl will just get out of there.

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.240
You're just like, get that Kyron.

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:16.480
Give me that Kyron that says that you are out of there, like that you didn't go back

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.680
or just, but it's like various combinations, very interesting.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.120
It's a very slim amount of people that actually, like the population that goes to jail over

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.280
and over again is something like three to five percent.

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.560
So you're watching something of like, it is truly just a slice of life.

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.280
Like you will not see that sort of relationship dynamic again.

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.880
The big headline of the show seems to be that even the sociopaths, because you're like,

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.680
boy, you're going to be knee deep and sociopaths on this show, really on both sides of the

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:53.000
prison yard, like the people who are going to subscribe to lovers from prison, et cetera.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.280
No wrong answers, no heroes, no villains.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:02.360
But you're, you're, you're, you're, well, you're yeah, depending on your definition

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.480
of crime, I mean, because it's not a show about what they did to go in prison, but you're

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.520
definitely watching them like, oh, okay, you're a bad, bad boy, the dude that shot up a house

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.720
full of cocaine and then asked his girlfriend to put a knife in her vagina is a villain.

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.160
But the, the interesting thing was strangely, strangely specific.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:28.520
The interesting thing is just, it's just, it's just interesting to me that like, like

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:35.960
the big elephant in the room on the show is okay, like, like, none of the people, including

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:41.920
the prisoners who claim to understand that this happens all the time, but they still

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.520
feel this emotional attachment, it, like, if people, no one in the show seems to understand

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.680
that if you're in prison, your entire world is a different context and that you're in,

01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:00.600
your value system is different and that, therefore, the people to whom you say, I love you, and

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:08.320
let's make all these plans for the future, like, you're not necessarily a liar or a Superman,

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.960
like, you know, you, you're, what you are as a person who's, who's understanding of

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.120
life is completely different from when you're going to get out, but they, they just keep

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:20.000
repeat it, it's, it's sort of, it's just people over and over again going.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.560
Well, think how important and how good or terrible your love letters would be if you

01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.880
had 24 hours a day for six years to think about writing a love letter to somebody.

01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.240
They also, very typically, they're doing, they all talk about how they, well, look,

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.600
you, you, they, they, they do ten of these at a time and they don't necessarily equate

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:46.360
that with dis, disingenuity, with dishonesty, like, it, the, the, the people on the outside

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:50.600
are familiar with the idea, well, I met this person on this site, so the idea that I was

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:57.560
the only one is, is not, it's not a realistic expectation, but more importantly, oh, that,

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.680
that was the courting process, was winnowing it down allegedly to just you, but then the

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.640
person they'll say in a talking head, well, I got two over here and one, it's like, the

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:11.920
interesting thing to me is just like picturing people as like vegetation, like if you're,

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.400
if you're a human and you're placed in prison and then you just, these roots come out, you

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:22.760
know, these fillet, these, these, these celia, these like little hairs and they're just gonna,

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:27.280
they're just looking for any kind of water because the, then these stories will end up

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.120
with a lot of people going back into the joint because they'll violate their parole or something

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:35.320
and as soon as they get in there, they're calling again and it's really hard for the

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.160
codependent people on the way out because, on, on the outside because they just went

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.240
through this whole reality show relationship where they finally figured out that the, the,

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:49.680
oh, that relationship was, but then as soon as they figure it out, the person's back in

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:56.120
prison and giving them exactly the sugar they need, which is calling them collect and asking

01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:03.680
for money and it's like this, it's siren call to them, not because they love the person

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:12.400
that much, but because they love the minimization of risk that prison represents for them.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:18.600
And I'm so fascinated by that that they're outside and they're less free romantically.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:25.160
They, they, they're so scared of being hurt and left that they have, they, they, at one

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.520
point, they need barbed wire and walls.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:32.000
They need barbed wires around the other person, not because they're sadists, but because they're

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.400
that terrified of, of getting hurt and it's like, oh, you're terrified and everyone's

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:37.400
like always scratching.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.520
They're like, oh, you're terrified of getting hurt, so you're with a convicted felon.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:46.320
But that's how terrified you can be of, of rejection.

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.480
If you went to prison down, let's say you, you were doing like a big federal stint and

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.280
what, what would your like role in prison be like, what clique would you run with?

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.960
You know, I'd be the fixer.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.960
The fixer.

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:04.280
No, I'd be a screaming lipstick man.

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.480
We all know what we would be in prison.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.360
We're the 60% of the population that will never go to prison.

01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.080
We're terrified of the idea.

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:16.800
We celebrate in our jokes and comedy and movies how everyone on the inside is getting raped

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:23.600
and the institution likes it that way because we're all thinking, oh my God, that's, some

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:27.640
of these, there was a woman who got out and there's a, there's a scene where she, she

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:33.160
just got married and she's like, she pulls up outside the prison that she was in and

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.280
they're taking pictures of her flipping the prison off and there's a guard out on the

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:44.200
perimeter and he's like, what are you doing and she's taking pictures and he's like, don't

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.720
get my face in it or something like that, like it's sort of like the, like prison equivalent

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:55.120
of going, trying to shoot a movie inside a, a, a Brookstone, but it's like, he's 500

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.880
guards away and he's like, just, just keep your camera and he says some Bibble Babble

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880
and she's like, what?

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.880
I can't hear you.

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:07.320
It goes, I assume you're a, you're an ex felons to take your pictures and get out of here.

01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:13.320
Like, like, that he's familiar with the fact that this road that he stands there and watches

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:18.280
basically it's just a regular thing that a Camaro pulls up and a man and a woman get

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.360
out with a six pack and pose, flipping off this place.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.720
So here's the thing.

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:31.720
I'm watching that and going, honey, don't do the, like, like, I, I wouldn't flip the

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720
place off.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.120
I wouldn't be shocked to find out through the mail a week later that I violated a finger

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120
law.

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:45.680
I, I, that's like, it's like the, the, the way that we employ our penal system is simply

01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:48.800
to say, are you capable of fear?

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.640
If so, fear this and then we're all afraid and then we have no respect for the people

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.400
on the inside and the people on the inside are treated like animals and whatever.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.400
Sorry.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.400
It's the end of the show.

01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.840
Uh, it's a love after lock up.

01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.400
This time, watch it.

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:09.520
My recommendation was good this time.

01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.520
It was 20% more fluid.

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.440
I'm telling you, watch one episode of season one of love after lock up and, and tell me

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:21.760
that you didn't want to watch the second episode and I'll be fine.

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:22.760
Then I'll accept that.

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:29.400
My new favorite thing is, uh, I got screwed on a flight, uh, like two days ago yesterday.

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.760
God, I'm so lost.

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:34.520
We got like five hours of delays and stuff like that.

01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.880
Looking over the shoulder of whatever the, whatever the person next to you is watching

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:44.320
on a plane, um, without, without, without the sound on this lady next to me was watching

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.120
some sort of like low rent game of throne stuff.

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.120
It was good.

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.680
It's probably better without the sound.

01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.920
I just watching these people fucking fucking fight.

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.320
It was great.

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320
Damn.

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.600
So that's my recommendation.

01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.640
Watch the lady up next to you on the plane.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:03.560
Uh, it's called, uh, low level fuck fucking fights.

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.360
I always get sucked into that shit.

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:09.720
Like I'll see somebody will be eight seats away and they'll be watching some piece of

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:14.600
shit like, uh, millennial slapstick that I like, I saw a billboard for and I was like,

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.720
I'm not watching fucking bad dog.

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.640
Uh, like, I don't care how many celebrities are the voice of the dog and like, and, but

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.120
then you, you, the, the precisely for that reason that you're like, it's definitely a

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.000
movie you were never going to see.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.520
You keep seeing scenes and you're like, is Jason Sudeikis in that?

01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.920
And you're like, God damn it.

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.360
I can't, because you're watching a movie in order.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.360
You got nothing to do.

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.080
And then you're like, well, why is she doing aerobics?

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.080
Is the dog evil?

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:46.160
And you're, you're like, what's the animated one where it's like kind of like Mexico.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.120
It's kind of day of the dead kind of stuff.

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:49.120
Yeah.

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.240
I watched that over, uh, like on the seat next to me with no sound on the person next

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.240
to me watching it.

01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:00.960
It fucking, I, I, the story, yeah, the story is great.

01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.440
I knew exactly what was going on and I didn't need to hear the words.

01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.200
It was like, it was like a beautiful, silent, like, uh, tragedy comedy.

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.120
It was, it was, it was gorgeous.

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.560
You have always told me that you like your Mexicans to shut up.

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:15.560
That's the show.

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.760
Ladies and gentlemen, what's Spanish for cliffhanger?

01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.760
Yeah.

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.520
I don't think I made myself very clear when I earlier alluded to, oh, you know, it's fun

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.520
to house.

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:27.600
I could tell someone was gay and Hispanic.

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.600
What was it?

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.600
I'm still like going over that.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.960
I'm like, what, what did you mean?

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.640
It wasn't, it wasn't what you think.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.640
Yeah.

01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.600
And I was trying to think of who, like, who's the funniest gay Hispanic I know to say,

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.720
but it was like, I, like, then I'm helping.

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:48.240
My story was me being like this Angela Lansbury and like feeling like I felt like I knew the

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.240
person.

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.240
Yeah.

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.240
Yeah.

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.240
And that person was gay.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.240
And Latino.

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.240
And Latino.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.240
Right.

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:57.240
Because they had a waterfall.

01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.240
That's the thing.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.920
I was in trouble because then by the time I stopped talking, I was like, oh boy, you

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.160
just really, you really did a number on yourself.

01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.000
Because all you did was say, I knew a, I know a person by something other than knowing them.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.560
It's a bad move, brother.

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.240
What a dumb move.

01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:22.000
Fortunately, we're in the middle of a podcast civil war between the, yeah, the shit's going

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
down.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Those bar bros.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
There's some, there's some, there's some crazy shit going down in the true crime community.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.320
I'll tell you that.

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.320
True crime.

01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.320
Yeah.

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.480
I mean, that's kind of the epicenter.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.120
I kind of, I don't want to, I don't want to dip my tender pie into it.

01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.120
Wait, wait, wait.

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.080
There's, there's, there's people beefing on true, true crime.

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.000
There's just some shit that weren't there.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Mergers last week.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Murder.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Didn't somebody get purchased for like 230 million?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
No, I don't know about nothing about that.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Okay.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.240
That somebody, somebody, somebody in the, somebody in the true crime community posted an Instagram

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.320
on International Women's Day that, that had this like crazy kind of just white text on

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:06.920
black meme, like, that was just sort of like what, I don't, I don't want to editorialize

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:07.920
any of it.

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:11.400
I just want to be objective and say like, somebody posted like a, it was just such a

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:17.880
strange thing to post, particularly at International Women's Day, like, like, and then there were

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:25.880
people that, their luminaries, our friends among them, like, going like, hey, this podcast

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.040
network, like, is this really, are you proud of this?

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.320
And then so then the, that, the person in particular got shit canned.

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:38.680
So it's just the age old now within the true crime community, the same schism that's everywhere

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:43.640
all the time, which is on one side, you got what the fuck dude, it's called freedom of

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:47.000
speech, it's called due process, all that stuff, and on the other side you have what

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.800
the fuck, it's called empathy, what the fuck is happening, and, and, and never the twain

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:57.080
shall meet and everyone shall be unhappy and angry and interesting, but it's, where would

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.920
I go to find this all play out anyway?

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920
I don't know.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.960
I don't, I just, I just, you can't say it because you don't want to be.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:09.200
You can probably Google true crime podcast, International Women's Day and probably find

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.200
something.

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:14.320
Well, I just, I know, well, here's the thing, I think that I've, I think what I, my point

01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.000
is that I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I didn't want to get, I don't want to get

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.000
involved as far as like, like, like, but it's, that doesn't mean it's, it's the, it's the

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.880
guy, the sword and scale guy, the Mike, Mike, Mike the day.

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.880
Reserve, don't clap.

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.880
Reserve it!

01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:33.320
So, so, like, if you, if that's what, if you want to go, if you want to go look at what

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:36.440
I'm talking about, I'm not like, oh, I don't want you to know about it, I'm like, I don't

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:41.760
want to, I don't want to stir anything, I don't want to, I don't want my presence to

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.260
affect anything.

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:46.360
You're then, people to watch, Loctur love it up.

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:49.200
I want, I want everyone to watch that, so we'll talk to people about something.

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:54.960
What if, what if, what if shit got so wild between rival true crime podcast that somebody

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:57.360
killed somebody else in a true crime podcast?

01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:00.920
It's absolutely going to happen.

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:04.360
There's, there's, there's the, there's the Harmontown Guarantees.

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:07.400
There's as many true crime podcasts as there are people.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.000
So somebody's going to get whacked, and it's going to be, yeah, it's going to be, yeah.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.920
Last podcast on left, I think.

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:14.920
Last podcast on the left?

02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:15.920
Or whatever the fuck it's going to be.

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.520
Is it next week now that our, our English friends will be here?

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.520
I think.

02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.520
I believe so.

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:21.520
That's what Steve says, yes.

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.440
I've missed, I've mis-cued that before, but yeah, okay.

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:30.000
So next week, Saruti and Hannah from the Red-Handed Podcast are going to be here.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:35.080
I'm actually a little nervous because I, I'm just, I'm starstruck and I want to, I want

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:40.360
to do a good job, but so I'll, I'll be sober and we'll talk about, we'll just talk about

02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.360
true crime.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.800
I've got a couple cases that I don't hear anybody covering enough.

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:48.280
The case of the smashed garage.

02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:49.280
Yeah.

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.280
The case of the.

02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:53.760
You corrupt this tree in the backyard.

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:55.520
The case of the dying tree.

02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:01.520
So next week, next week, those ladies will be here and until then, keep your hair on

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:08.080
a dish and keep your spoons from the help.

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:09.880
You want to try one last go at the song?

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.400
You want to close it out with one last try?

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:19.080
But let's do the other one, the fun one, the, the more, the more poppy one.

02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:20.080
Okay.

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:27.720
And then Dan, like you take it, I want you to make it about what you feel like the audience

02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:29.760
walks away from the show with.

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:30.760
Okay.

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:49.840
Thank you for joining us here at the Harmontown podcast.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.960
Are we ever going to plead D and D again?

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:54.960
Cliffhanger.

02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:01.120
Zach put a beat on him.

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:02.120
I'm not plugged in.

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:03.120
Thank y'all.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:08.960
Let's give it up for the return of Spencer Crittenden and everybody.

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:09.960
And the answer is yes.

02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.960
Spencer.

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:11.960
We're going to play D and D soon.

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:12.960
I miss it.

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:13.960
That's what you said last time.

02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:14.960
How about Brandon Johnson?

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.960
Thanks for having me guys.

02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:20.960
Mike drop.

02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:29.560
How about the Mike technique of your mayor, Dan Harmon, Zac McKeever's got the beats

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:30.560
on.

02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:31.560
I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:32.560
Drive fast, take chances.

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:33.560
We love you all.

02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:34.560
We'll see you soon.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:52.560
Did you get any of that?

02:02:52.560 --> 02:03:07.560
Thank you for joining us here at the Harmontown podcast.
