{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.000\nLet's bring out Spencer Crittenden, shall we?\n\n00:08.000 --> 00:10.000\nHarmontown is now in session.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:17.000\nLet's also bring out Brandon Johnson.\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:19.000\nBrandon Johnson to...\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:28.000\nAnd just for good measure at Harmontown,\n\n00:28.000 --> 00:29.000\nlet's bring out the mayor of Harmontown,\n\n00:29.000 --> 00:36.000\nthe prime of town, Dan Harmon.\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:40.000\nYou rocked into the beat, going downstairs,\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:45.000\nsaw your momma, said, hey, here, here, here.\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nI got excited, but then I got,\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:49.000\nand then I got just, something happened.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:52.000\nI don't know, I got terrified.\n\n00:52.000 --> 00:55.000\nI didn't want to rap all of a sudden, like really fast.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:57.000\nLike I went from wanting to rap really bad\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:59.000\nto not wanting to rap really fast.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nBecause you didn't feel the flow?\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nYeah, I think the flow got a little clogged,\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:05.000\nand then I just panicked.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:08.000\nHow do we unclog that flow?\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:10.000\nLike, I mean, I'm being for real right now.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:11.000\nA hot towel.\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:13.000\nIs there a flow, a hot towel?\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:15.000\nYeah.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:16.000\nWelcome back, Spencer.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:17.000\nThanks, man.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:19.000\nSpencer is back.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.000\nOh, I got a couch.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:26.000\nI see you've accepted my demands for one couch,\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:30.000\nand one pointed polished pyramid.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:33.000\nYeah, we don't, we typically don't air\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nour contract renegotiations here at Harmontown,\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:40.000\nyou know, the grievances, and we keep a line there.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:42.000\nEverything else is transparency and stuff,\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:44.000\nbut it is rough.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:46.000\nHis contract was up, you know,\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nand it was like, I should have never signed you\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nto a one plus one.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.000\nYeah, it was weird, because like I wanted to agree,\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:58.000\nbut like the Spencer's Guild was like, no.\n\n01:58.000 --> 01:59.000\nIt's got its own guild.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nAt the authorized to strike.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:09.000\nHow are the Spencer's Guild and producer guild negotiations going?\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nIt's hard to tell who's talking about anything.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:12.000\nRight.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nLike what stance anyone's taking.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:15.000\nBecause you're also a producer.\n\n02:15.000 --> 02:19.000\nWell, yeah, I mean, I'm on both sides of the table,\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:20.000\nand like it's hard.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:21.000\nYeah, exactly.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.000\nSo it's always in my own benefit.\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nHow's Harmon Quest?\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:27.000\nOh, it's so good.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:28.000\nI know.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:29.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:30.000\nSometimes I'm getting real mad,\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nand then I'm like, this is bad.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:35.000\nIt's the best job in the world.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:37.000\nIt's like you should be getting mad.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:38.000\nWhat are you getting mad at?\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:40.000\nJust like at the boards, all these boards.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nI'm like, oh, just like things that need to be.\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:45.000\nYeah, it's just yeah, but it's so fun.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nHoly shit.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nI mean, you talked about it in the last episode.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nI heard I was like, hell yeah.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:51.000\nHe's lying about the show.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:52.000\nYeah.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:56.000\nAnd you know, Cody, like, not only has never seen it before,\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nbut she's watching an animatic.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nShe's watching a thing with her fiance's ex-wife in it.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nNot that she doesn't have any pettiness there,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.000\nbut I'm just saying like, there's a lot of English on that ball.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:08.000\nIt's not predisposed to like it.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:11.000\nBut she was like, and she's never seen the first season.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:15.000\nSo all of these things, she was like, oh my god,\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\nthat's so great.\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:18.000\nShe was like really into it.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:20.000\nLike I understood all the jokes.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:24.000\nI don't care about no D&D, but it was like Aaron's really funny\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nand everything's like working really good.\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:34.000\nYeah, the only thing is I just like, I'm not going to like\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:35.000\nobsess over it.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:40.000\nBut I just, I can't believe the lethargy on my face\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nlike in the beginning.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:42.000\nIt's like crazy.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nThe first season, I guess because we're like, oh, how do we do it?\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nSo then we did like a bunch of takes where I was like,\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.000\nJohn Oliver, oh, it's Harmon Quest.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\nYou know, like, which you do need to do because the camera takes away\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.000\n10 pounds of energy.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nSo this time around, like I...\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nWhich energy is really light in the first place.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nI just remember being like, oh, I'm real chill.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nIt's like, it's just Harmon Quest.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nIt's like, let's just have some fun.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nAnd I'm watching, I'm like, am I blind?\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:08.000\nI look like I'm blind.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:09.000\nThat's true.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nYeah, you're not like looking at any single thing.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nAnd it's really off-putting.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\nSo here's the thing.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\nYeah, it is. Everyone hated it.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:20.000\nLike, I wish somebody would have hit me with a stick and said,\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:21.000\nwe're doing another take.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:22.000\nYou gotta...\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:23.000\nBut here's the thing about those cameras.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:28.000\nLike, it's one thing to, you know, if you have stage fright versus like,\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\noh, I'm comfortable.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nPeople looking at me, I'll be fine.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnd then there's another layer where you do like a single camera work\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:39.000\nor it's like, okay, there's a camera over here or right here or whatever,\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:43.000\nbut it's one camera and my job is to ignore it.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nMy job is to focus on the cookies because my character...\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:46.000\nRight, you can never look at it.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:51.000\nAnd then there's this, that live four cam thing where...\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nYeah, your solo camera, the tally light comes on in your camera too.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nThat's your camera.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:59.000\nBut it's not even like, because we're not doing it live,\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:02.000\nso it's not even like the red light comes on.\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:05.000\nIt's more like the director says to you, hey, Dan,\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nwhen you're gonna look at the camera, that's your camera\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nand points at one of the cameras.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:15.000\nAnd so the thing that freaks me out is I go,\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nokay, so I know it's not live.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nThey're not editing in board.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nSo it's sort of like, it puts it in my head that it's like,\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\nI have control over whether it cuts to me.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:29.000\nAnd so then I'm like, well,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nI'm never gonna make the decision for it to cut to me.\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nSo then I'm like staring at a table.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:34.000\nYeah, that's how I feel.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:35.000\nIt's just a weird thing.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nIt doesn't matter how talented a performer\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nor how comfortable in your own skin you might be.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nIt's a totally different talent, I think, section,\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:45.000\nthe idea of not being thrown by this idea.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:49.000\nOn whose line, there's tally lights where the red light comes on.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:53.000\nThey're just doing it like in a fake live edit.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nAnd then seven or eight cameras are all rolling at the same time.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nSo they're all good to go.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.000\nNo matter where you're looking, that camera is rolling.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:05.000\nBut on Harmon Quest, there's no tally light.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nThe red light doesn't come on and says,\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nthis is the one that's on you right now.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nBut you can take a camera take to any camera at any time,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nand that can be in the edit.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nYeah.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nYou can also get the fuck out of there the same way.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.000\nSo if you know that a camera is covering you,\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nthat you don't particularly agree with the take on,\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nyou can throw the take.\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nThus, rendering the camera that's on you,\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:27.000\nthis take is gonna suck,\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:30.000\nbecause I fucked up the line straight to camera.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nYeah, but all this is showmanship you guys are talking about.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:36.000\nThat's the membrane I'm talking about.\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.000\nSpencer and I are over here on this side of like,\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nthe top of our game is like,\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nI'm the world's most comfortable nerd.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nI'm no longer going to vomit by being in front of people\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\nor even a camera.\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:52.000\nBut then on the other side of that line is just like,\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:55.000\noh, while you're playing make believes ease,\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:59.000\nyou're also like, boy, Karen's hogging the spotlight tonight.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:02.000\nThere's calculations going on,\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nand I was never good at the long form improv,\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:08.000\nbecause I was just a bad listener.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:10.000\nI would just be like,\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:12.000\nI just sort of start thinking about like,\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\noh, I should come in as a crab or something.\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:18.000\nAnd then I'm like, I'm writing a crab thing in my head\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:22.000\nthat other people are gonna fuck up when I come in,\n\n07:22.000 --> 07:25.000\nbecause it's the improv you moron.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nAnd for the 30 seconds that I'm sitting there going like,\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\noh, the crab's gonna come in.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:32.000\nThis is what I'm gonna do.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nThere's things I'm supposed to be listening to.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:38.000\nFor me, like Harmon Quest, I take copious notes\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:39.000\nand I'm writing things down,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nbecause I want to remember the name of the thing\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nthat Spencer said, the name of the town.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.000\nAll the names.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nBut then while you're...\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nSpencer's laying down all this detail,\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nand I'm writing that down,\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.000\nbut while it's happening,\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:52.000\nsomething improv is happening,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nand I'm not listening to that.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nSo I've got the detail,\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.000\nbut not the moment that just happened.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nSo it's a hard line to walk.\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:01.000\nYeah.\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nYeah, baby.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:06.000\nWell, let's refine some of our chops tonight.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:07.000\nWe could do some drills.\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:08.000\nAll right.\n\n08:08.000 --> 08:10.000\nAll right.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:13.000\nWhy don't we just play some good old-fashioned D&D\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:14.000\nwith Spencer right now?\n\n08:14.000 --> 08:17.000\nOh, shit.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nIs that what you meant, Dan?\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nThe audience wasn't that enthused.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nOh, God.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nI didn't mean like that.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nAnd the crowd goes...\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nI'm trying to get to know you guys.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nWhat did you mean precisely, Dan?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nI was just high.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nYou wanted to sit.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.000\nHe goes, get it.\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nI was just going like,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nwell, let's do some dumb improv bits.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:39.000\nAll right.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.000\nNo, let's do dumb improv,\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:42.000\nbut let's walk the line\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nbetween thinking ahead\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nand being in the moment.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nYeah, I'm not going to...\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\nI'm only going to be in the moment.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.000\nYou're only in the moment.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nYou're not going to think about the crab character\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nthat's going to come in later on.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.000\nAll right.\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:56.000\nSo Spencer, be Dungeon Master for us\n\n08:56.000 --> 09:00.000\nand give us like a scene on us.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nAll right.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nCan I get a suggestion?\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.000\nA spaceship.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nYou're on a spaceship.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\nOkay.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nSnip, snip.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.000\nI'm a crab.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.000\nNo.\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nI hope no one's to the left,\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nthe direction I move.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nWell...\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:23.000\nCaptain Friend-Tester,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:27.000\nwhy did you let your crab out of the tank?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nYou know that it's against...\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nAcademy regulations to leave\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:34.000\nwild animals on the spaceship.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:36.000\nThe Academy had it their way.\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:40.000\nThis ship would be made of regulations.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:42.000\nAs far as whether Herman\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nis allowed to roam the cabin,\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nI think he's been on a few more missions\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:48.000\nthan you, Nurse Falco.\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:55.000\nBut away he goes.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nOh, damn.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.000\nCrab alert.\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:02.000\nCrab alert.\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:04.000\nCrab alert.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.000\nThere's a crab alert installed on the ship.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nDestroying crab.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nNo!\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:12.000\nNo!\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nHerman destroyed.\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nYou don't remember last week when you asked me\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nto put in that crab software?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:24.000\nBecause you told me you need all these lasers\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nand some of these drinks to be poured on crabs.\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nMarcus, what are you...\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:35.000\nI'm talking to you over the telescreen, right?\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:36.000\nYou just...\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:37.000\nAye, Captain.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:38.000\nAye.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:41.000\nYou're down in the mechanic bay.\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nThat's where I smoke weed.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nYeah.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:48.000\nYou can do just about anything with those computer tools.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:49.000\nCan't you, Marcus?\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:50.000\nOh, man.\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:51.000\nDental hygiene.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.000\nAir conditioning.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.000\nI can tune up a cat.\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nAnyway, going back to what you were doing,\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nI just wanted to know, was it successful?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nWas my crab thing like a convention?\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:02.000\nWas it good?\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:03.000\nDo you like it?\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:05.000\nYes, it killed my crab.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:06.000\nAwesome.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:08.000\nI'm distraught.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:09.000\nI better...\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nI'm gonna come down and see you, Marcus.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nOh, man.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nI gotta clean this place up first.\n\n11:15.000 --> 11:16.000\nOkay.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:19.000\nHey, please, come down, Captain, please.\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.000\nOver and out.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:22.000\nNurse Falco.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:23.000\nYes?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nUh, I'm gonna find it hard to believe\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nyou didn't know that was gonna happen.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nI tend to know exactly what's going on aboard the ship.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nIt is my job as the spaceship nurse.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:45.000\nWell, I have a little bit of a scrape\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\non one of my fingers.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:48.000\nOkay.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:49.000\nLet me attend to that.\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:50.000\nOh, oh, oh.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:51.000\nIt's my middle one.\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:52.000\nYour middle finger.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.000\nI'm holding up my middle one.\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:57.000\nAre you being ironic, or are you just telling me to fuck off?\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:58.000\nMan the helm, Falco.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:01.000\nI'm going to talk to Marcus.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nFalco.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nFalco, pick up.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nFalco, it's Marcus.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nPick up.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nFalco.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nFalco.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nYes?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nLook, Captain's on his way down,\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nand I'm not gonna be able to see you tonight.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:14.000\nOkay.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:15.000\nSo, look.\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nListen, as far as he's concerned,\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nwe've never met, we don't ever,\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nwe don't ever have anything going on.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:22.000\nOkay.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:23.000\nOkay.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI just, I was gonna, you know,\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nI was gonna put the good shoes on,\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\njust so you know.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:29.000\nAll right.\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nOkay.\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nThere you go.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nI'll call you back.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nJesus, it smells like a skunk down here.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:39.000\nBoy, you can take the city out of the astronaut.\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:42.000\nOr wait, you can't.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nYou can't.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:48.000\nYou can take the astronaut out of the city.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nThat's what you can do.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nAnd what we did do.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:55.000\nWhat we failed to realize we could never do\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nwas remove the city from your bones.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:04.000\nYou urban magical.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nWhoa.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nLook, just sit down, man.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nAll right.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:09.000\nI'm glad you're here, Captain.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nYou know, I don't really get a lot of time,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nyou know, chance to spend with the higher up.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:14.000\nSo I'm glad you came down.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:15.000\nYeah.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:16.000\nDid I offend you?\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:17.000\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nYou want a couple of noodles?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nWell, I'll tell you the truth.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nWouldn't mind a little of that sticky wiki\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nthat I'm smelling everywhere.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nI have no idea what you're talking about,\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nofficer, but it's right here.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.000\nUh-huh.\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:35.000\nDo you have to press the button five times or what?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nYou can shake it back and forth\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\njust to make the setting for yourself if you want.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:41.000\nRight?\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nSmells like Cheetos.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nFuck.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:50.000\nI probably got too high.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nMeh.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nMeh.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nMeh.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nThat's a signal three.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nUh, Captain Frantaster, we have an incoming message\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:02.000\nfrom your arch enemy, Diablos.\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nPut the weapons on standby.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:08.000\nCharge the shields.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:09.000\nI'll be right up.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nOkay.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:12.000\nShields charged.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:14.000\nOh, I can't see.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.000\nIs anyone there?\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nJohnson, are they on?\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:18.000\nOh, wait.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nIt's me, Diablos.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nSurrender your spaceship.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nNo.\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nYes.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:30.000\nJohnson, I can't see.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:31.000\nOh.\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nI'm sorry, man.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nLet me raise up the hailing shields.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nNo, no.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nWhat?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nNo.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nOh, God.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:40.000\nWhat?\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:41.000\nPut those back down.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nOkay.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.000\nWhy can't you see?\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:44.000\nThose are shields.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nYes, but you want to be able to see, right?\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:48.000\nYeah.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nOkay.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nPutting on vision mode.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nWhat?\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nVision mode enhanced.\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nMarcus, you have to be the captain.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nI'm too high.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nWhere my hat?\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:01.000\nNo, no.\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nJust do it.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:03.000\nJust do it.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nI'll tell everyone.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:05.000\nI'll tell everyone you got me high.\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:06.000\nOkay.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:07.000\nOkay.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:08.000\nOkay.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:10.000\nSnark ass, snitch ass, snark.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nAll right.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:12.000\nShields up.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:15.000\nWe need to get ready for evasive procedures.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:19.000\nCaptain Diablos, it is I.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:22.000\nCaptain, what exactly do you want from us?\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nSpace ship.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nWhat?\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:25.000\nI want it.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:26.000\nOkay.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nHold on for a second.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:29.000\nI got you.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:30.000\nHold on for a second.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:31.000\nWhat do you say?\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nHe want the space ship.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nDo it's a whole thing.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:35.000\nYeah.\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.000\nWe're in it.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:37.000\nSorry.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:38.000\nI'm nurse Falco.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:41.000\nI think that we shouldn't put the shields up.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.000\nWe should put the shields back down too.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nLike he just did.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nI think we should.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nThere should be a shields down situation.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:51.000\nAre they on when they're up or down?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.000\nI thought down was up yet.\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:56.000\nWell, what shields down?\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nYou're the captain Marcus.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:59.000\nGod damn it.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:05.000\nI leave the shields halfway up halfway down so we can peer over them and see the enemy Diablo.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:12.000\nDo you think the vernacular of the shield technicians is more rooted in the handheld\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:18.000\nshields being raised for infantry or the old Haggar the horrible thing coming down over\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nthe head?\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:22.000\nI think it's like an engineering thing like cuts the lights.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nOr is it does it come down like up and down together?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\nWhat are the states of the shield that are available?\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nWe have shields.\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:37.000\nWe have weapon shields and we have vision shields that you see through a through a shield.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nIt's not a perfect system.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.000\nIt looks like their shields are down.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nI could see the button.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nMaybe we should just fire on them.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nFire Diablo.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nShields up.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:48.000\nOh fuck.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nOh, we're hit.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nGod damn it.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\nAnd I was looking at these cheetos.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\nAll right.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nLook, we've been hit under my leadership, which is some bullshit.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:02.000\nBy the way, thank you fucking the worst time to make me captain Diablo.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nThere are two ships.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nThere are two ships.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:07.000\nOh shit.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.000\nThat's right.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nAnd this one is injured.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:14.000\nSo you will have our other ship.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nThat sounds perfect.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:25.000\nNow let us pass and get to safety so we can tell you about that other ship.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.000\nAll right.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nI'll do that.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nAnd then I'll monologue.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:29.000\nExcellent.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:43.000\nI became Diablos 2000 years ago at the peaks of Mount Olympus on earth dot dot dot.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nOh no.\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:49.000\nOh, he's in the background now.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nHe put himself on the background.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nHe became so engaged.\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:00.000\nThe baby captain look next to you.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nOh red bull.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:03.000\nDrink it.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:04.000\nOkay.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:05.000\nDrink the red bull captain.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:06.000\nI just don't think.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nI mean it's not like I'm gonna drink the red bull.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nIt gives me heartburn.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nIt'll make you come back.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:16.000\nOkay.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nWe need your sage leadership.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:21.000\nI tried to lead the ship, but I was too high.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nYou did great.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nYou got rid of the guy.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nThey blew the West Wing off.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:30.000\nThey did and I cried.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:35.000\nAnyway, get back upstairs and show us why you're the captain captain.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nOkay.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:41.000\nThen I went back in there and I said I'd like my job back.\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:45.000\nNurse Falco, I'm back from the mechanic.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nDiablos monologue completed.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nLower all shields.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nI knew it.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nLower all shields.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:56.000\nCaptain that puts us in a very vulnerable situation.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:58.000\nDoes it?\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nYes.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:03.000\nThat's how ships work.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:08.000\nAll shields lowered.\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nDiablos.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:16.000\nAs you can see, we are quite vulnerable over here.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nRight.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:21.000\nWe have no other ship to give you.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nWhat?\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nWhy was I just monologuing all this time?\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nBecause you're a fool.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nA damned fool.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nNo.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:32.000\nNo.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nYou floated over to a section of space.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.000\nWhat?\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nCalled the fantabulan zone.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:42.000\nBut that would mean that I'm getting fantabulous.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:48.000\nIf you thrust your engines, your entire ship will explode from the chain reaction,\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nfrom the anti-dark matter.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nNo one tells Diablos how to fly.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nNo.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nBoom.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nOh.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nWhat really happened?\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nIt actually happened.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:03.000\nCaptain Francesca, I can't believe that worked.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:04.000\nYeah.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:07.000\nHe really fell for that hook line and sinker.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:11.000\nI mean, it kind of didn't work because I was bluffing.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:17.000\nSo my bluff failed miserably because it turns out he was actually in the anti-matter space\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nand really blew up.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:20.000\nI thought you knew that.\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:21.000\nThat was your plot.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nNo, I was making it up.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nCouldn't tell.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:25.000\nSnap, snap.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.000\nI'm a ghost.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:27.000\nOh, no.\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nIt's Diablos's ghost.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.000\nDiablos's ghost.\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nNo, it's the crab.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:31.000\nMarcus.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nYes.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.000\nI'm a crab.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.000\nOh, he came back as a crab.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nAll right.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nThat felt like it.\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.000\nYay.\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:45.000\nEveryone loves us.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\nDan, you were very in the moment there.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:53.000\nI spent more time listening than usual.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:56.000\nI usually don't listen as much as I was.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nBecause you were what?\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nYou're thinking about the next 10 seconds ahead.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nYeah.\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:04.000\nYeah, I tried not to do that this time.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nHappy?\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nYeah, very, very happy.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nWe had a good time.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.000\nI had a good time.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:16.000\nAre you happy Spencer is back with us?\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.000\nYeah.\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nOh, everyone loves it.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nI had to come back because you said you could do the show without me.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nSo I was like, oh, OK.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nYeah.\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nWell, explain yourself now.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nWere you just busy?\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nYou said you were bummed out at one point.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nYeah, I've been depressed.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nI've been not feeling great.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:36.000\nI also, I talked about this a little bit, but I have a hip thing.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:41.000\nThis couch is great, actually, but it had been not great to sit for a long time and,\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:45.000\nyou know, to drive and then sit and then drive and then also just all snowballs.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nI don't do things for one reason.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nI do them for 30.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nBut yeah, no, I don't know.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nIt was just, yeah.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nHow are you feeling now?\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nOh, yeah, I resigned to my life.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n21:58.000 --> 21:59.000\nAre you still in pain?\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:03.000\nNo, but this couch is actually really nice.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:04.000\nI think I'm going to get surgery.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:05.000\nIt'll be great.\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nPeople love it.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nOh boy.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nI hope my leg doesn't fall out.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:13.000\nI feel if I was sitting in that position, I would, my back would start to get sore.\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:16.000\nI, my back could take it.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:19.000\nIt's doing a lot of work lately.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:24.000\nYou know, when your body's messed up, the rest of your body gets messed up trying to help.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:27.000\nBrandon, do you have back pain or anything like that?\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nNo, not yet.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.000\nThat's great.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:32.000\nHave you guys been to Lumbar in Silver Lake?\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:34.000\nOh, Lumbar.\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:40.000\nWell, you get, you get a, I like the synovial fluid teeny.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.000\nIt's great.\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nIt's a, yeah, it's, it's part of a new fad.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:49.000\nIt's like a ergonomic cocktail culture.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nDo you, does it have things like anis root in it and like it's very healthy?\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nIt's sort of there.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:57.000\nThey're like mind drugs because they're all natural elixirs.\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nIs that the sort of situation?\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:04.000\nNo, it's just the furniture is designed by like chiropractors and then the drinks are\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:05.000\nnormal pretty much.\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nThey have dumb names like.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nLike the Lumbargarita.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nYeah.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nNice.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nThe list goes on and on.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:14.000\nThe thoracic.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:20.000\nActually, a lot of their drinks are just named like S1, S2, S3, S4.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nWell, chiropractor.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nYeah.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:26.000\nWhat the hell are they doing back there?\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nI'm sure your chiropractors are different.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:31.000\nAll of them are voodoo people.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:36.000\nThey, but the weird thing is like which, what, how much voodoo did they get from the latest\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:40.000\nchiropractor convention where it's like high tech voodoo and then how many of them are\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:45.000\nlike DIY voodoo and they're like, which like you, you, you mentioned a guy who was like.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.000\nOh yeah.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.000\nMy parents used to go to a chiropractor who thought like he could tell if you had allergies\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:50.000\nor something.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:55.000\nAnd what he did is he had a little pack, like a suitcase lily thing that you open up and\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nhad all these little vials of I think, what do you call it?\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.000\nLike homeopathic water that was charged with essences or whatever the fuck.\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:08.000\nAnd so presumably these vials had allergens in them and he would hold the allergen near\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:11.000\nyou and then he would do this with his fingers.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:15.000\nLike you're, you're doing like a, give me some change kind of hand sign with your fingers\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:21.000\nand he would say that he was tracking the resistance on his fingers because when you\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:25.000\nwould sweat his hands would cause resistance in his hands.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:30.000\nSo if the, the allergen was, was close to you and you were allergic, it would make him\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nsweat more, which meant you were allergic.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nThis sounds like the first act of Wizard of Oz.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nOh, it is.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:39.000\nAnd then the tornado came.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:43.000\nIt's, it's all the, and the high tech stuff is just that, except it's like plastic crap\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nthat they bought at a booth number.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:51.000\nSo it's like, like, like my guy would like scan my back with a thing that was like basically\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:54.000\nlike it looked like a handheld paper scanner.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:55.000\nYeah.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:59.000\nAnd I was like, and you would hear, and he would like press a foot pedal and a voice\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:03.000\nwould go, as one, as two, as three.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nAnd he was like, like, measuring.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:10.000\nAnd then he'd like, it's all, it's all like muscle tension and sweat and stuff.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nAnd they go, you put your fingers in here.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nIt's all.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nThat sounds fucking.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nScientologists use.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:17.000\nThat sounds dumb.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nThat sounds dumb.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nIt is dumb.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nOh yeah.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.000\nIt's incredibly dumb.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.000\nI don't think it's real.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.000\nI don't think it's accredited science or anything.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:29.000\nYou know, I think they're just like, hey, let's I put a bunch of wires in a box.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:35.000\nI went, I absolutely screwed my back playing terrible golf in Florida once and I couldn't\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:39.000\neven lift up a pencil off the table without like, like weeping and pain.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:46.000\nAnd I went to a cat that a church has gone to and he just like instantly fixed me like\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:47.000\nhe's a bad motherfucker.\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:50.000\nYeah, I'll tell you what these guys are good at relieving back pain.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nWell, there there are.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.000\nThey're they're bad at being content with that station.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:58.000\nSo like physiotherapy, there are real things.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:03.000\nAnd so I assume all chiropractors have like cobbled together collections of real and\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nfake tools.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nThey're just they're just some of them work.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nThey're they're like, God damn it.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:15.000\nThey're like, Siri, how often does the average American want their back cracked?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:19.000\nI'm looking that up at six months to three years.\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nGod damn it.\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nI'm going to go broke in this motherfucker.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.000\nAnd then they so then they just have to put up posters.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nIt's like Siri.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:34.000\nCan you say s one flu s two flu seasons coming and remember all immunodeficiencies\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:37.000\noriginate in the spinal column like that?\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nYou know, it's just like this whole culture.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:45.000\nIt's every everything that a chiropractor can possibly do that will that the AMA won't\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nlike find them for it.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nI don't I know not of what I speak of how that works, but I don't know if it works\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nlike fines or if they just jump in your window.\n\n26:53.000 --> 27:01.000\nLike I remember this the Simpsons, the chiropractor guild like coming over and trashing his trash\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:07.000\ncan and then he hits the garage door closes and then they because they're chiropractors\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nthey bend back or it's and keep running out the garage.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nSo great.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nJust peak Simpsons.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:20.000\nAnyways, boy, what a joyful that's not like like what a what a great time to be in a\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:25.000\nwriter's room that must have been like this is like like like Homer Homer is a dented trash\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:29.000\ncan and it turns out to be like a chiropractic miracle like people are coming over to get\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nyour bags crack.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nThat's such a crazy like just episode.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:34.000\nIt's so satisfying.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:35.000\nWhat season was that like?\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:42.000\nI didn't really start watching the Simpsons until I moved to LA in syndication.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:45.000\nI would watch the Simpsons and X files back to back.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nAnd then I found some navel lint the other day.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nWhat is this show?\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:56.000\nWell, no one's no one's waiting for me to bring out a parrot.\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:02.000\nI've been doing a lot of composing in a garage band fucking poop song on Instagram.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nYeah, your Saturday Sunday pooping song was pretty good.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:06.000\nThat's pretty good, man.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nI just threw that one away.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nOkay, Kenny Loggins.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nDon't brag too much.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:17.000\nBut I have like I have a couple of garage band compositions that aren't there.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nThey're too soulful to be funny.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:22.000\nSo I just listened to him on a loop.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:23.000\nCan we can we hear one?\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:24.000\nWe should laugh at those.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:26.000\nYes.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:30.000\nWe'll be the judge of whether or not I live right near you.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nI can come over and do backup harmonies.\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nNow don't make fun of me.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nI mean, I guess on one hand it's like, okay.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:39.000\nThe reason why I like doing music is because I'm not supposed to be good at it.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nSo I can relax and just put myself into it.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:46.000\nBut I'm getting to a stage now where I'm going to get my feelings heard if people make fun of me.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:51.000\nThat's like when Vin Diesel does his kind of like karaoke videos.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:55.000\nHe's like everyone's loving it, but we can't tell him what we think.\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nI don't know anything about that.\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:58.000\nWell, it's easy.\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nHe's a delight.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nVin Diesel like sings.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nAnd he's tender about his.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nHe's loving it.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nOh, he's loving it.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nHe's loving it.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nBut is he good or is he terrible?\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nNo, he's not.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nBut as far as he's concerned, he's rocking it out.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\nRight.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:13.000\nWho's going to tell him that?\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nThat's why I like karaoke.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:16.000\nI go into karaoke.\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:17.000\nIt's a good thing.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:23.000\nIt's a place in Nashville, Tennessee with Chip, and it's called Santa's Pub.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:28.000\nAnd it's a Christmas decorated double wide trailer.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:31.000\nAs far as I remember, in the middle of fucking nowhere.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:35.000\nIt's like a perfect place to get a divorce.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:39.000\nIt's beer only and you cannot bring your drink up on stage.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:43.000\nAnd there's a sign that says no swearing on stage, no cursing on stage.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:49.000\nAnd after I sang my second or third song, I believe I brought the house down.\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nOr the trailer down.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nAnd I went, I fucking love this place.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nAnd he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nNo swearing on stage, man.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nBut he wasn't being a jerk about it.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:01.000\nIt was the greatest place.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:04.000\nIt was the most like Tennessee shit I've ever seen.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nIt was so good.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nOkay.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nHere's one of my songs.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nWe got mics on this.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nOh, great strings.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:42.000\nI rub the screen myself for the strings.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:54.000\nA little bit of lunacy.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:55.000\nGood.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:03.000\nSounds like somebody just scored another Alan Ball movie, huh?\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nThat's great.\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nIt's good.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nIt's great.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:10.000\nYeah, now, I'm not making fun of you here.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nAre you playing keys on it?\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nLike you're actually putting down the...\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nNot in real time, because I wouldn't know how to play.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:24.000\nBut I, like, no, there's like various apps that let you like map out melodies in a...\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nI found this really cool app that...\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nYou're playing chordal stuff in there too.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:29.000\nThere's a couple of clams in there.\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.000\nThere's a couple of notes that go over there.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nIt's a combination of apps.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:35.000\nNow, let's play it again and let's put some words to that.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nLet's...\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nDo you want to sing a song of that, Dan?\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nBecause you know the movement.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:41.000\nOr do you want to do it, Brandon?\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nNo, no, no, we're good.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:43.000\nI wonder if there's...\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nShould we pick from two?\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\nBecause it's, you know...\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.000\nWait, but real quick.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:51.000\nDid you say oof in the beginning when that first, like, sour note happened?\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nBecause that sour note was part of my style.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.000\nYeah.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:55.000\nIt was like a...\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nYeah, you're Tom Waits.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nThe piano's been drinking.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nYou're fucking out there, yeah.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nI like that sound.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:05.000\nI was like, it's like a simple plan score.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:06.000\nAll right.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nDo you have...\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nDo you want to hear more?\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nOh, the cats in trouble.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:12.000\nHow many more do you have?\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nWhat?\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nOh, I have one more.\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nLet's hear both.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:20.000\nI think that now we start putting the book to those musics.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:21.000\nOkay.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nNo lyrics for this one either, but yeah, but...\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:24.000\nYeah, but...\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:25.000\nHere we go.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:29.000\nThis one's more delightful.\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:47.000\nThis is like some forest gun shit.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:58.000\nOh, my baby ducks are in a fucking roll.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nOh, my baby ducks.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:03.000\nOh, my baby ducks.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nYeah.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:05.000\nOkay.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nYeah.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nBaby ducks.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:08.000\nYeah.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:10.000\nWho knew?\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:14.000\nWho knew that you had all that joy inside you?\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nThat's all from scratch.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.000\nIt's fucking great.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:20.000\nNone of that is like, oh, you hit this button and it gives you like a thing.\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nThat's like all from scratch.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nYou don't want to play piano.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nHow does the app work?\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nWere you making chords?\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.000\nYou just poke the screen at the spot where you wanted.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nIt's different from playing piano.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:31.000\nYou just put a note in a grid.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:34.000\nAnd then it gives you the little fill-in notes in the past notes.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:35.000\nNo.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nDon't say that.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\nI don't know.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.000\nI'm asking you.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nWell, no.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nI'm just saying, like, there's no...\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nOn that, there's no...\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nAll those chords are...\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nThat's all from scratch.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nYou did all that.\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nAnd a MIDI.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nNow, let's go back to the first one.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nIncluding the guitar.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:50.000\nLike, I'm playing a MIDI...\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:52.000\nI'm playing an iPad guitar in there.\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:55.000\nThe first one to me is the more...\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:58.000\nThe first one to me is the more interesting musically one.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nLike, it's got that kind of weird...\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nThat's my favorite one, too.\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:04.000\nIt's got strings and it's got that weird kind of out there kind of quality.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:05.000\nYeah.\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd it sounds a little like maybe it would...\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:13.000\nThe second one is like, it's going straight to like aviation museums like tour video.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:17.000\nI mean, I flatter myself.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nBut, like, that it would be used professionally.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nBut I'm saying, like, it's not...\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nIt's not a...\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nNobody...\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:24.000\nThe B-16 was the...\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.000\nNobody started crying during the second one.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:29.000\nBut during the first one, if you listened to it a bunch and if you made it,\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nI think you have to have made it.\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:32.000\nAll right.\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nNow, play the second one.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:37.000\nBut I want you to do voiceover at the Aviation Museum,\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:40.000\neven though you probably don't know a whole lot about aviation.\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:43.000\nWait, oh, you want the second one played again with that?\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nOkay.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:45.000\nYeah.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:49.000\nSo, like, we're walking under the tour of the Vintage Aviation Museum,\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nand this is the music, and then you're doing voiceover.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:56.000\nWelcome aboard.\n\n34:56.000 --> 35:06.000\nWhether you got here by car, boat, foot, or our preferred mode of travel,\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nyou just found a second home.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:12.000\nFor the next three hours,\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:17.000\nthe blinking lights on the floor will lead you through a labyrinth of educational\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:22.000\nand sometimes amusing exhibits.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:25.000\nYeah!\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nWe love exhibits.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:32.000\nMorgan Freeman, what are you doing here?\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:42.000\nOur lawyers require us to tell you that there are no such thing as ghosts.\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:46.000\nIf you see a pilot with unfinished business,\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:52.000\nhe's probably a rapist.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nExhibit one.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:59.000\nKitty Hawk, 1911.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:03.000\nIf you were getting pasta in Nebraska in 1911,\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:08.000\nyou probably weren't thinking about Orville and Wilbur Wright.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:15.000\nEven though their father was the Pesto King of Nebraska, I think I said,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:20.000\nthose two boys had their eyes on a bigger prize.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nHey, excuse me.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:27.000\nOh, is this a tour or a fossil?\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:30.000\nProppy, get out of here.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:32.000\nI'm trying to give the tour.\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:37.000\nYou need to blow away.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\nI'll be back in exhibit three.\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:42.000\nProppy, behave yourself.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nHi, folks.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nWe're going to take a different form of the tour.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:51.000\nI'm changing the blinking lights to proppy color.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:54.000\nDon't follow the same old tour.\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nYou're going to follow mine.\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nYou're going to have fun.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:06.000\nPizza, rock and roll, aviation history.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:13.000\nPregnant women should follow the emergency exit\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:19.000\nin an emergency along with non-pregnant women and men.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:22.000\nSorry, my wife is currently pregnant,\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:25.000\nand I, at the time of recording this,\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:26.000\nyou're hearing it.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nMy kid's probably eight years old.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nI'm not even part of the tour.\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.000\nI'm just the emergency exit speaker.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:36.000\nExhibit two.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:44.000\nOh, Cloris, pass me that butternut.\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:50.000\nOh, Einstein, what are you going to do with it?\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:53.000\nMore mathematics?\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:56.000\nOh, it's a living.\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:04.000\nIn the 1936s, gravity was only on a few people's mind,\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:09.000\neven though the planes were working.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:10.000\nYou know what?\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:14.000\nSorry, I got to go.\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nHey, man.\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nHey.\n\n38:18.000 -->

this.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nI'm Amelia Earhart.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nTouch it.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:36.000\nTouch my dick.\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.000\nOkay.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nYou were warned.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:43.000\nYeah.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:48.000\nBefore you put it away, are we going to do that second thing?\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:52.000\nYeah, the second thing, we're going to do the first one,\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nbut that one needs some Leonard Cohen lyrics to it.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:58.000\nThat's got some angular soul to it.\n\n38:58.000 --> 39:00.000\nYeah, I really feel like I could, yeah.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.000\nThat should be the album title.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.000\nAngular soul?\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nAngular soul.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:09.000\nOn Phantabilon Records.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nI don't know if I have the lyrical gumption.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nYou're going to make up lyrics for it?\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:17.000\nNo, you're going to do it.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:22.000\nYeah, but let me hear it through.\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:27.000\nYeah, that word.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:30.000\nThat's what I want.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:33.000\nI adjusted the velocity and some of the things.\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:38.000\nYou're laying it down, you know, because you're mad at your dad.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:42.000\nAll right, that's the title of the song.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:52.000\nI'm so mad at my dad.\n\n39:52.000 --> 39:56.000\nI also have that entire pedal next to you.\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:59.000\nOh, yeah, the robot voice.\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:03.000\nYeah, well, I don't think you want to do the heavy lifting.\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:06.000\nLet's play it again.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nBecause we're not familiar with it.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:10.000\nYou're going to take a first pass?\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:13.000\nLet's listen to it.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nDo you want me to give you a suggestion and you're going to improvise lyrics?\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nNo, I have written down lyrics to your song.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nWhoa, why don't you just read them?\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:25.000\nDo you want me to give you a silly suggestion?\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.000\nTell me what you think that music lends itself to.\n\n40:28.000 --> 40:30.000\nHe's being mad at his dad.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:34.000\nTitually, and I'll try my worst to make it good.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:39.000\nAll right, when I hear this song, I think about...\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:57.000\nConcrete dead leaves.\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nHe agrees.\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:00.000\nIt's official.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:05.000\nSo far, the dry leaf lobby is here.\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:08.000\nConcrete and dead leaves so far, right?\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nTo me, it's like...\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:12.000\nI was getting nervous. I thought I was going to have to come up there.\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:17.000\nIt's like someone angry who's going on a tear, like someone who's going on a rant.\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.000\nThis is the song.\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:23.000\nYeah, because it has this driving kind of bounciness to it,\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:28.000\nbut then the discord notes and stuff, they imply anger.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nSpencer, I don't want to put you on the spot.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nWould you try singing one?\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:35.000\nOkay, no. I mean, I'll do some of it, but you guys have to help.\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:38.000\nYou're coming in with more...\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nOh yeah, I'm the master. Let's do it.\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.000\nSo we've got concrete and dead leaves. Anything else, Harmon?\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:47.000\nWhat else does it talk to you?\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:48.000\nYou know, just...\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nDown a little, I think.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nAll right, we've got a Rob Schrab in the house.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nIt's good. This is good.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nYeah, I don't want to over-leber it. Let's see what we've got.\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:58.000\nConcrete and dead leaves.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nSpencer, why don't you drive?\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:06.000\nOkay.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:11.000\nI can't take this anymore.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:16.000\nMy dad, he is killing me.\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:21.000\nConcrete, dry leaves.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:25.000\nI can't break any of these.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:29.000\nI will not do this chore.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:34.000\nMy dad will ask me no more.\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nThese damn leaves.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:46.000\nAnd my goddamn father leaves.\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:51.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:54.000\nSee, you see how I had something for a little bit,\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nand then if someone really took it,\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nit would have just seemed like I was a real genius.\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:01.000\nBut then you started to see the seams a little bit.\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:04.000\nBrandon and I should have come in on the harmonic.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nOn the harmonic kind of backup vocal kind of thing.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:07.000\nI didn't mean that as a no.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nI just meant as like how good I did.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:10.000\nNo, you killed...\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nYou fucking destroyed it. It was fantastic.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nOh, yeah. No, everyone loves me.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nI heard the part where you knew you were killing it,\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nand then you had to wonder,\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:21.000\nlike, oh, am I supposed to bring it into the station?\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:22.000\nLike, as far as...\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.000\nLike, is it going to end soon?\n\n43:24.000 --> 43:26.000\nAnd then that threw you.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.000\nI certainly was done at a point.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nAnd yet the music played.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:33.000\nWow, that was good.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:36.000\nI never... I mean, that's the magic of collaboration.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:37.000\nYou want to try one down?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nThe same song?\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:39.000\nI'll give you a suggestion.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:43.000\nI'll kind of give you a poetical idea\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.000\nfor you to sing to that melody.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.000\nOkay.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:48.000\nAll right.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nMake your cocktail.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nWhat are you drinking there?\n\n43:52.000 --> 44:02.000\nYou get two guesses, audience.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:03.000\nI think it's kind of funny.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nAll right. So, Dan, same melody.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:09.000\nLet's do...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nI've been on the road a lot,\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:14.000\nand there's this repetition that happens\n\n44:14.000

happens\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:27.000\nwhere you wake up and your eyes are still closed\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:31.000\nand you're not totally sure what room you're in.\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:32.000\nAre you at

five.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:00.000\nOkay.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:01.000\nWe've heard enough.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nHere we go.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nWe've heard enough.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:07.000\nWhat am I going to get?\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nThe omelette.\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nI'm hungry and still yet.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:16.000\nI don't know why am I...\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:21.000\nThirst is still wet.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:28.000\nWhen I download tasty treats, Google style,\n\n49:28.000 --> 49:39.000\nI want a gigabyte of sandwiches to make me smile.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:43.000\nRight inside my office, I want something.\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:44.000\nSomething.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:47.000\nFarmed a table, no.\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:52.000\nFarmed, farmed, too.\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:55.000\nOrphous.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nAlmond butter.\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nAll right.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nA little bit of Jeff Bowie in this motherfucker.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nChurch, get up here and do it.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nYeah.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nNo, I'm sorry.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:07.000\nThat was...\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nThat's fair.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nIt's hard to argue with that logic.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nIt's really scary because you got to destroy yourself\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:13.000\nlike right into the...\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:14.000\nTo sing?\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:15.000\nAll right.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nNow we do one, but the four of us, we do like a boys to men\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nkind of full on.\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nYeah, people are saying.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nThe theme is going to be real simple\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:26.000\nso that we can pretty much know what we're doing.\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:27.000\nAll right.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:30.000\nWe'll have to look at each other's mouths.\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nWith the lights on.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.000\nDan, you'd be like the lead OJ and the rest of us\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:36.000\nwould be like the other OJs.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:37.000\nYou'd be the...\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nI see what's going on.\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:42.000\nYou'd be the gladdest knight to our pips or whatever.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nSo we'll fill in on the side.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:47.000\nI will do Sonic Augmentation.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:50.000\nI want to be the Yoko Ono.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:51.000\nOh, no.\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:52.000\nOh, yes.\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:53.000\nSee how that works?\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nI'll be the Shakira.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.000\nThis is going to be good.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.000\nWait, but am I like...\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.000\nI'll be the pit bull.\n\n50:58.000 --> 50:59.000\nYou'll do all the hard work.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:01.000\nI thought we were just undercutting you.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:02.000\nWe were like a group that kind of works together.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:03.000\nNo, no.\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:04.000\nWe all work together.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:05.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:06.000\nI say we all help at the same time.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nOkay, like it's like Bellevue DeVoe,\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:11.000\nlike somebody's got to do a little bit.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:12.000\nWe could do an A.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nThey don't just sing in unison the whole time.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:15.000\nA, B, A, B.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nThat could be easier.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:18.000\nWell, no, I mean...\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.000\nWe'll just throw to each other.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:22.000\nI like the idea of you guys harmonizing and stuff.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.000\nI mean, that's going to be...\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:24.000\nI say we just...\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nAnybody wants to take the wheel, you take the wheel.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:28.000\nLet's not...\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:29.000\nOkay.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nLet's not overthink it.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:32.000\nOkay, here we go.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:33.000\nAnd what's it about?\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:34.000\nWhat's it about?\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:35.000\nOh, it's about...\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nLet's go from the audience.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nHuman man.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:39.000\nHuman man.\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:40.000\nI like that.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.000\nOkay.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:42.000\nWhat?\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:43.000\nPyramid man.\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:44.000\nPyramid man.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:45.000\nShout out to Rob Schrab.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:46.000\nPyramid man.\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:47.000\nPyramid man.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nWhere's Pyramid man?\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:49.000\nOh, Pyramid man.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:50.000\nOh, Pyramid man.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:51.000\nHere we go.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:54.000\nI just want my pyramid...\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nPyramid man.\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:00.000\nI just want my slaves to build in...\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nI just want my pyramid...\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:04.000\nPyramid man.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:09.000\nI just need my slaves to build in...\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:12.160\nTook a million slaves to build a pyramid.\n\n52:12.160 --> 52:13.000\nDogs on top.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:15.920\nWe gotta start over.\n\n52:15.920 --> 52:16.760\nYeah.\n\n52:18.760 --> 52:21.560\nFirst of all, I put the phone away from the mic.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:22.600\nCan we give you another mic?\n\n52:22.600 --> 52:23.720\nI can't do two things at once.\n\n52:23.720 --> 52:24.560\nOkay, new suggestion.\n\n52:24.560 --> 52:26.520\nAnd then Brandon handed me a microphone.\n\n52:26.520 --> 52:27.920\nAll right, church, if you're not gonna sing.\n\n52:27.920 --> 52:30.660\nChurch, if you're not gonna sing, give us a title.\n\n52:30.660 --> 52:37.660\nLike, like some kind of Nick Cavey or Warren Ellisey.\n\n52:43.420 --> 52:47.860\nHow about hot dog water like a limb biscuit?\n\n52:49.420 --> 52:50.260\nReally?\n\n52:50.260 --> 52:51.660\nTrigger word, limb biscuit.\n\n52:51.660 --> 52:53.420\nChurch, you got something or no?\n\n52:53.420 --> 52:54.700\nHot dog water?\n\n52:54.700 --> 52:55.780\nYou know, I'm just trying to help.\n\n52:55.780 --> 52:56.620\nHot dog water.\n\n52:56.620 --> 52:57.460\nHot dog water.\n\n52:57.460 --> 52:58.300\nI'm just trying to help.\n\n52:58.300 --> 52:59.140\nHot dog water's exactly what it looks like.\n\n52:59.140 --> 53:00.860\nThis is exactly why I left.\n\n53:00.860 --> 53:03.300\nHot dog water.\n\n53:05.300 --> 53:07.460\nGotta cook those dogs.\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:11.700\nHot dog water.\n\n53:11.700 --> 53:13.260\nFull of nitrates and salt.\n\n53:15.860 --> 53:17.180\nYou guys, all right.\n\n53:17.180 --> 53:18.020\nThat's what you had.\n\n53:18.020 --> 53:19.180\nThat's what you forced it.\n\n53:19.180 --> 53:21.180\nBut no, I like, I thought we were doing.\n\n53:21.180 --> 53:22.620\nThe methodology is the problem.\n\n53:22.620 --> 53:25.220\nWhat was pitched to me was everybody was like doing a thing\n\n53:25.220 --> 53:26.060\nat the same time.\n\n53:26.060 --> 53:26.900\nOtherwise, why would I do a six?\n\n53:26.900 --> 53:28.900\nSuddenly what was pitched to you was you doing\n\n53:28.900 --> 53:29.740\nall the work.\n\n53:29.740 --> 53:30.580\nTry to watch each other's mouths\n\n53:30.580 --> 53:32.260\nand actually harmonize on what Dan is saying.\n\n53:32.260 --> 53:34.140\nDude, would you get here by bus?\n\n53:34.140 --> 53:34.980\nAll right.\n\n53:37.140 --> 53:37.980\nIt was your idea.\n\n53:37.980 --> 53:40.340\nI know, I mean, I thought that was more complicated.\n\n53:40.340 --> 53:43.100\nWell, yeah, that's why we already did all this stuff.\n\n53:43.100 --> 53:44.220\nAll right, okay, let's, let's,\n\n53:44.220 --> 53:45.740\nwe've tried the easy stuff.\n\n53:45.740 --> 53:46.580\nOkay.\n\n53:46.580 --> 53:47.420\nAll right.\n\n53:47.420 --> 53:48.260\nWe need any title.\n\n53:48.260 --> 53:49.180\nSo you like.\n\n53:49.180 --> 53:50.020\nAustralia?\n\n53:50.020 --> 53:52.180\nNo, we did too much Australia.\n\n53:52.180 --> 53:53.020\nCapitalism.\n\n53:53.020 --> 53:53.860\nCapitalism.\n\n53:53.860 --> 53:54.700\nCapitalism.\n\n53:54.700 --> 53:55.540\nOkay, nice.\n\n53:55.540 --> 53:56.380\nAll right, so we're gonna watch Dan\n\n53:56.380 --> 53:57.220\nand we're gonna harmonize.\n\n53:57.220 --> 53:58.060\nOkay, here we go.\n\n53:58.060 --> 53:58.900\nOh.\n\n53:58.900 --> 53:59.760\nOh.\n\n53:59.440 --> 54:00.780\nOh.\n\n54:00.780 --> 54:03.540\nYeah, just think about it.\n\n54:03.540 --> 54:05.360\nOooh.\n\n54:05.360 --> 54:06.300\nOooh.\n\n54:06.300 --> 54:07.620\nOh.\n\n54:07.620 --> 54:08.720\n$0.6.\n\n54:12.780 --> 54:13.580\nount.\n\n54:15.140 --> 54:16.700\nThen sense.\n\n54:16.700 --> 54:19.900\nThere is nothing better than an unplanned harmonization.\n\n54:19.900 --> 54:21.260\nHere.\n\n54:22.260 --> 54:23.800\nThe music is hard.\n\n54:23.800 --> 54:25.540\nYou think it's harder That's because\n\n54:25.540 --> 54:26.700\nwe are comedians.\n\n54:26.700 --> 54:31.800\nCan we play? I can't blame the methodology. That's gonna help. I pitched to an A\n\n54:31.800 --> 54:36.560\nB. Well, no, jump Brandon and I jumped on Brandon's pitch of A B A B. I think that\n\n54:36.560 --> 54:41.200\nmight have been a bit more. I don't we don't need to do those right now. I think\n\n54:41.200 --> 54:44.800\nDan was right and I misunderstood him. I think it's better that we all try to\n\n54:44.800 --> 54:49.520\nreally fucking isn't that what we just were trying to do? Yeah, but once we're\n\n54:49.520 --> 54:52.640\nall singing, we're louder than the music and then we can't hit the tempo or the\n\n54:52.640 --> 54:56.840\nfucking root is it's all over. All right. Well, I can air. I can text you the song.\n\n54:56.840 --> 55:03.200\nOh hell. Thank you. That'll fix everything. Thank you. Thank you. There's probably no\n\n55:03.200 --> 55:08.160\nsignal in here. We should just move on to the other thing that I have. No, we could\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:14.640\ndo it. It'll be why it'll be Bluetooth. I think so it should work. Davis. Well, I\n\n55:14.640 --> 55:19.240\ndidn't air drop it yet, but I'll try that next. I just kind of I'm like a I'm like a\n\n55:19.240 --> 55:23.440\nGen X pre air drop baby. It's hard to use air drop. It really doesn't work as\n\n55:23.440 --> 55:26.440\nit's supposed to be. You know, it's like it doesn't always. It's not always there.\n\n55:26.440 --> 55:32.160\nYou know, that's what I'm saying. Brandon, what you drinking? I'm drinking. I'm\n\n55:32.160 --> 55:36.520\ndrinking on them. They're quakes. Oh yeah. What flavor is that? Tangerine? I'll date.\n\n55:36.520 --> 55:42.720\nHell yeah. I'll date. I got my air drop son. Do you want to just know that's got\n\n55:42.720 --> 55:47.560\nessential oils get the text. There is supposed to be a. Oh, it hasn't sent\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:50.560\nus already. I'll try it. I can. In the meantime, I can try air drop and there's\n\n55:50.560 --> 55:55.080\nno harm in that. Huh? Wow. All right. If you're just joining us, it's the best\n\n55:55.080 --> 55:58.600\npodcast ever. We can plug it in. We can plug it in with this thing that Zach\n\n55:58.600 --> 56:01.800\ndropped off. Right. You just give me your phone. I can just I can just plug it in.\n\n56:04.320 --> 56:09.520\nYou got to go. You could die to Dan or you could like pass it. Is it an audio or is\n\n56:09.520 --> 56:12.920\nit a lightning because these are one of these lightning. Oh, if you need the\n\n56:12.920 --> 56:17.560\nadapter, you want to adapt it in? I don't know. We should cut this out of the\n\n56:17.560 --> 56:24.560\npodcast. No, we leave it in the stays. Okay. I just just the thought. How's\n\n56:24.560 --> 56:28.520\neveryone doing? I'm doing good. I'm fucking thirsty. I'm parched. I'm gonna\n\n56:28.520 --> 56:32.960\ngo backstage and grab a water. I am a thirsty fucker right now. Can you get\n\n56:32.960 --> 56:38.280\nme my half drinking coke? Oh yeah, the half drinking coke of it's still out\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:43.880\nthere. I drank in half of it when house or when are we going to see? When are\n\n56:43.880 --> 56:46.560\nwe going to see the end of your process? Like how much longer do you have on\n\n56:46.560 --> 56:52.680\nHarmon quest? What? Oh, we got two episodes left to cut and that animation\n\n56:52.680 --> 56:56.480\nhappens. I expect it by the end of the year. I don't know if we have a date or\n\n56:56.480 --> 56:59.920\nanything, but it should be before the next year. I know that they are all your\n\n56:59.920 --> 57:03.600\nfavorite children. Do you have any favorite episodes? Right? I we just cut\n\n57:03.600 --> 57:08.800\nepisode eight that had Jess McKenna from off book the musical podcast. She's so\n\n57:08.800 --> 57:12.480\ngood. She was a lawyer. We wanted to have an episode that was kind of like the\n\n57:12.480 --> 57:15.960\nepisode. Thank you so much where Matt gorelly came on our podcast and was\n\n57:15.960 --> 57:20.080\nthe skeleton Gary, the lawyer, but we couldn't get him for that episode. So we\n\n57:20.080 --> 57:24.640\nhad a different court case episode and I was really worried because if you guys\n\n57:24.640 --> 57:27.880\nlisten to the podcast, Matt gorelly really killed that episode and he really\n\n57:27.880 --> 57:32.640\nnailed it. Just throwing. Is he from Orange is the new black Mac gorelly? No,\n\n57:32.640 --> 57:38.760\nhe's from U. C. B. Awesome. I don't know exactly what he's. That's perfect. Matt\n\n57:38.760 --> 57:43.360\ngirl. He's a yeah, but he was.

01:10:43.520\nThey're filthy.\n\n01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:44.520\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520\nThey're tattered.\n\n01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.320\nThat's why you got to bring your own booties, Jackson.\n\n01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:58.440\nAnd 40% of the house touring consumer is going to put on those booties, under fucking duress,\n\n01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.760\nshuffle around your already dirty ass house, who you kidding?\n\n01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:11.600\nAnd by the way, I want to see your backyard, bitch.\n\n01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.000\nWhat do I got to schedule my feet for?\n\n01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.600\nI'm trying to give you millions of dollars.\n\n01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.080\nI want to flow around.\n\n01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.600\nThat's part of the whole house experience.\n\n01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600\nThat's what you got to bring your...\n\n01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.360\nWhen I go into the living room...\n\n01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.480\nYou got to bring your own booties.\n\n01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.480\nYou got to bring them.\n\n01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480\nNo, it doesn't.\n\n01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.640\nYou're not hearing me.\n\n01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.640\nBooties don't matter.\n\n01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.040\nThey're called shoes.\n\n01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.360\nYour feet go where your heart goes or you're not buying a house.\n\n01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.800\nThey had two baskets of booties at this place, the front door and the back door.\n\n01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800\nI went in the backyard.\n\n01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.960\nI was like, oh, it's a saltwater pool.\n\n01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.560\nI got the booties out.\n\n01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:52.760\nI'm not going to walk out to see the pool, unless I forget the most important thing that\n\n01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.400\nyou want to be on my mind is my feet and my booties.\n\n01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.200\nSo I can put them in the outgoing basket.\n\n01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:08.240\nI have my freedom around the backyard, collecting all kinds of AIDS grass and dog shit.\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:13.400\nOh, no, my dirty, dirty human society feet.\n\n01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.760\nOh, your backyard's all over my feet.\n\n01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.640\nAnd then you're supposed to go like, oh, I'm going to go, let's go back in and let's look\n\n01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.920\nat that laundry room again.\n\n01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.960\nDon't forget to scrub up for surgery.\n\n01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.120\nOf course I did it wrong.\n\n01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.840\nI went all around the backyard in the booties.\n\n01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840\nEveryone does that.\n\n01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.680\nI was going to say half of the people do that.\n\n01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.200\nBy the way, the other half of the people, why are you so experienced at house hunting?\n\n01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.240\nJust buy a fucking house.\n\n01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.440\nNot the most valued customers.\n\n01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.560\nYou know who you want coming to your open house?\n\n01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.480\nSomeone who goes to so few open houses, they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n\n01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480\nYou know why?\n\n01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.200\nBecause that motherfucker buys houses.\n\n01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.960\nSo he don't go to a lot open once.\n\n01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960\nI want to know.\n\n01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.400\nHe's too busy living in them and buying them.\n\n01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.680\nSo he ain't got no booty etiquette.\n\n01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.560\nThat's my favorite Sir Mix-a-Lot song.\n\n01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.640\nYou got to put some papers down for that booty brown, that booty brown.\n\n01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640\nBooty etiquette.\n\n01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.320\nI like to put the tissue cover on my shoes.\n\n01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.600\nWhat's the dopest thing you've seen in a house and what's the shittiest, like most\n\n01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:29.480\nlow budget shit that you've seen somebody try to ask for?\n\n01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.200\nI haven't.\n\n01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:38.440\nI've just seen some stuff where we looked at a house today and I was like, this man\n\n01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.040\nis gay and Hispanic.\n\n01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:46.120\nThere was no photos or anything.\n\n01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.000\nLike super upper class.\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.560\nI was just like, it's amazing how your house can express the amount of anxiety you're under\n\n01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.400\neven while being incredible.\n\n01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.560\nThe expression of floor space and like the work you've had done in your house and stuff.\n\n01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560\nI don't know.\n\n01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560\nI can't.\n\n01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.360\nBut like when you open the door and going straight back to a pool that has like a waterfall\n\n01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.160\nlike pouring, you know, like one of those like waterfall things, it's just sort of like,\n\n01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.160\nlike.\n\n01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.080\nIt just screams Hispanic.\n\n01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.720\nWell, well, no, that wasn't that.\n\n01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.360\nI'm sorry I hit that hot button by identifying people.\n\n01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.960\nMy point was that I was like conjuring this person in my head because I was like the neighborhood\n\n01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.520\nthat we're in is so stressful.\n\n01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.640\nIf you, it's like these beautiful houses, but then you were like on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.920\nSo imagine going to work every day and like you, like you're like 15 minutes, oh, it takes\n\n01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.680\nme 15 minutes to get to Burbank or whatever.\n\n01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.960\nAnd then you like your first stop is Hollywood Boulevard where you're just like, it could\n\n01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.560\nbe seven minutes before you can make a left turn.\n\n01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:00.440\nI just, and then, and then, so then the houses that are in some of these places, you're like,\n\n01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440\noh, okay.\n\n01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.200\nSo that's all that stress is manifesting itself.\n\n01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.720\nIt's like popping like popcorn inside of here.\n\n01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.360\nAnd then I, and then I project a few things like I, yes, I went ethnic because I was thinking\n\n01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.120\nlike Catholic and like, I was just thinking like this person's exploding inside and I\n\n01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.080\nwonder where they're moving to and I don't want their house because I don't want to wear\n\n01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.080\nno booties.\n\n01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.560\nWait, this is a booty house?\n\n01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.560\nNo, it wasn't actually a booty house.\n\n01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.360\nWhat's the, have you seen somebody who's been trying to patch up shit?\n\n01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.000\nHave you seen any houses where they're like clearly off asking for too much money and they've\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.800\nduct taped like a jacuzzi to a back wall?\n\n01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:35.800\nNo.\n\n01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800\nNo.\n\n01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.840\nAre people out there fairly, are they being fair or are they being like just trying to\n\n01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.000\nget this money right now?\n\n01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.380\nOur favorite place is like, has been on the market for hundreds of days.\n\n01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.000\nSo we keep on going like, well, what, who got murdered there?\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.680\nLike what's the, what's the ghost?\n\n01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.880\nYou know, like, um, and yeah, but that's, there's nothing apparent.\n\n01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.200\nMy house, the last one, you bring inspectors in and they don't find anything, but then\n\n01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:09.480\nyou still find out you're fucked, uh, uh, termites and I mean inspectors can find that\n\n01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:16.200\nshit, but like, whatever, why, how close, how close are you to, uh, are you tired yet?\n\n01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.640\nAre you like, no, I would look for a house forever because I'm like, I like my, I like\n\n01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.800\nthe house I have now and I keep going like, I know I'm counting on my fingers.\n\n01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.440\nI want to get mad at my house.\n\n01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.400\nIf I move into a house from what I'm in, I'm 46 years old, the next house I move into,\n\n01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.320\nit's not, you know, it's not like overwhelmingly possible I'm going to die in it, but like\n\n01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:43.760\nif it's cool enough, like maybe I could like, like, and I would like to get like mad at\n\n01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.760\nmy house.\n\n01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.000\nLike I would like to experience like, what the fuck, where the fuck did I put the goddamn\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.720\nscissors?\n\n01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.360\nHow many goddamn hallways are there in this goddamn, you know, I just want to feel a little\n\n01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.920\nbit of like over, oh, I got too much house.\n\n01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.760\nLike a little too much house.\n\n01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760\nRight.\n\n01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.920\nDo you want rooms that you don't even use?\n\n01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:12.040\nLike just like, like, just, I'm going to use them, you know, with VR be anything.\n\n01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.360\nYou know, you're going to end up, that's a room right there, you know, burn a, burn a\n\n01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:23.840\nroom, everybody, your next house needs an extra room, VR is coming, coming strong.\n\n01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:32.800\nNow, by my count, because here, Cody and I, we, here's our dream, this is what we want.\n\n01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.240\nWe want a master bedroom that we're going to, it's going to be like a, it's just for\n\n01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:45.040\nus, it's so, so far this tracks, yeah.\n\n01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:51.000\nBut it's not our, our personal bedrooms, it's our hotel room, where we spend all of our\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.600\ntime as a couple, you know, we, we watch Netflix in there, we do everything that we're doing\n\n01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.320\nin our master bedroom right now, but like, because Cody will now be moving in with me\n\n01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:08.920\nofficially, like we want to, we want to weatherproof that, that concept.\n\n01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:16.680\nSo we'll each have bedrooms that contain all our clothes, and I, and it has to have a bed,\n\n01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.680\nbecause otherwise it's not a bedroom, like, like, like, because the, this, the master\n\n01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:26.520\nbedroom has to be like a place that you're not necessarily, you, you don't necessarily\n\n01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.120\nhave to be, and then, super dope to devote a part of your house to straight intimacy\n\n01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.040\nand togetherness is great, because then if Cody's like, oh, what is this, a wrapper from\n\n01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.920\nyour protein bar or whatever, I, like, I won't be like, oh, god damn it, mom, like, it's\n\n01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:47.200\nlike, because when you're staying in a hotel, it's easier to, to just feel like you're\n\n01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:52.280\nboth on the same team, like no, neither person is like, well, I'm going to work some shit\n\n01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.160\nout now, you know, it's like you're both, both in this space that's like designed for\n\n01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160\nyour comfort.\n\n01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.320\nIf I had my way, I'd be like, like Jackie Gleason and all the, like the honeymooners,\n\n01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.480\nthey all lived in penthouses in New York hotels, where they were making the honeymoon,\n\n01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:11.160\nand they just lived in hotels, and the whole top floor was their crib, and every day they\n\n01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.080\ngo to work, they come back, sheets are clean, everything's good to go.\n\n01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.760\nI would love that, like just a hotel living, because I'm never home.\n\n01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.600\nI have an apartment that I pay a fortune for, and I'm never there.\n\n01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.600\nBurglars.\n\n01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600\nIs that right?\n\n01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.600\nOh, god damn it.\n\n01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.600\nOh, Jesus.\n\n01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600\nYeah, it's pretty fun.\n\n01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.160\nBack doors always unlocked, just get right in there.\n\n01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.400\nWhen that guy, like, drove through my garage and my insurance company put me up in a hotel\n\n01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.280\nfor a couple of weeks, it was like, yeah, it was fun.\n\n01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.800\nI got a taste of that life.\n\n01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.320\nLike we left with a couple of days available, though, we were kind of like, okay, we can\n\n01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.080\ngo home now, they fixed the garage, we're like, should we just stay here?\n\n01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.000\nI guess it would be weird if we stayed here, but.\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:01.600\nThat's where we did the Rob Schrab with Mike Ravelo's photography song.\n\n01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:14.400\nAnd if I haul all of my bags up the stairs, I will bring them to you.\n\n01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:24.720\nAnd if you call, you call on my bag service, because I am bringing those bags to you.\n\n01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.600\nAll right, all right, we're close.\n\n01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.600\nWe have.\n\n01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.600\nI'll take it.\n\n01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600\nYeah, I'll take it.\n\n01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600\nWe'll get there.\n\n01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.320\nIt's crazy when we actually learn the words to these songs.\n\n01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.320\nIt's the bag service.\n\n01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.680\nWe can't afford that shit.\n\n01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:37.680\nThe bag service.\n\n01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.680\nThey're called bell hops.\n\n01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.680\nBellman.\n\n01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.680\nOkay.\n\n01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.800\nWell, bag service, look, global warming.\n\n01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.800\nI think it's a lie.\n\n01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:56.920\nThis is terrible times we live in where people are just too tired to be to laugh.\n\n01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.720\nThey're like, that might be true.\n\n01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.320\nI give up.\n\n01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.680\nIf I talked about my beefs about hotel rooms, little things that I say in a lot of hotels,\n\n01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.240\nhave I talked about the toilet paper thing?\n\n01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240\nYeah.\n\n01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.040\nYou don't like the folding the little air out.\n\n01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:15.520\nAnd now they got the thing where you go into the fucking tissue paper and they put a million\n\n01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.000\nthings and make a big like Magnolia Blossom.\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nLike there's 11 tissues that you've just handled after cleaning somebody else's poop, but I'm\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.400\nnot going to use any of these.\n\n01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.760\nYou're always wasting them.\n\n01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.800\nI'm sure there's a difference that could be split, but if the alternative is that new\n\n01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:38.360\nrole where you're in charge of unshucking the fucking, you know what I'm talking about\n\n01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360\ngirls.\n\n01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.360\nThen you take that off.\n\n01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.400\nYou got to fucking claw that shit like a cat.\n\n01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.880\nHave I talked about the fucking do not disturb thing that falls off?\n\n01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.520\nMost doors and hotels have this fucking smooth, curvilinear kind of thing.\n\n01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.720\nAnd you put the do not disturb on because I don't want, I don't need the housekeeping\n\n01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.720\nto come.\n\n01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.040\nI've been there for two or three days.\n\n01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.040\nI don't need new towels.\n\n01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.040\nI'm fine.\n\n01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.160\nLike I need one disgusting, gross, gross person, disgusting.\n\n01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.560\nNo, I'm sleeping the street like a fucking tidy.\n\n01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560\nI'm tidy.\n\n01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.080\nAnd it's called being green, by the way.\n\n01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.080\nIt's called being homeless.\n\n01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.640\nYou're a fucking monster and you fucking put the do not disturb thing on so you don't\n\n01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.320\nhave to waste anybody's time or energy and cleansers and water to wash the things and\n\n01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.320\nall the shit.\n\n01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.320\nAnd then you leave.\n\n01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.600\nWho has ever been like all the hotel waters was making this drought for real hotels.\n\n01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600\nWaste tons of water.\n\n01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.600\nOkay.\n\n01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.600\nOh yeah.\n\n01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.600\nWe can't get enough.\n\n01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.600\nYeah.\n\n01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:32.600\nThey fucking love water.\n\n01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600\nAnd you close.\n\n01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.600\nThey thirsty.\n\n01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.600\nAnd you close the door.\n\n01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.280\nYou put the fucking do not disturb thing on the thing, which is a round little hole on\n\n01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:45.320\na curvy thing handle and you'd leave and the door shuts and it falls off every fucking\n\n01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320\ntime.\n\n01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.320\nYeah, it really does.\n\n01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.320\nAnd then when you shut the door is like, is the do not disturb thing on the ground\n\n01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.720\nsaying please come in.\n\n01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720\nYeah.\n\n01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720\nYou gotta fucking check it.\n\n01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.560\nIt fucking is like just make a do not disturb thing that hangs on the goddamn door.\n\n01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560\nYeah.\n\n01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:01.320\nA lot of times they do, but like then the handle designs aren't like they're like, yeah, this\n\n01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.320\nis good.\n\n01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.880\nAlso, fucking hotel TV remotes can go fuck themselves forever in a day that they don't\n\n01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880\nwork.\n\n01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.440\nIt's a travel hack that you could bring your own remote sometimes and they just use it\n\n01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.240\nyour own remote, which is a weird thing if I know I'm going to a Marriott, I bring my\n\n01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240\nMarriott remote.\n\n01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.240\nOh yeah.\n\n01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.240\nOkay.\n\n01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240\nThat's the fix.\n\n01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.240\nYeah.\n\n01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.960\nI wish I could go back to that one city that had the vending machines that were all\n\n01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.320\nlinked by a Tony Stark credit network.\n\n01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320\nWhat was that call?\n\n01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320\nDo you remember?\n\n01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320\nDenver?\n\n01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320\nWhere was it?\n\n01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.320\nIt wasn't PayPal.\n\n01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.120\nIt was like you could buy an account to an app and you were just like subscribed to all\n\n01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.520\nvending machines in the city.\n\n01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.200\nYou're like snack Tarzan.\n\n01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.400\nYou could just walk around and vending machines and be like, hey, you want some candy?\n\n01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:55.160\nLike, like you can have it like no transaction necessary just like it's on your tab.\n\n01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.920\nWas it pay range?\n\n01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.480\nThat sounds familiar because there's this one soda machine in Griffith Park that uses\n\n01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.160\npay range and it's oh boy.\n\n01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.920\nSometimes I'll drive out there just to get myself a nice Pepsi.\n\n01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920\nHmm.\n\n01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.080\nIt's a beautiful drive.\n\n01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.720\nI see a coyote just to get a Pepsi.\n\n01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:19.080\nI kick its ass also there's a new culture and hotels in my experience is that everyone\n\n01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.160\nyou walk through and there's 11 valet guys.\n\n01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160\nThere's 11 Bellman.\n\n01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.120\nThere's 11 hotel like receptionists.\n\n01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:31.840\nThere's 3000 people standing by the elevator and every one of them, every time you walk\n\n01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.680\nby, even if you just went past them a second ago, they all have to say good morning or\n\n01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.040\ngood afternoon or hello to you and it's like, can we just dispense with that?\n\n01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.520\nLike I don't need to have to have to touch base with 40 people every time I go this way\n\n01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520\nor that way.\n\n01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.320\nThese are my problems.\n\n01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.560\nI like it.\n\n01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.000\nMeanwhile, the world is on fire.\n\n01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:03.280\nI think that all hotels, bars should be open from ever six a.m. to two a.m.\n\n01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.280\nYeah.\n\n01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.280\nNot in Tennessee.\n\n01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.280\nTennessee.\n\n01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.280\nThey don't even fuck it.\n\n01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.920\nThey don't open until like, like never on Sunday, like you can't get a bloody drink.\n\n01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:16.960\nYou're like going, you're selling me a bed.\n\n01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.040\nSo if you're going to have a bar in your place, then it would stand to reason that it shouldn't\n\n01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.080\nbe like baker's hours.\n\n01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.640\nLike your bar should be like part of the, like you're in the pillowcase business.\n\n01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.680\nYou're in the toilet paper business.\n\n01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.680\nYou touch the stuff that touches my butthole.\n\n01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.000\nYour bar should be open.\n\n01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.960\nIt should be the reason I don't go out in Denver tonight.\n\n01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.320\nI got a hotel to come back to and I totally approve.\n\n01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.800\nMake it all fucking a card only swipey swipe.\n\n01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.400\nYou know, no one's going to come to your fucking hotels bar to get drunk when they live in\n\n01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400\nyour city.\n\n01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400\nStop.\n\n01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.000\nStop trying to make that business happen.\n\n01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.040\nIt's like when you go to a Starbucks and they don't have a bathroom and you're like,\n\n01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.120\nyou sell something that makes people piss and shit.\n\n01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.520\nHave you lost your mind?\n\n01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:12.280\nPlease have one guy or lady or, well, it doesn't matter anything.\n\n01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280\nThat was very welcome.\n\n01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.280\nThank you.\n\n01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.280\nThank you.\n\n01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.280\nYou're welcome is what I should be saying.\n\n01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:17.280\nWhy am I saying thank you?\n\n01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.280\nYou're welcome.\n\n01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.800\nLook what I did.\n\n01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:28.680\nHave a person who is there like hotels are the darkest part of your life.\n\n01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.560\nThey're transitory.\n\n01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.320\nYou wake up with a head wound.\n\n01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.400\nYou don't know where you're going.\n\n01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.480\nYou don't know where you've been.\n\n01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.440\nYou might have scabies the next day.\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.120\nYou're only in a hotel because your life is like it's moving.\n\n01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.600\nIt's moving, baby.\n\n01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.480\nThe bar, every bar needs to be open.\n\n01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.160\nYou need to be able to sidle up to it.\n\n01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.360\nIt's just a living wage.\n\n01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.560\nGive the one person a living wage for two shifts so that there's always a person there.\n\n01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.280\nYes, it's true.\n\n01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:07.520\nSometimes for hours on end, no one will be there wanting to drink.\n\n01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.560\nThat's what's cool about a bar is when you get to it, it's empty but it's already open\n\n01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:19.320\nand there's just a creepy dude washing a glass and it's like the open bar and you walk up\n\n01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.320\nto it.\n\n01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:21.600\nYou've become Dennis Wolfberg right now.\n\n01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.200\nI don't know if no one's going to get that reference but Google Dennis Wolfberg or YouTube\n\n01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.200\nrather.\n\n01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.200\nI agree.\n\n01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:33.000\nSo airports, airports, your bar should be open 24 motherfucking hours a day.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.320\nWait, aren't they on the VIPs?\n\n01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320\nHuh?\n\n01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.320\nAren't the VIP bars?\n\n01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.320\nUsually.\n\n01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.120\nThe VIP lounges, Brandon, let me tell you what a VIP lounge is.\n\n01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.320\nYou walked into a fucking bear trap here, Brandon.\n\n01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:55.360\nA VIP lounge is three Canadian flight attendants asking you for eight forms of ID so that you\n\n01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:02.800\ncan maybe have some pop off vodka with your olives, six hours from now, when the fucking\n\n01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:17.440\nbar opens and it's not a bar, it's a salad bar, but VIP lounges can orally minister my\n\n01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.440\nprivates.\n\n01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.680\nCan I get an amen?\n\n01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:24.680\nWe'll get back to that.\n\n01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:33.520\nIf any of you all here in the crowd or anyone that listens to us over the listener thingies,\n\n01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.560\nif you ever fly out of Burbank and it's an early flight, I almost hate to tell you this.\n\n01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:46.800\nThe only thing I like about Guy Fieri is that his fucking bar, Burp, sorry, my Lacroix\n\n01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.800\nBurp there.\n\n01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.800\nLacroix, how do you say?\n\n01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800\nSure.\n\n01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.080\nOr is it Guy Fieri?\n\n01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.080\nIs he French?\n\n01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.080\nGuy Fieri.\n\n01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.080\nOr Fieri.\n\n01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080\nRight.\n\n01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.120\nBecause it's Guy de Mopassant, but it's Guy Fieri.\n\n01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.120\nThis one.\n\n01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.120\nYeah.\n\n01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:08.320\nSo the guys, there's both terminals and the two little tiny terminals at the Burbank airport\n\n01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.600\nhave guys.\n\n01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.480\nThey're open at seven and they fucking serve booze and they have Frenette Bronca and if\n\n01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.000\nyou get a Bloody Mary, say no garnish because if you get it with garnish, there's no alcohol\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.040\nin it because there's 9,000 things inside it.\n\n01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.560\nSo that's what I will give to you, our Harmontown listeners.\n\n01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.240\nIf you fly out of Burbank, go straight to Guy's Crack-a-Don, it's open and you can get\n\n01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.560\nfucking wasted.\n\n01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.600\nAnd I wouldn't eat the food because you're probably going to have popcorn and shrimp\n\n01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.280\nand someone's going to yell at you and have spiky blonde hair.\n\n01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.280\nThat's great fun.\n\n01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.320\nSome people don't understand the point of a bar.\n\n01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:49.560\nIf you watch The Shining, hear him out everybody.\n\n01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.720\nLet the man talk.\n\n01:29:51.720 --> 01:30:03.720\nThen Mr. Shining, Jack Torrance, goes to the bar and he has a conversation with the\n\n01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:09.200\nBritish guy and then he's like, I don't know where, and the British guy is like, but you've\n\n01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:16.200\nalways been here and you'll always be, I always, when I watch that I'm like, I'm thirsty.\n\n01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.520\nI know it's supposed to be creepy, but it's like, the bars are supposed to be, it's\n\n01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:31.560\nsupposed to be about, it's like a self-imposed, one of those things, what do they call those\n\n01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:37.320\nthings in the center of like a puritan town where you put your hands in your head.\n\n01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.840\nIt's like a self-imposed stock.\n\n01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.840\nPillaring.\n\n01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:51.000\nYou go like, I'm going to, I'm a bad person, I'm in a dark place.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.680\nI'm never going to be in a light place and then you go to the bar and then you park it\n\n01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:04.520\nand then you like, you wind down the gears that would otherwise, who knows what they\n\n01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.520\nwould do.\n\n01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:06.520\nWe don't even know.\n\n01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.360\nThank God for bars.\n\n01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.360\nThere's none.\n\n01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.360\nWe're all doomed.\n\n01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:17.520\nI feel like the Rustic and you Rustic in the old drawing room, that's the bar from, we\n\n01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.520\ndon't shut them out.\n\n01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.520\nDo we not shut them out?\n\n01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.520\nNo.\n\n01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.520\nOkay.\n\n01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.520\nDamn.\n\n01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:27.720\nThey got go wings, though you guys have those wings, but I feel like those places are like\n\n01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.520\nthat is kind of the creepy bar where you feel at home.\n\n01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.040\nWhat's going on with this place next door?\n\n01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.040\nAre they going to be?\n\n01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.040\nThey were open before the show.\n\n01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:39.320\nAre they going to be open after the show?\n\n01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320\nI'm sure they are.\n\n01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.760\nIt's catching them when they're open.\n\n01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:47.560\nWe've been trying to coordinate a thing where I know it was like there was a, but do you\n\n01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.800\nknow if they're going to be open?\n\n01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.800\nOkay.\n\n01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800\nGod damn it.\n\n01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800\nSteve might know.\n\n01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.800\nSteve Levy might know.\n\n01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.800\nWhy are you so happy?\n\n01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.240\nYou're so happy that you're excited to do it.\n\n01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.040\nYeah, because I know in the past they've been trying to coordinate a thing where we all\n\n01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:06.240\ngo over there afterwards or whatever.\n\n01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.320\nYeah, because now we're not drawing room adjacent anymore.\n\n01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.360\nBecause there's no place to go over here.\n\n01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.320\nIf anyone ever goes to Vegas and people talk shit about going to Vegas because Vegas can\n\n01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.160\nbe a nightmare, there's a little bar way off this trip called Champagne's Cafe.\n\n01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:22.320\nIt used to be called Tony's Champagne's Cafe.\n\n01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.240\nI think it's just called Champagne's.\n\n01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:29.480\nIt's like the drawing room and it's 24 hours a day and it's always just chill.\n\n01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.080\nIt's fucking great.\n\n01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.800\nYou walk in there, you can go in there at 4 a.m. and it's just like there's eight people\n\n01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.800\nthere.\n\n01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.800\nIt's not ever crazy.\n\n01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.120\nI love it.\n\n01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:45.520\nThere was a double down if you want to really get it down.\n\n01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.520\nThe double down?\n\n01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520\nTell the story about going in.\n\n01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.400\nYou know the double down saloon in Vegas?\n\n01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.800\nAnybody?\n\n01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.800\nOne person raised their hand?\n\n01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.800\nYeah.\n\n01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.800\nIt's instead of clapping.\n\n01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.800\nI like that choice.\n\n01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.360\nIt's a 24-hour dive bar.\n\n01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.120\nI went in there one time at 3 or 4 a.m. by myself in a suit, sat down at the bar, I'm\n\n01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.120\nlike, this is going to be a bummer.\n\n01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.120\nI've been here a hundred times.\n\n01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.120\nIt's always been fun.\n\n01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.080\nThis is going to be the one night where it's going to suck ass.\n\n01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:14.240\nIt's graffiti and there's punk rock music and the men's room is really just terrible.\n\n01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:19.320\nIt's like being like an episode of Locked Up Abroad.\n\n01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.160\nA dude comes in and he's driven in a Bentley.\n\n01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.440\nHe looked like Daniel Craig, but like a little heftier and...\n\n01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.080\nOh, Robert Kraft.\n\n01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080\nToo soon.\n\n01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:39.480\nAnd he comes in with a bunch of great-looking girls, puts a bunch of hundreds on the bar,\n\n01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:49.320\na sandwich bag of cocaine, a ziplock bag of coke, and just passes out.\n\n01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.720\nHe thought it was the police station?\n\n01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.240\nHe walked in and he goes, this is money for them.\n\n01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.240\nHere's all the coke.\n\n01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.640\nI'm going to fucking take a little nappy time.\n\n01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:04.400\nAnd he's wearing a fucking bitching suit and outside he had like a Bugatti or a Bentley,\n\n01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.800\nsomething awesome outside.\n\n01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.120\nAnd he's like with four or five just like screaming hot girls.\n\n01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.840\nAnd the bartender very casually just took the coke and put it behind the bar, took the\n\n01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840\nmoney.\n\n01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840\nHe's like, what would you like?\n\n01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840\nAnd they all ordered drinks.\n\n01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:16.840\nThere's a corking fee.\n\n01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.840\nExactly.\n\n01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.240\nAnd then there was only like maybe before they had all walked in, there was probably six\n\n01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.240\nother people at the bar.\n\n01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:29.080\nIt's like kind of like a square kind of horseshoe shaped bar, and if that makes sense.\n\n01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.640\nAnd a few minutes later, he poured all the drinks and then gave everybody a black cocktail\n\n01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:41.360\nnapkin with a giant rail of coke on it and put it all out for everybody at the bar.\n\n01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.920\nMe, that guy over there, that lady over there, all the girls.\n\n01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:53.400\nI'm talking about like a golf pencil size rail of coke.\n\n01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.400\nAnd it was for everybody.\n\n01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.400\nYeah.\n\n01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.840\nAnd so the guy's just fucking fast asleep right next to me and we have a good time and\n\n01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.880\nhe wakes up about like two hours later and we're all having the time of our lives.\n\n01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:06.000\nAnd he goes, all right, let's go back to my place then.\n\n01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.240\nAnd we all get into cars.\n\n01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:09.680\nWait, now you're with the guy?\n\n01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.680\nHe went with you.\n\n01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.440\nYou're with Rip Van Winkle?\n\n01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.640\nHe needed his fucking Daniel Craig James Bond.\n\n01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.320\nYou like inserted yourself into his memento movie.\n\n01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:24.560\nI was simply sitting at the seat next to where he sat down and this all played out.\n\n01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.560\nThen we went to his crib.\n\n01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.120\nYeah, but that's the part that I'm saying, like, yeah, you would, you know, he invited\n\n01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.280\neverybody there because there was like eight of us and he goes like, oh, fucking, we're\n\n01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.280\ngoing back to my place.\n\n01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280\nLet's have a good time.\n\n01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.440\nAnd you're like, and he gets in his Bentley.\n\n01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.440\nThat's when I realized he's driving like a like $400,000 car outside.\n\n01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:41.840\nYou had me at driving.\n\n01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840\nYeah.\n\n01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840\nWhat does he do?\n\n01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.160\nHe's the guy that was asleep.\n\n01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.160\nHe took a nap.\n\n01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.520\nHe was too drunk to be awake.\n\n01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.040\nNo, he was tired, Dan.\n\n01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.840\nAnd now he's awake and now he's ready to drive.\n\n01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.120\nSo now we all fuck off to his place.\n\n01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.120\nIt's like a respawn.\n\n01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.080\nAnd it's like, it's like, I don't know, like five or six minutes off the strip.\n\n01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.280\nWe get into the place.\n\n01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.560\nIt's a penthouse and I'm not joking.\n\n01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.600\nThis sounds like one of those Jeff Davis stories that people are going to say didn't\n\n01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.600\nhappen.\n\n01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:05.600\nDoes it?\n\n01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.880\nHe had an indoor pool and an outdoor pool on the roof of the goddamn building.\n\n01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.400\nHis place was the entire roof of the building and there was a full like, like a pool the\n\n01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:18.560\nsize of the stage and then an outdoor pool.\n\n01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:24.640\nAnd we just fucking like did blow and drank and like, like until noon and I don't know\n\n01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.640\nhis name.\n\n01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.640\nI don't remember.\n\n01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:32.480\nWhy didn't you ask?\n\n01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.120\nI think, I think he composed for Black Panther.\n\n01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.120\nNo.\n\n01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.120\nI do.\n\n01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.560\nHe was certainly wealthy.\n\n01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.360\nBut I'm saying like, that's a good bar.\n\n01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.040\nThe drawing room at 3 a.m.\n\n01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.640\nThe drawing room just, I went another time in the drawing room, double down, I mean,\n\n01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640\nthe double down in Vegas.\n\n01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.640\nI went in there again.\n\n01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.640\n3 a.m.\n\n01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.040\nYou want, you want, you want to let the bar marinate.\n\n01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:54.040\nDon't go there before midnight.\n\n01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:57.680\nLike go, like go there after two o'clock after the bars or the bands are done.\n\n01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680\nI went in there, sat alone again.\n\n01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.360\nThis is not going to be fun.\n\n01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.920\nLike 20 roller derby lesbians came in and they were selling t-shirts and they just were\n\n01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:12.040\nharassing me and mad at me because I was like a straight guy and they were just talking\n\n01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.880\nshit and like just throwing ice cubes at me or whatever.\n\n01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.880\nThis is in Nevada.\n\n01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.880\nYeah.\n\n01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:17.880\nThis is Las Vegas.\n\n01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:18.880\nIt's a town in Nevada.\n\n01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:22.960\nAnd I don't know why I like I'm a fed.\n\n01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960\nWas this in Nevada?\n\n01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.960\nNo.\n\n01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.960\nNo.\n\n01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:29.960\nI mean, he is snitching though.\n\n01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.760\nIt's important.\n\n01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.760\nWas it in Nevada?\n\n01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.760\nNo.\n\n01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.760\nThis is a bar.\n\n01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.480\nAll we have to do is track down a house with two pools in it and this motherfucker going\n\n01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:38.480\nto jail.\n\n01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.840\nIt's a bar in Logan, Utah.\n\n01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.280\nNo, it's a bar in between like the hard rock and the airport.\n\n01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.280\nYou could walk to either.\n\n01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.280\nI thought I might have been drawing there a bunch.\n\n01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.280\nYeah, the double down.\n\n01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.080\nWe lost Dino for two days there once.\n\n01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.080\nWe didn't lose him.\n\n01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.040\nWe went somewhere other than there and when we came back he was there.\n\n01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.840\nWe called at Dino like, Dino, where are you?\n\n01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.400\nAnd he goes, I'm still here.\n\n01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.400\nI'm ugly.\n\n01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:04.440\nAnd he was just, he was crying at the bar because he was ugly.\n\n01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.240\nIt is like, you've been at a bar for 48 hours.\n\n01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.400\nSo all these roller derby lesbians from whatever Vegas team, maybe they're from out of town,\n\n01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.560\nlike there was a tournament or whatever.\n\n01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:21.120\nI don't know how, I bought a t-shirt, then we were friends.\n\n01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:27.480\nI woke up at like the fucking Mandalay Bay or where the fuck was I saying?\n\n01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480\nIn the Shark Tank.\n\n01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480\nOh God.\n\n01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.560\nI woke up at the Mandalay Bay and they were all there.\n\n01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.560\nI was covered in roller derby lesbians just like, it was like, I was Hugh Hefner, if\n\n01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:39.720\nHugh Hefner was into not getting laid.\n\n01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:43.920\nI wish it was just a bunch of drunk lesbians on top of me and they got up in the morning,\n\n01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.560\nwe all had breakfast together and it was the fucking best time.\n\n01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.640\nAgain, double down saloon, best bar in the world.\n\n01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.880\nWhy did we not put all of that in the song?\n\n01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:00.600\nI waited in the fucking men's room one time and there was, it was, I'll just start the\n\n01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:07.720\nstory by saying in the men's room it was exceptionally unclean and I used the ladies\n\n01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:13.080\nroom instead and I come out and a tough little punk rock chick with a wife beat her on, like\n\n01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.080\nhalf my height.\n\n01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.960\nShe's like, you motherfucker, you don't get to fucking use the ladies room, you got your\n\n01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.880\nown fucking ladies room and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's screaming at me, she wants\n\n01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:27.160\nto fucking punch me and I said, hang on, hang on, and I opened up the men's room and there\n\n01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:34.160\nis an inch and a half of brown poop water on the floor and she goes, oh, I'm so sorry,\n\n01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:36.240\ncan I buy you a drink?\n\n01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.320\nShe thought, she thought you were just like, I mean, did she think your threshold was just\n\n01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.720\nnot high enough?\n\n01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:47.000\nOr just taking advantage of, like the women's rooms are normally nicer than the men's rooms.\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.560\nYeah, like someone was in there and you just hopped into the women's room.\n\n01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:54.400\nYeah, I know, I'm just kind of wondering what her, if you opened the door and it was like\n\n01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.120\na regular men's room, which is also disgusting if she would have been like, no, that's the\n\n01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:03.040\npoint, I know why you use the women's room and you're cheating, but because there was\n\n01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.960\nactual doo-doo, she's like, oh, but that's sort of like a fascinating thing because it's\n\n01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.120\nkind of like, if we have any deal breakers, can we get some bathroom police in this place?\n\n01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:17.880\nI was sitting there playing pool and the pool tables, they have like sand traps and water\n\n01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.960\nhazards on them, they're the worst pool tables of all time, they're the most lopsided pool\n\n01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.680\ntables of all time and I was playing with these two gals and friends of mine and there\n\n01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:33.840\nwas these big biker dudes at the bar, like Hell's Angels looking guys and there was four\n\n01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.680\nor five people, like three girls, two guys or vice versa and they were sitting at a table\n\n01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.080\nand about as far as I am from a Spencer, which is like 15 feet, like 18 feet.\n\n01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.160\nYeah, like 15.\n\n01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:51.280\nThere was a trash can and they had a table with like 20 Corona empties on it and they\n\n01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.640\nwere just throwing them into the trash can and trying to bank them off the wall and make\n\n01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:03.720\na bank shot and just bing, like this is all so loud, just clang and then someone goes all\n\n01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.440\nover the floor and now there's just bottles everywhere and the bouncer is a big tough\n\n01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:11.680\nguy and all the bikers just keep looking over the shoulder, kind of rolling their eyes and\n\n01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:18.400\nthey're just throwing glass like across the room and missing half the time and making\n\n01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:26.560\na ton of noise and finally one breaks and the big old like gray bearded like duck dynasty\n\n01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:36.000\nlooking bouncer, the biker that whose street name is caveman or yeah or do socrates.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:45.080\nSo yeah, he gets up and he just kind of reluctantly walks over and he goes, your taxis outside.\n\n01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.680\nOh, shit, Socrates.\n\n01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:48.680\nLike not fuck you.\n\n01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680\nYou're thrown out.\n\n01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.800\nIt's like we called you a car and the people are like, oh, thank you.\n\n01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.680\nWe've been throwing bottles for 20 minutes.\n\n01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.640\nThat's very nice of you that bar.\n\n01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.960\nIt's hard to get thrown out of the double down.\n\n01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.000\nAnd just when they're about to throw you out, all you got to do is double down.\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nThere's a sign.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000\nThere's a bunch of signs.\n\n01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.640\nOne sign says you you puke, you clean and that's that's if you puke, you got to fuck\n\n01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640\nin.\n\n01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.160\nThey give you the fucking mop and the rag and the thing and you got to clean it up.\n\n01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:26.680\nBut at the site next to it says $20 puke insurance, which if you think you're going to puke or\n\n01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.000\nyou think your friends are going to puke, you can buy $20 insurance.\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.360\nAnd if your friend pukes or you puke the bar cleans, does it does the price go up after\n\n01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:38.360\nthe if you didn't buy it before?\n\n01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.640\nIt's like insurance on a bet and blackjack.\n\n01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.800\nWell, then I'm saying if it's the same price after you puke that it if you just turned\n\n01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:48.120\nit in, this is shark tank.\n\n01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.160\nThey should charge 60 bucks if you didn't buy it.\n\n01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:51.160\nI think you got it.\n\n01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.560\nI think you can't buy it at the point.\n\n01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.240\nYou just clean it insurance.\n\n01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.600\nIt's it's it's you puke you clean as before you as if you didn't pay insurance, $20 buys\n\n01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.600\nyou puke insurance.\n\n01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.600\nThe bar will clean up after you before.\n\n01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:03.600\nI know.\n\n01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.600\nYeah.\n\n01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.480\nBut what if you puke and then pay $20?\n\n01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:07.480\nIs that legal?\n\n01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.720\nNo, no, I think you have to right.\n\n01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:10.720\nYeah, that's what I had.\n\n01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:11.960\nThere used to be asked juice.\n\n01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.360\nNow asked juice.\n\n01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.360\nRight there.\n\n01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.600\nThere used to be dreams in the sky.\n\n01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:30.480\nThe ass to me a couple of ass to I will not play this on play this on play this on almost\n\n01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.480\nthere.\n\n01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.480\nThey used to do a thing.\n\n01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:39.640\nI think it used to be the bar mat, the little bar mat, whatever spilled in there.\n\n01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.920\nYou could for like whatever I don't know if they've even charged you for it.\n\n01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.160\nYou had to pay five bucks for it.\n\n01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.440\nThey would just empty the bar mat into a glass and you drank that.\n\n01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:54.400\nBut now I think it's they any bottle that gets below a shot, like the like the drag\n\n01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.760\nof any any bottle could be vodka, whiskey, Kahlua, you know, grenadine, whatever.\n\n01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:04.400\nThey just marry it into the opaque bottle so you have no idea what's in there.\n\n01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.320\nAnd they also have bacon martini, which is just bacon fat floating and vodka, which\n\n01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.280\nI think breaks five laws.\n\n01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.280\nLike like from the FDA.\n\n01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:15.600\nI've had a couple of those if you've had the bacon martini there.\n\n01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:20.720\nI think if you do an anastasia shot, a bacon martini and eat a slim Jim, you get a free\n\n01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.720\nt-shirt.\n\n01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.200\nWhoa, what a deal.\n\n01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:33.680\nBut if you have just you have just one for losing, right, the t-shirt just says like\n\n01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:38.440\nit's not it's the t-shirt definitely doesn't get you anything.\n\n01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.800\nI want to I want to even people who know what the t-shirt represents are like something\n\n01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:45.040\nlike I drink as juice at the devil.\n\n01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.440\nYeah, like I did the following three things.\n\n01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:57.040\nYeah, I was playing pool with two with these two gals and they were they were good looking\n\n01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:01.280\nand they're not great at pool and neither am I, but I'm better than they were.\n\n01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:07.920\nAnd we were playing for drinks, but you should talk and then they weren't that good.\n\n01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.840\nI mean, I'm not that great either, but I was better a little better than they were.\n\n01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:14.200\nSo I'm beating them and there's all these biker dudes at the bar and they're the only\n\n01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.080\ntwo gals in the bar and all these big tough house angels looking dudes are up there like\n\n01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.080\nMongols or whatever.\n\n01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:26.640\nAnd then so I go to the bar to get a drink and I say it and then the toughest looking\n\n01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.120\ndude there goes, hey man, what's the stakes over there?\n\n01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.360\nI said the stakes are high and he goes, what are you playing for?\n\n01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:41.720\nI go if I win, I got a kiss and he goes win one for us.\n\n01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720\nHe was on my side.\n\n01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.720\nIt was very nice.\n\n01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.560\nThey're like lost boys.\n\n01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.560\nThey're adorable.\n\n01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.480\nLet's let's all just get in a big bus and go there right now.\n\n01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.480\nAll right.\n\n01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.480\nOkay.\n\n01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.480\nAll right.\n\n01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480\nSpencer.\n\n01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.480\nHave you ever been there?\n\n01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.480\nOh yeah.\n\n01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.120\nWhen I was there, I ordered a drink and then a girl came in and was like, well, what are\n\n01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:02.120\nyou drinking?\n\n01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.400\nThat's a weird question.\n\n01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.320\nShe was like, yeah, that is, and then I told her why I was drinking.\n\n01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.040\nI thought I could do a Jeff story.\n\n01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.040\nWait for it.\n\n01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:12.040\nWait for it.\n\n01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:17.320\nAnd then she said, thank you, right?\n\n01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:23.560\nDoes anybody, did anybody on my recommendation start watching Love After Lockup?\n\n01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.560\nFuck you guys.\n\n01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.840\nI'm sure plenty of people did, but not here today.\n\n01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.240\nI listened back to my recommendation and I was like, what are you doing?\n\n01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.840\nYou sound like a crackhead.\n\n01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.280\nI guess I was just like extra stammery that night.\n\n01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.280\nI don't know what, it wasn't really a sales pitch that should be successful.\n\n01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:41.280\nTell me about it.\n\n01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.280\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280\nIt's just a great reality show.\n\n01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.800\nIt's people who are pen pals with prisoners and then they're getting out and they're\n\n01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.720\ngoing to marry them and it's just insane, man.\n\n01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.160\nDoes it often work out or what's the batting average on that?\n\n01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.680\nNo, it's chaos.\n\n01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.880\nIt's just chaos because even the people that work out, you're like, that's not working\n\n01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.600\nthem out.\n\n01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.920\nAnd then most of the time you're like, get out of there, girl.\n\n01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:05.920\nGet out of there.\n\n01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.400\nAnd then the girl will just get out of there.\n\n01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.240\nYou're just like, get that Kyron.\n\n01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:16.480\nGive me that Kyron that says that you are out of there, like that you didn't go back\n\n01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.680\nor just, but it's like various combinations, very interesting.\n\n01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.120\nIt's a very slim amount of people that actually, like the population that goes to jail over\n\n01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.280\nand over again is something like three to five percent.\n\n01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.560\nSo you're watching something of like, it is truly just a slice of life.\n\n01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:36.280\nLike you will not see that sort of relationship dynamic again.\n\n01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.880\nThe big headline of the show seems to be that even the sociopaths, because you're like,\n\n01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.680\nboy, you're going to be knee deep and sociopaths on this show, really on both sides of the\n\n01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:53.000\nprison yard, like the people who are going to subscribe to lovers from prison, et cetera.\n\n01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.280\nNo wrong answers, no heroes, no villains.\n\n01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:02.360\nBut you're, you're, you're, you're, well, you're yeah, depending on your definition\n\n01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.480\nof crime, I mean, because it's not a show about what they did to go in prison, but you're\n\n01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.520\ndefinitely watching them like, oh, okay, you're a bad, bad boy, the dude that shot up a house\n\n01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:14.720\nfull of cocaine and then asked his girlfriend to put a knife in her vagina is a villain.\n\n01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:20.160\nBut the, the interesting thing was strangely, strangely specific.\n\n01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:28.520\nThe interesting thing is just, it's just, it's just interesting to me that like, like\n\n01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:35.960\nthe big elephant in the room on the show is okay, like, like, none of the people, including\n\n01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:41.920\nthe prisoners who claim to understand that this happens all the time, but they still\n\n01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.520\nfeel this emotional attachment, it, like, if people, no one in the show seems to understand\n\n01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:53.680\nthat if you're in prison, your entire world is a different context and that you're in,\n\n01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:00.600\nyour value system is different and that, therefore, the people to whom you say, I love you, and\n\n01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:08.320\nlet's make all these plans for the future, like, you're not necessarily a liar or a Superman,\n\n01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.960\nlike, you know, you, you're, what you are as a person who's, who's understanding of\n\n01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:16.120\nlife is completely different from when you're going to get out, but they, they just keep\n\n01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:20.000\nrepeat it, it's, it's sort of, it's just people over and over again going.\n\n01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.560\nWell, think how important and how good or terrible your love letters would be if you\n\n01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.880\nhad 24 hours a day for six years to think about writing a love letter to somebody.\n\n01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.240\nThey also, very typically, they're doing, they all talk about how they, well, look,\n\n01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.600\nyou, you, they, they, they do ten of these at a time and they don't necessarily equate\n\n01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:46.360\nthat with dis, disingenuity, with dishonesty, like, it, the, the, the people on the outside\n\n01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:50.600\nare familiar with the idea, well, I met this person on this site, so the idea that I was\n\n01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:57.560\nthe only one is, is not, it's not a realistic expectation, but more importantly, oh, that,\n\n01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:02.680\nthat was the courting process, was winnowing it down allegedly to just you, but then the\n\n01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.640\nperson they'll say in a talking head, well, I got two over here and one, it's like, the\n\n01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:11.920\ninteresting thing to me is just like picturing people as like vegetation, like if you're,\n\n01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.400\nif you're a human and you're placed in prison and then you just, these roots come out, you\n\n01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:22.760\nknow, these fillet, these, these, these celia, these like little hairs and they're just gonna,\n\n01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:27.280\nthey're just looking for any kind of water because the, then these stories will end up\n\n01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.120\nwith a lot of people going back into the joint because they'll violate their parole or something\n\n01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:35.320\nand as soon as they get in there, they're calling again and it's really hard for the\n\n01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:39.160\ncodependent people on the way out because, on, on the outside because they just went\n\n01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.240\nthrough this whole reality show relationship where they finally figured out that the, the,\n\n01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:49.680\noh, that relationship was, but then as soon as they figure it out, the person's back in\n\n01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:56.120\nprison and giving them exactly the sugar they need, which is calling them collect and asking\n\n01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:03.680\nfor money and it's like this, it's siren call to them, not because they love the person\n\n01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:12.400\nthat much, but because they love the minimization of risk that prison represents for them.\n\n01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:18.600\nAnd I'm so fascinated by that that they're outside and they're less free romantically.\n\n01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:25.160\nThey, they, they're so scared of being hurt and left that they have, they, they, at one\n\n01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.520\npoint, they need barbed wire and walls.\n\n01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:32.000\nThey need barbed wires around the other person, not because they're sadists, but because they're\n\n01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.400\nthat terrified of, of getting hurt and it's like, oh, you're terrified and everyone's\n\n01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:37.400\nlike always scratching.\n\n01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.520\nThey're like, oh, you're terrified of getting hurt, so you're with a convicted felon.\n\n01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:46.320\nBut that's how terrified you can be of, of rejection.\n\n01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.480\nIf you went to prison down, let's say you, you were doing like a big federal stint and\n\n01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.280\nwhat, what would your like role in prison be like, what clique would you run with?\n\n01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.960\nYou know, I'd be the fixer.\n\n01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.960\nThe fixer.\n\n01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:04.280\nNo, I'd be a screaming lipstick man.\n\n01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.480\nWe all know what we would be in prison.\n\n01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.360\nWe're the 60% of the population that will never go to prison.\n\n01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.080\nWe're terrified of the idea.\n\n01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:16.800\nWe celebrate in our jokes and comedy and movies how everyone on the inside is getting raped\n\n01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:23.600\nand the institution likes it that way because we're all thinking, oh my God, that's, some\n\n01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:27.640\nof these, there was a woman who got out and there's a, there's a scene where she, she\n\n01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:33.160\njust got married and she's like, she pulls up outside the prison that she was in and\n\n01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:37.280\nthey're taking pictures of her flipping the prison off and there's a guard out on the\n\n01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:44.200\nperimeter and he's like, what are you doing and she's taking pictures and he's like, don't\n\n01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.720\nget my face in it or something like that, like it's sort of like the, like prison equivalent\n\n01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:55.120\nof going, trying to shoot a movie inside a, a, a Brookstone, but it's like, he's 500\n\n01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.880\nguards away and he's like, just, just keep your camera and he says some Bibble Babble\n\n01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880\nand she's like, what?\n\n01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.880\nI can't hear you.\n\n01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:07.320\nIt goes, I assume you're a, you're an ex felons to take your pictures and get out of here.\n\n01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:13.320\nLike, like, that he's familiar with the fact that this road that he stands there and watches\n\n01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:18.280\nbasically it's just a regular thing that a Camaro pulls up and a man and a woman get\n\n01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.360\nout with a six pack and pose, flipping off this place.\n\n01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.720\nSo here's the thing.\n\n01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:31.720\nI'm watching that and going, honey, don't do the, like, like, I, I wouldn't flip the\n\n01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720\nplace off.\n\n01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.120\nI wouldn't be shocked to find out through the mail a week later that I violated a finger\n\n01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120\nlaw.\n\n01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:45.680\nI, I, that's like, it's like the, the, the way that we employ our penal system is simply\n\n01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:48.800\nto say, are you capable of fear?\n\n01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.640\nIf so, fear this and then we're all afraid and then we have no respect for the people\n\n01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.400\non the inside and the people on the inside are treated like animals and whatever.\n\n01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.400\nSorry.\n\n01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.400\nIt's the end of the show.\n\n01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:03.840\nUh, it's a love after lock up.\n\n01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.400\nThis time, watch it.\n\n01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:09.520\nMy recommendation was good this time.\n\n01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:11.520\nIt was 20% more fluid.\n\n01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:18.440\nI'm telling you, watch one episode of season one of love after lock up and, and tell me\n\n01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:21.760\nthat you didn't want to watch the second episode and I'll be fine.\n\n01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:22.760\nThen I'll accept that.\n\n01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:29.400\nMy new favorite thing is, uh, I got screwed on a flight, uh, like two days ago yesterday.\n\n01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:31.760\nGod, I'm so lost.\n\n01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:34.520\nWe got like five hours of delays and stuff like that.\n\n01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.880\nLooking over the shoulder of whatever the, whatever the person next to you is watching\n\n01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:44.320\non a plane, um, without, without, without the sound on this lady next to me was watching\n\n01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.120\nsome sort of like low rent game of throne stuff.\n\n01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.120\nIt was good.\n\n01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.680\nIt's probably better without the sound.\n\n01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.920\nI just watching these people fucking fucking fight.\n\n01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.320\nIt was great.\n\n01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.320\nDamn.\n\n01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.600\nSo that's my recommendation.\n\n01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.640\nWatch the lady up next to you on the plane.\n\n01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:03.560\nUh, it's called, uh, low level fuck fucking fights.\n\n01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.360\nI always get sucked into that shit.\n\n01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:09.720\nLike I'll see somebody will be eight seats away and they'll be watching some piece of\n\n01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:14.600\nshit like, uh, millennial slapstick that I like, I saw a billboard for and I was like,\n\n01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.720\nI'm not watching fucking bad dog.\n\n01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:22.640\nUh, like, I don't care how many celebrities are the voice of the dog and like, and, but\n\n01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.120\nthen you, you, the, the precisely for that reason that you're like, it's definitely a\n\n01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.000\nmovie you were never going to see.\n\n01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.520\nYou keep seeing scenes and you're like, is Jason Sudeikis in that?\n\n01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:33.920\nAnd you're like, God damn it.\n\n01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.360\nI can't, because you're watching a movie in order.\n\n01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.360\nYou got nothing to do.\n\n01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.080\nAnd then you're like, well, why is she doing aerobics?\n\n01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.080\nIs the dog evil?\n\n01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:46.160\nAnd you're, you're like, what's the animated one where it's like kind of like Mexico.\n\n01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.120\nIt's kind of day of the dead kind of stuff.\n\n01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:49.120\nYeah.\n\n01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.240\nI watched that over, uh, like on the seat next to me with no sound on the person next\n\n01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.240\nto me watching it.\n\n01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:00.960\nIt fucking, I, I, the story, yeah, the story is great.\n\n01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:04.440\nI knew exactly what was going on and I didn't need to hear the words.\n\n01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.200\nIt was like, it was like a beautiful, silent, like, uh, tragedy comedy.\n\n01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.120\nIt was, it was, it was gorgeous.\n\n01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.560\nYou have always told me that you like your Mexicans to shut up.\n\n01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:15.560\nThat's the show.\n\n01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.760\nLadies and gentlemen, what's Spanish for cliffhanger?\n\n01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:20.760\nYeah.\n\n01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:25.520\nI don't think I made myself very clear when I earlier alluded to, oh, you know, it's fun\n\n01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.520\nto house.\n\n01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:27.600\nI could tell someone was gay and Hispanic.\n\n01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.600\nWhat was it?\n\n01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.600\nI'm still like going over that.\n\n01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.960\nI'm like, what, what did you mean?\n\n01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.640\nIt wasn't, it wasn't what you think.\n\n01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:36.640\nYeah.\n\n01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.600\nAnd I was trying to think of who, like, who's the funniest gay Hispanic I know to say,\n\n01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:43.720\nbut it was like, I, like, then I'm helping.\n\n01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:48.240\nMy story was me being like this Angela Lansbury and like feeling like I felt like I knew the\n\n01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.240\nperson.\n\n01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.240\nYeah.\n\n01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.240\nYeah.\n\n01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:52.240\nAnd that person was gay.\n\n01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.240\nAnd Latino.\n\n01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.240\nAnd Latino.\n\n01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.240\nRight.\n\n01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:57.240\nBecause they had a waterfall.\n\n01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.240\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.920\nI was in trouble because then by the time I stopped talking, I was like, oh boy, you\n\n01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.160\njust really, you really did a number on yourself.\n\n01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.000\nBecause all you did was say, I knew a, I know a person by something other than knowing them.\n\n01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.560\nIt's a bad move, brother.\n\n01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.240\nWhat a dumb move.\n\n01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:22.000\nFortunately, we're in the middle of a podcast civil war between the, yeah, the shit's going\n\n01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000\ndown.\n\n01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000\nThose bar bros.\n\n01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000\nThere's some, there's some, there's some crazy shit going down in the true crime community.\n\n01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.320\nI'll tell you that.\n\n01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.320\nTrue crime.\n\n01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.320\nYeah.\n\n01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.480\nI mean, that's kind of the epicenter.\n\n01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.120\nI kind of, I don't want to, I don't want to dip my tender pie into it.\n\n01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.120\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.080\nThere's, there's, there's people beefing on true, true crime.\n\n01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.000\nThere's just some shit that weren't there.\n\n01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000\nMergers last week.\n\n01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000\nMurder.\n\n01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000\nDidn't somebody get purchased for like 230 million?\n\n01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000\nNo, I don't know about nothing about that.\n\n01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000\nOkay.\n\n01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.240\nThat somebody, somebody, somebody in the, somebody in the true crime community posted an Instagram\n\n01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.320\non International Women's Day that, that had this like crazy kind of just white text on\n\n01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:06.920\nblack meme, like, that was just sort of like what, I don't, I don't want to editorialize\n\n01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:07.920\nany of it.\n\n01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:11.400\nI just want to be objective and say like, somebody posted like a, it was just such a\n\n01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:17.880\nstrange thing to post, particularly at International Women's Day, like, like, and then there were\n\n01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:25.880\npeople that, their luminaries, our friends among them, like, going like, hey, this podcast\n\n01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.040\nnetwork, like, is this really, are you proud of this?\n\n01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.320\nAnd then so then the, that, the person in particular got shit canned.\n\n01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:38.680\nSo it's just the age old now within the true crime community, the same schism that's everywhere\n\n01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:43.640\nall the time, which is on one side, you got what the fuck dude, it's called freedom of\n\n01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:47.000\nspeech, it's called due process, all that stuff, and on the other side you have what\n\n01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.800\nthe fuck, it's called empathy, what the fuck is happening, and, and, and never the twain\n\n01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:57.080\nshall meet and everyone shall be unhappy and angry and interesting, but it's, where would\n\n01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:59.920\nI go to find this all play out anyway?\n\n01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920\nI don't know.\n\n01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.960\nI don't, I just, I just, you can't say it because you don't want to be.\n\n01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:09.200\nYou can probably Google true crime podcast, International Women's Day and probably find\n\n01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.200\nsomething.\n\n01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:14.320\nWell, I just, I know, well, here's the thing, I think that I've, I think what I, my point\n\n01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.000\nis that I didn't want to, I didn't want to, I didn't want to get, I don't want to get\n\n01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:23.000\ninvolved as far as like, like, like, but it's, that doesn't mean it's, it's the, it's the\n\n01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.880\nguy, the sword and scale guy, the Mike, Mike, Mike the day.\n\n01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:28.880\nReserve, don't clap.\n\n01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.880\nReserve it!\n\n01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:33.320\nSo, so, like, if you, if that's what, if you want to go, if you want to go look at what\n\n01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:36.440\nI'm talking about, I'm not like, oh, I don't want you to know about it, I'm like, I don't\n\n01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:41.760\nwant to, I don't want to stir anything, I don't want to, I don't want my presence to\n\n01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.260\naffect anything.\n\n01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:46.360\nYou're then, people to watch, Loctur love it up.\n\n01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:49.200\nI want, I want everyone to watch that, so we'll talk to people about something.\n\n01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:54.960\nWhat if, what if, what if shit got so wild between rival true crime podcast that somebody\n\n01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:57.360\nkilled somebody else in a true crime podcast?\n\n01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:00.920\nIt's absolutely going to happen.\n\n02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:04.360\nThere's, there's, there's the, there's the Harmontown Guarantees.\n\n02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:07.400\nThere's as many true crime podcasts as there are people.\n\n02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.000\nSo somebody's going to get whacked, and it's going to be, yeah, it's going to be, yeah.\n\n02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.920\nLast podcast on left, I

I'll be sober and we'll talk about, we'll just talk about\n\n02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.360\ntrue crime.\n\n02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.800\nI've got a couple cases that I don't hear anybody covering enough.\n\n02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:48.280\nThe case of the smashed garage.\n\n02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:49.280\nYeah.\n\n02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.280\nThe case of the.\n\n02:00:50.280 -->
