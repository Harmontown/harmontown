00:00.000 --> 00:10.840
Yes, and welcome to this installment of Harmontown.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.340
I know you're so upset that you're not listening to Jeff Davis right now.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.340
He couldn't be here.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.340
I will be guest comptrolling.

00:16.340 --> 00:17.340
Big shoes to fill.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.540
My name is Brandon Johnson.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.180
We are so glad to see you again.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.180
Let's get started.

00:23.180 --> 00:28.740
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Spencer Prittenton, the Dungeon

00:28.740 --> 00:34.660
Master, King of All Kings, fresh from Martin Luther King Day celebration.

00:34.660 --> 00:35.660
He's still drunk.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.660
Yeah.

00:36.660 --> 00:41.860
Welcome the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:41.860 --> 00:42.860
What can I say?

00:42.860 --> 00:43.860
Welcome back.

00:43.860 --> 00:44.860
Yeah.

00:44.860 --> 00:45.860
Yeah.

00:45.860 --> 00:46.860
Rap.

00:46.860 --> 00:47.860
Yeah.

00:47.860 --> 00:48.860
Rap.

00:48.860 --> 00:52.540
Rap into the beat isn't easy.

00:52.540 --> 00:55.500
George didn't fuck Wheezy without some effort.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.780
He had to put it in and he had to get up in the morning, go to the gym and say, I want

01:00.780 --> 01:01.780
to rap today.

01:01.780 --> 01:04.820
I got to put my effort in and make it my way.

01:04.820 --> 01:08.100
I'm going to rap at the top of the show.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.380
It's just a thing I do.

01:09.380 --> 01:12.660
So you know, got to get the energy up.

01:12.660 --> 01:14.300
Got to keep me on my toes.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.020
So the show is good.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.020
Sup.

01:17.020 --> 01:18.020
What's up?

01:18.020 --> 01:19.020
Yo.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.020
Yo.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.020
Yo.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.020
Rap.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.020
Yo.

01:23.020 --> 01:24.020
Rap.

01:24.020 --> 01:25.020
Yo.

01:25.020 --> 01:26.020
Rap.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.020
Yo.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.020
Rap.

01:28.020 --> 01:32.380
R to the A to the P. That spells rap, at least to me.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.500
It's a word that means to rap.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.500
Rap.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.500
Rap.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.500
Rap.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.500
Rap it.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.500
Rap it.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.500
Rap it.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.500
Everybody's rapping.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.500
Yo.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.500
Rap it.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.500
Yo.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
Rap it.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.500
R-A-P-P-I-A.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.500
Rap it.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
Rap it.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.500
Rap it.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.500
Rap it.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.500
Rap it.

01:52.500 --> 01:56.180
I am.

01:56.180 --> 02:01.660
Gonna spell it another time again.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.300
R-A-P-P-I-A.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.300
Conjugation.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.300
Yo.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.260
Alright, stop.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.260
Alright.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.420
We can do that all night.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.420
Thank you.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.620
We'd like to, I like to rap at the top of the show.

02:13.620 --> 02:14.980
It's not because they think I'm good at rapping.

02:14.980 --> 02:17.060
It's not because I think it's a good way to start the show.

02:17.060 --> 02:20.500
It's because they want to be flat footage as they say in D&D, right?

02:20.500 --> 02:21.500
Yeah.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.300
Don't love that dexterity.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.260
Off guard.

02:24.260 --> 02:26.540
If I come up here knowing what I'm going to do,

02:26.540 --> 02:29.620
then it's death for everybody.

02:29.620 --> 02:30.780
Welcome to the show.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.620
Thank you for paying $5.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.340
If you're watching it right now, thank you for nothing.

02:35.340 --> 02:36.980
If you're listening to it for free,

02:36.980 --> 02:38.060
thank you for your judgment.

02:38.060 --> 02:39.220
Thank you for your judging me.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.940
I make a convenient target.

02:40.940 --> 02:42.420
You're welcome.

02:42.420 --> 02:43.500
I'm not complaining about that.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.300
I'm 45.

02:44.300 --> 02:45.420
All I want to do is get out.

02:45.420 --> 02:48.180
I just want to get out.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.660
I watched the post.

02:50.660 --> 02:51.500
It's bad.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.420
It's a bad movie.

02:53.420 --> 02:57.940
Steven Spielberg is no longer a good director.

02:57.940 --> 03:02.460
I don't know when he was good last.

03:02.460 --> 03:06.100
I know he was good for a good long time

03:06.100 --> 03:09.420
and that he deserves all of the credit in the world

03:09.420 --> 03:12.700
for being a wonderful, wonderful director who

03:12.700 --> 03:15.340
did such things as, for instance,

03:15.340 --> 03:21.180
adapting a book about sharks into anything with empathy.

03:21.180 --> 03:21.860
It was neat.

03:21.860 --> 03:25.020
He would add a couple shots in it, like, oh,

03:25.020 --> 03:28.380
there's a shark in the water, but this guy loves his kid.

03:28.380 --> 03:29.100
Terrific.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.620
Like, we built an empire on this.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.140
OK, I watched the post.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.540
You know, you suck.

03:35.540 --> 03:37.820
It's a bad movie.

03:37.820 --> 03:38.460
It's terrible.

03:38.460 --> 03:39.540
Performances?

03:39.540 --> 03:41.300
Performances bad.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.420
Director's fault.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.420
Good actors.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.020
Got to be the director's fault.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.660
I don't, like, awful.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.940
Tom Hanks is acting like he's doing dinner theater.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.060
He's doing a character.

03:50.060 --> 03:51.860
I don't know what's happening in that movie.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.380
It looks like an impression.

03:54.380 --> 03:58.180
It looks like a crazy person showed up on your doorstep

03:58.180 --> 04:01.700
having seen five minutes of all the president's men

04:01.700 --> 04:03.820
and he's just, like, outside your house,

04:03.820 --> 04:05.100
like, kicking at the door.

04:05.100 --> 04:08.060
It's a horrible, horrible movie.

04:08.060 --> 04:10.660
And if you like it, you're stupid.

04:10.660 --> 04:13.900
And if you nominated it for an award, you're dumb

04:13.900 --> 04:15.220
and you don't deserve that vote.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.740
You got your vote wrong.

04:17.740 --> 04:20.300
You cheated someone out of it.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.180
It's a dumb movie.

04:21.180 --> 04:21.900
It's terrible.

04:21.900 --> 04:22.900
I couldn't finish watching it.

04:22.900 --> 04:23.580
It's awful.

04:23.580 --> 04:24.900
What's next?

04:24.900 --> 04:25.780
Florida Project.

04:25.780 --> 04:26.500
Ripped off.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.820
Totally snubbed.

04:27.820 --> 04:29.140
Fucking what?

04:29.140 --> 04:30.100
You're using kids.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.660
Kids are fucking monsters.

04:31.660 --> 04:32.260
They're animals.

04:32.260 --> 04:33.620
It's like directing cats.

04:33.620 --> 04:34.980
You get a performance out of kids.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.860
You're automatically nominated for best director, period.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.420
It's not nominated.

04:40.420 --> 04:41.700
I don't understand.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.100
I don't get you anymore.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.020
You're an academy.

04:44.020 --> 04:44.900
You have one job.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.820
What else was nominated?

04:51.820 --> 04:52.300
Get out.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.620
Did you finally see Get Out?

04:53.620 --> 04:54.220
Get Out.

04:54.220 --> 04:55.340
I enjoyed very much.

04:55.340 --> 04:56.140
I saw it.

04:56.140 --> 04:57.020
I'm not racist.

04:57.020 --> 04:59.100
I saw it.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.780
I liked it.

05:01.780 --> 05:04.180
Call me by your name.

05:04.180 --> 05:04.500
All right.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.780
Here's the thing, kids.

05:05.780 --> 05:07.380
I don't like it.

05:07.380 --> 05:10.820
All right, let's just look at it this way.

05:10.820 --> 05:13.020
Like, 2000, whatever this is, it

05:13.020 --> 05:14.540
wasn't a year for storytelling.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.100
I get it.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.620
I don't see it.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.780
Apparently, movies are just about hanging out.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.780
And that's fine.

05:22.780 --> 05:26.620
I kind of liked Call Me By Your Name just because you

05:26.620 --> 05:28.940
can tell the director's good.

05:28.940 --> 05:32.580
Three hours to show me that, I don't know.

05:32.580 --> 05:33.580
All right, just look.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.340
You know what?

05:34.340 --> 05:36.340
Fine.

05:36.340 --> 05:37.340
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

05:37.340 --> 05:38.140
Beautiful movie, though.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.060
I just want to shit on Spielberg's head and go,

05:40.060 --> 05:42.500
you should know better.

05:42.500 --> 05:43.340
Fuck you.

05:43.340 --> 05:46.100
What is your camera fucking like?

05:46.100 --> 05:49.620
Why did you lay down track for a shot in a restaurant?

05:49.620 --> 05:54.060
Why would you use credence in a fucking Vietnam scene?

05:54.060 --> 05:57.220
Are you dead?

05:57.220 --> 05:58.980
Stop it.

05:58.980 --> 06:01.060
Not everybody goes to work every day.

06:01.060 --> 06:04.900
Yeah, well, then don't go to work at all.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.220
All I want is to get out.

06:08.220 --> 06:10.460
And there are people that have so much money that could have

06:10.460 --> 06:11.980
been out decades ago.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.580
And they just hang out making shit.

06:14.580 --> 06:16.820
And I'm like, you're mocking me.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.740
I want to die.

06:18.740 --> 06:23.060
I just want to draw the blanket of retirement over my body.

06:23.060 --> 06:27.700
I need one thing, $150 million.

06:27.700 --> 06:28.860
I've calculated it.

06:28.860 --> 06:29.980
OK, that is.

06:29.980 --> 06:33.660
If I put that in the bank, don't mock me for my goals.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.740
I've done the math.

06:34.740 --> 06:35.900
How did you do the math?

06:35.900 --> 06:37.540
Was this with the Sklar Brothers?

06:37.540 --> 06:43.180
$150 million, I've crunched the numbers.

06:43.180 --> 06:47.580
That means that even if I spend $2 million a year,

06:47.580 --> 06:51.460
I can live another 75 years.

06:51.460 --> 06:54.140
That's my math.

06:54.140 --> 06:54.980
Yeah, good math.

06:54.980 --> 06:55.740
So you bought a cryo.

06:55.740 --> 06:56.180
Thank you.

06:56.180 --> 06:56.700
Thank you.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.300
I know you're being sarcastic, but thank you.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.740
Sorry, what was Brandon saying?

06:59.740 --> 07:00.820
I wasn't being sarcastic.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.140
Yes, you were.

07:02.140 --> 07:05.380
So some of that money is a cryo chamber

07:05.380 --> 07:08.500
because 75 more years is ambitious.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.060
There's all this inflation stuff.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.580
I'm not mad at Spielberg.

07:12.580 --> 07:15.740
I don't want beef.

07:15.740 --> 07:16.420
I want beef.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.660
I don't want Spielberg's podcast to start shooting.

07:18.660 --> 07:19.940
We're calling you out.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.820
Shooting over at me.

07:21.820 --> 07:24.260
It just, look, I saw Steven.

07:24.260 --> 07:29.340
I saw the shot where Streep comes into the restaurant.

07:29.340 --> 07:30.940
She's meeting Tom Hanks for the first time.

07:30.940 --> 07:36.420
I said, why did the camera go all the way to the right

07:36.420 --> 07:39.540
and then all the way to the left and all the way to the right?

07:39.540 --> 07:40.820
How do you mind?

07:40.820 --> 07:41.940
You've lost your mind.

07:41.940 --> 07:44.700
It's a scene about two people having breakfast.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.700
You should have worked with the actors.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.260
Tom Hanks, he's gone off the rails, which is ironic

07:51.260 --> 07:53.860
because your camera is on fucking railroad tracks

07:53.860 --> 07:58.260
that took three days to bolt into the floor of a restaurant

07:58.260 --> 08:01.380
you probably put out of business or a four-walled set

08:01.380 --> 08:04.740
that you created in Uganda because the sound

08:04.740 --> 08:07.900
sounds more restaurant-y there.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.340
Pay attention to your actors.

08:09.340 --> 08:11.060
The guy's got cotton balls in his lips or something.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.300
He's doing a weird impression of Tommy Lasorda.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.900
I don't know what he's doing.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.260
I don't know what Meryl Streep's doing.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.100
I don't know what anyone in that movie's doing.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.060
Everyone's walking around these old sets going like,

08:21.060 --> 08:22.860
oh, I got the byline.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.420
I got a fucking thing.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.540
I don't understand it.

08:25.540 --> 08:28.060
It's a weird, weird, weird movie.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.940
And if anyone had any objectivity that go,

08:29.940 --> 08:30.660
what is happening?

08:30.660 --> 08:31.860
Why is this movie happening?

08:31.860 --> 08:33.500
I don't know why I'm supposed to be watching this.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.460
This is a weird movie.

08:34.460 --> 08:35.740
But we don't have any objectivity.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.540
We're just like, oh, this was designed to win an Oscar,

08:37.540 --> 08:38.740
so we're going to nominate it for an Oscar.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.020
It doesn't deserve an Oscar.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.220
You're fucking insane.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.420
It's a terrible movie.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.260
I shut it off after a half an hour.

08:44.260 --> 08:45.660
I can't stand it.

08:45.660 --> 08:48.220
I couldn't hear it over me jerking off.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.260
I had to masturbate during your movie

08:50.260 --> 08:51.700
to make me interested in it.

08:51.700 --> 08:55.220
It just got real Argo up in here.

08:55.220 --> 08:58.140
Do you think it is Spielberg's attempt to make

08:58.140 --> 09:00.100
a Scorsese type of film?

09:00.100 --> 09:01.420
I think there may have been.

09:01.420 --> 09:04.980
There may have been some Scorsese influences

09:04.980 --> 09:07.300
on the goals of that movie.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.740
Because there would be like, the people

09:08.740 --> 09:11.580
would walk into a New York newspaper

09:11.580 --> 09:12.740
office or something.

09:12.740 --> 09:15.380
And then there'd be a fire hydrant

09:15.380 --> 09:17.740
that would have a liquid spring.

09:17.740 --> 09:21.700
And then someone would go, oh, oh, oh, and it got a defeat.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.700
And then it was all like, everyone was lit weird.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.100
It was like, there'd be like a little girl going like,

09:27.100 --> 09:28.060
extra, extra.

09:28.060 --> 09:30.620
Like, it was weird.

09:30.620 --> 09:31.860
I don't care, though.

09:31.860 --> 09:32.820
This is not my job.

09:32.820 --> 09:33.620
I don't care anymore.

09:33.620 --> 09:34.540
I just want out.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.100
If you're hearing the sound of my voice,

09:36.100 --> 09:38.700
and you're like, oh, Dan, I don't like you.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.900
Join the club!

09:39.900 --> 09:44.500
I don't want to be here anymore.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.700
I don't want to be talking to you.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.100
I don't want you listening to me.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.220
I don't want to have an opinion.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.660
I don't want my opinion to matter.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.180
I just want money.

09:51.180 --> 09:55.420
I just want enough money to get a fucking break.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.820
If I had been born with the amount of money

09:58.820 --> 10:03.980
that normal people have when they're born,

10:03.980 --> 10:06.220
I would never have been doing this.

10:06.220 --> 10:09.420
I would be under a rock somewhere, minding my own business.

10:09.420 --> 10:13.660
I made myself out of dirt without permission.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.540
What else are we talking about?

10:15.540 --> 10:16.460
OK, real quick, though.

10:16.460 --> 10:16.980
Where are you?

10:16.980 --> 10:17.740
Not real quick.

10:17.740 --> 10:18.620
Fill of time.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.820
I don't have no show.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.100
I'm trying to pump up controversy.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.460
Where the fuck would you go?

10:24.460 --> 10:25.260
Where would I go?

10:25.260 --> 10:27.060
Where are you trying to escape to right now?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.820
Because I know what you're talking about.

10:28.820 --> 10:33.900
You got some post-success blues, which are real.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.780
It's totally real to be super well-fed and happy,

10:37.780 --> 10:40.660
and have lost the thing that made you run through the jungle.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.220
So now you get depressed on some new shit.

10:43.220 --> 10:43.740
You know what I mean?

10:43.740 --> 10:46.380
It's like, if you had had, say, your appendix out,

10:46.380 --> 10:47.980
and you've worried about that for two months,

10:47.980 --> 10:49.900
and then they took it out, and you weren't in pain anymore,

10:49.900 --> 10:52.060
you might have a rash that bothered you,

10:52.060 --> 10:53.380
like your appendix used to, because we're

10:53.380 --> 10:55.260
used to living in some sort of crazy fear, right?

10:55.260 --> 10:55.540
Right.

10:55.540 --> 10:56.740
So I follow you.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.220
Where would you go to to escape you?

10:59.220 --> 11:00.700
Bed.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.300
Yeah.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.100
You don't even think like, you're not going to know.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.060
Like, there's no desert.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.540
There's no another country like Amsterdam for two months.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.620
No, I like the United States.

11:08.620 --> 11:10.420
I like that when you take a shit,

11:10.420 --> 11:13.940
it's in a bucket of water that makes the shit disappear.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.660
They have that at Amsterdam?

11:15.660 --> 11:17.460
Yeah.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.740
I hear that's big in Japan.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.540
Don't you dare high road me.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.820
Can you brag about some dope shit we have?

11:24.820 --> 11:25.980
No, I don't want to go to it.

11:25.980 --> 11:28.060
I assume, you know, when people talk about, oh,

11:28.060 --> 11:31.380
I love it in Norway or Amsterdam or whatever,

11:31.380 --> 11:34.340
I got to assume, I think those people are lying, right?

11:34.340 --> 11:35.820
It's got to be better here than anywhere.

11:35.820 --> 11:36.740
Am I wrong?

11:36.740 --> 11:37.420
What do you think?

11:37.420 --> 11:38.460
Depends on what you're into.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.300
If you're into, like, kicking it at, like, two or three,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.300
you want Brazil, you want France.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.580
If you're into, like, safety, when you walk home as drunk

11:44.580 --> 11:47.260
as you want, you want, like, Norway, Amsterdam.

11:47.260 --> 11:49.700
Like, you know, you can do a different kind of party

11:49.700 --> 11:50.980
all over the planet.

11:50.980 --> 11:54.340
All right, well, you make it sound like a party.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.180
Not getting stabbed when you're walking home

11:56.180 --> 11:57.620
is like a menu item.

11:57.620 --> 11:58.900
Well, think about it like this.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.300
If you get drunk in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles,

12:01.300 --> 12:02.980
and you leave a bar, you leave a club,

12:02.980 --> 12:04.060
like, you just made a mistake.

12:04.060 --> 12:05.060
You could get stabbed.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.380
But if you're in a foreign country,

12:06.380 --> 12:08.060
like, the places where they're kind of decent.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.180
Right.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.220
But the place you just were is shitty, right?

12:12.220 --> 12:14.220
Or it's one of three places that is open.

12:14.220 --> 12:14.660
I don't know.

12:14.660 --> 12:15.220
That's what I'm saying.

12:15.220 --> 12:16.340
Isn't there a trade-off?

12:16.340 --> 12:19.380
Yeah, the trade-off is, you can get a little clarity

12:19.380 --> 12:20.140
in those places.

12:24.020 --> 12:24.700
Ta-da.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.500
But aren't you comfortable making the assumption

12:27.500 --> 12:31.420
that for everybody's, like, mocking us,

12:31.420 --> 12:35.940
that America's probably the best?

12:35.940 --> 12:38.460
Like, we make an easy target.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.780
It's like, oh, you guys suck.

12:40.780 --> 12:42.940
Oh, you don't want to be there.

12:42.940 --> 12:44.380
Your guns and your violence.

12:44.380 --> 12:47.020
Totally agreed, but when we compare ourselves

12:47.020 --> 12:50.100
to other countries, we go, like, did you know in Sweden

12:50.100 --> 12:52.820
that you can leave your bike on the sidewalk

12:52.820 --> 12:56.380
and just jerk off on it and, like, roll into the storm

12:56.380 --> 12:58.500
drain, and the storm drain will take you to the nearest

12:58.500 --> 12:59.740
hospital for free?

12:59.740 --> 13:03.380
Like, you hear these things, and I'm not saying they're not

13:03.380 --> 13:05.580
true, but I'm just assuming that that probably

13:05.580 --> 13:07.980
means that, like, there's got to be some trade-off.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.620
Like, maybe their cable sucks.

13:09.620 --> 13:10.500
I don't know.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.260
But that's true.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.860
But the visit is the thing.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.740
The thing is to, like, sort of go someplace,

13:14.740 --> 13:17.220
look at things differently, get that perspective.

13:17.220 --> 13:18.500
You want me to fall into the trap

13:18.500 --> 13:22.620
where I use the only money I do have traveling around,

13:22.620 --> 13:24.860
going, like, oh, I like the Yukon.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.380
I like the wheat patch.

13:27.380 --> 13:31.060
I like the turkey farm.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.660
I got to tell you that that's the root.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.500
When you had no money, you would.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.620
If you had, like, $1,000, you'd spend $800 on a trip.

13:37.620 --> 13:38.220
You would.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.020
And then you'd be like, fuck it.

13:39.020 --> 13:41.020
When I get back, I'll figure out how to manage this $200

13:41.020 --> 13:42.260
into another $800.

13:42.260 --> 13:43.100
But now you got cash.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.180
You got nervous and shit.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.540
So you stop taking risks.

13:45.540 --> 13:46.340
I feel you.

13:46.340 --> 13:46.840
No.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.700
But it's time to, like, seriously, like, maybe take some

13:49.700 --> 13:50.420
trips.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.260
Dream life.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.020
Dream life.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.460
Here it is.

13:53.460 --> 13:55.100
Bed.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.100
California King.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.260
Cody.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.460
Me.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.020
Comforter.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.020
The dogs.

14:02.020 --> 14:02.620
They're fine.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.860
We'll deal with them.

14:05.860 --> 14:07.180
Forensic files.

14:07.180 --> 14:07.780
Netflix.

14:07.780 --> 14:08.300
Everything.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.340
All of it.

14:09.340 --> 14:10.180
Everything available.

14:10.180 --> 14:10.940
Baller shit.

14:10.940 --> 14:11.820
Baller.

14:11.820 --> 14:13.020
I'm going to complain about all of it.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.700
Spielberg, you heard me.

14:15.700 --> 14:16.660
Keep making shit.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.060
I'll keep fucking shooting it back in your face.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.100
What have you done?

14:22.100 --> 14:23.220
You barfed it on me.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.660
I'll barf it right back at you.

14:24.660 --> 14:25.420
I enjoy it.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.340
You enjoyed it.

14:26.340 --> 14:27.820
You didn't suffer during that movie.

14:27.820 --> 14:28.500
I could tell.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.300
I watched five movies of it.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.100
You started this.

14:30.100 --> 14:34.180
If you were hurting while you made that movie,

14:34.180 --> 14:37.700
I'll give you a million dollars.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.580
You were definitely happy.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.820
You were in a hammock.

14:42.820 --> 14:46.940
But I want to be in bed with Cody.

14:46.940 --> 14:51.780
Laptop for just I want to learn Maya.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.580
I'm learning Maya right now, 3D modeling.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.300
And just watching things.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.260
And then I want to wake up the next morning.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.380
And I don't want to have to go to work.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.420
I want to stay in bed with Cody.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.980
And then I want to stay in bed.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.020
And then go to sleep again.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.420
And then wake up the next day.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.660
I want to just keep doing that.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.540
I think you can.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.300
That's what I'm saying.

15:14.300 --> 15:14.860
I think you can.

15:14.860 --> 15:17.380
Well, God knows I've tried.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.380
We're trying.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.660
But I don't.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.300
But you can't.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.420
You live in a house.

15:24.420 --> 15:25.700
And the house has a mortgage.

15:25.700 --> 15:26.780
And then the water.

15:26.780 --> 15:30.060
And the water comes from a place.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.180
And they go, we need our money for the water.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.260
And there's dirt people.

15:34.260 --> 15:35.380
They're like, oh, you have dirt.

15:35.380 --> 15:37.900
You're going to pay your dirt rent.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.300
The dogs have chips in their brains.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.100
How about a garage?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.500
Revolved out of the chips.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.540
Give the dog cancer.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.300
There's iron outside your fence to keep people

15:48.300 --> 15:51.220
from getting in to spread their poor germs on you.

15:51.220 --> 15:55.340
But the iron, if you don't replace it, it gets rusty.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.380
There's cameras.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.140
And the camera's got to be upgraded.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.660
And the stereo system is never enough.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.380
You can't just listen to Phil Collins.

16:02.380 --> 16:03.620
You can't just press play.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.540
And listen to fucking Phil Collins.

16:05.540 --> 16:10.340
I was like, everything cost $200,000, $300,000, $400,000.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.380
And then the guy that tells you all this,

16:12.380 --> 16:14.700
he cost $50,000 a month.

16:14.700 --> 16:18.380
And your publicist, his job is to keep you less famous

16:18.380 --> 16:19.140
than you are.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.860
He's like, just keep me out of the news.

16:21.860 --> 16:23.580
$3,000 a month.

16:23.580 --> 16:27.780
I got people paying people to pay people to pay people

16:27.780 --> 16:28.780
to count money.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.580
I don't care if I have.

16:30.580 --> 16:32.780
I just want to die.

16:32.780 --> 16:33.280
Yeah.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.380
Not really literally die.

16:35.380 --> 16:36.940
I want to go to sleep.

16:36.940 --> 16:38.940
I want to hang out.

16:38.940 --> 16:40.660
You got those new money blues.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.300
And I'm not complaining.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.900
It sounds a lot like I am.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.180
It's not.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.100
It's not.

16:47.100 --> 16:47.780
It's a real thing.

16:47.780 --> 16:52.540
I'm only saying, during this time between 45 and 50,

16:52.540 --> 16:54.140
I'm going to spend the next five years working

16:54.140 --> 16:55.060
as hard as I can.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.820
I'm going to try to bring the kids quality entertainment.

16:57.820 --> 17:00.260
During that five years, Mr. Spielberg,

17:00.260 --> 17:06.140
could you please stop making films or actively

17:06.140 --> 17:08.540
start making them?

17:08.540 --> 17:13.260
This difference you've split is offensive.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.380
I can tell you weren't on set.

17:16.380 --> 17:17.460
It shows.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.260
I can tell, baby.

17:19.260 --> 17:20.340
I'm psychic.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.220
I've got hackdar.

17:22.220 --> 17:26.460
I know when you weren't on set.

17:26.460 --> 17:29.820
And to just be shipped in a pneumatic tube

17:29.820 --> 17:32.980
from your fucking asshole to the academy,

17:32.980 --> 17:34.780
fucking is bullshit.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.860
Because if you shot that on an iPhone

17:36.860 --> 17:38.700
and you were like Dominican and were like,

17:38.700 --> 17:40.500
I made a movie about the Washington Post.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.860
They'd be like, so?

17:41.860 --> 17:44.780
He'd be like, Dan, I got a lawn, and I got water,

17:44.780 --> 17:47.820
and there's a rusty fence, and I got a house I got to pay for,

17:47.820 --> 17:49.540
and I got to sell this shit, too.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.220
Yeah.

17:50.220 --> 17:53.340
Well, I'm sure he's got a small army.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.780
He's got to pay for the laser dots.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.780
You can see all over my head right now.

17:57.780 --> 18:01.700
Those aren't cheap.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.420
I like Get Out.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.340
Oh, good.

18:04.340 --> 18:05.580
Good.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.380
Good.

18:06.380 --> 18:07.380
Ask her good.

18:07.380 --> 18:08.180
Ask her good.

18:08.180 --> 18:08.860
No, all right.

18:08.860 --> 18:09.580
Let's not start.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.620
What did you like about it?

18:10.620 --> 18:11.140
It was great.

18:11.140 --> 18:14.220
I love that it was the guy that got out.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.900
That sounds real.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.100
I love it when the guy got out.

18:18.100 --> 18:18.780
Spoilers.

18:18.780 --> 18:20.460
Where is it?

18:20.460 --> 18:21.500
Where is it?

18:21.500 --> 18:23.580
But did the guy truly get out?

18:23.580 --> 18:27.060
Well, I mean, I didn't see the movie.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.180
Well, I don't know what happens.

18:31.220 --> 18:32.580
Spoiler alert.

18:32.580 --> 18:34.700
It's America.

18:34.700 --> 18:37.180
I liked it.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.620
Any Itania?

18:38.620 --> 18:39.780
I liked Itania.

18:39.780 --> 18:42.220
Did Itania get nominated for anything?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.500
I don't think so.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.380
See?

18:45.380 --> 18:49.220
It's no country for a lot of harbors.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.540
I'll bother to watch these young people's movies,

18:51.540 --> 18:53.660
so I'll go like, oh, I like that.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.940
Florida Project, oh, you know, it's

18:56.940 --> 18:58.980
got to be hard to direct a bunch of fucking kids running

18:58.980 --> 19:01.500
around, Willem Dafoe, you add him to it.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.820
Just give the person a director what?

19:04.820 --> 19:06.900
Obviously, that's a hard movie to direct.

19:06.900 --> 19:07.620
Yeah.

19:07.620 --> 19:08.340
And it was hot.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.700
A nomination.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.420
So no, no, no nomination.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.420
Come on, you're being silly then.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.220
Any love for Ebbing at all?

19:17.220 --> 19:17.620
What?

19:17.620 --> 19:19.740
The three billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri?

19:19.740 --> 19:20.660
Oh, boy.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.580
You know?

19:22.580 --> 19:23.420
No.

19:23.420 --> 19:24.260
OK.

19:24.260 --> 19:24.820
No.

19:24.820 --> 19:25.320
OK.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.180
I watched it.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.500
I like all the actors.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.140
I don't, look, I'm sorry.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.580
I don't know.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.460
I thought it was trite.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.020
I thought it was trite.

19:37.020 --> 19:39.500
Oh.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.540
Oh, Spencer got those bulls.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.580
Spencer, you loved it.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.060
Oh, boy.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.660
I couldn't get enough.

19:45.660 --> 19:46.460
Those performances.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.020
I thought there could have been two billboards.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.820
Those billboards?

19:49.820 --> 19:51.780
No, I think there could have been five, easy.

19:51.780 --> 19:56.700
I thought, you know what?

19:56.700 --> 19:59.860
Here we go.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.900
I don't like that fucking Netflix show

20:01.900 --> 20:04.380
but the End of the Fucking World.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.740
I don't know anything about that show, and I hate it.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.820
I don't like the look in that guy's eye.

20:11.820 --> 20:13.060
I don't like anything.

20:13.060 --> 20:13.820
Name a thing.

20:13.820 --> 20:14.940
Try to find something I like.

20:14.940 --> 20:17.620
I don't like anything.

20:17.620 --> 20:18.380
Olives.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.020
Ice cream has its moments.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.100
Minecraft.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.380
Minecraft is OK.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.740
Kello One.

20:24.740 --> 20:25.540
Kello One's song.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.500
Come on.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.020
I was talking about movies.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:29.180 --> 20:29.680
Robotop.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.540
What about the new season of Black Mirror?

20:31.540 --> 20:32.380
I haven't seen it.

20:32.380 --> 20:33.140
What are you?

20:33.140 --> 20:33.420
What are you?

20:33.420 --> 20:33.860
That's the thing.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.540
With something threatens to be good, I don't watch it.

20:35.540 --> 20:36.660
I haven't watched Atlanta yet.

20:36.660 --> 20:37.820
I haven't watched Black Mirror.

20:37.820 --> 20:38.900
You haven't watched Atlanta yet?

20:38.900 --> 20:39.540
No, I haven't.

20:39.540 --> 20:40.220
I'm racist.

20:40.220 --> 20:41.020
I'm racist.

20:41.020 --> 20:44.220
You deserve everything that happens to you.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.220
That show would make you so happy.

20:46.220 --> 20:47.580
You would love it for so many reasons.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.500
It's right up your alley.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.660
You would love that show.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.260
I don't want to be happy.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.580
And also, don't wait, because I don't

20:53.580 --> 20:55.620
know that season three and fours and fives

20:55.620 --> 20:57.060
are going to be as good as one or two.

20:57.060 --> 20:57.820
Oh, no.

20:57.820 --> 20:58.380
Oh, god.

20:58.380 --> 20:59.420
You'll be mad.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.500
You'll be like, damn, why don't you watch a show?

21:01.500 --> 21:02.980
It's already been going five seasons.

21:02.980 --> 21:03.780
It's already one.

21:03.780 --> 21:04.540
What am I going to do?

21:04.540 --> 21:05.820
Go, oh, this show's good.

21:05.820 --> 21:07.780
Never is going to go, oh, Dan likes that show.

21:07.780 --> 21:08.900
It doesn't matter.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.140
So you get the enjoyment of the show, and then what happens?

21:11.140 --> 21:14.940
I'm trying to tell you to help me stay in bed.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.140
Yeah, that's what we've got to do a bit.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.820
Watch some of Atlanta stay in bed.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.620
Forensic files.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.540
The big sick.

21:21.540 --> 21:22.300
Dan loves it.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.140
I haven't seen it.

21:23.140 --> 21:23.940
He loves it.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.300
I haven't watched it.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.340
I won't watch it.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.660
I don't want to stand the chance of anybody

21:30.660 --> 21:32.980
making me feel good.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.220
I want to drown in hatred.

21:35.220 --> 21:38.300
We'll just focus on the part where she gets sick.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.620
Yeah, you can watch that over and over.

21:39.620 --> 21:45.020
Fast forward to the, I bet she gets sick 30 minutes in.

21:45.020 --> 21:46.260
I just want to see the sick parts.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.140
I'm really here just for the sick parts.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.300
Yeah, no, it's good.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.860
It's good you guys confronted me on this.

21:50.860 --> 21:53.780
It's like, oh, I'm not actively exposing myself to things

21:53.780 --> 21:55.700
that I have reason to believe will be good.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.340
So why am I complaining about things that I just

21:58.340 --> 21:59.700
thought the post would be good?

21:59.700 --> 22:04.420
And Stephen, can I call you Stephen?

22:04.420 --> 22:05.740
I don't think he'd like that.

22:05.740 --> 22:10.020
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's going to be ugly in these streets.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.060
All right.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.140
Talking shit from Berkley?

22:12.140 --> 22:15.820
You can watch the big sick on Pornhub.

22:15.820 --> 22:18.380
That's what I heard.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.580
It's true, you guys.

22:19.580 --> 22:22.180
Thank you, Brandon Johnson, for subbing in for Jeff Davis.

22:22.180 --> 22:23.940
Yeah, I do the best I can.

22:23.940 --> 22:29.140
It's a very, very hard job, but I'm so, so psyched to be here.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.220
Thanks, man.

22:30.220 --> 22:32.580
I'm still unsure of whether or not I want, you know,

22:32.580 --> 22:35.100
like, do we want the people in the house

22:35.100 --> 22:41.100
to be laughing and clapping or?

22:41.100 --> 22:41.820
Yeah.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.620
No.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.220
No.

22:44.220 --> 22:46.180
Well, you don't have to. You can have your own opinion.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.140
Right, exactly.

22:47.140 --> 22:49.180
Who am I?

22:49.180 --> 22:50.180
Just subbing right now.

22:50.180 --> 22:52.780
I probably should just wait my turn.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.740
I'm going to start my movie.

22:57.740 --> 23:00.300
The movie's going to start in Vietnam.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.340
Well, what music should we use?

23:02.340 --> 23:05.980
I could whip up a nice Vietnam score for you.

23:05.980 --> 23:06.620
No credence.

23:06.620 --> 23:10.180
What's that song about running through the jungle?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.860
Will you stop it?

23:11.860 --> 23:13.700
Stop it.

23:13.700 --> 23:14.700
Credence, man.

23:21.180 --> 23:25.620
We could always shift gears and maybe bring up our guest.

23:25.620 --> 23:26.300
Is he here?

23:26.300 --> 23:27.460
That's what I heard, yeah.

23:27.460 --> 23:28.700
That is the rumor.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.340
All right, well, maybe I've rubbed you the wrong way tonight.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.180
Who?

23:32.180 --> 23:33.100
Steven Spielberg.

23:36.020 --> 23:37.140
Or is that a song title?

23:39.780 --> 23:42.060
I just want to get on everybody's good side

23:42.060 --> 23:47.180
and maybe I don't have the personality or the reputation

23:47.180 --> 23:50.020
for that, so why don't I bring up our guest?

23:50.020 --> 23:51.020
Is he really here?

23:51.020 --> 23:51.740
Is he really here?

23:51.740 --> 23:52.540
John Mayer's here.

23:52.540 --> 23:53.540
Let's bring up John Mayer.

23:53.540 --> 23:54.040
What?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.020
Oh, man.

23:55.020 --> 23:56.620
A very special Harmontown.

24:00.620 --> 24:01.620
Yo.

24:01.620 --> 24:05.380
Yo, yo, John Mayer coming to the stage.

24:05.380 --> 24:09.940
John Mayer on the fucking rage, blues, rock, pop, soul.

24:09.940 --> 24:13.180
Fuck your mama on a donut roll.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.620
Donuts don't have rolls.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.740
Fuck your mama in a hole.

24:17.740 --> 24:22.180
I'm getting nervous because you're a famous lyricist.

24:22.180 --> 24:26.980
Yo, John Mayer is here.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.500
John Mayer is here.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.780
Let's talk to John Mayer.

24:31.780 --> 24:32.780
Oh, yeah.

24:32.780 --> 24:33.820
I want to be the guy.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.780
I want to be the guy who hears the other rapper rap

24:36.780 --> 24:40.980
and then quickly associates other words to shout out.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.480
Yeah.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.420
That's an answer to it.

24:42.420 --> 24:43.620
That's the hardest part.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.700
I try to do that every night.

24:45.700 --> 24:46.260
Yeah, that's what I like.

24:46.260 --> 24:46.860
It's so hard.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.100
Sometimes I'm like MC nubs, and it's

24:49.100 --> 24:50.300
like the best I could pull out.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.220
It's not easy.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.620
Yeah, and there's so many rap songs that don't have that.

24:53.620 --> 24:56.100
You can go back in time and just add it to all the other songs

24:56.100 --> 24:57.020
that are there.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.100
And people do.

24:58.100 --> 24:58.500
Yeah.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.420
And re-release them.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.660
Yeah, I do it.

25:00.660 --> 25:04.860
I think that we put out a glass for you with a lemon wedge.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.220
I got this from my hotel room.

25:06.220 --> 25:07.140
All right.

25:07.140 --> 25:07.700
What is that?

25:07.700 --> 25:08.420
What you got there?

25:08.420 --> 25:09.380
It's a kombucha.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.100
Oh, nice.

25:10.100 --> 25:10.860
Do you like that?

25:10.860 --> 25:12.940
I haven't had a type I've liked so far,

25:12.940 --> 25:14.100
but I'm still open to it.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.860
I quit drinking, and so I find that this

25:16.860 --> 25:20.380
takes the place of a curiously strange bubbly drink

25:20.380 --> 25:21.660
that I'm not sure if I like.

25:21.660 --> 25:22.340
Yeah.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.300
Yes, it's perfect for that.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.660
Each sip just creates more curiosity

25:26.660 --> 25:29.660
as to what the fuck I'm drinking this time.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.340
Can I swear?

25:30.340 --> 25:31.140
Yeah, yeah.

25:31.140 --> 25:32.220
Please do.

25:32.220 --> 25:33.060
We prefer it.

25:33.060 --> 25:33.900
Thank you.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.340
Sometimes I'll be laying in bed, and I'll hear it.

25:36.340 --> 25:37.340
Eh.

25:37.340 --> 25:40.100
Eh.

25:40.100 --> 25:40.860
And I'll be like, what is it?

25:40.860 --> 25:43.020
And I'll turn over, and it's my kombucha bottle,

25:43.020 --> 25:45.740
where the cap wasn't totally on, and it scares me.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.140
It emits, like a.

25:47.140 --> 25:48.460
Yeah, the carbonation, you know?

25:48.460 --> 25:49.780
Eh.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.380
Yeah, it ferments, right?

25:51.380 --> 25:51.980
Over time.

25:51.980 --> 25:52.380
Over time.

25:52.380 --> 25:52.980
Yeah, it gets hot.

25:52.980 --> 25:53.500
It screams.

25:53.500 --> 25:54.100
Yeah.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.500
What is there?

25:56.500 --> 26:02.540
I started washing a bottle out in my sink

26:02.540 --> 26:04.660
that's like a drinking bottle, and I put, like,

26:04.660 --> 26:08.660
I have a thing in my sink that emits boiling water,

26:08.660 --> 26:10.940
and so I fill the thing with boiling water,

26:10.940 --> 26:12.420
because I don't, I'm like, oh, I'm

26:12.420 --> 26:14.540
getting an end run around washing things.

26:14.540 --> 26:19.780
And I fill the cup with boiling water, and I seal it shut,

26:19.780 --> 26:22.380
and then I shake it, and it's got boiling water in it.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.460
And then when I unscrew it, how come it goes sssss?

26:25.460 --> 26:26.060
Right.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.260
What happened in that short period of time?

26:27.260 --> 26:28.140
It's just water.

26:28.140 --> 26:30.780
It was already hot water, but the air wasn't hot.

26:30.780 --> 26:31.580
What is it, Spencer?

26:31.580 --> 26:33.220
What's, is it steam?

26:33.220 --> 26:34.060
I don't understand.

26:34.060 --> 26:37.300
It's sizzling, like, it sounded like you were making

26:37.300 --> 26:40.780
the sound like when you open a bottle of soda kind of hiss?

26:40.780 --> 26:42.420
Yeah, it's like just a little one, though.

26:42.420 --> 26:43.940
It's sssss, and I'm like, what is that?

26:43.940 --> 26:45.700
What were you keeping from me?

26:45.700 --> 26:48.180
Yeah, it's just got to be, like, pressurized somehow,

26:48.180 --> 26:48.900
I would guess.

26:48.900 --> 26:49.700
I don't know.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.460
When you poured it in there, the air was not warm.

26:52.460 --> 26:54.300
It probably has nothing to do with me shaking it.

26:54.300 --> 26:57.740
It's probably just hot water steaming already.

26:57.740 --> 26:58.980
You seal it up.

26:58.980 --> 27:01.700
It didn't matter what I did, and then I, you.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.860
Steam, steam pressure.

27:02.860 --> 27:03.980
It's a platonic engine.

27:03.980 --> 27:05.460
Yeah, I think that's it.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.460
That's how trains are made.

27:06.460 --> 27:08.060
Right, that's how trains work.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.380
That's how trains work.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.300
I don't even know.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.780
John Mayer, we just met today.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.980
Yeah, a seven time Grammy winner.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.580
Whoa, looked it up.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.660
You're welcome.

27:22.660 --> 27:24.980
Good host, good host, good interviewer.

27:24.980 --> 27:26.500
Yeah, how did we meet?

27:26.500 --> 27:27.420
Let's tell the story.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.500
We just met an hour ago.

27:29.500 --> 27:30.660
We met, like, six hours ago.

27:30.660 --> 27:33.700
I'm a huge fan of Rick and Morty, like everyone else is.

27:33.700 --> 27:37.100
And I tend to dive deep when I like something.

27:37.100 --> 27:39.420
You don't want to be the friend in my life who likes something

27:39.420 --> 27:42.140
and then turns me on to it because I will swiftly just

27:42.140 --> 27:45.980
railroad you with my being into it 20 times more than you

27:45.980 --> 27:47.220
are within a short period of time.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.100
And I did that.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.140
And I became a big fan.

27:49.140 --> 27:51.180
And then I reached out to somebody from your show.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.860
Or what I usually do is I just make

27:52.860 --> 27:55.620
such a big whoop on social media.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.740
You know, I tend to sort of manifest my desires

27:58.740 --> 28:01.660
by way of Twitter and just creating a stir.

28:01.660 --> 28:04.020
And one of your producers reached out, I think.

28:04.020 --> 28:05.340
Uh-huh.

28:05.340 --> 28:06.300
Was that Steve Levy?

28:06.300 --> 28:08.380
I think it was Mike.

28:08.380 --> 28:09.220
Mike?

28:09.220 --> 28:10.140
Oh, Mike Mendele.

28:10.140 --> 28:11.060
Mike Mendele.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.340
Yeah.

28:12.340 --> 28:13.580
Oh, Mike McMahon.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.780
Yeah, a lot of Mike's going on.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.940
And all I need is one Mike.

28:17.940 --> 28:18.660
OK.

28:18.660 --> 28:19.500
Thanks.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.220
It's a nozz, right?

28:20.220 --> 28:21.100
Nozz, ladies and gentlemen.

28:21.100 --> 28:21.940
Thanks, thanks.

28:21.940 --> 28:22.340
Well done.

28:22.340 --> 28:23.780
Thanks.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.700
And then I met a really sweet guy on your crew

28:26.700 --> 28:27.660
who's one of the artists.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.340
His name is Corey.

28:29.340 --> 28:29.820
Corey?

28:29.820 --> 28:30.420
Never met him.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.100
Yep.

28:31.100 --> 28:36.140
He invited me to the taping of the season three DVD commentary.

28:36.140 --> 28:39.980
And I came, availed myself, to actually sitting in the room

28:39.980 --> 28:41.620
and talking on a DVD with you guys.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.420
Here's the fun part.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.660
I'm already aware that I'm behind the eight ball

28:44.660 --> 28:45.620
when it comes to my name.

28:45.620 --> 28:48.740
And certain people enjoy Rick and Morty because of the fact

28:48.740 --> 28:53.020
it does not contain any John Mayer elements in it.

28:53.020 --> 28:53.940
A lot of them.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.700
Certain things just have their strength from me not

28:56.700 --> 28:58.660
being involved in it in any way.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.780
And I like to close that gap.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.980
And there I was.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.260
And I wasn't on the first commentary

29:05.260 --> 29:07.060
that they did today.

29:07.060 --> 29:10.940
But I was on what will end up being the very first episode

29:10.940 --> 29:13.420
on the commentary in the sequence,

29:13.420 --> 29:15.660
which makes me look even nervier than I already am.

29:15.660 --> 29:17.020
But we got to talking.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.540
And I think I found a certain familiarity

29:19.540 --> 29:24.340
in both your intelligence and your unhappiness.

29:24.340 --> 29:25.340
Yes.

29:25.340 --> 29:26.340
Yes.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.540
I mean, it really is true.

29:27.540 --> 29:31.140
I had a great day today because I met John Mayer.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.020
And I was like, I'm not miserable,

29:33.020 --> 29:37.060
but I don't get to complain about the things that I

29:37.060 --> 29:40.020
have to complain about to anybody but John Mayer.

29:40.020 --> 29:40.500
Bring him.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
Bring him.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.500
Well, no.

29:42.500 --> 29:45.580
We were standing in a kitchenette eating pepperoni pizza

29:45.580 --> 29:49.740
talking about how hard Google Autofill can be.

29:49.740 --> 29:51.340
Yeah, I was saying that.

29:51.340 --> 29:52.460
How merciless.

29:52.460 --> 29:55.340
Well, I don't know that anybody searches.

29:55.340 --> 29:57.940
Does anybody just Google search a celebrity name

29:57.940 --> 30:00.860
to find out what's going on unless you're the celebrity?

30:00.860 --> 30:04.620
Like, does anybody here go like, what's going on with Gaga?

30:04.620 --> 30:07.300
And just throw in Lady Gaga and everything?

30:07.300 --> 30:07.800
Yeah.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.940
Like, it's been two years, I think.

30:08.940 --> 30:09.700
What's happening?

30:09.700 --> 30:10.980
What makes that kind of curiosity?

30:10.980 --> 30:11.420
Oh, really?

30:11.420 --> 30:12.100
Just to catch up?

30:12.100 --> 30:13.220
Sometimes.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.220
When you're a fan, I mean, I'm a fan of a ton of people,

30:16.220 --> 30:17.460
so I catch up.

30:17.460 --> 30:21.620
I mean, I was looking at, like, aerobics icons from the 80s

30:21.620 --> 30:23.020
before I got here.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.060
Yeah, but that's not by name.

30:24.060 --> 30:24.940
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

30:24.940 --> 30:26.540
That's a little bit like a where they announce it.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.460
Like Cynthia Carellick?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.620
Well, you know, it's like Denise Austin.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.700
Yeah, sure.

30:31.700 --> 30:32.340
Jane Fonda.

30:32.340 --> 30:32.980
Jane Fonda.

30:32.980 --> 30:33.980
Yeah.

30:33.980 --> 30:36.220
My mother used to have Jane Fonda LP.

30:36.220 --> 30:37.340
You'd fall down those rabbit holes.

30:37.340 --> 30:39.860
Yeah, that's how I discovered the Jacksons.

30:39.860 --> 30:45.180
Because Can You Feel It was the song for the Jane Fonda.

30:45.180 --> 30:47.220
And she would say, one vertebra at a time.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.500
Lift it up, one vertebra.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.020
Can you feel it, boom, boom, boom, can you feel it?

30:51.020 --> 30:52.020
And my mother was there.

30:55.020 --> 30:59.300
Funny way to get indoctrinated into the love of the Jacksons.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.580
One vertebra at a time.

31:00.580 --> 31:04.260
You're slightly younger than me, but I came of pubescence

31:04.260 --> 31:10.180
at the height of the aerobics movement.

31:10.180 --> 31:13.420
And that was my girlfriend shifting uncomfortable.

31:13.420 --> 31:17.580
Is that to suggest that it served a purpose beyond aerobic?

31:17.580 --> 31:21.980
Yeah, I wasn't the most fit 13-year-old boy in the world.

31:21.980 --> 31:27.460
And yet I watched a lot of syndicated aerobics programs.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.940
Sometimes I get upset when I watch porn

31:30.940 --> 31:33.180
that I can see everything.

31:33.180 --> 31:36.740
I remember not seeing everything and fighting with my eyes.

31:36.740 --> 31:40.380
Well, do you know that there's a, I mean, one thing I've

31:40.380 --> 31:40.940
tried.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.900
I started typing in fully closed.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.620
Or even just bra ads and stuff.

31:44.620 --> 31:48.340
Like wanting to see beyond things is very erotic.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.780
Or wanting to, it could be a creepier thing

31:50.780 --> 31:53.860
where you want to see what you see every day.

31:53.860 --> 31:57.420
And you want to sexualize that as someone who's just available.

31:57.420 --> 31:59.780
I can get with that.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.580
Yeah, I won't judge it either way.

32:02.580 --> 32:07.260
But yeah, I found myself typing in.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.980
And I found out there's an abbreviation.

32:08.980 --> 32:11.620
It's a genre of porn.

32:11.620 --> 32:21.380
It's C-F-N-F-N-N-M, the closed female male.

32:21.380 --> 32:23.020
I don't know why the guy has to be naked.

32:23.020 --> 32:24.100
That's not on my.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.540
Because it's humiliating.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.260
Well, he doesn't seem humiliated.

32:27.260 --> 32:28.220
No, he's into it.

32:28.220 --> 32:30.100
I think it's exactly to your point.

32:30.100 --> 32:34.980
It has this sense of extreme ease.

32:34.980 --> 32:37.460
The idea that, well, it really is the manifestation

32:37.460 --> 32:39.700
of what you see a lot going on in the news right now.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.140
Apparently, that's how most people

32:41.140 --> 32:42.780
want to work in the office.

32:42.780 --> 32:45.260
Just nothing on.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.660
Yeah, I mean, well, yeah.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.500
What's going on in the news right now?

32:48.500 --> 32:52.860
Well, it seems to be a lot of that kind of sexualization

32:52.860 --> 32:56.500
of the idea that I'm going to turn what seems to be a very

32:56.500 --> 32:58.740
matter of fact moment into something sexual, which I think

32:58.740 --> 33:02.700
is where the root of C, you have to work it out.

33:02.700 --> 33:03.260
It's like a plan.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.140
Yeah, you really do every time.

33:04.140 --> 33:05.940
It's Roy G. Biv, really.

33:05.940 --> 33:06.460
Roy G. Biv.

33:06.460 --> 33:07.700
You could call it Roy G. Biv.

33:07.700 --> 33:11.660
Yeah, most of the stuff in that folder

33:11.660 --> 33:14.860
that I hope no one finds, it really

33:14.860 --> 33:20.820
resembles things that are hardly recognizable as porn.

33:20.820 --> 33:21.500
I understand.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.540
I'm into the sleight of hand of it as well.

33:23.540 --> 33:23.900
No pun.

33:23.900 --> 33:28.020
I enjoy the subtle, like the game of subtlety.

33:28.020 --> 33:29.660
I friggin' love it.

33:29.660 --> 33:30.740
I friggin' love it.

33:30.740 --> 33:35.700
All right, well, let's pull back out to the bigger picture.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.740
Fame, the difficulty with it.

33:39.740 --> 33:41.020
There was a certain point where it was like,

33:41.020 --> 33:42.380
you've got to come on the podcast,

33:42.380 --> 33:45.260
and we've got to have this conversation, because why?

33:45.260 --> 33:46.980
I don't know, because I'm a nurse assistant,

33:46.980 --> 33:48.780
and I don't want to continue to have it privately,

33:48.780 --> 33:50.500
because I might accidentally make a front.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.020
I just want to.

33:52.020 --> 33:56.220
But it was like, and we were both like,

33:56.220 --> 33:58.900
as long as we don't take a woe as me stance,

33:58.900 --> 34:02.540
it would be really funny to talk about how.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.100
I think there's a lot to work with in it,

34:05.100 --> 34:06.340
as your therapist might say.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.380
There's a lot to work with you.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.260
Follow that thought.

34:08.260 --> 34:10.980
Do you actively, are you in therapy?

34:10.980 --> 34:11.780
Yes.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.380
How long have you been in therapy?

34:13.380 --> 34:16.780
I've been in therapy for years, but my current relationship

34:16.780 --> 34:22.300
of man versus therapist has been since 2009.

34:22.300 --> 34:26.580
And I don't really think about it in the overall machinations

34:26.580 --> 34:29.220
of fame the way you would normally think about it.

34:29.220 --> 34:31.580
I don't really have that ad hoc relationship anymore

34:31.580 --> 34:32.380
with the world.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.260
I am subject.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.580
Thing I do is famous.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.980
I think I've sort of particleized it in a good way,

34:37.980 --> 34:41.180
like over time, with kind of going up and down so many times,

34:41.180 --> 34:43.660
or changing my name, or musically changing my name.

34:43.660 --> 34:47.060
I feel like I carry six musical passports.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.700
And the perfect backdrop for this

34:49.700 --> 34:53.660
is that as we speak, the Grammy after parties

34:53.660 --> 34:56.500
are taking place in New York City.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.460
And I'm not there.

34:58.460 --> 35:01.260
And that's something, that's a thing.

35:01.260 --> 35:01.940
That's a thing.

35:01.940 --> 35:03.140
I put a record out this year.

35:03.140 --> 35:05.460
I made a record and thought that when I was making it,

35:05.460 --> 35:07.900
there's no way this can't hit.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.340
And that's what you're supposed to think

35:09.340 --> 35:10.180
when you make something.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.660
Don't you think that when you're making something

35:11.660 --> 35:13.180
every time that it's going to hit?

35:13.180 --> 35:16.700
Yeah, but I want to make sure that we can connect our,

35:16.700 --> 35:19.340
because not being a musician, I just

35:19.340 --> 35:23.540
want to make sure that we understand what we're

35:23.540 --> 35:27.700
talking about, because me putting something out

35:27.700 --> 35:30.140
versus you putting something out can be a totally different

35:30.140 --> 35:31.820
thing.

35:31.820 --> 35:37.980
But so not being at the Grammy after parties in New York

35:37.980 --> 35:42.060
means very carefully, not invited, didn't attend, or?

35:42.060 --> 35:48.580
Did not get nominated, didn't break through with my record.

35:48.580 --> 35:52.660
And I find that actually, I used to find it really sad,

35:52.660 --> 35:55.340
and now I find it really empowering somehow or another.

35:55.340 --> 35:59.340
I feel like it drives me pretty hard.

35:59.340 --> 36:02.980
The idea that at least that's taken off the table,

36:02.980 --> 36:04.860
not to put words in your mouth, but this

36:04.860 --> 36:06.420
is where I'm trying to find a parallel,

36:06.420 --> 36:08.020
like stop me when I diverse through.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.580
I'm greedy, and I want to go to every party.

36:10.580 --> 36:11.500
I'm greedy.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.620
I want everything every possible way I can have it.

36:14.620 --> 36:19.140
I want both obscurity and also great, great mainstream

36:19.140 --> 36:19.620
success.

36:19.620 --> 36:20.180
Yes, OK.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.940
I want the power that obscurity has.

36:22.940 --> 36:26.820
But I want the adulation that mainstream success has.

36:26.820 --> 36:30.820
And I find myself bouncing back and forth between those two

36:30.820 --> 36:34.420
needs always a little bit upset in the middle of those two things.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.340
You take the obscurity a little personally.

36:36.340 --> 36:36.940
Makes sense.

36:36.940 --> 36:40.580
If you're not nominated for this, or this didn't hit that,

36:40.580 --> 36:43.420
or this charts as much as you know as an intellectual person,

36:43.420 --> 36:45.580
that these metrics mean nothing.

36:45.580 --> 36:46.900
You know you're supposed to know that.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.220
Your therapist knows it.

36:48.220 --> 36:49.980
You've arrived at all these things.

36:49.980 --> 36:51.420
You're a grown man.

36:51.420 --> 36:52.820
You get all that stuff, but.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.300
And then it gets visceral because you're on Instagram.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.540
And then something happens that triggers you to go,

36:57.540 --> 36:58.820
oh, people don't like me.

36:58.820 --> 36:59.900
I'm not approved of.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.620
I'm not.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.860
And you're like, I don't need that goal.

37:03.860 --> 37:04.860
I don't need that goal.

37:04.860 --> 37:08.620
This is a great opportunity for me to now not be like that.

37:08.620 --> 37:09.620
Now, if you want, exact.

37:09.620 --> 37:12.540
But if you want insight into the world

37:12.540 --> 37:15.220
and how the world must work, look at what I have.

37:15.220 --> 37:18.540
And now, I metabolize success so fast.

37:18.540 --> 37:19.660
And I know this about myself.

37:19.660 --> 37:21.700
I can't hold on to it.

37:21.700 --> 37:24.420
But I have a lot of it that I could point to if I needed to.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.100
I'm sure it's always at work, whether I realize it or not.

37:27.100 --> 37:29.940
I'm sure the defense mechanisms of great success

37:29.940 --> 37:32.660
are always humming along, even if I can't hear it.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.940
And then I say to myself, if I feel this way,

37:35.940 --> 37:38.980
if I feel a little beat down today by this thing,

37:38.980 --> 37:42.660
imagine how someone who is 22 feels, who

37:42.660 --> 37:44.460
doesn't have anything to their name,

37:44.460 --> 37:47.260
that must make them like a straw house

37:47.260 --> 37:48.860
in the wind of that stuff.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.420
Because they grow up in an environment

37:50.420 --> 37:53.420
where they need the likes and the, yeah.

37:53.420 --> 37:54.220
Imagine that.

37:54.220 --> 37:55.780
My heart breaks for that.

37:55.780 --> 37:57.900
Like, I did this.

37:57.900 --> 38:03.180
I sat in the interim between Craig Ferguson and James

38:03.180 --> 38:04.740
Corden doing Late Late Show.

38:04.740 --> 38:08.140
I did a guest host thing for three days.

38:08.140 --> 38:10.660
I did Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

38:10.660 --> 38:13.780
And I literally cried on Thursday night.

38:13.780 --> 38:17.620
It made me cry because the question,

38:17.620 --> 38:21.380
and this might sort of overlap into television, was,

38:21.380 --> 38:24.380
and I asked one simple question of the world.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.180
Isn't it good?

38:25.180 --> 38:25.940
Was I good?

38:25.940 --> 38:26.660
That was the question.

38:26.660 --> 38:27.660
Was I good?

38:27.660 --> 38:34.660
The answer told over Twitter just kept prolonging the question.

38:34.660 --> 38:35.980
I couldn't find the answer.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.740
And it drove me crazy.

38:36.740 --> 38:38.860
Now, you've got the East Coast airtime,

38:38.860 --> 38:40.340
and you've got the West Coast airtime.

38:40.340 --> 38:43.460
So you do actually two laps around every broadcast.

38:43.460 --> 38:46.100
You do the East Coast live tweet, and you read it.

38:46.100 --> 38:48.820
And every answer just gets further away from you

38:48.820 --> 38:50.180
as you keep reading.

38:50.180 --> 38:53.860
And it drove me mad because I couldn't answer the question.

38:53.860 --> 38:55.380
And then I realized retroactively,

38:55.380 --> 38:58.700
this is what the friends I've had,

38:58.700 --> 39:01.260
the girls I've tried to love forever,

39:01.260 --> 39:03.140
like this is what people in this industry

39:03.140 --> 39:07.700
have to deal with, is this ever-escaping answer

39:07.700 --> 39:11.180
to the simplest of questions, which is,

39:11.180 --> 39:12.260
did anybody like that?

39:12.260 --> 39:13.220
Yeah.

39:13.220 --> 39:13.720
Yeah.

39:13.720 --> 39:14.940
That's the only question.

39:14.940 --> 39:16.020
Am I a good primate?

39:16.020 --> 39:16.860
Did I do good?

39:16.860 --> 39:18.180
Are you ever going to kick me out?

39:18.180 --> 39:21.020
Will you just set me up in a branch of this tree

39:21.020 --> 39:22.340
where I can chill?

39:22.340 --> 39:25.700
I like, yeah.

39:25.700 --> 39:31.860
Because you get early encouragement

39:31.860 --> 39:34.500
for doing special things.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.740
And before you realize that special things are special

39:38.740 --> 39:42.540
because they're not normal, and you eventually

39:42.540 --> 39:44.620
enter a world where you realize that those special things,

39:44.620 --> 39:48.020
they're not that special, you're just being normal.

39:48.020 --> 39:49.900
Like, they're not that special.

39:49.900 --> 39:53.060
They're not so special that you can be an asshole.

39:53.060 --> 39:56.500
They're not so special that someone else isn't better at it.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.260
They're not so special that it's definitive at all.

39:59.260 --> 40:02.500
They're just special enough that your mom says,

40:02.500 --> 40:04.860
I love you, when you do it.

40:04.860 --> 40:08.380
And it might be sowing a fucking seam.

40:08.380 --> 40:12.020
It might be your eyesight is better than 2020.

40:12.020 --> 40:14.340
It might be jumping over a bush.

40:14.340 --> 40:16.740
It might be catching a ball.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.820
For me, it was reading and writing.

40:18.820 --> 40:21.420
I was reading, and I was writing, and I was reading,

40:21.420 --> 40:22.260
and I was writing.

40:22.260 --> 40:32.340
And it's like you're swallowing this thread.

40:32.340 --> 40:36.100
And you're just going along it, and you're going.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.660
And it's all too late when you go,

40:38.660 --> 40:42.180
I don't want approval anymore.

40:42.180 --> 40:43.140
I want safety.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.500
I want comfort.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.460
And then you look around and go, oh,

40:47.460 --> 40:50.620
I don't have as much safety and comfort

40:50.620 --> 40:54.380
as someone whose mom patted him on the head

40:54.380 --> 40:56.900
for being a mailman.

40:56.900 --> 41:00.620
Well, I would amend that a little bit for me, because I have.

41:00.620 --> 41:02.940
By the way, I lost what I was trying to say in the middle

41:02.940 --> 41:03.860
and started riffing.

41:03.860 --> 41:06.380
And I totally, it all fell apart.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.540
I tracked it the whole time.

41:07.540 --> 41:08.060
That's the scare.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.020
You're so bright, you can even articulate.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.660
I wasn't fishing for that, John Mayer.

41:11.660 --> 41:14.140
You're so bright, you can even articulate stuff.

41:14.140 --> 41:15.300
You're not even thinking.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.420
Don't say my mind is a wonderland.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.340
I won't let you say it.

41:18.340 --> 41:19.500
I won't have it.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.420
I won't have it.

41:20.420 --> 41:22.140
You're not an expert on it.

41:22.140 --> 41:24.460
And if you say it, it won't be a quote

41:24.460 --> 41:27.180
that I can take to my grave.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.780
Don't say my mind is a wonderland.

41:28.780 --> 41:29.620
I won't.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.220
I won't sing it to you.

41:31.220 --> 41:32.420
OK.

41:32.420 --> 41:33.980
But I have fans.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.220
I have music fans.

41:35.220 --> 41:38.420
And songs are repeatable.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.860
People live inside them forever.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.140
So I have that part of it.

41:41.140 --> 41:42.380
And I feel stable there.

41:42.380 --> 41:46.940
However, most of my childhood upbringing I've decided

41:46.940 --> 41:51.540
is redacted, but part of the way that I got out of Fairfield

41:51.540 --> 41:56.060
Connecticut was by weaponizing my ability

41:56.060 --> 41:58.820
to focus on things and write songs and play guitar

41:58.820 --> 41:59.540
and get better.

41:59.540 --> 42:04.020
Getting better was what I did to defeat monsters.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.620
That's how I beat monsters.

42:05.620 --> 42:08.860
Literally defeated monsters by getting better.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.620
I got hit in the arm by the bully.

42:10.620 --> 42:11.340
I wouldn't hit back.

42:11.340 --> 42:14.780
I would say to myself, you'll see the day you want to buy

42:14.780 --> 42:17.540
tickets to my show, and I won't let you.

42:17.540 --> 42:19.620
Of course, to say nothing of the fact that's impossible

42:19.620 --> 42:22.620
commercially, but you know what I'm saying.

42:22.620 --> 42:25.580
And then someone says, you can't do it.

42:25.580 --> 42:27.860
You say, you go silent.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.140
I learned how to go deadly silent.

42:30.140 --> 42:31.500
I don't act out.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.300
I just go deadly silent and then go off in a room and do

42:34.300 --> 42:36.060
something, and it works.

42:36.060 --> 42:39.260
But now I'm 40, and I think I've driven this pattern

42:39.260 --> 42:43.620
into my life where every time I feel lonely, every time I feel

42:43.620 --> 42:46.100
like I don't have enough to keep me company, literally to

42:46.100 --> 42:51.540
keep me company, I'll just build another weapon.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.380
And the weapon is the music, and that's great.

42:53.380 --> 42:56.940
But over time, and I think this is where we connect on this,

42:56.940 --> 43:00.820
is nobody tells you when to stop punching.

43:00.820 --> 43:03.620
You literally have no concept of what the finish line is,

43:03.620 --> 43:05.580
because no one really knows what it is.

43:05.580 --> 43:07.820
A therapist will tell you.

43:07.820 --> 43:09.460
My therapist told me.

43:09.460 --> 43:10.820
I'm still catching up to it.

43:10.820 --> 43:16.700
She said, you're covered in weapons, an armor.

43:16.700 --> 43:20.940
And you're just going to have to let it go.

43:20.940 --> 43:23.140
It's not doing anything for anybody.

43:23.140 --> 43:25.900
It's there for a fine reason, but you've got to let it go.

43:25.900 --> 43:37.620
But I get the sense from you that seven Grammys, you're

43:37.620 --> 43:40.460
John Mayer, whatever, man.

43:40.460 --> 43:41.060
No, I'm kidding.

43:41.060 --> 43:42.540
One day I'm just going to get to John,

43:42.540 --> 43:44.540
but I understand we're at first name, last name.

43:44.540 --> 43:49.340
The, like, I correct me if I'm wrong.

43:49.340 --> 43:54.260
Because this is like, it sounds like you're at least

43:54.260 --> 43:57.540
willing to admit that you're scrolling through comments

43:57.540 --> 44:00.020
and you're looking for, you may not

44:00.020 --> 44:02.700
be looking for validation there, but you're like,

44:02.700 --> 44:03.780
it's like a ticker.

44:03.780 --> 44:06.980
And I'm very curious, just in your inner clockwork,

44:06.980 --> 44:12.420
like, when someone tries to say, someone

44:12.420 --> 44:15.140
tries to take a shot at me, they can say you're fat.

44:15.140 --> 44:19.260
And I'm like, yeah, that just means

44:19.260 --> 44:23.020
I'm twice as talented as I'd have to be if I was thin.

44:23.020 --> 44:24.940
They say you're untalented.

44:24.940 --> 44:27.460
And I'm like, it doesn't.

44:27.460 --> 44:29.580
Yeah, because I'm like, I want to say to the kid,

44:29.580 --> 44:32.540
like, that is where Batman's chest plate is.

44:32.540 --> 44:35.620
Like, you don't, like, are you kidding me?

44:35.620 --> 44:40.900
You heard my name because I, like, this is what I do.

44:40.900 --> 44:43.900
Like, I cannot be killed there.

44:43.900 --> 44:47.100
You could dynamite that chest plate,

44:47.100 --> 44:50.460
and there wouldn't be a heart behind it to kill.

44:50.460 --> 44:53.500
But then there's this, but it's like,

44:53.500 --> 44:55.940
there's other shit that fucks you up, right?

44:55.940 --> 44:57.460
And it's weird, because like, someone

44:57.460 --> 45:00.060
could call you untalented, and you could know it,

45:00.060 --> 45:03.220
and it's like, and go like, oh, I'm not

45:03.220 --> 45:04.900
worried about being untalented.

45:04.900 --> 45:06.620
I'm John Mayer.

45:06.620 --> 45:12.780
But what I'm hearing you say is that there is shit that it's like.

45:12.780 --> 45:14.300
Because I won't stay still.

45:14.300 --> 45:19.140
So because I don't like a unanimous vote,

45:19.140 --> 45:20.900
I don't like unanimous votes.

45:20.900 --> 45:24.260
It took me 40 years to realize I don't like golf claps.

45:24.260 --> 45:27.780
I don't like agreed upon 100% approval.

45:27.780 --> 45:29.740
For some reason, things go invisible.

45:29.740 --> 45:30.860
It's not very punk rock.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.060
They just go invisible in my head.

45:32.060 --> 45:33.260
Your nightmare is obscurity.

45:33.260 --> 45:33.780
It hurts.

45:33.780 --> 45:37.340
It hurts to be part of the woodwork.

45:37.340 --> 45:38.700
My nightmare is.

45:38.700 --> 45:39.540
I'm not saying you are.

45:39.540 --> 45:40.740
I'm saying that's your nightmare.

45:40.740 --> 45:41.500
Not obscurity.

45:41.500 --> 45:44.220
No, I like obscurity if there's some depth to it.

45:44.220 --> 45:47.260
My nightmare is being placed off to the side

45:47.260 --> 45:49.100
where everybody goes, got it.

45:49.100 --> 45:52.300
He's indexed, labeled, barcoded, RF labeled.

45:52.300 --> 45:53.140
We know who he is.

45:53.140 --> 45:54.580
Off you go.

45:54.580 --> 45:58.380
That to me, I feel like I disappear.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.300
And so what I purposefully have done, I think,

46:00.300 --> 46:02.180
now I can look back on it with some clarity,

46:02.180 --> 46:05.740
is diversify so that things can never get that way.

46:05.740 --> 46:07.100
I don't know why I do it that way.

46:07.100 --> 46:10.180
So the only reason, now, if I went and played a show

46:10.180 --> 46:11.820
and came back, you're right.

46:11.820 --> 46:14.500
Nobody could say that I didn't know how to play the guitar.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.660
But it's the fact that I'm trying

46:16.660 --> 46:19.540
to diversify into situations that are so foreign.

46:19.540 --> 46:23.860
Like, how do people feel about me hosting a talk show?

46:23.860 --> 46:26.340
I'm going into such enemy territory that I think.

46:26.340 --> 46:27.220
The Dave Chappelle moments.

46:27.220 --> 46:28.900
Yeah, the stuff with Dave Chappelle.

46:28.900 --> 46:31.860
Going off and doing a tour with Dave.

46:31.860 --> 46:35.820
After enough times of getting thrown in jail,

46:35.820 --> 46:37.100
you have to say to yourself, there

46:37.100 --> 46:39.820
must be something about the clothes in here that I like.

46:39.820 --> 46:41.980
There must be something in here that I like.

46:41.980 --> 46:43.860
I mean, I'm taking that look at myself at 40.

46:43.860 --> 46:45.860
Like, take a look at the patterns.

46:45.860 --> 46:48.340
When things go well for you, you tend,

46:48.340 --> 46:49.860
it's like, your hand disappears.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.020
Then you start going, where am I?

46:51.020 --> 46:53.060
And you do these things as markers

46:53.060 --> 46:54.820
to feel as if you matter in the world,

46:54.820 --> 46:56.980
because you're trying to houdini into new stuff.

46:56.980 --> 47:01.380
Is it an oversimplification to say, OK,

47:01.380 --> 47:04.220
our families, God bless them.

47:04.220 --> 47:06.180
Let's not call them good people, bad people.

47:06.180 --> 47:07.660
Let's not blame them for anything.

47:07.660 --> 47:09.380
They weren't filling.

47:09.380 --> 47:11.660
They weren't paying off the credit card bill.

47:11.660 --> 47:14.060
Maybe they gave birth to people with bigger needs

47:14.060 --> 47:14.820
that they could fill.

47:14.820 --> 47:17.500
But in any case, everybody that I talk to,

47:17.500 --> 47:20.420
that in our line of work in general,

47:20.420 --> 47:22.940
they seemed to come back around to their early memories

47:22.940 --> 47:26.460
of the parents weren't filling the bucket,

47:26.460 --> 47:28.300
and then company would come over.

47:28.300 --> 47:30.660
And all of my friends were the kids

47:30.660 --> 47:32.540
that would run out in their pajamas,

47:32.540 --> 47:35.460
and they would make an ass of themselves,

47:35.460 --> 47:37.500
and they just loved.

47:37.500 --> 47:38.420
Is it attention?

47:38.420 --> 47:40.220
Is it an oversimplification to say

47:40.220 --> 47:44.580
that what you're talking about is that attention is needed?

47:44.580 --> 47:46.460
I'll take you one deeper.

47:46.460 --> 47:48.460
Distinction.

47:48.460 --> 47:49.740
I need distinction.

47:49.740 --> 47:52.500
But distinction is defined by strangers or not,

47:52.500 --> 47:54.700
because it seems like you could be in your garage knowing

47:54.700 --> 47:56.300
you're distinct.

47:56.300 --> 48:01.380
You have trophies and the ego and the self-confidence to know.

48:01.380 --> 48:03.340
You could sit on a desert island and know

48:03.340 --> 48:06.300
that you're better, that you could win a guitar contest.

48:06.300 --> 48:10.940
That I always tell people, when they ask about empirical talent

48:10.940 --> 48:13.300
level, I'm like, if this were tennis,

48:13.300 --> 48:15.220
I don't know the ranking, but I would definitely

48:15.220 --> 48:17.540
be at the open.

48:17.540 --> 48:19.060
That's as far as I can understand it,

48:19.060 --> 48:20.660
is that I'd be at the US Open.

48:20.660 --> 48:21.980
I don't know where I'd come in.

48:21.980 --> 48:23.380
I don't know if I'd place.

48:23.380 --> 48:24.380
I don't know if that's a tennis place.

48:24.380 --> 48:26.620
So you know that, so what's that distinction?

48:26.620 --> 48:28.740
That's what you're talking about, being distinct, is that?

48:28.740 --> 48:29.500
Well, I got it now.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.460
I mean, when I was a kid, that's what I wanted.

48:31.460 --> 48:33.620
I mean, the thing about music is, I guess,

48:33.620 --> 48:35.900
the same thing with animating, not trying to put it

48:35.900 --> 48:36.980
in your wheelhouse too much.

48:36.980 --> 48:37.780
I know you're not animating.

48:37.780 --> 48:39.460
Well, I'm certainly taking a lot of liberties

48:39.460 --> 48:43.260
comparing us so you can do whatever you want.

48:43.260 --> 48:45.900
For music, you can hear yourself do the thing.

48:45.900 --> 48:47.980
I mean, for me, it came a lot.

48:47.980 --> 48:51.940
It resembled very much the alter ego, the superhero thing.

48:51.940 --> 48:53.220
Training in your room.

48:53.220 --> 48:56.420
I mean, I have a great, great, great sense

48:56.420 --> 49:00.500
memory of tonight being like everyone's at this party.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.860
And I was told maybe there'd be room in the Jetta.

49:03.860 --> 49:06.700
So Ryan has a Jetta.

49:06.700 --> 49:10.580
And then Ryan said, sorry, I got no more seats in the Jetta.

49:10.580 --> 49:12.300
And I'm like, cool, cool.

49:12.300 --> 49:14.460
And I know right now that everybody's at the party.

49:14.460 --> 49:17.140
And I imagine if I weren't sitting here talking to you,

49:17.140 --> 49:19.380
I would be in my bathroom playing a guitar pretending

49:19.380 --> 49:20.940
I was at the party.

49:20.940 --> 49:21.940
Because I like it.

49:21.940 --> 49:23.380
There's something about it.

49:23.380 --> 49:26.980
I like, I relate it in the 80s to Teen Wolf.

49:26.980 --> 49:28.780
Differentiation, distinction.

49:28.780 --> 49:30.900
He's the only one, except for that,

49:30.900 --> 49:31.900
for getting into Teen Wolf.

49:31.900 --> 49:39.300
I want to be honest and say what I don't quite get.

49:39.300 --> 49:41.340
I want to go back over that.

49:41.340 --> 49:43.900
The Jetta metaphor, that didn't happen tonight.

49:43.900 --> 49:46.060
You're talking about a memory.

49:46.060 --> 49:48.540
Yeah, no.

49:48.540 --> 49:50.340
I'm not a man of distinction this evening.

49:50.340 --> 49:53.860
The image of you in the bathroom by yourself

49:53.860 --> 49:55.580
when you're not at the party playing guitar,

49:55.580 --> 50:02.100
that's an important because I don't know.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.980
Maybe you're five years younger than me.

50:03.980 --> 50:06.980
So I don't know.

50:06.980 --> 50:10.140
A lot of shit can change in a couple of years.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.820
And I know that I was prolific.

50:11.820 --> 50:14.340
I know that I would fucking write for no reason.

50:14.340 --> 50:15.540
I remember that.

50:15.540 --> 50:23.580
But I look at musicians because it involves a piece of lumber

50:23.580 --> 50:25.700
and lessons and things.

50:25.700 --> 50:32.340
And when you say that you would really do it by yourself,

50:32.340 --> 50:34.580
I'm so curious about that because are you

50:34.580 --> 50:36.660
searching for something when you do it by yourself?

50:36.660 --> 50:41.500
When you do you plunk out little melodies and like?

50:41.500 --> 50:42.900
Yeah, you do it.

50:42.900 --> 50:46.020
I do it to make sure that it's still there.

50:46.020 --> 50:50.780
If you could fly, OK, why in the comic books,

50:50.780 --> 50:53.980
and this is a new thought, is Superman occasionally not

50:53.980 --> 50:56.860
just levitating a little bit?

50:56.860 --> 50:58.500
If you were Superman, wouldn't you

50:58.500 --> 51:01.460
figure out a way to just like, just like a person

51:01.460 --> 51:03.620
and be like, Superman, can you please not do that?

51:03.620 --> 51:04.620
I'm trying to talk to you.

51:04.620 --> 51:06.780
Maybe it's the thing he does when he's bored with a story.

51:06.780 --> 51:08.580
Just goes up a foot and a half.

51:08.580 --> 51:13.860
And for me, I feel like if I was told by myself and others

51:13.860 --> 51:16.460
that I'm able to perform this act,

51:16.460 --> 51:19.100
I have a system inside of me that does it.

51:19.100 --> 51:21.060
I need to do it every once in a while

51:21.060 --> 51:23.900
to see the system at work so I can remember, oh,

51:23.900 --> 51:27.060
the reason that I'm in this whole affair is because of that.

51:27.060 --> 51:28.900
And that always sort of brings me back.

51:28.900 --> 51:31.300
I mean, we're talking about the impetus

51:31.300 --> 51:33.700
for doing this with your hand.

51:33.700 --> 51:35.300
Pick a note, pick a place.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.820
It's total freedom.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.420
Play it, hear yourself play it.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.580
So you can sit down and play guitar

51:40.580 --> 51:41.940
from a lot of different angles.

51:41.940 --> 51:43.540
Some of it can be like, fuck you.

51:43.540 --> 51:46.140
Although I don't do that very often because I'm very blessed.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.820
But sometimes, sometimes I get in.

51:47.820 --> 51:50.300
And if I were sitting in my hotel room tonight,

51:50.300 --> 51:53.220
I might have made a little smirk in the mirror

51:53.220 --> 51:55.940
and pretended I was at whatever venue the Grammys are at tonight.

51:55.940 --> 51:56.460
I don't know.

51:56.460 --> 51:59.060
But I think to stay in touch with that

51:59.060 --> 52:02.140
is what keeps you healthy and writing great music

52:02.140 --> 52:05.220
that you desperately want people to hear.

52:05.220 --> 52:09.060
Does doing your music live also sort of keep those demons at bay?

52:09.060 --> 52:10.060
Oh, yeah.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.820
And it taught me how to make records.

52:12.820 --> 52:15.180
It's hard to argue with thousands of people.

52:15.180 --> 52:17.140
If you're feeling shitty that day,

52:17.140 --> 52:19.180
it sort of helps to be doing it live, right?

52:19.180 --> 52:20.740
So that's why people stay on tour.

52:20.740 --> 52:23.740
They don't like traveling.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.460
Interesting.

52:25.460 --> 52:27.140
So I'll tell you a little bit about my life.

52:27.140 --> 52:30.300
Recently, I came off tour after a full year of touring.

52:30.300 --> 52:33.500
And I decided no tour for a minute, no plans for a minute.

52:33.500 --> 52:35.860
Figure it out, build a life.

52:35.860 --> 52:37.380
And 40 didn't freak me out.

52:37.380 --> 52:39.420
But it was like, OK, this is a real thing.

52:39.420 --> 52:40.740
It's a real benchmark.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.660
And so I bought a house.

52:42.660 --> 52:45.180
It's been a while before I moved into it, but I got that.

52:45.180 --> 52:46.980
And I'm living in a hotel.

52:46.980 --> 52:50.140
And I realized that I have no life.

52:50.140 --> 52:52.860
Now, you could say tiny violins, but it's a good life.

52:52.860 --> 52:55.260
But I have no life outside of touring.

52:55.260 --> 52:59.700
If I had a grid on a spiral-bound itinerary book,

52:59.700 --> 53:01.660
we don't even talk about life in time.

53:01.660 --> 53:02.780
We talk about it in place.

53:02.780 --> 53:05.580
We say things like, that's not until Dallas.

53:05.580 --> 53:06.500
There's no time.

53:06.500 --> 53:07.820
It's just place.

53:07.820 --> 53:09.780
Well, that's not until California.

53:09.780 --> 53:11.820
Well, back in Denver.

53:11.820 --> 53:15.180
And so my life only lived inside of that framework.

53:15.180 --> 53:16.500
And I took it away.

53:16.500 --> 53:18.940
And I don't have anything to do.

53:18.940 --> 53:20.340
And it's freaky.

53:20.340 --> 53:21.140
It's hard.

53:21.140 --> 53:22.420
And I go, good.

53:22.420 --> 53:23.420
Fight from there.

53:23.420 --> 53:24.220
Start from there.

53:24.220 --> 53:25.860
That's why I'm bumming around the city.

53:25.860 --> 53:27.020
That's why I ran into you today.

53:27.020 --> 53:28.700
That's why I went, yeah, I'm not doing anything.

53:28.700 --> 53:30.140
I took an Uber here.

53:30.140 --> 53:31.820
I wish we could help each other.

53:31.820 --> 53:34.340
But maybe we could just commiserate.

53:34.340 --> 53:37.740
But I think there's a key difference between us,

53:37.740 --> 53:41.100
not that I was searching for symmetry.

53:41.100 --> 53:45.100
But I think it's important, because I'm searching myself.

53:45.100 --> 53:51.140
I'm going, it makes me insecure to hear you talk about being

53:51.140 --> 53:56.300
alone and working your craft.

53:56.300 --> 53:59.780
And I think musicians make me insecure for that reason,

53:59.780 --> 54:01.660
because that is something they do.

54:01.660 --> 54:06.540
And the part of a musician's career that I can relate to

54:06.540 --> 54:11.340
is the touring part, because that is a musician saying,

54:11.340 --> 54:15.180
as Dorothy Parker said, I don't like writing.

54:15.180 --> 54:16.620
I like having written.

54:16.620 --> 54:20.420
And a musician on tour is they're not

54:20.420 --> 54:22.060
going to say, thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

54:22.060 --> 54:23.580
for coming to this stadium.

54:23.580 --> 54:26.860
I'd like to write a song in front of you.

54:26.860 --> 54:29.220
They can have their own religion about the songs they've

54:29.220 --> 54:31.100
written and the stuff they want to play from their old album,

54:31.100 --> 54:35.180
but ultimately, it's like they're just,

54:35.180 --> 54:36.980
that's what I can relate to.

54:36.980 --> 54:39.780
I feel like that's how I spend my life.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.980
But there's something fucked up about that,

54:41.980 --> 54:45.580
because, and I worry about that, like I go, fuck,

54:45.580 --> 54:48.740
when's the last time you actually tested yourself?

54:48.740 --> 54:52.420
When's the last time you sat in a bathroom while the Grammys

54:52.420 --> 54:53.860
party was happening?

54:53.860 --> 54:57.140
I don't go home and write a story.

54:57.140 --> 54:58.940
I play a video game.

54:58.940 --> 55:00.380
I watch forensic files.

55:00.380 --> 55:03.260
I don't want, I don't, I look at writing

55:03.260 --> 55:05.460
as like this thing that I do.

55:05.460 --> 55:08.860
Like it's like shitting a fucking egg.

55:08.860 --> 55:10.420
I look at that with songwriting.

55:10.420 --> 55:11.660
I look at it that way with songwriting.

55:11.660 --> 55:13.620
But it's just disembodied guitar playing,

55:13.620 --> 55:17.180
I just think it's the greatest thing in the world.

55:17.180 --> 55:20.860
But I wonder if I had spent, because how long would you

55:20.860 --> 55:23.460
know, I don't know, like this is probably

55:23.460 --> 55:24.620
a difficult question to answer.

55:24.620 --> 55:28.100
But how long does your career really span?

55:28.100 --> 55:31.660
Like how old were you when, the first time someone said,

55:31.660 --> 55:33.340
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

55:33.340 --> 55:34.900
14.

55:34.900 --> 55:38.180
So I feel like if I had spent, you know,

55:38.180 --> 55:40.740
like somewhere around there, somebody said, like, you know,

55:40.740 --> 55:42.220
you're really good at writing essays.

55:42.220 --> 55:44.580
You should be on the high school paper or whatever.

55:44.580 --> 55:48.340
Like somewhere in our lives, somebody says,

55:48.340 --> 55:52.940
hey, you could get what you want by what you got.

55:52.940 --> 55:59.420
And when I talk to musicians, I get insecure,

55:59.420 --> 56:02.940
because I feel like I'm not, I don't practice.

56:02.940 --> 56:04.260
Well, I don't know that I practice.

56:04.260 --> 56:06.660
I think I just check up on it.

56:06.660 --> 56:08.140
You know, I mean, you're talking.

56:08.140 --> 56:09.100
But you write songs.

56:09.100 --> 56:09.620
You talk.

56:09.620 --> 56:10.620
You have conversations.

56:10.620 --> 56:13.580
You going out and sitting in a coffee shop is practice.

56:13.580 --> 56:15.700
You literally just practiced for the last five minutes

56:15.700 --> 56:16.060
straight.

56:16.060 --> 56:17.060
That was just riffing.

56:17.060 --> 56:19.940
Well, maybe that's why this, you know, maybe.

56:19.940 --> 56:20.780
This is that.

56:20.780 --> 56:24.780
I go in and do it to make sure that it's still there,

56:24.780 --> 56:29.020
because if it's not, my entire argument for life is failed.

56:29.020 --> 56:34.140
Like someone said to me one time, a great lady

56:34.140 --> 56:35.860
worked in publishing.

56:35.860 --> 56:39.780
She said to me, John, can you imagine being famous

56:39.780 --> 56:42.180
and knowing you're not talented?

56:42.180 --> 56:43.660
And I just went, whoa.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.900
And I'll never fail to put the fear of God into me.

56:45.900 --> 56:50.340
And when things get a little pear-shaped,

56:50.340 --> 56:53.100
or they get, or it's not even any more like,

56:53.100 --> 56:53.940
things are too intense.

56:53.940 --> 56:56.540
Do you think anybody famous knows that they're not talented?

56:56.540 --> 56:57.420
Yeah.

56:57.420 --> 57:00.380
Those people would be self-actualized.

57:00.380 --> 57:02.820
Like, I think fame makes you feel.

57:02.820 --> 57:03.940
That's a really good question.

57:03.940 --> 57:06.740
Where is the awareness?

57:06.740 --> 57:10.780
Yeah, I mean, well, if I can't figure it out,

57:10.780 --> 57:13.300
then how could an untalented person figure it out?

57:13.300 --> 57:14.700
You could know it's for them.

57:14.700 --> 57:19.980
If everyone is chanting at you, Donald, Donald, Donald.

57:19.980 --> 57:21.420
I riffed a name.

57:21.420 --> 57:24.180
You'd be like, well, I must be good at something.

57:24.180 --> 57:26.220
I'm good at getting people to shout Donald.

57:26.220 --> 57:27.660
I think the entire thing.

57:27.660 --> 57:31.060
But then nobody else that you like likes you.

57:31.060 --> 57:31.900
That's how you know.

57:31.900 --> 57:34.500
Yeah, but I think we're talking about like,

57:34.500 --> 57:36.340
Smash Mouth, or I don't know what.

57:36.340 --> 57:39.700
I don't have enough musical.

57:39.700 --> 57:41.700
If you told me, Smash Mouth's fucking great.

57:41.700 --> 57:43.460
Fuck you, you snob.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.220
I'd be like, OK, John Mayer.

57:45.220 --> 57:49.780
But I just felt like bands that come

57:49.780 --> 57:51.220
in and out of nowhere or whatever

57:51.220 --> 57:52.820
to keep it in the musical realm.

57:52.820 --> 57:55.660
And they're like, oh, my god, they're amazing.

57:55.660 --> 57:57.540
They got a hit on the Billboard charts.

57:57.540 --> 58:01.700
And we all go, or my music snob friends go, they're not shit.

58:01.700 --> 58:02.740
They're not talented.

58:02.740 --> 58:04.660
That's three power chords or whatever.

58:04.660 --> 58:07.660
Do you think those guys are like,

58:07.660 --> 58:09.500
they know they're untalented?

58:09.500 --> 58:11.140
I don't think they know they're untalented.

58:11.140 --> 58:13.300
I think they're like, holy shit, we fucking hit it.

58:13.300 --> 58:15.180
I think we're talking about varying degrees

58:15.180 --> 58:16.620
of knowing you're untalented.

58:16.620 --> 58:18.300
I think they're all shades of the same thing.

58:18.300 --> 58:20.180
By the way, the way your mind works,

58:20.180 --> 58:22.460
very interesting because it's kind of like a Wonderland

58:22.460 --> 58:24.140
and you don't need to say it.

58:24.140 --> 58:25.780
But I want to give you some.

58:25.780 --> 58:29.340
But if you say it before the end of the show, it'll be a quote.

58:29.340 --> 58:29.700
I will.

58:29.700 --> 58:31.260
Is there a drinking game going on tonight?

58:31.260 --> 58:34.220
No, it's just more of an achievement on my end.

58:34.220 --> 58:35.060
Can I do it now?

58:35.060 --> 58:36.140
We can get it out of the way.

58:36.140 --> 58:37.740
If you look, I didn't fish for it.

58:37.740 --> 58:40.380
But if you want to say it, yeah, you didn't fish for it at all.

58:40.380 --> 58:43.380
You find it interesting that a singer is just not singing

58:43.380 --> 58:44.420
right now and is just talking.

58:44.420 --> 58:48.060
Like the same in here is the ability to sing at any moment.

58:48.060 --> 58:49.020
And I'm not.

58:49.020 --> 58:51.140
I'm just talking, if you thought about this before.

58:51.140 --> 58:53.180
I've been thinking this whole time it's pretty weird

58:53.180 --> 58:54.380
how he's not singing.

58:54.380 --> 58:55.860
You know what I mean?

58:55.860 --> 58:57.660
No, but when you're around a singer, you're like,

58:57.660 --> 58:59.820
that singing voice is not doing its thing.

58:59.820 --> 59:02.860
It's just talking.

59:02.860 --> 59:04.780
I guess I hadn't thought about that.

59:04.780 --> 59:07.660
Oh, I think about it all the time.

59:07.660 --> 59:10.860
Are you right now thinking it's weird that you're not singing?

59:10.860 --> 59:13.140
Now I think it's weird that I can sing.

59:13.140 --> 59:14.060
I'm just not singing.

59:14.060 --> 59:16.780
Yeah.

59:16.780 --> 59:19.380
A more naive person would think you were teeing up

59:19.380 --> 59:21.100
a kind of musical number.

59:21.100 --> 59:24.180
I am, because when I do, it'll be fun.

59:24.180 --> 59:25.420
You'll be like, that's right.

59:25.420 --> 59:28.380
That was in that guy's throat the whole time.

59:28.380 --> 59:30.620
Well, what do we do?

59:30.620 --> 59:32.500
So here I am talking.

59:32.500 --> 59:33.860
I'm a person who's talking.

59:33.860 --> 59:36.500
And at any moment that I want, I can go,

59:36.500 --> 59:39.500
your mind is a wanderland.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.820
And then all of a sudden, I just start talking again.

59:41.820 --> 59:43.860
People wouldn't know that you were talking about me.

59:43.860 --> 59:46.340
So if I was in the lyrics, see, this is.

59:46.340 --> 59:48.140
OK, it's a lot of cadence here.

59:48.140 --> 59:49.140
Hold on a second.

59:49.140 --> 59:51.540
Dan Harmon's mind is a wanderland.

59:51.540 --> 59:53.700
Well, you kind of said the Dan Harmon song.

59:53.700 --> 59:56.460
Dan Harmon's mind is a wanderland.

59:56.460 --> 59:58.060
OK, well, that's.

59:58.060 --> 59:59.740
Yeah, you don't have to take notes.

59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.420
Look at my face.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.780
Thank you.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.060
And I'm talking, and I'm singing, and I'm talking,

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.020
and I'm singing, and I'm talking.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:07.860
Isn't it strange?

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.380
I think it's kind of strange.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.300
It's weird that I could do it at any moment.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.620
I just choose not to.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.020
It's a little Robert Klein in it, little Robert Klein.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.580
What are the things that hurt you?

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.820
In terms of this cloud of people,

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.860
I get the sense from you that, I don't know.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.820
What are the adjectives that you wish?

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.500
Forget about whether or not you've

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.820
come to terms with the fact that you can't control people.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.180
But what are the adjectives about you

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.700
that get used that really sting?

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:57.980
Womanizer, douchebag, anything from the past.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.660
I find that right now, especially with the ability

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.140
to consolidate tons of information really quickly,

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.500
the blind spot is how we deal with past.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.260
And I think everyone should be allowed a past

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.300
as a blanket statement.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.260
I'm not defending anything overall.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:19.620
But things as they exist in the past are the,

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.220
is the sort of, that's the gun to my head

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.780
in the hostage standoff between my happiness

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.140
and feeling like I've got to dig out of a hole.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:31.100
And I find that the internet is fantastic at compiling

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.620
a dossier on you that fast.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.900
With one comment, all it is is someone

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:39.900
who just won't let something go, or the last big signifying

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.020
piece of information they had about you was negative.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.340
If I ask, we don't know, unless we

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.780
Google them to find out what their news is,

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.180
we don't know the goings on of everybody all day.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.900
And that's the mistake we make sometimes.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.860
So people might not have had an updated take on me

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.580
since 2010.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.020
And I find it so disorienting.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.860
I find it such a distortion field of reality

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.420
when I'm living my life in a way that I know is fair and kind

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.780
and good and advanced and improved

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:15.340
and finally together to have your past sort of brought

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.860
to you again in what feels like really

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.660
stark current clarity.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.500
You have to really go, that's not true.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.500
So you know what I'm saying?

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.380
Yeah, somebody rehashes it to build their website.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.140
Somebody pulls something up from 10 years ago.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.740
Somewhere in a comment thing, and you'll go up,

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.580
and it'll just, in the middle of a great thing,

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.380
a great picture and a great thing and having a great moment.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.340
And it took me a really long time

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.340
to get to the point where I can be like,

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.700
get over it, not true.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.660
Get over it, grow up, it's not true.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.060
But that's how you can get me is show me

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.340
what feels like a threatening reemergence of my past.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.900
And it'll stop me, although lately I've

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.860
found a way to just practice looking at it and going,

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.460
long time ago, dude, come on, come on, let's carry on.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.620
This might be your fault now that you're still bringing this up.

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.180
This might actually now be on you.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.300
I had a thing a couple days ago not

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.420
to embarrass my girlfriend, but she was doing something

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.180
that I haven't done in five years, which

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:23.900
is peruse the Harmontown subreddit.

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:31.340
And I had this Me Too surfing expedition recently.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:35.420
I'm giving my master classes and apologies as we speak.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:40.740
But I live, I survive whatever.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.820
And my girlfriend was in this subreddit

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.140
where I haven't gone since way before that because no matter

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.980
what, I'm not going to see anything there that's

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.140
going to make me happy.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.740
I'll see a million things that might make me happy,

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.260
but I'll be numb to those things.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.420
And then one person will be like,

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.020
I wonder if I could really fucking black this guy's

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.020
eye from this far.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.420
And that should be their domain.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.820
But the weird thing is, and it's like,

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.180
you think you resolve this shit.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:15.540
And then I had this little, it was just a little episode

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.620
because Cody got upset.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.780
And she sent me a screen grab of an exchange

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.580
she was having with a troll in that group

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.980
and had to do with all this shit.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.860
And I got upset with her.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.500
And now our seam is broken.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.660
We're not on the same page.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:35.500
And then I'm expressing to a writer friend of mine

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.180
who I'm working with in that room,

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.380
I'm explaining the story to her.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.980
I'm like, this is happening and it's bad.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.380
And that writer, Leslie, is going,

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.900
well, I understand where she's coming from

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.940
because I did this and that.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.460
And I'm telling this is all back straight

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.260
to this moment that was actually genuinely weird for me.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.980
A world where I keep thinking that I'm done learning

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.860
and I just want to die.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:05.700
I, like, this writer that I respect

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.860
who's like talking to me, she goes, like,

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.100
she goes, well, you know, and look, we all Google ourselves.

01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.820
And I exploded.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:20.060
I was like, no, we don't all Google ourselves.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:24.140
I literally cannot Google myself.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.900
Do you understand?

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.860
Do any of you people understand what it's like

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.580
to be unable to Google yourself?

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.420
Yes, I do.

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:42.140
It's a guilty pleasure for you when you wish you were famous,

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:47.300
when you hope maybe, when you think about how shitty it might

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.020
be, when you get to the point where you are choking

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.340
on your own name, when you don't want

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.780
to see your own face.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.460
I do not Google myself and have not.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.740
Stop putting me in that drawer.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:06.900
And I wound down, I'm like, oh, shit, I got unresolved.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.180
That's like when somebody accused you of masturbating

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.060
as a kid and you really weren't.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.060
Yeah.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.260
Like, yeah.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.420
Yes, especially.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.700
Yes, John, yeah.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.420
That's my entire childhood.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.260
I jerked off so many times when no one said anything.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.460
And then I spent too long doing my own laundry.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.860
And I come upstairs and my mom goes,

01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.300
reading, plead, playboy, magazines, much,

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.820
stop, get out of my pants.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.060
I was drying my clothes.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:31.980
Exactly what it is.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.460
You want to know when I jerked off?

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.660
It was right behind you.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.780
Yep.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.740
Yep, right behind.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.700
But yeah, I can't know.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.540
But it was like, the weird thing is that I just jumped

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:48.340
on this woman because she was accidentally confusing me

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.420
with someone who googled themselves.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.620
I quit googling myself.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.020
I think a lot of celebrities quit googling themselves.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.780
It doesn't offer any really good information.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.020
It gives you a really bad cross-section of what's happening.

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.820
It's like you're not really pulling out what's really

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:05.660
in the river.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.060
It's only the money-making headlines.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:07.780
Yeah, it's a weird.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.340
Look at what the fuck the river is, though.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.260
Well, now that's what I want to make sure

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.900
we talk about before whenever this thing is over, is over.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.180
You made it sound a little bit like you're not enjoying it.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:20.660
No, I am, but my well, so what I do now

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.060
is I haven't googled myself in three, four years.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.820
But when I told you this today, when

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.540
I want to see something specific, a certain guitar

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.780
that I'm coming out with or something,

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.740
I'll put the name of the guitar in first and then my name

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.980
because I can't even bear to watch the autofill happen.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.660
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.580
So and if I do, I just go, brah, brah, brah,

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.780
John Mayer, PRS guitar.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.460
Because I can't see what comes up like that.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.060
It might be one of the words that I've mentioned.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.980
I don't know if I've shaken the Chevy Chase

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.820
syphilis from my autofill or not.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.460
I don't know.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.060
Well, that's just.

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.860
Because I won't look.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.100
I will literally, people think I'm joking.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.860
I'll close my eyes if there's some reason for me to type Dan.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.300
Because it goes back to the past thing.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.620
And it goes like that until I finish typing.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.940
What should fucking happen online

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.540
is that every year, everything that had ever

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.260
been posted to the internet that is not

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.340
sort of textual in a reference sense should blur.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.580
Every year, it should blur 10%.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.460
So that when you see an old story,

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.420
when you see someone's old point of view, you can go,

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.740
yeah, but it was pretty blurry.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.060
I couldn't make most of it out.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.140
Because that's what happens in people's minds,

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.780
in their hearts.

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.340
Things blur over time.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.220
Yeah, and I feel compelled to stop here and go, by the way.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.620
It looks like because they just were not complaining.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.260
They were not saying what was me.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.500
We're talking about an island that you don't even

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.500
know if you're listening, whether or not

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.540
you want to get there.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:48.500
And I never signed up for a, I guess

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.180
I always just thought the more attention you get, the better.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.940
The more MySpace friends you have, the better.

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.700
Every metric is just like, well, you want more and not less.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:04.460
I want to go back in time and go, no, I'm artisanal.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.140
I want to squeeze it off and go, don't know me.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.020
I don't want strangers to know my name.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.740
Well, I do.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.580
And I think it's important to square up with that.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.420
And I think it's also important for anybody watching who's

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.180
a fan of either of ours.

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.060
I think the one thing we haven't sort of laid out

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.780
is, to what extent do we wrestle with this every day?

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.020
We haven't really given people context

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.380
as to what fraction of our lives do we deal with this.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.900
This is a very small, I want to say that I am magnifying

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.340
a very small experience.

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.100
It's 15% of the experience.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.940
And most of it, I almost want to say to the world,

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.180
don't worry, I'll handle it.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.340
And it's really handleable.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:46.340
What I find is interesting and sort of universal

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:52.580
is how much we hand off to this voracious sort

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.860
of invisible boa constrictor that just keeps consuming

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.580
our thoughts that don't have a purpose.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.100
Waking up, I know you do the same thing.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.740
You wake up and you read Twitter,

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:07.500
and something seems to you to be so cognitively wrong.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.540
Not a bad opinion, not a bad idea,

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.300
but cognitively empirically wrong.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.180
And you stare at the blinds until it's

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.540
seared into your eyes, the slats of light.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.340
And you haven't even gotten a coffee yet.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.620
And you're already trying to go, you're going, fuck.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.820
And you're trying to get out the knot in the necklace that

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.580
is this whole thing.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.580
And the question is, how much are you

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.420
willing to trade of your life to do that, which seemingly

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.940
has no real actionable outcome, versus I'm just

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.740
going to live a life to scale so that I can at least

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.980
enjoy some of this stuff?

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.100
That's certainly what I've started.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:45.980
I came off Twitter.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.260
I got to enjoy my life.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.500
I feel like what Twitter is trying to do right now

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.780
are basically like full court trick shots

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.220
instead of just like, let's just work off

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.220
of basketball fundamentals.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.820
And every day is a failure to throw the ball off

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.780
like the McDonald's commercial.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.660
And it's like, well, we'll get them again tomorrow.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.940
That's really interesting.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.180
And I go, why can't you piece this out?

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.900
And the answer is because there's too many.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.180
It's like, why can't you leave single file in an arena

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.380
if someone screams fire?

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.620
Because there's chaos.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.700
But you could get everybody out like that.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.300
If you just went, row one, you're out.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.100
Row two, you're out.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:25.620
Row three.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.180
And so every day I watch the pile on.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.220
And I go, no, no, no, no.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.220
And it's for things I'm allied with.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.420
But I watch the course in which it takes.

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.940
And I watch it every day.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.660
Every day you wake up, it's a possibility

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.700
that we might get it.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.020
And within seconds you find out, no.

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.420
And you find out there's people are getting trampled.

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.620
The only thing that nags at me is,

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.900
how do we know the difference between getting over 40

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.340
and realizing that self-care is important

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.820
and becoming old men saying, get off my line.

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.860
I don't understand why the kids spend all their time online.

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:01.100
I think the word that we're trying to get at is fatigue.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.540
There is fatigue with each cycle.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.460
With each cycle.

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.380
The difference is whether you're outputting.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.260
The difference is whether we go into our bathrooms

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.700
and play guitar and put stuff out.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.180
Because if you say, get off Twitter, kids.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.540
I'm not on Twitter doing whatever the fuck you want.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.220
And you put out a single every month or whatever.

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.740
It's like, if you're exuding shit and people

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.300
that are on Twitter are not exuding shit,

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.780
except for tweets, that's the answer to my question.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.420
But I'll take you even deeper on fatigue.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.300
Let's go back to the play guitar in the bathroom thing.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.620
There's fatigue in that.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:40.900
40 is not about some celebration of ordaining

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.500
how many years you've been alive for.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.420
It's how long you've been doing, how your memory begins to,

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.020
the memory of being alive, the access you have to.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.060
There's a certain fatigue where occasionally I'll say to myself,

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.740
just about life in general, we still doing this?

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.460
Yeah.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.180
You ever find yourself, you go, were you still at this?

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.620
And it's not like we want to end this at all.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.660
You just go, were you still at this?

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:06.740
And the answer is, yep.

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.220
And you go, OK.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.100
It's like you see all the days line up.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:18.060
And you're like, yeah, I'm at 60,000 of 140,000.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.140
Just checking in.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.900
But you don't even have to look at it in that numerical way.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.740
You can just feel it.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.100
You can kind of count cards without really counting cards.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:26.700
Right, for sure.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.940
You just kind of feel it.

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.580
It's like, were you still at this?

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.060
OK, what am I about to do?

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.740
Go make another record.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.700
So we're going to fight from scratch to have, yep.

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.740
OK, and we're going to come home three out of four times

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.260
with nothing, with an empty net.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:42.580
We're going to have to live off of something else that night?

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.300
Yep.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.100
We're still at this.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.020
Yep, why?

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.060
It's got to be that way.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.780
Because it's all there is.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.500
Because otherwise we won't sleep tonight.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.260
We can't.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.900
It won't work.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.660
Like I have to risk everything.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.180
I have to have everyone hate me.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.500
I have to do it.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.060
I have to prove something to myself.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.820
Yeah.

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.700
And where I think it gets really tricky

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:08.940
is in relationship and family, getting a wife,

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.540
getting a girlfriend.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:15.980
That takes a certain determination

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.300
that might not exist in my life like it should anymore.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.660
Because my determination is taking

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:25.460
a natural dip, testosterone, determination.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.300
It starts to just go down a little bit.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.660
Old jazz horn players don't play as long a line.

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:31.140
You know?

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:31.420
That's true.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.180
And vocalists do the same thing.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:32.700
Vocalists.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.580
They don't sing as like, oh, you guys

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.540
used to burn on the saxophone with bop lines for four minutes.

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.500
Go.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.700
Bo-da-bo-da-bo-da.

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.700
And everyone loves them.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.140
And everyone goes, that's the guy who used to burn.

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.260
And I used to burn, and I'm trying to still burn.

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.340
I think I've got two more burning things in me.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.940
That's why I want to make sure I do on my next one.

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.140
I feel like I have one more burn.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.300
You have one more way to burn.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.820
You motherfuckers wish.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.980
You know, we don't get to say that.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.780
You wish.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.180
We don't get to say that.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.500
You know, we wish we had like one or two burns.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.340
But the truth is, the universe, whoever gave us the shit,

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.740
is going to tell us when we get to stop burning.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.900
You're going to find out mid-failed burn.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.380
How many burns you got?

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:09.880
Yeah.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.380
Failed burn.

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.780
Burn!

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.340
That's my first daughter's name.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.380
Mid-fail burn.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.100
I wish I could retire.

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.580
We don't get to, you know, the deal.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.500
Yeah.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.020
You're going to be six burns in.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:23.780
Yeah.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.220
I just mean like, and I agree.

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.820
I'm not saying that's not what you're saying.

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.620
But I'll always be making records.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.820
But like, burning things, like you listen to like 21 pilots.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.980
That shit is burning.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.740
That's a 21, 22-year-old kid who's got so many syllables.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.060
When you're young, you got syllables.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:40.900
Sometimes I think too much.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:41.900
Ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.980
I went and I had those thoughts.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.220
I wish somebody could bottle the smell.

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.620
And they were like, I had those thoughts.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.220
I went that close to the wallpaper.

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.420
And those are the kids that we send to war and convince to.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:51.900
Yeah.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.420
Dark is fun, Dan.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.860
They're brains are on fire and we go, yeah, fuck you.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.180
You're a child that you need to be.

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:01.660
But I did it.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.900
I went from, welcome to the real, what she said to me,

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.540
condescendingly, take a seat, take your life, blot it out.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.580
And we're not even halfway through the verse.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.580
Not even halfway through the first verse.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.700
That's what happens when you're younger.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:12.340
You burn.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.020
You want to go out.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:13.540
You want to drink.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.140
Hi, my name is.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:14.740
Hi, my name's John.

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.540
Hi, my name's John.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.220
And then you hopefully, through those actions,

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.420
and you dial them in enough and get enough focus,

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.820
you go, oh, at the end of that nitro burn,

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.860
I ended up with a wonderful wife, three kids,

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.020
I got a house, I got a career, I got a thing.

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:30.140
The stages to which my career, the booster rocket

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.700
worked and the way it burned to stick with this burn,

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.180
metaphor till it dies out, is that I have incredible career.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.980
I have an incredible mindset.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.460
I got to where I needed to get to and I went, oh, there's nobody.

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.860
I forgot to pick someone up.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.660
And then add to that the trauma that everybody feels

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.020
through the way that they live through their 20s for dating

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:51.860
and 30s for dating.

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.780
And I have that times 100 because I

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.100
chose, in many ways, without knowing it,

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:59.740
to do that in a very visible way that, in a way,

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.700
my brain is just fried from it.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.820
That's the part that scares me.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.020
Everything else is a joy ride.

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:09.020
The part that scares me is that I might have missed the boat.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.620
And in which case, it would still be cool

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.500
because I would just be like, rich uncle John,

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.140
you could come to his island and a drone comes out

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:15.860
to get you first.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.940
And you're like, you start running after the drone.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.860
You see the drone first, like war games.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.180
You're running after the drone?

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.020
Remember war games when they're going to see Joshua?

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.140
Yeah, there was a helicopter came.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.420
But that was pre-drone.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.540
If you just like your drone, you have to run after it

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.140
because that's how fancy you are.

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.300
They would get off the boat.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.340
It's John Mayer's drone.

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.860
It doesn't come hunting you.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.940
You have to fucking chase it.

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.500
I'm trying to make a good impression on my niece

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.300
who I haven't seen as she's seven, probably.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.180
I wouldn't have seen my niece in like seven years.

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.220
And I'll give her the drone.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.100
It's going to be hers.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.620
If you chase the drone and catch it,

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.140
you can keep a John Mayer drone.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.820
The John Mayer drone will go, you're

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.580
mine is a wonderland.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.900
Now I'm doing an impression of people doing an impression of you.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.460
You're bad.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.980
The white noise, just all white noise.

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.300
That's the name of my next album.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.820
We hear that you are a Rick and Morty fan.

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:02.300
Is that true?

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.740
Huge Rick and Morty fan.

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.300
I'm such a big fan of Rick and Morty

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.900
that as I watch it, I lament the minutes I've already

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.380
watched it for.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:09.940
Do you know what I mean?

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.440
Yeah.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:10.940
Like up.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.440
Yeah.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.500
Four minutes in.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.060
What's the, well, I mean, that seemed like a segue.

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.260
We could talk about Rick and Morty, but I actually,

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.540
I don't know, I wanted to hear, like I asked you,

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.140
you said douchebag and womanizer,

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:28.180
these are things that sting, which I look at as like with,

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.860
I'm just like marveling.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.460
I'm like, it must be nice to have

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:36.620
being called a womanizer to your kryptonite.

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.660
Maybe it's because when you talk,

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.940
I want to fuck your brains out.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.660
I always tell people, if you think

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.940
that I thought that I was good looking growing up,

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.500
why do you think I would have played

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.820
guitar six hours a day?

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.420
There's my, there's your answer.

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.900
I played guitar six hours a day.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.340
If I had any inclination or belief in myself

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.740
that I was good looking, I'm sure I don't have the will

01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.300
to have done that.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.500
What are the things you like to hear?

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.060
What are the things you wish to hear?

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.100
Or when you hear them, that it's like fucking,

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.180
like even secretly, like, you're just like, god damn it,

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:07.700
I love hearing that.

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.460
I like when people say like, you're my Clapton.

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.620
I like, because I can use that.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.300
That's a good, clean, linear line item way

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.220
to be like, that's what's going on.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.220
Because you do want proof that you're

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.220
living your life in the format of your dreams as a kid.

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.340
What does that mean to you, you're my Clapton?

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:26.340
It means everything I tried to be, I got to it.

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.100
Because I tried to be your Clapton.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.300
Well, because what was Clapton to you?

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:35.220
An incredible mix of blues guitar and mainstream music,

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.180
which not to get super technical,

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.740
but blues music isn't really an idiom of music.

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.620
It's a style of writing.

01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:47.020
It's a compositional form.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.300
And there's not a lot of money in blues.

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.020
There's not a lot of audience in blues.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.140
And part of me thinks it's because blues

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:58.140
needs to be mixed with another compound to come to life.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.300
And you could say, for everybody who came around,

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.860
they kind of were.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.100
Am I right in saying Stevie Ray Vaughan

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.020
sort of did the same thing?

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.700
Yes, Stevie Ray Vaughan did the same thing.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.220
Jimmy Hendricks did the same thing.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:16.260
And Clapton is the guy who fused really incredibly

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:20.380
prestigious blues playing with pop music.

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.980
And that's incredibly hard to do.

01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.260
To get those two organisms to live together

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.780
and not reject each other and just turn

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.820
into a blob and a Petri dish, it's really hard.

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.540
Like nine out of 10 attempts to do it,

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.260
you just end up with nothing.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:39.020
So I mean, that guy stands in his own universe.

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.860
It's in the way that you use it.

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.980
Let me ask you a question.

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.900
Do you think that's a cool song?

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.980
I think it's a funny song.

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.420
The thing I think is funny about it

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.660
is that it's the only song I've ever heard that

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.980
starts mid-refrain.

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:54.820
Yeah, there's a couple.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.140
It's really funny that that song just goes, all right.

01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.100
It's in the world.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.420
Normally, a song like that should start with,

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.020
sometimes you use things.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:10.020
Matt Bump, sometimes the way, boom, boom.

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.660
That was a big 80s trick, though.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.300
And then you build and build and build.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.940
And you're waiting for him to go.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.660
But he was just like, I just think

01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:18.500
it's funny that the needle drops on that record.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.940
It's like, two, three.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.380
It's in the way that you use it.

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:23.860
Fuck it.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.700
And then they eventually come around

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.260
to proving that that was the refrain.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.820
It's like, that's not the verse.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.580
That's the refrain.

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.100
That came from 80s producer mindset,

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.140
which was like, gotta hit him with the hook.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.060
There's no time.

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:35.780
No time for this.

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.340
There's no time.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.540
These kids are going to buy a Pokemon instead of your record

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.500
if you give them five measures.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500
That's the way it is now.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.020
I mean, you've got to hit him with the mixtape in one song.

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.220
One, don't pick up the phone.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.420
You know he's only one in the highway cone.

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.540
Two, don't poop in your shoe.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.140
I got the rules that tell you three.

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.540
This is the whole record in one song?

01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.260
I don't know.

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.220
I was just thinking of like, you got to get,

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.380
that song reminds me of a BuzzFeed article.

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.220
That's like.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.700
Oh, it's like a listicle song.

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.180
Yeah.

01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:10.380
I went skydiving in a narrow plane.

01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.740
Yeah, that country has that a lot.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.900
Here's six ways to lose weight by Friday.

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.900
Yeah, like I would make it up and it'd be like,

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.020
I went skydiving.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.300
I went mountain climbing.

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.060
I walked 50,000 miles across the land.

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.260
We're only halfway through.

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.140
I swam across the river.

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.820
I walked across the gator, but there's

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.380
one thing that I'll never understand.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.700
And then a completely different phrase

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:42.020
that just lands like unbalanced into the title.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.780
Well, I don't know why you're not a bun for my hot dog.

01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.260
That's right.

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.260
Yeah, that's right.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.140
And you're like, wait, what?

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.220
Where was the mountain guy?

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.420
Why would you climb a mountain?

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.020
How do we get there?

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.940
Well, this was just misdirection.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.940
Yeah.

01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.460
And at the last line, it's like, but check your back pocket.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:01.300
That's right.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:04.860
I got your wallet.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.100
Just taking your wallet.

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.700
I'll mix your metaphors, darling.

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.300
I'll mix them better than a gun.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.740
I wrote a line one time.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.260
It was just I couldn't handle it.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:19.020
I wouldn't put it, you're like a metaphor I've never heard

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.020
before.

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.660
And I went, that's so cyclical because no one really

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.180
has heard that metaphor before.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.180
And if you wondered, does John Mayer

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.060
have a theoretical limit to how poetic something can be?

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.820
Yes, that will never make the cut.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:31.980
There it is, yeah.

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.140
I thought in your body's in Wonderland,

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.820
I know it's like, oh, it's your hit, and you're not like,

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.060
oh, it's also a most proud of it.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:43.660
But I did think the verse where you compare,

01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.820
would you say your nipples are like Epcot center?

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.980
It was, I pushed it.

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.540
I think you're pushing the metaphor.

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.860
Yeah, it's like you didn't have to go through every part

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:57.220
of the body and compare it to theme park.

01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.140
Your toes are like a quick pass.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.100
Yeah, your toes are like little, little, little shrimp.

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:06.300
And then I said, you have a langoustine pinky toe.

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.340
If you love a woman, just tell her you love her.

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.820
A lot of times, that's good enough.

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.220
When you love a woman.

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.820
That was a direct response to your body as a woman.

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.780
Brian Adams wrote, when you really love a woman,

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.940
is a way to tell me to shut the fuck up in your body

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.380
and go on and on.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.060
You don't have to write a cheesy song about how

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.060
body parts are like rights.

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.500
Because when you find yourself lying helpless in her arms,

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:39.460
you know you don't need a stupid song.

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:40.220
I'm like, man.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.660
Your vagina's like the haunted hotel

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.140
before they were using it to advertise the Eddie Murphy

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.620
movie.

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.180
Your vagina is the classic version of that.

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.980
I've got a fast pass to your titties.

01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.780
So I'm going to eat at your naval restaurant.

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:05.060
You had that, Kaden, I'll take a fast pass to your titties.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.460
It was very Western.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.540
I took a fast pass to your titties.

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.140
I'm curious about the slo-bo tea.

01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.980
Well, I'm curious about singing.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.300
Because, well, so people just have pipes, right?

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:19.420
So is that genetic?

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.860
Yeah, and it actually is.

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.620
As I get older, now I realize I can't take it personally

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.260
if someone says I can't sing.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.580
Or I go like, this is the shape my voice is in.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.140
I literally can't change it.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:33.700
Whatever my pharynx is, whatever the larynx is,

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.700
it's a shape.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.100
And it's like the shape of a wind instrument.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.100
So I'm very good at singing low.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.740
And I'm very bad at singing high.

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.260
In fact, worse than ever, because I had some vocal issues.

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:44.900
You had surgery.

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.580
Yeah, surgery.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.060
Like you battled back.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:47.660
What's the answer?

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.500
Yeah, it's kind of awesome.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.300
Thank you.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.820
I looked at it like Kobe would look at it, which is like,

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.300
yeah, if you need to go into the knee, go into the knee.

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.660
If I can't play a season, I want a championship next year.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.740
So go into the knee this year.

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.980
Would you have continued just to play guitar

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:03.620
if that had gone down?

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.580
Yeah, but I got to tell you I learned how much I love singing.

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.140
Because I did do that, and they're linked.

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.420
I didn't think they were linked.

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.300
Once I got my voice back, I was like, OK, with what I have,

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.580
which is still mostly capable.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.580
When people who can sing are singing,

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.500
as a person who cannot sing and who occasionally then

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.140
sings, like in karaoke, like the rest of us,

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:26.380
and you have these moments where you're listening to yourself

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.220
and you go, oh, I sound a little bit like George

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.620
Michael for that one moment.

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:36.260
When people who can sing, do you, is there dread?

01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:39.260
If you're in front of a stadium and you're singing,

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:43.100
do you, is every note like an evil, conneval jump?

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:46.300
Or are you just like, nah, I got this?

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:47.980
Some are.

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.780
OK, so when I feel like I have a well-slept reflexes in check,

01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:57.140
I sleep on a medicated pillow, prescription pillow.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.220
It's on a slant, I sleep on my side.

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.820
I hide it when company comes over.

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.140
But most of the time, I use it.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:07.780
That's like the sexiness of John Mayer atmosphere.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.740
The medicated pillow just bounces off.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.580
Sorry, I have a prescription pillow.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.780
But then you could also see, because I'm a singer.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.900
But when I know that the facility is there,

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.100
it's really, really fun.

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:26.540
But singers are a notoriously sensitive, hyper-focused,

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.500
neurotic bunch, because the voice is never

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.300
the same way two days in a row.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.460
My voice has never been the same way, any two days.

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:35.900
It's just a natural thing.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.420
Your voice changes.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.300
There are things you could go for on the record that

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.140
don't sound the same live.

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.740
And that's another thing I've come to live with over the years.

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.060
But when you're young, and it's the showcase,

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.580
and you're an LA, let me tell you this, when you're an LA

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.420
for your showcase, and you're starting out,

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.300
you're playing the club, you will get sick.

01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.220
You just will.

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.100
You just will get sick.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.180
You'll wake up that day and go, ha, ha.

01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.020
And you live with that.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.420
And you go crazy for the day.

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.220
You take prednisone.

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.260
Every singer has prednisone stashed away.

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.060
Every singer dopes in that sense.

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.900
And it's because there are horror stories.

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:07.820
It's up here.

01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:12.260
Or what, but have you, do you experience these moments

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.860
where, like, what's the worst case scenario?

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.580
Because from the layman's perspective,

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.860
all we understand is, like, oh, it's like the Rockstar game

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.780
where, like, there's eight notes and you hit the note right.

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.780
And then you professionals are like, oh, no,

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.300
it's all this other shit.

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.460
But we look at it like, oh, Madonna canceled her gig.

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:35.500
Sorry, I'm dating myself.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.700
She canceled her gig because she's got a sore throat.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.500
OK, well, that's the big, but to me,

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.260
the nightmare wouldn't be canceling a gig.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.100
It would be, is there this theme?

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.940
The nightmare is canceling the gig

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.140
because you just stare out your hotel window.

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.220
Have you ever been in front of a bunch of people

01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:53.220
and been like, your body is a ha?

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.900
Yes, but I've learned that they really, most of the time,

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:57.700
can't tell.

01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.900
And you interpret, right?

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.340
Yeah, most of the time, they can't tell.

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.020
98% of the time, they can't tell.

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.180
And so that's my next question.

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.820
Like, what, so it's not just this empirical thing

01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.420
because your voice, I can hear it,

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.740
even though I don't even like music.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.980
I'm like, I get it.

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.740
You can get it by the way.

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.380
I know why your voice is special.

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:17.420
I can hear it.

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.020
Like, you're listening to different shit,

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.340
and you're going, shit, I lost 5% of the mayor sound.

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:28.180
So this is the difference between having a good performance

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.100
and giving a good performance.

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.500
You can give a good performance, which means you liked it.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:32.900
You liked it.

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:33.420
You liked it.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.380
But I didn't have a good performance.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.460
And having a good performance is in the user experience

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.980
of how it feels to have the auto mat arm go for the note,

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.180
pull it, have the muscles go reek like that,

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.700
have the air push through the right way,

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.420
have the microphone turned up loud enough,

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.540
and the monitor's in the right way,

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:50.380
and the thing bouncing around, the sound wave's

01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:51.540
bouncing around the room in the right way,

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.940
and they come back to you in a way that says, you are God.

01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:54.900
And it feels good.

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.900
That's what I wanted to know.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:59.700
Because actually, that's how normal people feel, too.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.580
When they accidentally hit a note,

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:02.540
that's why we sing in the shower.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.220
Oh, I see what you're saying.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.100
Because the shower makes us feel like that.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.340
Do you think that every normal person to use your parlance,

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.460
do you think that every one of them

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:14.060
has one pet favorite line from a song that you sing

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.740
that they picked up in the shower because it sounds?

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:21.580
Micravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.580
Yeah.

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:27.100
Sorry, it's a commercial from Milwaukee.

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:30.140
No, but it's more importantly, but yes, the answer

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.020
to your question is yes.

01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:31.580
People like.

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:32.460
Do you have one?

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.060
Is there a song, like a little line you go,

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.100
I still got it on that one.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:35.900
Just get it out.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.540
Yeah, if I can hit any, like this is dating myself,

01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:39.980
but any Philip Bailey.

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.460
Yeah.

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.180
My Michael McDonald is falling apart as I get older.

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:44.860
As I get older.

01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.740
But so did his.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.860
Right, right, right, right.

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.220
I'll just learn to sing how he sings now.

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:49.820
I love those.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.140
I love listening to Easy Lover all the time.

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.980
Yeah, that's why we get along, because I'm a Phil Collins guy.

01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.860
We never sung Easy Lover together.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.980
It's such the drummer's mix of that song.

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.540
Biddu-duh-duh-duh-duh, biddu-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:06.060
Because it's two, you know, doing drummers.

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.340
So you were like, oh, they had to agree on this track.

01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:09.660
They really had to love this track,

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.020
because it starts out with big drums.

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:14.020
Actually, that also starts out with Easy Lover.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:14.500
Yeah.

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.100
Oh, you're right.

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:15.500
Starts with the phrase.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.380
You're absolutely right.

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.380
It starts with the fucking refrain.

01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:18.780
That was the 80s thing, was like, hit.

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.220
You got to hit him.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.180
Got to hit him with the hook first.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.380
Got to hit him with the hook.

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.140
Give him a hit.

01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.420
But I thought actually to myself,

01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.300
there's a sign of an amazingly good song.

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.660
Because when I hear it, and I wonder

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.940
what it must have been like the night the artist finished it

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.100
and sat back and played it for the manager.

01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.260
And imagine being like, Joel, come here.

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.060
Joel, sit down.

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.020
Press play.

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:42.460
And you hear, biddu-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:46.860
Dun, dun, dun-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.980
And Joel's like, I like it.

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.820
You're like, shut up, Joel.

01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:49.340
How's it going?

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:49.820
Hold on.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.820
Biddu-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:54.460
You're like, Easy Lover.

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.420
And you're just like this.

01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.180
Yup.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.860
That's a victorious moment.

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:02.820
I love the producer nod that's like, this is a hit.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:03.460
Imagine that.

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.100
Every documentary where they just knew it right.

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.700
But I kind of think that, yeah, but it's

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.740
interesting to note that you feel the same feeling

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.220
that my uncle feels in the shower.

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:20.140
There are the, it's just that when you're feeling it,

01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.900
it's more in line with a bunch of people hearing it.

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.020
But we all feel it when we, that sensation of, fuck,

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.420
I'm nailing it.

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.780
And it's weird to me, as a person who doesn't understand

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.100
anything about music or singing, like, what, yeah,

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:33.940
what is that?

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.380
But that's a different podcast.

01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.180
I'll tell you, as a guitar player,

01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:39.460
anybody who picks a guitar can feel the same way I feel.

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.620
It's so scalable.

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:41.900
It's the same feeling.

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.020
That's what makes it a magic thing.

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.660
Like, you take it home and you learn fire and rain.

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:50.860
I promise you it has the same experiential bliss

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.220
that my writing gravity does.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.380
I'm sure of it.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.180
But just imagine being like, hey, Dan,

01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.340
can I tell you something?

01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:57.900
Check this out.

01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.460
Here, have a seat.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:59.380
You want to go, check?

01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:03.220
I was born by the river.

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.900
Like, the moment in a little stream.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.180
In the strings.

01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.260
Just like that river, and I'm watching to make sure

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.540
you don't get on your phone.

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.140
Ever since, gonna be alone.

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:17.620
That's the first time anybody's heard it.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.220
Long time coming, and I know.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.500
You're like, he likes it.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.700
And then some guy goes, do the strings have

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.700
to start from the beginning?

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.140
You go like, Bobby, I told you put tambourine in it.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:35.260
Bobby, Bobby, I told you put tambourine.

01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.340
I told you, you're not going to hook up the recorder.

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.780
I told you, my daughter played recorder.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.260
You know, this is for Colgate Records.

01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:43.740
They want it minty.

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.020
This doesn't feel minty.

01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.020
You're going to say river, you're going to say field.

01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.860
You was born by a field, Bobby.

01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.780
I miss the days where the lead singer would

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.100
talk to the drummer.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.940
What you going to play now?

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.380
Have you ever seen the thing on YouTube,

01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:06.340
the young ladies singing the jingles in the 80s

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.180
for the bread company?

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.660
It's a patty kick.

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:14.220
Patty kicks, patty kicks.

01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.860
It's like 40 minutes of her doing takes on this jingle.

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.580
And your heart goes out to her, and she's just like,

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:26.180
she's in this sweater, and it's the 80s,

01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:28.140
and it's VHS, and she's just in this booth,

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.740
and it's just over and over again, endless takes.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.460
She's like, uh-huh, OK, all right, sorry.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:33.660
Yeah.

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:40.500
Patty kicks, patty kicks, because clearly what they're

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.260
saying is give it more bread.

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:48.180
She's not singing about something she feels anything

01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.540
about, but she's trying.

01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.180
And then you just watch her reaching for it.

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:56.620
And she's like, patty, you know that patty kicks are my bread.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.100
And then she keeps getting cut off so many times,

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.100
you never get to the, I guess you'd call it a bridge,

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.620
but it's a jingle.

01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.020
And that's the amazing part.

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.180
It's like 20 minutes into this reel.

01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:10.980
She finally gets all the way to the point

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.700
where you get to hear the rest of the song,

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.620
and it's like a bridge.

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:18.580
And she's like, because it's good bread.

01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.300
You know, it's good bread.

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:29.140
Like, that's the velhalla you get too.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.420
If you jump through all those hoops,

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.020
you get to sing, it's good bread.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.740
And this poor woman, who's born with the voice of God,

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:41.100
everyone's getting like the creatives are giving this gift.

01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.380
And then they're like, they're just

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.740
putting these actual glass boxes.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:49.420
Can you give us a little more raisin on the raisin?

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:52.780
Because it's raisin, bread.

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.580
It's amazing.

01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.540
I just think it'd be so fun.

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.780
The realism of hearing a little bit of what she hears

01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.940
on the track through her earphones, just like a little bit.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:02.020
You just hear the music.

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:05.540
You just hear that little bit through her headphones.

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.540
Patty kicks.

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:11.020
Patty kicks.

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.220
Run it back.

01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:15.300
I imagine that someone like you probably

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.500
has lived his whole career wondering,

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:23.140
when do I get an opportunity to sing

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:30.900
the improvised hook for an improvised rap about just

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.260
anything?

01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:35.100
When do I get to really let loose and just be John Mayer

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:38.300
on the Dan Harmon rap?

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:41.100
Well, I believe now that the way that I

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:45.540
can speak to my abilities without sounding arrogant

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:49.980
is to speak to my potential.

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:53.100
I believe that I am a man of infinite potential.

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.020
I believe that my potential is far greater

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.380
than anyone else's potential.

01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.540
And I believe that.

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:01.260
So I don't even know what I'm capable of.

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:03.380
I am also just discovering.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:05.700
Every day I wake up, if I choose to,

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:09.380
I can put my hand in a goldfish and pull out something new,

01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.940
something I didn't know that I could do.

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.700
This is a super cool speech.

01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.220
You caught me on the same night.

01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.540
I'm feeling the same way.

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.580
I don't know if I can rap.

01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:23.220
And one might say that anything that's

01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.180
come to me that has been deleterious in any way

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:29.580
has come because of my belief in my potential.

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.100
Yes.

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:30.740
Holy shit.

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.140
It has all just been infinite potential.

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.140
And this is why I feel like I get flattened out

01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.860
and two-dimensional when things go my way,

01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.740
because I lose the sight of my potential,

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.140
because my potential is realized.

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.580
And I don't feel at home there.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.620
So whatever song you have, Dan Harmon,

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:49.460
I want you to believe that I'm going to drop into it

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.460
with vigor and dedication, like it was my patty cakes.

01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:55.860
Let us bring this vigor.

01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.460
Give me a beat.

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:02.740
Don't give me time to think about it.

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:05.380
Oh, shit.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.500
Yo.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.660
Yo.

01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.100
Rap isn't about thinking.

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.300
It's the Titanic's not about sinking.

01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.180
It's about floating on the ocean with water.

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.340
Rap is going from mothers to daughters.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.940
The patriarchy has got to come down.

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.700
I fucked your mama so hard, I turned her smile upside down.

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.460
But that doesn't mean she started frowning.

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:28.860
It just means happiness was inverted for her.

01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.860
My name is Dan Harmon.

01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:33.220
I'm here to say that I'm here to say things in a rapping way.

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:36.500
I like to rap west and rap to the east.

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.300
I fucked your mama like a beast.

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.620
But let's talk about the earth and horizons.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.540
I fucked your mama, and it was surprising.

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:45.940
I'm not trying to use the fuck your mama crutch.

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:50.060
I'm not Starsky or Hutch.

01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.460
I'm rapping for real.

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.260
From the top of my head, John Mayer's here to help me.

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:59.460
I'm going to respect his involvement and not be hack.

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:02.580
I'm going to flow from my head down to my heart

01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:06.420
and rap instead in a real way and rap from the soul

01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.700
and do it like rock and roll.

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:11.820
I'm going to rap like a stream, rap like a mountain.

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.700
I fucked your mama like she was a fountain.

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:14.700
OK, stop.

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:15.860
Don't stop.

01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:16.980
I didn't mean you stop.

01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.500
I'm rapping.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.780
Take it.

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.300
Don't you know it's now or never?

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:25.020
We can't do it all so clever.

01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.980
We've got to do it together.

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.940
We've got to do it together.

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.460
Don't you know it's now or never?

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.220
All we've got to be is clever.

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.940
Don't you know we've got to do it together.

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.020
All we've got to get together.

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.700
Birds from a feather.

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:44.100
They flock together depending on the weather.

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.060
When it's warm out, they go down to Miami.

01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:52.900
They fuck your mama like Sammy, a friend of mine.

01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.660
Just give me a chance.

01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.700
All right, give me a chance.

01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.500
Just give me a second.

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.860
We're OK to fail here.

01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.500
Rap, rap.

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.660
You know it's now or never?

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.780
Tell your mama, check the weather.

01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.580
Whatever we do is clever when we all get together.

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:15.580
Yeah, when we rap, we join together and then we clap.

01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:16.980
And then we do it together.

01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:17.700
Friends.

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.540
And then we're friends.

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:24.620
And then it's like, yo, yo, when I went, I'm rapping.

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.220
Bumble.

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.860
Yeah, no, it's fine.

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.460
Stammer.

01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.140
Yo, we keep rapping.

01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.900
Foot in a shoe, I fucked your mama and shot my glue.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:37.020
I put it on her envelope.

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.100
And then we went off and got married.

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:39.900
We eloped.

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.380
I proposed to her and she said yes.

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.700
And then we went and met Hermann Hesse.

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.300
He was a Nazi war criminal, but he was fine.

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.860
He's not a good person.

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:53.100
But he allowed us to dine in his living room.

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.940
He gave us some shrooms.

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.660
And we went in the backyard and we looked at her hands.

01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.380
And they looked like cosmic shards.

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.980
And they were reflecting the moonlight.

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.500
And we said, holy shit, humanity is United,

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.700
like loaves of bread.

01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.540
Oh, shit, we're all yeast.

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:10.180
And we're rising up to the west of the east.

01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:13.940
And then Herman is your daddy now.

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.300
He's been here with your mother.

01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.100
And he likes to tell the world about it.

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.980
There's no harm in harming.

01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:23.260
John Mayer.

01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:24.180
Don't you know that?

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:26.300
There's no harm in harming.

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.300
He and your daddy.

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:27.860
John Mayer.

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.180
He could have broken the news.

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:33.900
Maybe a little better, but what better time

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.020
than a freestyle line to let you know that he'll

01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.620
be coming home to put you in your place

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.420
via your mama's face than harming.

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.900
There's no harm in harming.

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.500
I should give you two different hooks

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:48.620
to choose from in the mix.

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.620
Yeah, well, we're not going to edit it.

01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.060
Here's me at a different pitch.

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.460
I'm doing a different sitch.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.500
I got my vocoder over here.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:02.060
I turned the knob, and now I'm sitting in a higher pitch.

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.100
OK, we won't do that.

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.500
John Mayer went to lunch one day, and he saw your mama.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.180
And he said, hey, and he said, my name's John Mayer.

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.180
And she said, hi.

01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.740
And he said, I'm going to take you to the sky.

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.380
And he sang, your body's a wonderland.

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:23.340
But what about my dick?

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.620
And she said, I'm not standing in line for it.

01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.220
And he said, you don't have to.

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:28.260
I'll take you to the front.

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:32.340
And she said, yo, you got a fast pass to my front.

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.340
Yes!

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:33.840
All right.

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.340
Yes!

01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:35.840
Yes!

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:42.020
10 minutes left.

01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.780
How it's called fast pass.

01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:44.420
You're fearless.

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.020
As a window.

01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.460
You don't let the fact that you can't think of anything

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.060
stop you from going.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:51.620
No, that's the virtue of it.

01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:54.740
You might say my mind is a wonderland.

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:55.420
He did.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.420
He already did.

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.740
Well, he said it, but it was two different looks.

01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.300
He said it in multiple ways.

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:00.800
Darn it!

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.300
Darn it!

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.300
He said it right.

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:03.100
That's beautiful.

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:03.600
Oh, yeah.

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.300
I gave you, there's no holland of a nana.

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.140
Yeah.

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.900
And also, we came full circle because you got to actually

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:11.900
do some add-ins.

01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.400
I did.

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.540
At the top of the presentation, we

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.420
said, who's the dude that does the rap add-ins?

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:15.920
Yep.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.380
You said it, Marvin Hess.

01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:18.300
And I said, Sid Artha.

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:18.940
I dropped Sid Artha.

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.020
That was perfect.

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.020
I mean, come on.

01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.220
It's hard to do.

01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:22.740
It's hard to do.

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:23.660
You did it.

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:24.380
It's hard to do.

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:25.500
It is hard to do.

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.460
I mean, I'm serious.

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.860
I was thinking that whole time, you just buzzed it off Sid

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:29.360
Artha.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.980
I couldn't do one.

01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:31.480
Yeah.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:31.980
It was great.

01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:32.620
It was great.

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.820
You have to be an open channel, but not too open.

01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:36.460
I try to close my channels.

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.100
Yeah.

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.060
I try to keep the aperture just as gaping wide as possible.

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:40.780
That makes sense.

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:41.860
Why don't you guys get a room?

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.700
You know, he's not going to be back here next week.

01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:44.660
I won't be back next week.

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:45.860
I didn't think he would.

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:47.660
Well, you don't have to cozy up to him like this.

01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.500
I would say he's a guest.

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.140
I'm trying to make him feel welcome

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.820
and like he didn't make a mistake tonight.

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:51.820
OK.

01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.980
We'll try to walk a line where you don't make me feel

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:55.660
unwelcome by just saying.

01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.780
I love that on the night of the Grammys,

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.860
I wrote a song with Dan Harmon about the fact

01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.180
that he's having copious amounts of sex with America's mother.

01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.420
America's mother.

01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.420
Now, this does circle back to everything

01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.740
we were talking about, being disruptive, being strange.

01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:14.100
On Grammy night, I showed up here, and we jammed out.

01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.900
And my fate is unclear after this.

01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:19.820
We'll probably win a Grammy next year for this.

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.100
That's the only reason I'm here.

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.420
So how do we put together?

01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:26.340
I was going to say, the one thing I didn't get to is,

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.660
Dan, the way your mind works, and I love being a map maker.

01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:29.780
Wonderlandish.

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.820
Wonderlandish.

01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:32.220
Oh, that's why I could never get to it.

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.060
There was the Wonderland smoke bomb went on.

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.300
You subdivide.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.660
Your brain cleaves.

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.140
You take one thing, you cut it into two.

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:39.900
You go because it's A and B. You take B,

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:43.180
and you go because it's B with 1 and 2 and italics underneath.

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.580
You build, it's kind of increasingly,

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.140
what's the mathematical theorem where you just

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.980
keep cutting the distance between here and the wall

01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:52.300
and you never get to the wall?

01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.500
ADD, I don't know.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500
Yeah, you have this thing where you continually

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.460
keep cutting, subdividing the idea.

01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.100
Jesus, John Deere.

01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.460
And I like to do the opposite.

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.140
I like to lump the ideas.

01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.740
And I would like, in the final five minutes,

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.580
to put things into boxes a little bit.

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.780
How are things in general?

01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.420
Are you generally happy, though?

01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.180
Fantastic.

01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.820
I'm generally fantastic, yeah.

01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:13.220
So you're working in the little nooks and crannies

01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.100
and things.

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:18.260
Everybody wants to maintain and get to a healthier place.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.580
You just seem to be more in touch with what those things are.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.540
You tend to.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:22.820
Which may be called gratitude.

01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:25.420
Like, looking and going like, oh, here's the box I'm in.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:28.060
It's pretty good compared to other people in Lebanon.

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:29.460
I have to put things back into boxes

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.060
if I take them out like we have.

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:33.900
I think it's important to put them back in and go,

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:36.020
so what is a great thing?

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.020
What is something you love?

01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.460
What's a simple pleasure where you go,

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.460
god, I love being on this planet?

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.460
My girlfriend.

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.180
Oh, that's awesome.

01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.460
Is that you an alt-right guy?

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.780
Are you going to call me a cuck now?

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.660
No, because I never fully figured out

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.940
how cuck the term applied to politics.

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:50.420
Yeah.

01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.020
I still don't understand.

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.420
Well, what about just loving your guy?

01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:53.420
I love my girlfriend.

01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.780
I'm really happy to be with her.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:56.140
I'm so excited I found somebody.

01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:57.580
And it's not just because she's in the room.

01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:00.620
I swear to god, she's not usually here.

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.380
She may have left already, but I really genuinely

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:06.300
like it's a thing that I've found, not that she's a thing.

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.380
It's just so happy.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.860
I understand anybody would understand it.

01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.580
And forensic files.

01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.420
So you do.

01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:14.740
So we don't have to worry about you being in a constant state.

01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:15.500
Yeah, no, no.

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.980
When you're not hearing from me, I'm happy.

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.020
Hey, that's what I think is important.

01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:22.820
No news is good news.

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:24.140
That made me feel better because I

01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:28.980
tend to wear the sympathetic residue of people's problems.

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:30.820
The more you go into something, I track it.

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:33.140
My brain has such traction on things that I wear.

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:36.140
Like, if you ask me, what's that word that starts with a P

01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:39.100
that's not, and I will text you four days later and be like,

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.740
are you sure it doesn't start with an L?

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.220
Really?

01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:42.700
Yeah, I will assume.

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:44.740
You were going to walk out of here worried about me being

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.140
depressed?

01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:47.780
I would have texted you not worried about being depressed

01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.860
because you can handle yourself obviously here.

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:52.860
But I would probably have texted you other things

01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:55.260
to try to put into context what I wasn't sure you did or didn't.

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.420
I'm truly, truly happy.

01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.780
I'm very happy.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.300
I'm frustrated at this current time with the fact

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:08.220
that the way out of this life is not, keeps changing.

01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.380
The exit ramp keeps being updated.

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.460
And it's a frustrating thing.

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:13.700
But that's called privilege.

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:18.380
It's like, well, I just wanted to know that I could,

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:20.780
with five years I had a plan, and they just

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.020
keep changing the exit ramp.

01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.940
And I'm like, these people.

01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:28.700
But inside my car, it smells like pine.

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.660
Phil Collins is playing.

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:32.660
It's very good.

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.340
There is nothing wrong.

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:37.980
It's you that's changing the plan.

01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.980
And that's the good news.

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.940
Well, I guess I would argue with that.

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.300
I think it's, I don't know.

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:47.260
You've got a strong, intelligent voice

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:51.100
that seems to be able to hold up against a lot of forces

01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:54.060
that normally drive intelligent minds crazy.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.460
I'll probably be fine.

01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.580
I just didn't see myself lifting anything after 45.

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:06.180
I just wanted, I had this image in my head.

01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.940
I thought I'd be retired by now.

01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:10.220
Because my dad worked hard until a certain age.

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.580
And I was like, well, that was dumb.

01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.860
You should do it that earlier.

01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.060
Could you be retired if you had all the money in the world

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.540
you ever wanted?

01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.500
Could you do it?

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.500
Yes.

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.500
Could you wake up tomorrow?

01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:19.820
Money's in the bank, everything's good.

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.540
You couldn't spend it if you tried.

01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:23.420
You would be OK being retired.

01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.420
Do you think that's true?

01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:24.920
No.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.780
Look at the face.

01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.260
Fuck no.

01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:30.460
No, because you could have.

01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:30.940
You could have.

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.140
No, no, I couldn't have.

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:32.940
No, I couldn't have.

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.140
You could have had about $80,000.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.300
In LA, broke rider money, that's like 10 years.

01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:39.100
This is like when people are like, everybody googles

01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:41.340
themselves like, nope, can't Google myself.

01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.540
I fucking can't do it.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.140
I think it's you that moves the gold post.

01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:44.860
Yeah, I think so.

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.900
I mean, let's not.

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:48.700
I mean, I like that you actually said gold post.

01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:49.700
It's a kind of is.

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.740
You know, it's a kind of is like gold post at this point.

01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.220
Oh, by the way, I don't know if you know.

01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:55.220
You're a fan of Rick and Morty.

01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:58.420
You know that Brandon does the voice of Mr. Goldenfold.

01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.140
The math teacher.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:48:59.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:00.380
Oh, that's great.

01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.620
Just trivia.

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.260
That's great.

01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:05.540
I like him very much because he's drawn just a little

01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.420
differently than everyone else.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.860
He's drawn from a different kind of nomenclature

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.300
than everyone else on the show.

01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:11.820
You know what I mean?

01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.740
It looks like he stumbled in from a different cartoon.

01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:16.860
He's based very much on a real life math teacher

01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:21.620
I had in seventh grade, whose last name I can't remember,

01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:24.660
but it looks like some sort of animation exchange program.

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.060
Someone from Rick and Morty is in some other like Fat Albert

01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.780
Esk kind of show.

01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.940
I like that his name is Mr. Goldenfold,

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.460
and the principal's name is Mr. Vagina.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.420
I don't know what the rest of the faculty is.

01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.700
Everything just.

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:40.420
Great Phil Hendry.

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:41.260
The great Phil Hendry.

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:45.060
The great Phil Hendry.

01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:48.060
All right, well, obviously, you're not plugging anything.

01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:51.220
Hey, go to John Mayer's Kickstarter.

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:54.540
He's trying to start an actual Wonderland.

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:57.420
Just like me.

01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:59.700
You know what, I would enjoy a couple of comments.

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.780
I'll probably go creeping around for him or like,

01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:03.580
and this is the best I can do at this point in my life.

01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:05.620
And someone's like, don't love his music,

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:08.700
but funnier than I thought, which is still

01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:09.500
an insult to my music.

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.540
Would you really like that?

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:11.620
I'm really curious about that.

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.060
Would you like that?

01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.660
I don't care if someone likes the music.

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.300
People have to put up a lot of disclaimers

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:21.060
like, actually, got to say.

01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:22.660
For someone who like me, they have to put up

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:23.860
like six or seven disclaimers.

01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.060
I got to say, not a fan of his music, and his past is shady,

01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.460
and I wasn't into this and that.

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.500
Your body of Wonderland is dumb, but I

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:34.660
have to tell you in confidence that I do believe now,

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.260
after watching this podcast, that I now know nothing

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.140
about John Mayer, and I'm waiting for something positive

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:41.700
to come along.

01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.540
I've settled all debts with the man.

01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:44.700
We'll see what he comes out with next.

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.620
I always see the opposite.

01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:47.860
When I see somebody go like, I love community,

01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:50.260
and I love Rick and Morty, and I've

01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:54.500
been trained now when I see those two statements.

01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.580
Those sound like great things, but I

01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:59.380
know no one would say that online if they weren't

01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.420
about to fucking tear me apart.

01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:04.220
That's why I like the opposite, which is, don't love his music.

01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:05.220
He's a giant piece of shit.

01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.900
I'm like, come, come, what?

01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:10.020
And, but I got to say, funnier than I thought.

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.860
Yes.

01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:15.500
I mean, I am super grateful for you coming by,

01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.140
not just because you're super famous,

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:19.380
and it was like an interesting star fucker win,

01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.380
but honestly, I really wanted you to come on the show

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:26.340
because we had a moment of eating pepperoni pizza,

01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:32.460
and I just, yeah, you exude an intelligence

01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:36.740
and an awareness that made me excited to talk to you,

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.900
and I bet a lot of our listeners are happy for it.

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.580
And it was, you don't do this a lot.

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.740
You're not on every podcast.

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.860
I had to write some friends who've

01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:48.060
asked me to be on a podcast before, and I said I wouldn't.

01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:50.500
I literally texted them on the way here, literally.

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.660
I actually honestly texted them on the way here,

01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.860
and I was like, just want to let you know,

01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.540
I'm going off to Dan Harmon's podcast.

01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.620
I've told you know in the past, but he cornered me,

01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:59.500
and told me that.

01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:02.540
I had to do it, and so I just want to let you know.

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.260
So yeah, I've lifted the embargo for this

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.060
because I find you far too interesting.

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.300
I think you are diseased with your own intelligence.

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.580
We could disappear up each other's asses.

01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:13.860
And the show title.

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.620
We have finally found the show title.

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.460
Disappear up each other's asses.

01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:18.940
And that's right.

01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:21.660
No, but I really want you to know how grateful I am.

01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:24.100
That's so cool that you came out to the middle of Burbank

01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:26.660
on a Sunday night by yourself and came here

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:32.180
and shared your fears and insecurities and your pride

01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.660
and all the shit with us.

01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:38.660
Like, I love transparency and honesty, and your soul

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.500
is the opposite of a wonderland.

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:41.220
Thank you, man.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.300
It's a deep labyrinth.

01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:42.940
It's a deep land.

01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.940
Land.

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.220
Thank you.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.620
Also, there's other songs that he wrote.

01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.100
Yep.

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:50.900
Oh, seven Grammys.

01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.860
Spencer, is there anything you?

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.380
I thought there was a reason he kept hitting it.

01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:56.580
Is there anything you ever wanted to ask or say to John Mayer?

01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:59.100
No, I just identify with a lot of the stuff

01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:00.340
you were saying on stage.

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:04.220
I don't know, I have the tiniest slice of tiny internet

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.980
fame, but a lot of what you're saying

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.140
is stuff that I've wrestled with and dealt with

01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:10.380
that the past is very illuminating and helpful.

01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:10.940
Oh, good.

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:11.440
Yeah.

01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:15.580
Yeah, no, I mean, we could open that module up for an hour

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:18.460
and go into the mechanics of how to process what

01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.180
people say about you.

01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:24.260
But most people give themselves up in the way

01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.900
they write the first sentence.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.140
You start seeing vocabulary.

01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:30.900
They don't realize that they follow a pattern.

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:31.340
We do.

01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.540
We know they follow a pattern.

01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.860
So most of the time, people just out themselves

01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.540
as being lame in the first sentence.

01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:37.420
You know what I mean?

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.380
Yeah.

01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.300
Occasionally, someone will get a good hit in,

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:42.060
and then I'll be like, that's a good hit.

01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:45.620
Like, have you ever gone as far as finding out

01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.660
the Twitter account of the person who wrote the article

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.140
and you just think about reaching out?

01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.900
Well, I always look.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.540
I look at all of their accounts.

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:55.700
Because when somebody takes a shot at me,

01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:59.860
I always, I block all of them.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.020
And usually before I block them, I'll send them

01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:07.700
a snapshot of their profile with their follower numbers

01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.820
and then the fact that they were following me

01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.180
circled in red.

01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.460
And then I'll block them.

01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:14.780
Because I'm just like, why are you following somebody

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:16.020
and talking shit?

01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:16.900
You're dumb.

01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:18.060
Your existence is dumb.

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:18.900
I'll tell you why.

01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.980
The whole thing comes down to an Acura Integra.

01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:23.780
I knew it.

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.060
It all comes down to an Acura Integra.

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.580
Beautiful car.

01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.020
I'm sure it's a great value.

01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:34.900
People want you to have one so that Acura keeps giving money

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:37.020
to the people who want you to have one.

01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:39.620
50% of the articles that are written on these sites

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.780
that try to sell you the Acura are very important.

01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:44.260
They're meaningful.

01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:48.260
The other 50% is absolute garbage meant to drive you

01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:50.820
to just nothing but sales and clicks.

01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:55.500
Your responsibility is to figure out which 50% is which

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.300
and block out the dumb shit.

01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.900
That's the challenge.

01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:02.780
It all goes back to an Acura Integra.

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.300
That's true.

01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:04.780
All right.

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:05.780
That's the closer.

01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.060
Let's fucking close the show.

01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:08.900
I'm not going to monopolize it.

01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.420
John Mayer, ladies and gentlemen, thank him for coming.

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.060
Thank you very much.

01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:13.500
That's awesome.

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.500
Yeah.

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:17.260
And let's end our podcast.

01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.140
Let's all go do things that are relatively important,

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.060
like going to bed with Cody.

01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.220
All right.

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:27.140
I'm going to drive home and think about the worst thing I said.

01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.100
It's going to get in my head.

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.260
It's going to corkscrew.

01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:30.820
It's going to say, John, fuck you.

01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.580
There's some things you just shouldn't do.

01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:34.500
You're going to run the whole transcript through that brick.

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.340
You call the brain.

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.820
And then you're going to complain.

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:38.380
You're going to ask if you can take it out.

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.180
The next time they put it up on the net,

01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:42.700
you're going to say, uh, that thing I'd rather forget.

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.780
Can we take the rap out?

01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:44.700
We do it yet?

01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:46.340
I just don't want to hear from people telling me

01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.140
that there was something I said, that they could get

01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:51.060
the smell on me, that I was trying too hard in the backyard.

01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.100
I bought the milkshake, but it had lard.

01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.700
And it was all curdled.

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:56.140
Yeah, I don't want to be that way.

01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:58.020
So I think I did it right.

01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.180
But now that I did, that's why I kept rapping tonight.

01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:02.580
So when I get in the car, I think about the rap.

01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:05.300
This is the thing that I did that's crap,

01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.140
to make it off balance, to make it strange.

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:09.140
It's got to be strange.

01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:12.620
So tomorrow is a new day, a new direction, a new way.

01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:13.340
I got to improve.

01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.100
I got to change.

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.260
I did it too well tonight.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.140
That wraps my brain.

01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:17.460
I got to get in the tub and wonder

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.660
what I can write to tell you.

01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:20.180
Can you take a couple things out tonight?

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.180
Because I don't like two legs.

01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180
I don't like four legs.

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.820
I don't like even pecs.

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.740
I like shit missing.

01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.460
That's when my brain goes, listen, out.

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.660
Ooh, opioid love, uh, up there in the tub, uh.

01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:37.260
Holy fuck, John, you just blew our fucking mind.

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.260
You buried the lead.

01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:41.740
You fucking rap good.

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.340
I'm embarrassed that I did it in front of you.

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.700
You can never come back again.

01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:50.780
That was amazing.

01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:51.780
Fuck you.

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:52.780
Fuck you.

01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:53.780
Fuck you.

01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:54.780
Fuck you.

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:55.780
Fuck you.

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:01.780
That was awesome.

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:02.780
It's a nice guitar part.

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:03.780
It's a tasty guitar part.

01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:04.780
I repressed that Ableton button.

01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:05.780
It's real good.

01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:06.780
Go.

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.780
This is how fast you rap.

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.780
You're rapping everything fast.

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:10.780
You can only rap the fast if you talk jibberish.

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:12.780
You can't talk rap from the outside.

01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:14.780
You just rap this fast and you're making it up.

01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:15.780
You can rap fast.

01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:16.780
I can't freestyle.

01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:17.780
That's fucking crazy.

01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:18.780
Oh, took it out.

01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:19.780
Took it out.

01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:20.780
Hello, 80s.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:21.780
Took it out.

01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:22.780
Boop, boop, boop.

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.780
That's not even the right key.

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:24.780
Some Sadi Rollins shit back there.

01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:25.780
What time is your massage scheduled for?

01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:26.780
Thanks so much, everyone.

01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:27.780
Good night.

01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:28.780
It's been a long day.

01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:29.780
It's been a long day.

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:30.780
How are you?

01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:31.780
I'm good.

01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:32.780
I'm good.

01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:33.780
I'm good.

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.780
I'm good.

01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:35.780
I'm good.

01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:36.780
I'm good.

01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.780
I'm good.

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:38.780
I'm good.

01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:39.780
I'm good.

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.780
I'm good.

01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:41.780
I'm good.

01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:42.780
I'm good.

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.780
You're good.

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.340
Good night, we don't want you to take chances, drive fast.

01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:51.460
Yeah, thanks to Steve Levy, thanks to Kris Boruff,

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:54.380
Zach the Audio Maniac, Sarah Hill,

01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:59.380
Nolan Fabricius, Kevin Day, Brandon, our guest comptroller.

01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:04.220
Of course, Dan Harmon, John Mayer, thank you so much.

01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:08.260
Drive fast, take chances.

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:12.460
Good night.

01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:28.220
Did you get any of that?

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:30.220
It's a good show!
