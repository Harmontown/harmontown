02:20.500\nIt's because they want to be flat footage as they say in D&D, right?\n\n02:20.500 --> 02:21.500\nYeah.\n\n02:21.500 --> 02:23.300\nDon't love that dexterity.\n\n02:23.300 --> 02:24.260\nOff

02:48.180\nI just want to get out.\n\n02:48.180 --> 02:50.660\nI watched the post.\n\n02:50.660 --> 02:51.500\nIt's bad.\n\n02:51.500 --> 02:53.420\nIt's a bad movie.\n\n02:53.420 --> 02:57.940\nSteven Spielberg is no longer a good director.\n\n02:57.940 --> 03:02.460\nI don't know when he was good last.\n\n03:02.460 --> 03:06.100\nI know he was good for a good long time\n\n03:06.100 --> 03:09.420\nand that he deserves all of the credit in the world\n\n03:09.420 --> 03:12.700\nfor being a wonderful, wonderful director who\n\n03:12.700 --> 03:15.340\ndid such things as, for instance,\n\n03:15.340 --> 03:21.180\nadapting a book about sharks into anything with empathy.\n\n03:21.180 --> 03:21.860\nIt was neat.\n\n03:21.860 --> 03:25.020\nHe would add a couple shots in it, like, oh,\n\n03:25.020 --> 03:28.380\nthere's a shark in the water, but this guy loves his kid.\n\n03:28.380 --> 03:29.100\nTerrific.\n\n03:29.100 --> 03:31.620\nLike, we built an empire on this.\n\n03:31.620 --> 03:33.140\nOK, I watched the post.\n\n03:33.140 --> 03:35.540\nYou know, you suck.\n\n03:35.540 --> 03:37.820\nIt's a bad movie.\n\n03:37.820 --> 03:38.460\nIt's terrible.\n\n03:38.460 --> 03:39.540\nPerformances?\n\n03:39.540 --> 03:41.300\nPerformances bad.\n\n03:41.300 --> 03:42.420\nDirector's fault.\n\n03:42.420 --> 03:43.420\nGood actors.\n\n03:43.420 --> 03:45.020\nGot to be the director's fault.\n\n03:45.020 --> 03:46.660\nI don't, like, awful.\n\n03:46.660 --> 03:48.940\nTom Hanks is acting like he's doing dinner theater.\n\n03:48.940 --> 03:50.060\nHe's doing a character.\n\n03:50.060 --> 03:51.860\nI don't know what's happening in that movie.\n\n03:51.860 --> 03:54.380\nIt looks like an impression.\n\n03:54.380 --> 03:58.180\nIt looks like a crazy person showed up on your doorstep\n\n03:58.180 --> 04:01.700\nhaving seen five minutes of all the president's men\n\n04:01.700 --> 04:03.820\nand he's just, like, outside your house,\n\n04:03.820 --> 04:05.100\nlike, kicking at the door.\n\n04:05.100 --> 04:08.060\nIt's a horrible, horrible movie.\n\n04:08.060 --> 04:10.660\nAnd if you like it, you're stupid.\n\n04:10.660 --> 04:13.900\nAnd if you nominated it for an award, you're dumb\n\n04:13.900 --> 04:15.220\nand you don't deserve that vote.\n\n04:15.220 --> 04:17.740\nYou got your vote wrong.\n\n04:17.740 --> 04:20.300\nYou cheated someone out of it.\n\n04:20.300 --> 04:21.180\nIt's a dumb movie.\n\n04:21.180 --> 04:21.900\nIt's terrible.\n\n04:21.900 --> 04:22.900\nI couldn't finish watching it.\n\n04:22.900 --> 04:23.580\nIt's awful.\n\n04:23.580 --> 04:24.900\nWhat's next?\n\n04:24.900 --> 04:25.780\nFlorida Project.\n\n04:25.780 --> 04:26.500\nRipped off.\n\n04:26.500 --> 04:27.820\nTotally snubbed.\n\n04:27.820 --> 04:29.140\nFucking what?\n\n04:29.140 --> 04:30.100\nYou're using kids.\n\n04:30.100 --> 04:31.660\nKids are fucking monsters.\n\n04:31.660 --> 04:32.260\nThey're animals.\n\n04:32.260 --> 04:33.620\nIt's like directing cats.\n\n04:33.620 --> 04:34.980\nYou get a performance out of kids.\n\n04:34.980 --> 04:38.860\nYou're automatically nominated for best director, period.\n\n04:38.860 --> 04:40.420\nIt's not nominated.\n\n04:40.420 --> 04:41.700\nI don't understand.\n\n04:41.700 --> 04:43.100\nI don't get you anymore.\n\n04:43.100 --> 04:44.020\nYou're an academy.\n\n04:44.020 --> 04:44.900\nYou have one job.\n\n04:48.500 --> 04:51.820\nWhat else was nominated?\n\n04:51.820 --> 04:52.300\nGet out.\n\n04:52.300 --> 04:53.620\nDid you finally see Get Out?\n\n04:53.620 --> 04:54.220\nGet Out.\n\n04:54.220 --> 04:55.340\nI enjoyed very much.\n\n04:55.340 --> 04:56.140\nI saw it.\n\n04:56.140 --> 04:57.020\nI'm not racist.\n\n04:57.020 --> 04:59.100\nI saw it.\n\n04:59.100 --> 05:01.780\nI liked it.\n\n05:01.780 --> 05:04.180\nCall me by your name.\n\n05:04.180 --> 05:04.500\nAll right.\n\n05:04.500 --> 05:05.780\nHere's the thing, kids.\n\n05:05.780 --> 05:07.380\nI don't like it.\n\n05:07.380 --> 05:10.820\nAll right, let's just look at it this way.\n\n05:10.820 --> 05:13.020\nLike, 2000, whatever this is, it\n\n05:13.020 --> 05:14.540\nwasn't a year for storytelling.\n\n05:14.540 --> 05:16.100\nI get it.\n\n05:16.100 --> 05:18.620\nI don't see it.\n\n05:18.620 --> 05:20.780\nApparently, movies are just about hanging out.\n\n05:20.780 --> 05:22.780\nAnd that's fine.\n\n05:22.780 --> 05:26.620\nI kind of liked Call Me By Your Name just because you\n\n05:26.620 --> 05:28.940\ncan tell the director's good.\n\n05:28.940 --> 05:32.580\nThree hours to show me that, I don't know.\n\n05:32.580 --> 05:33.580\nAll right, just look.\n\n05:33.580 --> 05:34.340\nYou know what?\n\n05:34.340 --> 05:36.340\nFine.\n\n05:36.340 --> 05:37.340\nI don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\n05:37.340 --> 05:38.140\nBeautiful movie, though.\n\n05:38.140 --> 05:40.060\nI just want to shit on Spielberg's head and go,\n\n05:40.060 --> 05:42.500\nyou should know better.\n\n05:42.500 --> 05:43.340\nFuck you.\n\n05:43.340 --> 05:46.100\nWhat is your camera fucking like?\n\n05:46.100 --> 05:49.620\nWhy did you lay down track for a shot in a restaurant?\n\n05:49.620 --> 05:54.060\nWhy would you use credence in a fucking Vietnam scene?\n\n05:54.060 --> 05:57.220\nAre you dead?\n\n05:57.220 --> 05:58.980\nStop it.\n\n05:58.980 --> 06:01.060\nNot everybody goes to work every day.\n\n06:01.060 --> 06:04.900\nYeah, well, then don't go to work at all.\n\n06:04.900 --> 06:08.220\nAll I want is to get out.\n\n06:08.220 --> 06:10.460\nAnd there are people that have so much money that could have\n\n06:10.460 --> 06:11.980\nbeen out decades ago.\n\n06:11.980 --> 06:14.580\nAnd they just hang out making shit.\n\n06:14.580 --> 06:16.820\nAnd I'm like, you're mocking me.\n\n06:16.820 --> 06:18.740\nI want to die.\n\n06:18.740 --> 06:23.060\nI just want to draw the blanket of retirement over my body.\n\n06:23.060 --> 06:27.700\nI need one thing, $150 million.\n\n06:27.700 --> 06:28.860\nI've calculated it.\n\n06:28.860 --> 06:29.980\nOK, that is.\n\n06:29.980 --> 06:33.660\nIf I put that in the bank, don't mock me for my goals.\n\n06:33.660 --> 06:34.740\nI've done the math.\n\n06:34.740 --> 06:35.900\nHow did you do the math?\n\n06:35.900 --> 06:37.540\nWas this with the Sklar Brothers?\n\n06:37.540 --> 06:43.180\n$150 million, I've crunched the numbers.\n\n06:43.180 --> 06:47.580\nThat means that even if I spend $2 million a year,\n\n06:47.580 --> 06:51.460\nI can live another 75 years.\n\n06:51.460 --> 06:54.140\nThat's my math.\n\n06:54.140 --> 06:54.980\nYeah, good math.\n\n06:54.980 --> 06:55.740\nSo you bought a cryo.\n\n06:55.740 --> 06:56.180\nThank you.\n\n06:56.180 --> 06:56.700\nThank you.\n\n06:56.700 --> 06:58.300\nI know you're being sarcastic, but thank you.\n\n06:58.300 --> 06:59.740\nSorry, what was Brandon saying?\n\n06:59.740 --> 07:00.820\nI wasn't being sarcastic.\n\n07:00.820 --> 07:02.140\nYes, you were.\n\n07:02.140 --> 07:05.380\nSo some of that money is a cryo chamber\n\n07:05.380 --> 07:08.500\nbecause 75 more years is ambitious.\n\n07:08.500 --> 07:11.060\nThere's all this inflation stuff.\n\n07:11.060 --> 07:12.580\nI'm not mad at Spielberg.\n\n07:12.580 --> 07:15.740\nI don't want beef.\n\n07:15.740 --> 07:16.420\nI want beef.\n\n07:16.420 --> 07:18.660\nI don't want Spielberg's podcast to start shooting.\n\n07:18.660 --> 07:19.940\nWe're calling you out.\n\n07:19.940 --> 07:21.820\nShooting over at me.\n\n07:21.820 --> 07:24.260\nIt just, look, I saw Steven.\n\n07:24.260 --> 07:29.340\nI saw the shot where Streep comes into the restaurant.\n\n07:29.340 --> 07:30.940\nShe's meeting Tom Hanks for the first time.\n\n07:30.940 --> 07:36.420\nI said, why did the camera go all the way to the right\n\n07:36.420 --> 07:39.540\nand then all the way to the left and all the way to the right?\n\n07:39.540 --> 07:40.820\nHow do you mind?\n\n07:40.820 --> 07:41.940\nYou've lost your mind.\n\n07:41.940 --> 07:44.700\nIt's a scene about two people having breakfast.\n\n07:44.700 --> 07:46.700\nYou should have worked with the actors.\n\n07:46.700 --> 07:51.260\nTom Hanks, he's gone off the rails, which is ironic\n\n07:51.260 --> 07:53.860\nbecause your camera is on fucking railroad tracks\n\n07:53.860 --> 07:58.260\nthat took three days to bolt into the floor of a restaurant\n\n07:58.260 --> 08:01.380\nyou probably put out of business or a four-walled set\n\n08:01.380 --> 08:04.740\nthat you created in Uganda because the sound\n\n08:04.740 --> 08:07.900\nsounds more restaurant-y there.\n\n08:07.900 --> 08:09.340\nPay attention to your actors.\n\n08:09.340 --> 08:11.060\nThe guy's got cotton balls in his lips or something.\n\n08:11.060 --> 08:13.300\nHe's doing a weird impression of Tommy Lasorda.\n\n08:13.300 --> 08:14.900\nI don't know what he's doing.\n\n08:14.900 --> 08:16.260\nI don't know what Meryl Streep's doing.\n\n08:16.260 --> 08:18.100\nI don't know what anyone in that movie's doing.\n\n08:18.100 --> 08:21.060\nEveryone's walking around these old sets going like,\n\n08:21.060 --> 08:22.860\noh, I got the byline.\n\n08:22.860 --> 08:24.420\nI got a fucking thing.\n\n08:24.420 --> 08:25.540\nI don't understand it.\n\n08:25.540 --> 08:28.060\nIt's a weird, weird, weird movie.\n\n08:28.060 --> 08:29.940\nAnd if anyone had any objectivity that go,\n\n08:29.940 --> 08:30.660\nwhat is happening?\n\n08:30.660 --> 08:31.860\nWhy is this movie happening?\n\n08:31.860 --> 08:33.500\nI don't know why I'm supposed to be watching this.\n\n08:33.500 --> 08:34.460\nThis is a weird movie.\n\n08:34.460 --> 08:35.740\nBut we don't have any objectivity.\n\n08:35.740 --> 08:37.540\nWe're just like, oh, this was designed to win an Oscar,\n\n08:37.540 --> 08:38.740\nso we're going to nominate it for an Oscar.\n\n08:38.740 --> 08:40.020\nIt doesn't deserve an Oscar.\n\n08:40.020 --> 08:41.220\nYou're fucking insane.\n\n08:41.220 --> 08:42.420\nIt's a terrible movie.\n\n08:42.420 --> 08:44.260\nI shut it off after a half an hour.\n\n08:44.260 --> 08:45.660\nI can't stand it.\n\n08:45.660 --> 08:48.220\nI couldn't hear it over me jerking off.\n\n08:48.220 --> 08:50.260\nI had to masturbate during your movie\n\n08:50.260 --> 08:51.700\nto make me interested in it.\n\n08:51.700 --> 08:55.220\nIt just got real Argo up in here.\n\n08:55.220 --> 08:58.140\nDo you think it is Spielberg's attempt to make\n\n08:58.140 --> 09:00.100\na Scorsese type of film?\n\n09:00.100 --> 09:01.420\nI think there may have been.\n\n09:01.420 --> 09:04.980\nThere may have been some Scorsese influences\n\n09:04.980 --> 09:07.300\non the goals of that movie.\n\n09:07.300 --> 09:08.740\nBecause there would be like, the people\n\n09:08.740 --> 09:11.580\nwould walk into a New York newspaper\n\n09:11.580 --> 09:12.740\noffice or something.\n\n09:12.740 --> 09:15.380\nAnd then there'd be a fire hydrant\n\n09:15.380 --> 09:17.740\nthat would have a liquid spring.\n\n09:17.740 --> 09:21.700\nAnd then someone would go, oh, oh, oh, and it got a defeat.\n\n09:21.700 --> 09:24.700\nAnd then it was all like, everyone was lit weird.\n\n09:24.700 --> 09:27.100\nIt was like, there'd be like a little girl going like,\n\n09:27.100 --> 09:28.060\nextra, extra.\n\n09:28.060 --> 09:30.620\nLike, it was weird.\n\n09:30.620 --> 09:31.860\nI don't care, though.\n\n09:31.860 --> 09:32.820\nThis is not my job.\n\n09:32.820 --> 09:33.620\nI don't care anymore.\n\n09:33.620 --> 09:34.540\nI just want out.\n\n09:34.540 --> 09:36.100\nIf you're hearing the sound of my voice,\n\n09:36.100 --> 09:38.700\nand you're like, oh, Dan, I don't like you.\n\n09:38.700 --> 09:39.900\nJoin the club!\n\n09:39.900 --> 09:44.500\nI don't want to be here anymore.\n\n09:44.500 --> 09:45.700\nI don't want to be talking to you.\n\n09:45.700 --> 09:47.100\nI don't want you listening to me.\n\n09:47.100 --> 09:48.220\nI don't want to have an opinion.\n\n09:48.220 --> 09:49.660\nI don't want my opinion to matter.\n\n09:49.660 --> 09:51.180\nI just want money.\n\n09:51.180 --> 09:55.420\nI just want enough money to get a fucking break.\n\n09:55.420 --> 09:58.820\nIf I had been born with the amount of money\n\n09:58.820 --> 10:03.980\nthat normal people have when they're born,\n\n10:03.980 --> 10:06.220\nI would never have been doing this.\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:09.420\nI would be under a rock somewhere, minding my own business.\n\n10:09.420 --> 10:13.660\nI made myself out of dirt without permission.\n\n10:13.660 --> 10:15.540\nWhat else are we talking about?\n\n10:15.540 --> 10:16.460\nOK, real quick, though.\n\n10:16.460 --> 10:16.980\nWhere are you?\n\n10:16.980 --> 10:17.740\nNot real quick.\n\n10:17.740 --> 10:18.620\nFill of time.\n\n10:18.620 --> 10:19.820\nI don't have no show.\n\n10:19.820 --> 10:23.100\nI'm trying to pump up controversy.\n\n10:23.100 --> 10:24.460\nWhere the fuck would you go?\n\n10:24.460 --> 10:25.260\nWhere would I go?\n\n10:25.260 --> 10:27.060\nWhere are you trying to escape to right now?\n\n10:27.060 --> 10:28.820\nBecause I know what you're talking about.\n\n10:28.820 --> 10:33.900\nYou got some post-success blues, which are real.\n\n10:33.900 --> 10:37.780\nIt's totally real to be super well-fed and happy,\n\n10:37.780 --> 10:40.660\nand have lost the thing that made you run through the jungle.\n\n10:40.660 --> 10:43.220\nSo now you get depressed on some new shit.\n\n10:43.220 --> 10:43.740\nYou know what I mean?\n\n10:43.740 --> 10:46.380\nIt's like, if you had had, say, your appendix out,\n\n10:46.380 --> 10:47.980\nand you've worried about that for two months,\n\n10:47.980 --> 10:49.900\nand then they took it out, and you weren't in pain anymore,\n\n10:49.900 --> 10:52.060\nyou might have a rash that bothered you,\n\n10:52.060 --> 10:53.380\nlike your appendix used to, because we're\n\n10:53.380 --> 10:55.260\nused to living in some sort of crazy fear, right?\n\n10:55.260 --> 10:55.540\nRight.\n\n10:55.540 --> 10:56.740\nSo I follow you.\n\n10:56.740 --> 10:59.220\nWhere would you go to to escape you?\n\n10:59.220 --> 11:00.700\nBed.\n\n11:00.700 --> 11:01.300\nYeah.\n\n11:01.300 --> 11:03.100\nYou don't even think like, you're not going to know.\n\n11:03.100 --> 11:04.060\nLike, there's no desert.\n\n11:04.060 --> 11:06.540\nThere's no another country like Amsterdam for two months.\n\n11:06.540 --> 11:08.620\nNo, I like the United States.\n\n11:08.620 --> 11:10.420\nI like that when you take a shit,\n\n11:10.420 --> 11:13.940\nit's in a bucket of water that makes the shit disappear.\n\n11:13.940 --> 11:15.660\nThey have that at Amsterdam?\n\n11:15.660 --> 11:17.460\nYeah.\n\n11:17.460 --> 11:20.740\nI hear that's big in Japan.\n\n11:20.740 --> 11:22.540\nDon't you dare high road me.\n\n11:22.540 --> 11:24.820\nCan you brag about some dope shit we have?\n\n11:24.820 --> 11:25.980\nNo, I don't want to go to it.\n\n11:25.980 --> 11:28.060\nI assume, you know, when people talk about, oh,\n\n11:28.060 --> 11:31.380\nI love it in Norway or Amsterdam or whatever,\n\n11:31.380 --> 11:34.340\nI got to assume, I think those people are lying, right?\n\n11:34.340 --> 11:35.820\nIt's got to be better here than anywhere.\n\n11:35.820 --> 11:36.740\nAm I wrong?\n\n11:36.740 --> 11:37.420\nWhat do you think?\n\n11:37.420 --> 11:38.460\nDepends on what you're into.\n\n11:38.460 --> 11:40.300\nIf you're into, like, kicking it at, like, two or three,\n\n11:40.300 --> 11:42.300\nyou want Brazil, you want France.\n\n11:42.300 --> 11:44.580\nIf you're into, like, safety, when you walk home as drunk\n\n11:44.580 --> 11:47.260\nas you want, you want, like, Norway, Amsterdam.\n\n11:47.260 --> 11:49.700\nLike, you know, you can do a different kind of party\n\n11:49.700 --> 11:50.980\nall over the planet.\n\n11:50.980 --> 11:54.340\nAll right, well, you make it sound like a party.\n\n11:54.340 --> 11:56.180\nNot getting stabbed when you're walking home\n\n11:56.180 --> 11:57.620\nis like a menu item.\n\n11:57.620 --> 11:58.900\nWell, think about it like this.\n\n11:58.900 --> 12:01.300\nIf you get drunk in New York or Chicago or Los Angeles,\n\n12:01.300 --> 12:02.980\nand you leave a bar, you leave a club,\n\n12:02.980 --> 12:04.060\nlike, you just made a mistake.\n\n12:04.060 --> 12:05.060\nYou could get stabbed.\n\n12:05.060 --> 12:06.380\nBut if you're in a foreign country,\n\n12:06.380 --> 12:08.060\nlike, the places where they're kind of decent.\n\n12:08.060 --> 12:09.180\nRight.\n\n12:09.180 --> 12:12.220\nBut the place you just were is shitty, right?\n\n12:12.220 --> 12:14.220\nOr it's one of three places that is open.\n\n12:14.220 --> 12:14.660\nI don't know.\n\n12:14.660 --> 12:15.220\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n12:15.220 --> 12:16.340\nIsn't there a trade-off?\n\n12:16.340 --> 12:19.380\nYeah, the trade-off is, you can get a little clarity\n\n12:19.380 --> 12:20.140\nin those places.\n\n12:24.020 --> 12:24.700\nTa-da.\n\n12:24.700 --> 12:27.500\nBut aren't you comfortable making the assumption\n\n12:27.500 --> 12:31.420\nthat for everybody's, like, mocking us,\n\n12:31.420 --> 12:35.940\nthat America's probably the best?\n\n12:35.940 --> 12:38.460\nLike, we make an easy target.\n\n12:38.460 --> 12:40.780\nIt's like, oh, you guys suck.\n\n12:40.780 --> 12:42.940\nOh, you don't want to be there.\n\n12:42.940 --> 12:44.380\nYour guns and your violence.\n\n12:44.380 --> 12:47.020\nTotally agreed, but when we compare ourselves\n\n12:47.020 --> 12:50.100\nto other countries, we go, like, did you know in Sweden\n\n12:50.100 --> 12:52.820\nthat you can leave your bike on the sidewalk\n\n12:52.820 --> 12:56.380\nand just jerk off on it and, like, roll into the storm\n\n12:56.380 --> 12:58.500\ndrain, and the storm drain will take you to the nearest\n\n12:58.500 --> 12:59.740\nhospital for free?\n\n12:59.740 --> 13:03.380\nLike, you hear these things, and I'm not saying they're not\n\n13:03.380 --> 13:05.580\ntrue, but I'm just assuming that that probably\n\n13:05.580 --> 13:07.980\nmeans that, like, there's got to be some trade-off.\n\n13:07.980 --> 13:09.620\nLike, maybe their cable sucks.\n\n13:09.620 --> 13:10.500\nI don't know.\n\n13:10.500 --> 13:11.260\nBut that's true.\n\n13:11.260 --> 13:12.860\nBut the visit is the thing.\n\n13:12.860 --> 13:14.740\nThe thing is to, like, sort of go someplace,\n\n13:14.740 --> 13:17.220\nlook at things differently, get that perspective.\n\n13:17.220 --> 13:18.500\nYou want me to fall into the trap\n\n13:18.500 --> 13:22.620\nwhere I use the only money I do have traveling around,\n\n13:22.620 --> 13:24.860\ngoing, like, oh, I like the Yukon.\n\n13:24.860 --> 13:27.380\nI like the wheat patch.\n\n13:27.380 --> 13:31.060\nI like the turkey farm.\n\n13:31.060 --> 13:32.660\nI got to tell you that that's the root.\n\n13:32.660 --> 13:34.500\nWhen you had no money, you would.\n\n13:34.500 --> 13:37.620\nIf you had, like, $1,000, you'd spend $800 on a trip.\n\n13:37.620 --> 13:38.220\nYou would.\n\n13:38.220 --> 13:39.020\nAnd then you'd be like, fuck it.\n\n13:39.020 --> 13:41.020\nWhen I get back, I'll figure out how to manage this $200\n\n13:41.020 --> 13:42.260\ninto another $800.\n\n13:42.260 --> 13:43.100\nBut now you got cash.\n\n13:43.100 --> 13:44.180\nYou got nervous and shit.\n\n13:44.180 --> 13:45.540\nSo you stop taking risks.\n\n13:45.540 --> 13:46.340\nI feel you.\n\n13:46.340 --> 13:46.840\nNo.\n\n13:46.840 --> 13:49.700\nBut it's time to, like, seriously, like, maybe take some\n\n13:49.700 --> 13:50.420\ntrips.\n\n13:50.420 --> 13:51.260\nDream life.\n\n13:51.260 --> 13:52.020\nDream life.\n\n13:52.020 --> 13:53.460\nHere it is.\n\n13:53.460 --> 13:55.100\nBed.\n\n13:55.100 --> 13:57.100\nCalifornia King.\n\n13:57.100 --> 13:58.260\nCody.\n\n13:58.260 --> 13:59.460\nMe.\n\n13:59.460 --> 14:01.020\nComforter.\n\n14:01.020 --> 14:02.020\nThe dogs.\n\n14:02.020 --> 14:02.620\nThey're fine.\n\n14:02.620 --> 14:05.860\nWe'll deal with them.\n\n14:05.860 --> 14:07.180\nForensic files.\n\n14:07.180 --> 14:07.780\nNetflix.\n\n14:07.780 --> 14:08.300\nEverything.\n\n14:08.300 --> 14:09.340\nAll of it.\n\n14:09.340 --> 14:10.180\nEverything available.\n\n14:10.180 --> 14:10.940\nBaller shit.\n\n14:10.940 --> 14:11.820\nBaller.\n\n14:11.820 --> 14:13.020\nI'm going to complain about all of it.\n\n14:13.020 --> 14:15.700\nSpielberg, you heard me.\n\n14:15.700 --> 14:16.660\nKeep making shit.\n\n14:16.660 --> 14:19.060\nI'll keep fucking shooting it back in your face.\n\n14:19.060 --> 14:22.100\nWhat have you done?\n\n14:22.100 --> 14:23.220\nYou barfed it on me.\n\n14:23.220 --> 14:24.660\nI'll barf it right back at you.\n\n14:24.660 --> 14:25.420\nI enjoy it.\n\n14:25.420 --> 14:26.340\nYou enjoyed it.\n\n14:26.340 --> 14:27.820\nYou didn't suffer during that movie.\n\n14:27.820 --> 14:28.500\nI could tell.\n\n14:28.500 --> 14:29.300\nI watched five movies of it.\n\n14:29.300 --> 14:30.100\nYou started this.\n\n14:30.100 --> 14:34.180\nIf you were hurting while you made that movie,\n\n14:34.180 --> 14:37.700\nI'll give you a million dollars.\n\n14:37.700 --> 14:40.580\nYou were definitely happy.\n\n14:40.580 --> 14:42.820\nYou were in a hammock.\n\n14:42.820 --> 14:46.940\nBut I want to be in bed with Cody.\n\n14:46.940 --> 14:51.780\nLaptop for just I want to learn Maya.\n\n14:51.780 --> 14:54.580\nI'm learning Maya right now, 3D modeling.\n\n14:54.580 --> 14:57.300\nAnd just watching things.\n\n14:57.300 --> 15:00.260\nAnd then I want to wake up the next morning.\n\n15:00.260 --> 15:02.380\nAnd I don't want to have to go to work.\n\n15:02.380 --> 15:04.420\nI want to stay in bed with Cody.\n\n15:04.420 --> 15:06.980\nAnd then I want to stay in bed.\n\n15:06.980 --> 15:09.020\nAnd then go to sleep again.\n\n15:09.020 --> 15:11.420\nAnd then wake up the next day.\n\n15:11.420 --> 15:12.660\nI want to just keep doing that.\n\n15:12.660 --> 15:13.540\nI think you can.\n\n15:13.540 --> 15:14.300\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n15:14.300 --> 15:14.860\nI think you can.\n\n15:14.860 --> 15:17.380\nWell, God knows I've tried.\n\n15:17.380 --> 15:18.380\nWe're trying.\n\n15:18.380 --> 15:21.660\nBut I don't.\n\n15:21.660 --> 15:23.300\nBut you can't.\n\n15:23.300 --> 15:24.420\nYou live in a house.\n\n15:24.420 --> 15:25.700\nAnd the house has a mortgage.\n\n15:25.700 --> 15:26.780\nAnd then the water.\n\n15:26.780 --> 15:30.060\nAnd the water comes from a place.\n\n15:30.060 --> 15:32.180\nAnd they go, we need our money for the water.\n\n15:32.180 --> 15:34.260\nAnd there's dirt people.\n\n15:34.260 --> 15:35.380\nThey're like,

gears and maybe bring up our guest.\n\n23:25.620 --> 23:26.300\nIs he here?\n\n23:26.300 --> 23:27.460\nThat's what I heard, yeah.\n\n23:27.460 --> 23:28.700\nThat is the rumor.\n\n23:28.700 --> 23:31.340\nAll right, well, maybe I've rubbed you the wrong way tonight.\n\n23:31.340 --> 23:32.180\nWho?\n\n23:32.180 --> 23:33.100\nSteven Spielberg.\n\n23:36.020 --> 23:37.140\nOr is that a song title?\n\n23:39.780 --> 23:42.060\nI just want to get on everybody's good side\n\n23:42.060 --> 23:47.180\nand maybe I don't have the personality or the reputation\n\n23:47.180 --> 23:50.020\nfor that, so why don't I bring up our guest?\n\n23:50.020 --> 23:51.020\nIs he really here?\n\n23:51.020 --> 23:51.740\nIs he really here?\n\n23:51.740 --> 23:52.540\nJohn Mayer's here.\n\n23:52.540 --> 23:53.540\nLet's bring up John Mayer.\n\n23:53.540 --> 23:54.040\nWhat?\n\n23:54.040 --> 23:55.020\nOh, man.\n\n23:55.020 --> 23:56.620\nA very special Harmontown.\n\n24:00.620 --> 24:01.620\nYo.\n\n24:01.620 --> 24:05.380\nYo, yo, John Mayer coming to the stage.\n\n24:05.380 --> 24:09.940\nJohn Mayer on the fucking rage, blues, rock, pop, soul.\n\n24:09.940 --> 24:13.180\nFuck your mama on a donut roll.\n\n24:13.180 --> 24:14.620\nDonuts don't have rolls.\n\n24:14.620 --> 24:17.740\nFuck your mama in a hole.\n\n24:17.740 --> 24:22.180\nI'm getting nervous because you're a famous lyricist.\n\n24:22.180 --> 24:26.980\nYo, John Mayer is here.\n\n24:26.980 --> 24:28.500\nJohn Mayer is here.\n\n24:28.500 --> 24:31.780\nLet's talk to John Mayer.\n\n24:31.780 --> 24:32.780\nOh, yeah.\n\n24:32.780 --> 24:33.820\nI want to be the guy.\n\n24:33.820 --> 24:36.780\nI want to be the guy who hears the other rapper rap\n\n24:36.780 --> 24:40.980\nand then quickly associates other words to shout out.\n\n24:40.980 --> 24:41.480\nYeah.\n\n24:41.480 --> 24:42.420\nThat's an answer to it.\n\n24:42.420 --> 24:43.620\nThat's the hardest part.\n\n24:43.620 --> 24:45.700\nI try to do that every night.\n\n24:45.700 --> 24:46.260\nYeah, that's what I like.\n\n24:46.260 --> 24:46.860\nIt's so hard.\n\n24:46.860 --> 24:49.100\nSometimes I'm like MC nubs, and it's\n\n24:49.100 --> 24:50.300\nlike the best I could pull out.\n\n24:50.300 --> 24:51.220\nIt's not easy.\n\n24:51.220 --> 24:53.620\nYeah, and there's so many rap songs that don't have that.\n\n24:53.620 --> 24:56.100\nYou can go back in time and just add it to all the other songs\n\n24:56.100 --> 24:57.020\nthat are there.\n\n24:57.020 --> 24:58.100\nAnd people do.\n\n24:58.100 --> 24:58.500\nYeah.\n\n24:58.500 --> 24:59.420\nAnd re-release them.\n\n24:59.420 --> 25:00.660\nYeah, I do it.\n\n25:00.660 --> 25:04.860\nI think that we put out a glass for you with a lemon wedge.\n\n25:04.860 --> 25:06.220\nI got this from my hotel room.\n\n25:06.220 --> 25:07.140\nAll right.\n\n25:07.140 --> 25:07.700\nWhat is that?\n\n25:07.700 --> 25:08.420\nWhat you got there?\n\n25:08.420 --> 25:09.380\nIt's a kombucha.\n\n25:09.380 --> 25:10.100\nOh, nice.\n\n25:10.100 --> 25:10.860\nDo you like that?\n\n25:10.860 --> 25:12.940\nI haven't had a type I've liked so far,\n\n25:12.940 --> 25:14.100\nbut I'm still open to it.\n\n25:14.100 --> 25:16.860\nI quit drinking, and so I find that this\n\n25:16.860 --> 25:20.380\ntakes the place of a curiously strange bubbly drink\n\n25:20.380 --> 25:21.660\nthat I'm not sure if I like.\n\n25:21.660 --> 25:22.340\nYeah.\n\n25:22.340 --> 25:24.300\nYes, it's perfect for that.\n\n25:24.300 --> 25:26.660\nEach sip just creates more curiosity\n\n25:26.660 --> 25:29.660\nas to what the fuck I'm drinking this time.\n\n25:29.660 --> 25:30.340\nCan I swear?\n\n25:30.340 --> 25:31.140\nYeah, yeah.\n\n25:31.140 --> 25:32.220\nPlease do.\n\n25:32.220 --> 25:33.060\nWe prefer it.\n\n25:33.060 --> 25:33.900\nThank you.\n\n25:33.900 --> 25:36.340\nSometimes I'll be laying in bed, and I'll hear it.\n\n25:36.340 --> 25:37.340\nEh.\n\n25:37.340 --> 25:40.100\nEh.\n\n25:40.100 --> 25:40.860\nAnd I'll be like, what is it?\n\n25:40.860 --> 25:43.020\nAnd I'll turn over, and it's my kombucha bottle,\n\n25:43.020 --> 25:45.740\nwhere the cap wasn't totally on, and it scares me.\n\n25:45.740 --> 25:47.140\nIt emits, like a.\n\n25:47.140 --> 25:48.460\nYeah, the carbonation, you know?\n\n25:48.460 --> 25:49.780\nEh.\n\n25:49.780 --> 25:51.380\nYeah, it ferments, right?\n\n25:51.380 --> 25:51.980\nOver time.\n\n25:51.980 --> 25:52.380\nOver time.\n\n25:52.380 --> 25:52.980\nYeah, it gets hot.\n\n25:52.980 --> 25:53.500\nIt screams.\n\n25:53.500 --> 25:54.100\nYeah.\n\n25:54.100 --> 25:56.500\nWhat is there?\n\n25:56.500 --> 26:02.540\nI started washing a bottle out in my sink\n\n26:02.540 --> 26:04.660\nthat's like a drinking bottle, and I put, like,\n\n26:04.660 --> 26:08.660\nI have a thing in my sink that emits boiling water,\n\n26:08.660 --> 26:10.940\nand so I fill the thing with boiling water,\n\n26:10.940 --> 26:12.420\nbecause I don't, I'm like, oh, I'm\n\n26:12.420 --> 26:14.540\ngetting an end run around washing things.\n\n26:14.540 --> 26:19.780\nAnd I fill the cup with boiling water, and I seal it shut,\n\n26:19.780 --> 26:22.380\nand then I shake it, and it's got boiling water in it.\n\n26:22.380 --> 26:25.460\nAnd then when I unscrew it, how come it goes sssss?\n\n26:25.460 --> 26:26.060\nRight.\n\n26:26.060 --> 26:27.260\nWhat happened in that short period of time?\n\n26:27.260 --> 26:28.140\nIt's just water.\n\n26:28.140 --> 26:30.780\nIt was already hot water, but the air wasn't hot.\n\n26:30.780 --> 26:31.580\nWhat is it, Spencer?\n\n26:31.580 --> 26:33.220\nWhat's, is it steam?\n\n26:33.220 --> 26:34.060\nI don't understand.\n\n26:34.060 --> 26:37.300\nIt's sizzling, like, it sounded like you were making\n\n26:37.300 --> 26:40.780\nthe sound like when you open a bottle of soda kind of hiss?\n\n26:40.780 --> 26:42.420\nYeah, it's like just a little one, though.\n\n26:42.420 --> 26:43.940\nIt's sssss, and I'm like, what is that?\n\n26:43.940 --> 26:45.700\nWhat were you keeping from me?\n\n26:45.700 --> 26:48.180\nYeah, it's just got to be, like, pressurized somehow,\n\n26:48.180 --> 26:48.900\nI would guess.\n\n26:48.900 --> 26:49.700\nI don't know.\n\n26:49.700 --> 26:52.460\nWhen you poured it in there, the air was not warm.\n\n26:52.460 --> 26:54.300\nIt probably has nothing to do with me shaking it.\n\n26:54.300 --> 26:57.740\nIt's probably just hot water steaming already.\n\n26:57.740 --> 26:58.980\nYou seal it up.\n\n26:58.980 --> 27:01.700\nIt didn't matter what I did, and then I, you.\n\n27:01.700 --> 27:02.860\nSteam, steam pressure.\n\n27:02.860 --> 27:03.980\nIt's a platonic engine.\n\n27:03.980 --> 27:05.460\nYeah, I think that's it.\n\n27:05.460 --> 27:06.460\nThat's how trains are made.\n\n27:06.460 --> 27:08.060\nRight, that's how trains work.\n\n27:08.060 --> 27:09.380\nThat's how trains work.\n\n27:09.380 --> 27:10.300\nI don't even know.\n\n27:10.300 --> 27:12.780\nJohn Mayer, we just met today.\n\n27:12.780 --> 27:15.980\nYeah, a seven time Grammy winner.\n\n27:15.980 --> 27:17.580\nWhoa, looked it up.\n\n27:20.980 --> 27:22.660\nYou're welcome.\n\n27:22.660 --> 27:24.980\nGood host, good host, good interviewer.\n\n27:24.980 --> 27:26.500\nYeah, how did we meet?\n\n27:26.500 --> 27:27.420\nLet's tell the story.\n\n27:27.420 --> 27:29.500\nWe just met an hour ago.\n\n27:29.500 --> 27:30.660\nWe met, like, six hours ago.\n\n27:30.660 --> 27:33.700\nI'm a huge fan of Rick and Morty, like everyone else is.\n\n27:33.700 --> 27:37.100\nAnd I tend to dive deep when I like something.\n\n27:37.100 --> 27:39.420\nYou don't want to be the friend in my life who likes something\n\n27:39.420 --> 27:42.140\nand then turns me on to it because I will swiftly just\n\n27:42.140 --> 27:45.980\nrailroad you with my being into it 20 times more than you\n\n27:45.980 --> 27:47.220\nare within a short period of time.\n\n27:47.220 --> 27:48.100\nAnd I did that.\n\n27:48.100 --> 27:49.140\nAnd I became a big fan.\n\n27:49.140 --> 27:51.180\nAnd then I reached out to somebody from your show.\n\n27:51.180 --> 27:52.860\nOr what I usually do is I just make\n\n27:52.860 --> 27:55.620\nsuch a big whoop on social media.\n\n27:55.620 --> 27:58.740\nYou know, I tend to sort of manifest my desires\n\n27:58.740 --> 28:01.660\nby way of Twitter and just creating a stir.\n\n28:01.660 --> 28:04.020\nAnd one of your producers reached out, I think.\n\n28:04.020 --> 28:05.340\nUh-huh.\n\n28:05.340 --> 28:06.300\nWas that Steve Levy?\n\n28:06.300 --> 28:08.380\nI think it was Mike.\n\n28:08.380 --> 28:09.220\nMike?\n\n28:09.220 --> 28:10.140\nOh, Mike Mendele.\n\n28:10.140 --> 28:11.060\nMike Mendele.\n\n28:11.060 --> 28:12.340\nYeah.\n\n28:12.340 --> 28:13.580\nOh, Mike McMahon.\n\n28:13.580 --> 28:15.780\nYeah, a lot of Mike's going on.\n\n28:15.780 --> 28:17.940\nAnd all I need is one Mike.\n\n28:17.940 --> 28:18.660\nOK.\n\n28:18.660 --> 28:19.500\nThanks.\n\n28:19.500 --> 28:20.220\nIt's a nozz, right?\n\n28:20.220 --> 28:21.100\nNozz, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n28:21.100 --> 28:21.940\nThanks, thanks.\n\n28:21.940 --> 28:22.340\nWell done.\n\n28:22.340 --> 28:23.780\nThanks.\n\n28:23.780 --> 28:26.700\nAnd then I met a really sweet guy on your crew\n\n28:26.700 --> 28:27.660\nwho's one of the artists.\n\n28:27.660 --> 28:29.340\nHis name is Corey.\n\n28:29.340 --> 28:29.820\nCorey?\n\n28:29.820 --> 28:30.420\nNever met him.\n\n28:30.420 --> 28:31.100\nYep.\n\n28:31.100 --> 28:36.140\nHe invited me to the taping of the season three DVD commentary.\n\n28:36.140 --> 28:39.980\nAnd I came, availed myself, to actually sitting in the room\n\n28:39.980 --> 28:41.620\nand talking on a DVD with you guys.\n\n28:41.620 --> 28:42.420\nHere's the fun part.\n\n28:42.420 --> 28:44.660\nI'm already aware that I'm behind the eight ball\n\n28:44.660 --> 28:45.620\nwhen it comes to my name.\n\n28:45.620 --> 28:48.740\nAnd certain people enjoy Rick and Morty because of the fact\n\n28:48.740 --> 28:53.020\nit does not contain any John Mayer elements in it.\n\n28:53.020 --> 28:53.940\nA lot of them.\n\n28:53.940 --> 28:56.700\nCertain things just have their strength from me not\n\n28:56.700 --> 28:58.660\nbeing involved in it in any way.\n\n28:58.660 --> 29:00.780\nAnd I like to close that gap.\n\n29:00.780 --> 29:01.980\nAnd there I was.\n\n29:01.980 --> 29:05.260\nAnd I wasn't on the first commentary\n\n29:05.260 --> 29:07.060\nthat they did today.\n\n29:07.060 --> 29:10.940\nBut I was on what will end up being the very first episode\n\n29:10.940 --> 29:13.420\non the commentary in the sequence,\n\n29:13.420 --> 29:15.660\nwhich makes me look even nervier than I already am.\n\n29:15.660 --> 29:17.020\nBut we got to talking.\n\n29:17.020 --> 29:19.540\nAnd I think I found a certain familiarity\n\n29:19.540 --> 29:24.340\nin both your intelligence and your unhappiness.\n\n29:24.340 --> 29:25.340\nYes.\n\n29:25.340 --> 29:26.340\nYes.\n\n29:26.340 --> 29:27.540\nI mean, it really is true.\n\n29:27.540 --> 29:31.140\nI had a great day today because I met John Mayer.\n\n29:31.140 --> 29:33.020\nAnd I was like, I'm not miserable,\n\n29:33.020 --> 29:37.060\nbut I don't get to complain about the things that I\n\n29:37.060 --> 29:40.020\nhave to complain about to anybody but John Mayer.\n\n29:40.020 --> 29:40.500\nBring him.\n\n29:40.500 --> 29:41.500\nBring him.\n\n29:41.500 --> 29:42.500\nWell, no.\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:45.580\nWe were standing in a kitchenette eating pepperoni pizza\n\n29:45.580 --> 29:49.740\ntalking about how hard Google Autofill can be.\n\n29:49.740 --> 29:51.340\nYeah, I was saying that.\n\n29:51.340 --> 29:52.460\nHow merciless.\n\n29:52.460 --> 29:55.340\nWell, I don't know that anybody searches.\n\n29:55.340 --> 29:57.940\nDoes anybody just Google search a celebrity name\n\n29:57.940 --> 30:00.860\nto find out what's going on unless you're the celebrity?\n\n30:00.860 --> 30:04.620\nLike, does anybody here go like, what's going on with Gaga?\n\n30:04.620 --> 30:07.300\nAnd just throw in Lady Gaga and everything?\n\n30:07.300 --> 30:07.800\nYeah.\n\n30:07.800 --> 30:08.940\nLike, it's been two years, I think.\n\n30:08.940 --> 30:09.700\nWhat's happening?\n\n30:09.700 --> 30:10.980\nWhat makes that kind of curiosity?\n\n30:10.980 --> 30:11.420\nOh, really?\n\n30:11.420 --> 30:12.100\nJust to catch up?\n\n30:12.100 --> 30:13.220\nSometimes.\n\n30:13.220 --> 30:16.220\nWhen you're a fan, I mean, I'm a fan of a ton of people,\n\n30:16.220 --> 30:17.460\nso I catch up.\n\n30:17.460 --> 30:21.620\nI mean, I was looking at, like, aerobics icons from the 80s\n\n30:21.620 --> 30:23.020\nbefore I got here.\n\n30:23.020 --> 30:24.060\nYeah, but that's not by name.\n\n30:24.060 --> 30:24.940\nOh, yeah, I guess so.\n\n30:24.940 --> 30:26.540\nThat's a little bit like a where they announce it.\n\n30:26.540 --> 30:28.460\nLike Cynthia Carellick?\n\n30:28.460 --> 30:30.620\nWell, you know, it's like Denise Austin.\n\n30:30.620 --> 30:31.700\nYeah, sure.\n\n30:31.700 --> 30:32.340\nJane Fonda.\n\n30:32.340 --> 30:32.980\nJane Fonda.\n\n30:32.980 --> 30:33.980\nYeah.\n\n30:33.980 --> 30:36.220\nMy mother used to have Jane Fonda LP.\n\n30:36.220 --> 30:37.340\nYou'd fall down those rabbit holes.\n\n30:37.340 --> 30:39.860\nYeah, that's how I discovered the Jacksons.\n\n30:39.860 --> 30:45.180\nBecause Can You Feel It was the song for the Jane Fonda.\n\n30:45.180 --> 30:47.220\nAnd she would say, one vertebra at a time.\n\n30:47.220 --> 30:48.500\nLift it up, one vertebra.\n\n30:48.500 --> 30:51.020\nCan you feel it, boom, boom, boom, can you feel it?\n\n30:51.020 --> 30:52.020\nAnd my mother was there.\n\n30:55.020 --> 30:59.300\nFunny way to get indoctrinated into the love of the Jacksons.\n\n30:59.300 --> 31:00.580\nOne vertebra at a time.\n\n31:00.580 --> 31:04.260\nYou're slightly younger than me, but I came of pubescence\n\n31:04.260 --> 31:10.180\nat the height of the aerobics movement.\n\n31:10.180 --> 31:13.420\nAnd that was my girlfriend shifting uncomfortable.\n\n31:13.420 --> 31:17.580\nIs that to suggest that it served a purpose beyond aerobic?\n\n31:17.580 --> 31:21.980\nYeah, I wasn't the most fit 13-year-old boy in the world.\n\n31:21.980 --> 31:27.460\nAnd yet I watched a lot of syndicated aerobics programs.\n\n31:27.460 --> 31:30.940\nSometimes I get upset when I watch porn\n\n31:30.940 --> 31:33.180\nthat I can see everything.\n\n31:33.180 --> 31:36.740\nI remember not seeing everything and fighting with my eyes.\n\n31:36.740 --> 31:40.380\nWell, do you know that there's a, I mean, one thing I've\n\n31:40.380 --> 31:40.940\ntried.\n\n31:40.940 --> 31:42.900\nI started typing in fully closed.\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:44.620\nOr even just bra ads and stuff.\n\n31:44.620 --> 31:48.340\nLike wanting to see beyond things is very erotic.\n\n31:48.340 --> 31:50.780\nOr wanting to, it could be a creepier thing\n\n31:50.780 --> 31:53.860\nwhere you want to see what you see every day.\n\n31:53.860 --> 31:57.420\nAnd you want to sexualize that as someone who's just available.\n\n31:57.420 --> 31:59.780\nI can get with that.\n\n31:59.780 --> 32:02.580\nYeah, I won't judge it either way.\n\n32:02.580 --> 32:07.260\nBut yeah, I found myself typing in.\n\n32:07.260 --> 32:08.980\nAnd I found out there's an abbreviation.\n\n32:08.980 --> 32:11.620\nIt's a genre of porn.\n\n32:11.620 --> 32:21.380\nIt's C-F-N-F-N-N-M, the closed female male.\n\n32:21.380 --> 32:23.020\nI don't know why the guy has to be naked.\n\n32:23.020 --> 32:24.100\nThat's not on my.\n\n32:24.100 --> 32:25.540\nBecause it's humiliating.\n\n32:25.540 --> 32:27.260\nWell, he doesn't seem humiliated.\n\n32:27.260 --> 32:28.220\nNo, he's into it.\n\n32:28.220 --> 32:30.100\nI think it's exactly to your point.\n\n32:30.100 --> 32:34.980\nIt has this sense of extreme ease.\n\n32:34.980 --> 32:37.460\nThe idea that, well, it really is the manifestation\n\n32:37.460 --> 32:39.700\nof what you see a lot going on in the news right now.\n\n32:39.700 --> 32:41.140\nApparently, that's how most people\n\n32:41.140 --> 32:42.780\nwant to work in the office.\n\n32:42.780 --> 32:45.260\nJust nothing on.\n\n32:45.260 --> 32:46.660\nYeah, I mean, well, yeah.\n\n32:46.660 --> 32:48.500\nWhat's going on in the news right now?\n\n32:48.500 --> 32:52.860\nWell, it seems to be a lot of that kind of sexualization\n\n32:52.860 --> 32:56.500\nof the idea that I'm going to turn what seems to be a very\n\n32:56.500 --> 32:58.740\nmatter of fact moment into something sexual, which I think\n\n32:58.740 --> 33:02.700\nis where the root of C, you have to work it out.\n\n33:02.700 --> 33:03.260\nIt's like a plan.\n\n33:03.260 --> 33:04.140\nYeah, you really do every time.\n\n33:04.140 --> 33:05.940\nIt's Roy G. Biv, really.\n\n33:05.940 --> 33:06.460\nRoy G. Biv.\n\n33:06.460 --> 33:07.700\nYou could call it Roy G. Biv.\n\n33:07.700 --> 33:11.660\nYeah, most of the stuff in that folder\n\n33:11.660 --> 33:14.860\nthat I hope no one finds, it really\n\n33:14.860 --> 33:20.820\nresembles things that are hardly recognizable as porn.\n\n33:20.820 --> 33:21.500\nI understand.\n\n33:21.500 --> 33:23.540\nI'm into the sleight of hand of it as well.\n\n33:23.540 --> 33:23.900\nNo pun.\n\n33:23.900 --> 33:28.020\nI enjoy the subtle, like the game of subtlety.\n\n33:28.020 --> 33:29.660\nI friggin' love it.\n\n33:29.660 --> 33:30.740\nI friggin' love it.\n\n33:30.740 --> 33:35.700\nAll right, well, let's pull back out to the bigger picture.\n\n33:35.700 --> 33:39.740\nFame, the difficulty with it.\n\n33:39.740 --> 33:41.020\nThere was a certain point where it was like,\n\n33:41.020 --> 33:42.380\nyou've got to come on the podcast,\n\n33:42.380 --> 33:45.260\nand we've got to have this conversation, because why?\n\n33:45.260 --> 33:46.980\nI don't know, because I'm a nurse assistant,\n\n33:46.980 --> 33:48.780\nand I don't want to continue to have it privately,\n\n33:48.780 --> 33:50.500\nbecause I might accidentally make a front.\n\n33:50.500 --> 33:52.020\nI just want to.\n\n33:52.020 --> 33:56.220\nBut it was like, and we were both like,\n\n33:56.220 --> 33:58.900\nas long as we don't take a woe as me stance,\n\n33:58.900 --> 34:02.540\nit would be really funny to talk about how.\n\n34:02.540 --> 34:05.100\nI think there's a lot to work with in it,\n\n34:05.100 --> 34:06.340\nas your therapist might say.\n\n34:06.340 --> 34:07.380\nThere's a lot to work with you.\n\n34:07.380 --> 34:08.260\nFollow that thought.\n\n34:08.260 --> 34:10.980\nDo you actively, are you in therapy?\n\n34:10.980 --> 34:11.780\nYes.\n\n34:11.780 --> 34:13.380\nHow long have you been in therapy?\n\n34:13.380 --> 34:16.780\nI've been in therapy for years, but my current relationship\n\n34:16.780 --> 34:22.300\nof man versus therapist has been since 2009.\n\n34:22.300 --> 34:26.580\nAnd I don't really think about it in the overall machinations\n\n34:26.580 --> 34:29.220\nof fame the way you would normally think about it.\n\n34:29.220 --> 34:31.580\nI don't really have that ad hoc relationship anymore\n\n34:31.580 --> 34:32.380\nwith the world.\n\n34:32.380 --> 34:34.260\nI am subject.\n\n34:34.260 --> 34:35.580\nThing I do is famous.\n\n34:35.580 --> 34:37.980\nI think I've sort of particleized it in a good way,\n\n34:37.980 --> 34:41.180\nlike over time, with kind of going up and down so many times,\n\n34:41.180 --> 34:43.660\nor changing my name, or musically changing my name.\n\n34:43.660 --> 34:47.060\nI feel like I carry six musical passports.\n\n34:47.060 --> 34:49.700\nAnd the perfect backdrop for this\n\n34:49.700 --> 34:53.660\nis that as we speak, the Grammy after parties\n\n34:53.660 --> 34:56.500\nare taking place in New York City.\n\n34:56.500 --> 34:58.460\nAnd I'm not there.\n\n34:58.460 --> 35:01.260\nAnd that's something, that's a thing.\n\n35:01.260 --> 35:01.940\nThat's a thing.\n\n35:01.940 --> 35:03.140\nI put a record out this year.\n\n35:03.140 --> 35:05.460\nI made a record and thought that when I was making it,\n\n35:05.460 --> 35:07.900\nthere's no way this can't hit.\n\n35:07.900 --> 35:09.340\nAnd that's what you're supposed to think\n\n35:09.340 --> 35:10.180\nwhen you make something.\n\n35:10.180 --> 35:11.660\nDon't you think that when you're making something\n\n35:11.660 --> 35:13.180\nevery time that it's going to hit?\n\n35:13.180 --> 35:16.700\nYeah, but I want to make sure that we can connect our,\n\n35:16.700 --> 35:19.340\nbecause not being a musician, I just\n\n35:19.340 --> 35:23.540\nwant to make sure that we understand what we're\n\n35:23.540 --> 35:27.700\ntalking about, because me putting something out\n\n35:27.700 --> 35:30.140\nversus you putting something out can be a totally different\n\n35:30.140 --> 35:31.820\nthing.\n\n35:31.820 --> 35:37.980\nBut so not being at the Grammy after parties in New York\n\n35:37.980 --> 35:42.060\nmeans very carefully, not invited, didn't attend, or?\n\n35:42.060 --> 35:48.580\nDid not get nominated, didn't break through with my record.\n\n35:48.580 --> 35:52.660\nAnd I find that actually, I used to find it really sad,\n\n35:52.660 --> 35:55.340\nand now I find it really empowering somehow or another.\n\n35:55.340 --> 35:59.340\nI feel like it drives me pretty hard.\n\n35:59.340 --> 36:02.980\nThe idea that at least that's taken off the table,\n\n36:02.980 --> 36:04.860\nnot to put words in your mouth, but this\n\n36:04.860 --> 36:06.420\nis where I'm trying to find a parallel,\n\n36:06.420 --> 36:08.020\nlike stop me when I diverse through.\n\n36:08.020 --> 36:10.580\nI'm greedy, and I want to go to every party.\n\n36:10.580 --> 36:11.500\nI'm greedy.\n\n36:11.500 --> 36:14.620\nI want everything every possible way I can have it.\n\n36:14.620 --> 36:19.140\nI want both obscurity and also great, great mainstream\n\n36:19.140 --> 36:19.620\nsuccess.\n\n36:19.620 --> 36:20.180\nYes, OK.\n\n36:20.180 --> 36:22.940\nI want the power that obscurity has.\n\n36:22.940 --> 36:26.820\nBut I want the adulation that mainstream success has.\n\n36:26.820 --> 36:30.820\nAnd I find myself bouncing back and forth between those two\n\n36:30.820 --> 36:34.420\nneeds always a little bit upset in the middle of those two things.\n\n36:34.420 --> 36:36.340\nYou take the obscurity a little personally.\n\n36:36.340 --> 36:36.940\nMakes sense.\n\n36:36.940 --> 36:40.580\nIf you're not nominated for this, or this didn't hit that,\n\n36:40.580 --> 36:43.420\nor this charts as much as you know as an intellectual person,\n\n36:43.420 --> 36:45.580\nthat these metrics mean nothing.\n\n36:45.580 --> 36:46.900\nYou know you're supposed to know that.\n\n36:46.900 --> 36:48.220\nYour therapist knows it.\n\n36:48.220 --> 36:49.980\nYou've arrived at all these things.\n\n36:49.980 --> 36:51.420\nYou're a grown man.\n\n36:51.420 --> 36:52.820\nYou get all that stuff, but.\n\n36:52.820 --> 36:55.300\nAnd then it gets visceral because you're on Instagram.\n\n36:55.300 --> 36:57.540\nAnd then something happens that triggers you to go,\n\n36:57.540 --> 36:58.820\noh, people don't like me.\n\n36:58.820 --> 36:59.900\nI'm not approved of.\n\n36:59.900 --> 37:01.620\nI'm not.\n\n37:01.620 --> 37:03.860\nAnd you're like, I don't need that goal.\n\n37:03.860 --> 37:04.860\nI don't need that goal.\n\n37:04.860 --> 37:08.620\nThis is a great opportunity for me to now not be like that.\n\n37:08.620 --> 37:09.620\nNow, if you want, exact.\n\n37:09.620 --> 37:12.540\nBut if you want insight into the world\n\n37:12.540 --> 37:15.220\nand how the world must work, look at what I have.\n\n37:15.220 --> 37:18.540\nAnd now, I metabolize success so fast.\n\n37:18.540 --> 37:19.660\nAnd I know this about myself.\n\n37:19.660 --> 37:21.700\nI can't hold on to it.\n\n37:21.700 --> 37:24.420\nBut I have a lot of it that I could point to if I needed to.\n\n37:24.420 --> 37:27.100\nI'm sure it's always at work, whether I realize it or not.\n\n37:27.100 --> 37:29.940\nI'm sure the defense mechanisms of great success\n\n37:29.940 --> 37:32.660\nare always humming along, even if I can't hear it.\n\n37:32.660 --> 37:35.940\nAnd then I say to myself, if I feel this way,\n\n37:35.940 --> 37:38.980\nif I feel a little beat down today by this thing,\n\n37:38.980 --> 37:42.660\nimagine how someone who is 22 feels, who\n\n37:42.660 --> 37:44.460\ndoesn't have anything to their name,\n\n37:44.460 --> 37:47.260\nthat must make them like a straw house\n\n37:47.260 --> 37:48.860\nin the wind of that stuff.\n\n37:48.860 --> 37:50.420\nBecause they grow up in an environment\n\n37:50.420 --> 37:53.420\nwhere they need the likes and the, yeah.\n\n37:53.420 --> 37:54.220\nImagine that.\n\n37:54.220 --> 37:55.780\nMy heart breaks for that.\n\n37:55.780 --> 37:57.900\nLike, I did this.\n\n37:57.900 --> 38:03.180\nI sat in the interim between Craig Ferguson and James\n\n38:03.180 --> 38:04.740\nCorden doing Late Late Show.\n\n38:04.740 --> 38:08.140\nI did a guest host thing for three days.\n\n38:08.140 --> 38:10.660\nI did Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\n38:10.660 --> 38:13.780\nAnd I literally cried on Thursday night.\n\n38:13.780 --> 38:17.620\nIt made me cry because the question,\n\n38:17.620 --> 38:21.380\nand this might sort of overlap into television, was,\n\n38:21.380 --> 38:24.380\nand I asked one simple question of the world.\n\n38:24.380 --> 38:25.180\nIsn't it good?\n\n38:25.180 --> 38:25.940\nWas I good?\n\n38:25.940 --> 38:26.660\nThat was the question.\n\n38:26.660 --> 38:27.660\nWas I good?\n\n38:27.660 --> 38:34.660\nThe answer told over Twitter just kept prolonging the question.\n\n38:34.660 --> 38:35.980\nI couldn't find the answer.\n\n38:35.980 --> 38:36.740\nAnd it drove me crazy.\n\n38:36.740 --> 38:38.860\nNow, you've got the East Coast airtime,\n\n38:38.860 --> 38:40.340\nand you've got the West Coast airtime.\n\n38:40.340 --> 38:43.460\nSo you do actually two laps around every broadcast.\n\n38:43.460 --> 38:46.100\nYou do the East Coast live tweet, and you read it.\n\n38:46.100 --> 38:48.820\nAnd every answer just gets further away from you\n\n38:48.820 --> 38:50.180\nas you keep reading.\n\n38:50.180 --> 38:53.860\nAnd it drove me mad because I couldn't answer the question.\n\n38:53.860 --> 38:55.380\nAnd then I realized retroactively,\n\n38:55.380 --> 38:58.700\nthis is what the friends I've had,\n\n38:58.700 --> 39:01.260\nthe girls I've tried to love forever,\n\n39:01.260 --> 39:03.140\nlike this is what people in this industry\n\n39:03.140 --> 39:07.700\nhave to deal with, is this ever-escaping answer\n\n39:07.700 --> 39:11.180\nto the simplest of questions, which is,\n\n39:11.180 --> 39:12.260\ndid anybody like that?\n\n39:12.260 --> 39:13.220\nYeah.\n\n39:13.220 --> 39:13.720\nYeah.\n\n39:13.720 --> 39:14.940\nThat's the only question.\n\n39:14.940 --> 39:16.020\nAm I a good primate?\n\n39:16.020 --> 39:16.860\nDid I do good?\n\n39:16.860 --> 39:18.180\nAre you ever going to kick me out?\n\n39:18.180 --> 39:21.020\nWill you just set me up in a branch of this tree\n\n39:21.020 --> 39:22.340\nwhere I can chill?\n\n39:22.340 --> 39:25.700\nI like, yeah.\n\n39:25.700 --> 39:31.860\nBecause you get early encouragement\n\n39:31.860 --> 39:34.500\nfor doing special things.\n\n39:34.500 --> 39:38.740\nAnd before you realize that special things are special\n\n39:38.740 --> 39:42.540\nbecause they're not normal, and you eventually\n\n39:42.540 --> 39:44.620\nenter a world where you realize that those special things,\n\n39:44.620 --> 39:48.020\nthey're not that special, you're just being normal.\n\n39:48.020 --> 39:49.900\nLike, they're not that special.\n\n39:49.900 --> 39:53.060\nThey're not so special that you can be an asshole.\n\n39:53.060 --> 39:56.500\nThey're not so special that someone else isn't better at it.\n\n39:56.500 --> 39:59.260\nThey're not so special that it's definitive at all.\n\n39:59.260 --> 40:02.500\nThey're just special enough that your mom says,\n\n40:02.500 --> 40:04.860\nI love you, when you do it.\n\n40:04.860 --> 40:08.380\nAnd it might be sowing a fucking seam.\n\n40:08.380 --> 40:12.020\nIt might be your eyesight is better than 2020.\n\n40:12.020 --> 40:14.340\nIt might be jumping over a bush.\n\n40:14.340 --> 40:16.740\nIt might be catching a ball.\n\n40:16.740 --> 40:18.820\nFor me, it was reading and writing.\n\n40:18.820 --> 40:21.420\nI was reading, and I was writing, and I was reading,\n\n40:21.420 --> 40:22.260\nand I was writing.\n\n40:22.260 --> 40:32.340\nAnd it's like you're swallowing this thread.\n\n40:32.340 --> 40:36.100\nAnd you're just going along it, and you're going.\n\n40:36.100 --> 40:38.660\nAnd it's all too late when you go,\n\n40:38.660 --> 40:42.180\nI don't want approval anymore.\n\n40:42.180 --> 40:43.140\nI want safety.\n\n40:43.140 --> 40:44.500\nI want comfort.\n\n40:44.500 --> 40:47.460\nAnd then you look around and go, oh,\n\n40:47.460 --> 40:50.620\nI don't have as much safety and comfort\n\n40:50.620 --> 40:54.380\nas someone whose mom patted him on the head\n\n40:54.380 --> 40:56.900\nfor being a mailman.\n\n40:56.900 --> 41:00.620\nWell, I would amend that a little bit for me, because I have.\n\n41:00.620 --> 41:02.940\nBy the way, I lost what I was trying to say in the middle\n\n41:02.940 --> 41:03.860\nand started riffing.\n\n41:03.860 --> 41:06.380\nAnd I totally, it all fell apart.\n\n41:06.380 --> 41:07.540\nI tracked it the whole time.\n\n41:07.540 --> 41:08.060\nThat's the scare.\n\n41:08.060 --> 41:10.020\nYou're so bright, you can even articulate.\n\n41:10.020 --> 41:11.660\nI wasn't fishing for that, John Mayer.\n\n41:11.660 --> 41:14.140\nYou're so bright, you can even articulate stuff.\n\n41:14.140 --> 41:15.300\nYou're not even thinking.\n\n41:15.300 --> 41:17.420\nDon't say my mind is a wonderland.\n\n41:17.420 --> 41:18.340\nI won't let you say it.\n\n41:18.340 --> 41:19.500\nI won't have it.\n\n41:19.500 --> 41:20.420\nI won't have it.\n\n41:20.420 --> 41:22.140\nYou're not an expert on it.\n\n41:22.140 --> 41:24.460\nAnd if you say it, it won't be a quote\n\n41:24.460 --> 41:27.180\nthat I can take to my grave.\n\n41:27.180 --> 41:28.780\nDon't say my mind is a wonderland.\n\n41:28.780 --> 41:29.620\nI won't.\n\n41:29.620 --> 41:31.220\nI won't sing it to you.\n\n41:31.220 --> 41:32.420\nOK.\n\n41:32.420 --> 41:33.980\nBut I have fans.\n\n41:33.980 --> 41:35.220\nI have music fans.\n\n41:35.220 --> 41:38.420\nAnd songs are repeatable.\n\n41:38.420 --> 41:39.860\nPeople live inside them forever.\n\n41:39.860 --> 41:41.140\nSo I have that part of it.\n\n41:41.140 --> 41:42.380\nAnd I feel stable there.\n\n41:42.380 --> 41:46.940\nHowever, most of my childhood upbringing I've decided\n\n41:46.940 --> 41:51.540\nis redacted, but part of the way that I got out of Fairfield\n\n41:51.540 --> 41:56.060\nConnecticut was by weaponizing my ability\n\n41:56.060 --> 41:58.820\nto focus on things and write songs and play guitar\n\n41:58.820 --> 41:59.540\nand get better.\n\n41:59.540 --> 42:04.020\nGetting better was what I did to defeat monsters.\n\n42:04.020 --> 42:05.620\nThat's how I beat monsters.\n\n42:05.620 --> 42:08.860\nLiterally defeated monsters by getting better.\n\n42:08.860 --> 42:10.620\nI got hit in the arm by the bully.\n\n42:10.620 --> 42:11.340\nI wouldn't hit back.\n\n42:11.340 --> 42:14.780\nI would say to myself, you'll see the day you want to buy\n\n42:14.780 --> 42:17.540\ntickets to my show, and I won't let you.\n\n42:17.540 --> 42:19.620\nOf course, to say nothing of the fact that's impossible\n\n42:19.620 --> 42:22.620\ncommercially, but you know what I'm saying.\n\n42:22.620 --> 42:25.580\nAnd then someone says, you can't do it.\n\n42:25.580 --> 42:27.860\nYou say, you go silent.\n\n42:27.860 --> 42:30.140\nI learned how to go deadly silent.\n\n42:30.140 --> 42:31.500\nI don't act out.\n\n42:31.500 --> 42:34.300\nI just go deadly silent and then go off in a room and do\n\n42:34.300 --> 42:36.060\nsomething, and it works.\n\n42:36.060 --> 42:39.260\nBut now I'm 40, and I think I've driven this pattern\n\n42:39.260 --> 42:43.620\ninto my life where every time I feel lonely, every time I feel\n\n42:43.620 --> 42:46.100\nlike I don't have enough to keep me company, literally to\n\n42:46.100 --> 42:51.540\nkeep me company, I'll just build another weapon.\n\n42:51.540 --> 42:53.380\nAnd the weapon is the music, and that's great.\n\n42:53.380 --> 42:56.940\nBut over time, and I think this is where we connect on this,\n\n42:56.940 --> 43:00.820\nis nobody tells you when to stop punching.\n\n43:00.820 --> 43:03.620\nYou literally have no concept of what the finish line is,\n\n43:03.620 --> 43:05.580\nbecause no one really knows what it is.\n\n43:05.580 --> 43:07.820\nA therapist will tell you.\n\n43:07.820 --> 43:09.460\nMy therapist told me.\n\n43:09.460 --> 43:10.820\nI'm still catching up to it.\n\n43:10.820 --> 43:16.700\nShe said, you're covered in weapons, an armor.\n\n43:16.700 --> 43:20.940\nAnd you're just going to have to let it go.\n\n43:20.940 --> 43:23.140\nIt's not doing anything for anybody.\n\n43:23.140 --> 43:25.900\nIt's there for a fine reason, but you've got to let it go.\n\n43:25.900 --> 43:37.620\nBut I get the sense from you that seven Grammys, you're\n\n43:37.620 --> 43:40.460\nJohn Mayer, whatever, man.\n\n43:40.460 --> 43:41.060\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n43:41.060 --> 43:42.540\nOne day I'm just going to get to John,\n\n43:42.540 --> 43:44.540\nbut I understand we're at first name, last name.\n\n43:44.540 --> 43:49.340\nThe, like, I correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n43:49.340 --> 43:54.260\nBecause this is like, it sounds like you're at least\n\n43:54.260 --> 43:57.540\nwilling to admit that you're scrolling through comments\n\n43:57.540 --> 44:00.020\nand you're looking for, you may not\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:02.700\nbe looking for validation there, but you're like,\n\n44:02.700 --> 44:03.780\nit's like a ticker.\n\n44:03.780 --> 44:06.980\nAnd I'm very curious, just in your inner clockwork,\n\n44:06.980 --> 44:12.420\nlike, when someone tries to say, someone\n\n44:12.420 --> 44:15.140\ntries to take a shot at me, they can say you're fat.\n\n44:15.140 --> 44:19.260\nAnd I'm like, yeah, that just means\n\n44:19.260 --> 44:23.020\nI'm twice as talented as I'd have to be if I was thin.\n\n44:23.020 --> 44:24.940\nThey say you're untalented.\n\n44:24.940 --> 44:27.460\nAnd I'm like, it doesn't.\n\n44:27.460 --> 44:29.580\nYeah, because I'm like, I want to say to the kid,\n\n44:29.580 --> 44:32.540\nlike, that is where Batman's chest plate is.\n\n44:32.540 --> 44:35.620\nLike, you don't, like, are you kidding me?\n\n44:35.620 --> 44:40.900\nYou heard my name because I, like, this is what I do.\n\n44:40.900 --> 44:43.900\nLike, I cannot be killed there.\n\n44:43.900 --> 44:47.100\nYou could dynamite that chest plate,\n\n44:47.100 --> 44:50.460\nand there wouldn't be a heart behind it to kill.\n\n44:50.460 --> 44:53.500\nBut then there's this, but it's like,\n\n44:53.500 --> 44:55.940\nthere's other shit that fucks you up, right?\n\n44:55.940 --> 44:57.460\nAnd it's weird, because like, someone\n\n44:57.460 --> 45:00.060\ncould call you untalented, and you could know it,\n\n45:00.060 --> 45:03.220\nand it's like, and go like, oh, I'm not\n\n45:03.220 --> 45:04.900\nworried about being untalented.\n\n45:04.900 --> 45:06.620\nI'm John Mayer.\n\n45:06.620 --> 45:12.780\nBut what I'm hearing you say is that there is shit that it's like.\n\n45:12.780 --> 45:14.300\nBecause I won't stay still.\n\n45:14.300 --> 45:19.140\nSo because I don't like a unanimous vote,\n\n45:19.140 --> 45:20.900\nI don't like unanimous votes.\n\n45:20.900 --> 45:24.260\nIt took me 40 years to realize I don't like golf claps.\n\n45:24.260 --> 45:27.780\nI don't like agreed upon 100% approval.\n\n45:27.780 --> 45:29.740\nFor some reason, things go invisible.\n\n45:29.740 --> 45:30.860\nIt's not very punk rock.\n\n45:30.860 --> 45:32.060\nThey just go invisible in my head.\n\n45:32.060 --> 45:33.260\nYour nightmare is obscurity.\n\n45:33.260 --> 45:33.780\nIt hurts.\n\n45:33.780 --> 45:37.340\nIt hurts to be part of the woodwork.\n\n45:37.340 --> 45:38.700\nMy nightmare is.\n\n45:38.700 --> 45:39.540\nI'm not saying you are.\n\n45:39.540 --> 45:40.740\nI'm saying that's your nightmare.\n\n45:40.740 --> 45:41.500\nNot obscurity.\n\n45:41.500 --> 45:44.220\nNo, I like obscurity if there's some depth to it.\n\n45:44.220 --> 45:47.260\nMy nightmare is being placed off to the side\n\n45:47.260 --> 45:49.100\nwhere everybody goes, got it.\n\n45:49.100 --> 45:52.300\nHe's indexed, labeled, barcoded, RF labeled.\n\n45:52.300 --> 45:53.140\nWe know who he is.\n\n45:53.140 --> 45:54.580\nOff you go.\n\n45:54.580 --> 45:58.380\nThat to me, I feel like I disappear.\n\n45:58.380 --> 46:00.300\nAnd so what I purposefully have done, I think,\n\n46:00.300 --> 46:02.180\nnow I can look back on it with some clarity,\n\n46:02.180 --> 46:05.740\nis diversify so that things can never get that way.\n\n46:05.740 --> 46:07.100\nI don't know why I do it that way.\n\n46:07.100 --> 46:10.180\nSo the only reason, now, if I went and played a show\n\n46:10.180 --> 46:11.820\nand came back, you're right.\n\n46:11.820 --> 46:14.500\nNobody could say that I didn't know how to play the guitar.\n\n46:14.500 --> 46:16.660\nBut it's the fact that I'm trying\n\n46:16.660 --> 46:19.540\nto diversify into situations that are so foreign.\n\n46:19.540 --> 46:23.860\nLike, how do people feel about me hosting a talk show?\n\n46:23.860 --> 46:26.340\nI'm going into such enemy territory that I think.\n\n46:26.340 --> 46:27.220\nThe Dave Chappelle moments.\n\n46:27.220 --> 46:28.900\nYeah, the stuff with Dave Chappelle.\n\n46:28.900 --> 46:31.860\nGoing off and doing a tour with Dave.\n\n46:31.860 --> 46:35.820\nAfter enough times of getting thrown in jail,\n\n46:35.820 --> 46:37.100\nyou have to say to yourself, there\n\n46:37.100 --> 46:39.820\nmust be something about the clothes in here that I like.\n\n46:39.820 --> 46:41.980\nThere must be something in here that I like.\n\n46:41.980 --> 46:43.860\nI mean, I'm taking that look at myself at 40.\n\n46:43.860 --> 46:45.860\nLike, take a look at the patterns.\n\n46:45.860 --> 46:48.340\nWhen things go well for you, you tend,\n\n46:48.340 --> 46:49.860\nit's like, your hand disappears.\n\n46:49.860 --> 46:51.020\nThen you start going, where am I?\n\n46:51.020 --> 46:53.060\nAnd you do these things as markers\n\n46:53.060 --> 46:54.820\nto feel as if you matter in the world,\n\n46:54.820 --> 46:56.980\nbecause you're trying to houdini into new stuff.\n\n46:56.980 --> 47:01.380\nIs it an oversimplification to say, OK,\n\n47:01.380 --> 47:04.220\nour families, God bless them.\n\n47:04.220 --> 47:06.180\nLet's not call them good people, bad people.\n\n47:06.180 --> 47:07.660\nLet's not blame them for anything.\n\n47:07.660 --> 47:09.380\nThey weren't filling.\n\n47:09.380 --> 47:11.660\nThey weren't paying off the credit card bill.\n\n47:11.660 --> 47:14.060\nMaybe they gave birth to people with bigger needs\n\n47:14.060 --> 47:14.820\nthat they could fill.\n\n47:14.820 --> 47:17.500\nBut in any case, everybody that I talk to,\n\n47:17.500 --> 47:20.420\nthat in our line of work in general,\n\n47:20.420 --> 47:22.940\nthey seemed to come back around to their early memories\n\n47:22.940 --> 47:26.460\nof the parents weren't filling the bucket,\n\n47:26.460 --> 47:28.300\nand then company would come over.\n\n47:28.300 --> 47:30.660\nAnd all of my friends were the kids\n\n47:30.660 --> 47:32.540\nthat would run out in their pajamas,\n\n47:32.540 --> 47:35.460\nand they would make an ass of themselves,\n\n47:35.460 --> 47:37.500\nand they just loved.\n\n47:37.500 --> 47:38.420\nIs it attention?\n\n47:38.420 --> 47:40.220\nIs it an oversimplification to say\n\n47:40.220 --> 47:44.580\nthat what you're talking about is that attention is needed?\n\n47:44.580 --> 47:46.460\nI'll take you one deeper.\n\n47:46.460 --> 47:48.460\nDistinction.\n\n47:48.460 --> 47:49.740\nI need distinction.\n\n47:49.740 --> 47:52.500\nBut distinction is defined by strangers or not,\n\n47:52.500 --> 47:54.700\nbecause it seems like you could be in your garage knowing\n\n47:54.700 --> 47:56.300\nyou're distinct.\n\n47:56.300 --> 48:01.380\nYou have trophies and the ego and the self-confidence to know.\n\n48:01.380 --> 48:03.340\nYou could sit on a desert island and know\n\n48:03.340 --> 48:06.300\nthat you're better, that you could win a guitar contest.\n\n48:06.300 --> 48:10.940\nThat I always tell people, when they ask about empirical talent\n\n48:10.940 --> 48:13.300\nlevel, I'm like, if this were tennis,\n\n48:13.300 --> 48:15.220\nI don't know the ranking, but I would definitely\n\n48:15.220 --> 48:17.540\nbe at the open.\n\n48:17.540 --> 48:19.060\nThat's as far as I can understand it,\n\n48:19.060 --> 48:20.660\nis that I'd be at the US Open.\n\n48:20.660 --> 48:21.980\nI don't know where I'd come in.\n\n48:21.980 --> 48:23.380\nI don't know if I'd place.\n\n48:23.380 --> 48:24.380\nI don't know if that's a tennis place.\n\n48:24.380 --> 48:26.620\nSo you know that, so what's that distinction?\n\n48:26.620 --> 48:28.740\nThat's what you're talking about, being distinct, is that?\n\n48:28.740 --> 48:29.500\nWell, I got it now.\n\n48:29.500 --> 48:31.460\nI mean, when I was a kid, that's what I wanted.\n\n48:31.460 --> 48:33.620\nI mean, the thing about music is, I guess,\n\n48:33.620 --> 48:35.900\nthe same thing with animating, not trying to put it\n\n48:35.900 --> 48:36.980\nin your wheelhouse too much.\n\n48:36.980 --> 48:37.780\nI know you're not animating.\n\n48:37.780 --> 48:39.460\nWell, I'm certainly taking a lot of liberties\n\n48:39.460 --> 48:43.260\ncomparing us so you can do whatever you want.\n\n48:43.260 --> 48:45.900\nFor music, you can hear yourself do the thing.\n\n48:45.900 --> 48:47.980\nI mean, for me, it came a lot.\n\n48:47.980 --> 48:51.940\nIt resembled very much the alter ego, the superhero thing.\n\n48:51.940 --> 48:53.220\nTraining in your room.\n\n48:53.220 --> 48:56.420\nI mean, I have a great, great, great sense\n\n48:56.420 --> 49:00.500\nmemory of tonight being like everyone's at this party.\n\n49:00.500 --> 49:03.860\nAnd I was told maybe there'd be room in the Jetta.\n\n49:03.860 --> 49:06.700\nSo Ryan has a Jetta.\n\n49:06.700 --> 49:10.580\nAnd then Ryan said, sorry, I got no more seats in the Jetta.\n\n49:10.580 --> 49:12.300\nAnd I'm like, cool, cool.\n\n49:12.300 --> 49:14.460\nAnd I know right now that everybody's at the party.\n\n49:14.460 --> 49:17.140\nAnd I imagine if I weren't sitting here talking to you,\n\n49:17.140 --> 49:19.380\nI would be in my bathroom playing a guitar pretending\n\n49:19.380 --> 49:20.940\nI was at the party.\n\n49:20.940 --> 49:21.940\nBecause I like it.\n\n49:21.940 --> 49:23.380\nThere's something about it.\n\n49:23.380 --> 49:26.980\nI like, I relate it in the 80s to Teen Wolf.\n\n49:26.980 --> 49:28.780\nDifferentiation, distinction.\n\n49:28.780 --> 49:30.900\nHe's the only one, except for that,\n\n49:30.900 --> 49:31.900\nfor getting into Teen Wolf.\n\n49:31.900 --> 49:39.300\nI want to be honest and say what I don't quite get.\n\n49:39.300 --> 49:41.340\nI want to go back over that.\n\n49:41.340 --> 49:43.900\nThe Jetta metaphor, that didn't happen tonight.\n\n49:43.900 --> 49:46.060\nYou're talking about a memory.\n\n49:46.060 --> 49:48.540\nYeah, no.\n\n49:48.540 --> 49:50.340\nI'm not a man of distinction this evening.\n\n49:50.340 --> 49:53.860\nThe image of you in the bathroom by yourself\n\n49:53.860 --> 49:55.580\nwhen you're not at the party playing guitar,\n\n49:55.580 --> 50:02.100\nthat's an important because I don't know.\n\n50:02.100 --> 50:03.980\nMaybe you're five years younger than me.\n\n50:03.980 --> 50:06.980\nSo I don't know.\n\n50:06.980 --> 50:10.140\nA lot of shit can change in a couple of years.\n\n50:10.140 --> 50:11.820\nAnd I know that I was prolific.\n\n50:11.820 --> 50:14.340\nI know that I would fucking write for no reason.\n\n50:14.340 --> 50:15.540\nI remember that.\n\n50:15.540 --> 50:23.580\nBut I look at musicians because it involves a piece of lumber\n\n50:23.580 --> 50:25.700\nand lessons and things.\n\n50:25.700 --> 50:32.340\nAnd when you say that you would really do it by yourself,\n\n50:32.340 --> 50:34.580\nI'm so curious about that because are you\n\n50:34.580 --> 50:36.660\nsearching for something when you do it by yourself?\n\n50:36.660 --> 50:41.500\nWhen you do you plunk out little melodies and like?\n\n50:41.500 --> 50:42.900\nYeah, you do it.\n\n50:42.900 --> 50:46.020\nI do it to make sure that it's still there.\n\n50:46.020 --> 50:50.780\nIf you could fly, OK, why in the comic books,\n\n50:50.780 --> 50:53.980\nand this is a new thought, is Superman occasionally not\n\n50:53.980 --> 50:56.860\njust levitating a little bit?\n\n50:56.860 --> 50:58.500\nIf you were Superman, wouldn't you\n\n50:58.500 --> 51:01.460\nfigure out a way to just like, just like a person\n\n51:01.460 --> 51:03.620\nand be like, Superman, can you please not do that?\n\n51:03.620 --> 51:04.620\nI'm trying to talk to you.\n\n51:04.620 --> 51:06.780\nMaybe it's the thing he does when he's bored with a story.\n\n51:06.780 --> 51:08.580\nJust goes up a foot and a half.\n\n51:08.580 --> 51:13.860\nAnd for me, I feel like if I was told by myself and others\n\n51:13.860 --> 51:16.460\nthat I'm able to perform this act,\n\n51:16.460 --> 51:19.100\nI have a system inside of me that does it.\n\n51:19.100 --> 51:21.060\nI need to do it every once in a while\n\n51:21.060 --> 51:23.900\nto see the system at work so I can remember, oh,\n\n51:23.900 --> 51:27.060\nthe reason that I'm in this whole affair is because of that.\n\n51:27.060 --> 51:28.900\nAnd that always sort of brings me back.\n\n51:28.900 --> 51:31.300\nI mean, we're talking about the impetus\n\n51:31.300 --> 51:33.700\nfor doing this with your hand.\n\n51:33.700 --> 51:35.300\nPick a note, pick a place.\n\n51:35.300 --> 51:36.820\nIt's total freedom.\n\n51:36.820 --> 51:38.420\nPlay it, hear yourself play it.\n\n51:38.420 --> 51:40.580\nSo you can sit down and play guitar\n\n51:40.580 --> 51:41.940\nfrom a lot of different angles.\n\n51:41.940 --> 51:43.540\nSome of it can be like, fuck you.\n\n51:43.540 --> 51:46.140\nAlthough I don't do that very often because I'm very blessed.\n\n51:46.140 --> 51:47.820\nBut sometimes, sometimes I get in.\n\n51:47.820 --> 51:50.300\nAnd if I were sitting in my hotel room tonight,\n\n51:50.300 --> 51:53.220\nI might have made a little smirk in the mirror\n\n51:53.220 --> 51:55.940\nand pretended I was at whatever venue the Grammys are at tonight.\n\n51:55.940 --> 51:56.460\nI don't know.\n\n51:56.460 --> 51:59.060\nBut I think to stay in touch with that\n\n51:59.060 --> 52:02.140\nis what keeps you healthy and writing great music\n\n52:02.140 --> 52:05.220\nthat you desperately want people to hear.\n\n52:05.220 --> 52:09.060\nDoes doing your music live also sort of keep those demons at bay?\n\n52:09.060 --> 52:10.060\nOh, yeah.\n\n52:10.060 --> 52:12.820\nAnd it taught me how to make records.\n\n52:12.820 --> 52:15.180\nIt's hard to argue with thousands of people.\n\n52:15.180 --> 52:17.140\nIf you're feeling shitty that day,\n\n52:17.140 --> 52:19.180\nit sort of helps to be doing it live, right?\n\n52:19.180 --> 52:20.740\nSo that's why people stay on tour.\n\n52:20.740 --> 52:23.740\nThey don't like traveling.\n\n52:23.740 --> 52:25.460\nInteresting.\n\n52:25.460 --> 52:27.140\nSo I'll tell you a little bit about my life.\n\n52:27.140 --> 52:30.300\nRecently, I came off tour after a full year of touring.\n\n52:30.300 --> 52:33.500\nAnd I decided no tour for a minute, no plans for a minute.\n\n52:33.500 --> 52:35.860\nFigure it out, build a life.\n\n52:35.860 --> 52:37.380\nAnd 40 didn't freak me out.\n\n52:37.380 --> 52:39.420\nBut it was like, OK, this is a real thing.\n\n52:39.420 --> 52:40.740\nIt's a real benchmark.\n\n52:40.740 --> 52:42.660\nAnd so I bought a house.\n\n52:42.660 --> 52:45.180\nIt's been a while before I moved into it, but I got that.\n\n52:45.180 --> 52:46.980\nAnd I'm living in a hotel.\n\n52:46.980 --> 52:50.140\nAnd I realized that I have no life.\n\n52:50.140 --> 52:52.860\nNow, you could say tiny violins, but it's a good life.\n\n52:52.860 --> 52:55.260\nBut I have no life outside of touring.\n\n52:55.260 --> 52:59.700\nIf I had a grid on a spiral-bound itinerary book,\n\n52:59.700 --> 53:01.660\nwe don't even talk about life in time.\n\n53:01.660 --> 53:02.780\nWe talk about it in place.\n\n53:02.780 --> 53:05.580\nWe say things like, that's not until Dallas.\n\n53:05.580 --> 53:06.500\nThere's no time.\n\n53:06.500 --> 53:07.820\nIt's just place.\n\n53:07.820 --> 53:09.780\nWell, that's not until California.\n\n53:09.780 --> 53:11.820\nWell, back in Denver.\n\n53:11.820 --> 53:15.180\nAnd so my life only lived inside of that framework.\n\n53:15.180 --> 53:16.500\nAnd I took it away.\n\n53:16.500 --> 53:18.940\nAnd I don't have anything to do.\n\n53:18.940 --> 53:20.340\nAnd it's freaky.\n\n53:20.340 --> 53:21.140\nIt's hard.\n\n53:21.140 --> 53:22.420\nAnd I go, good.\n\n53:22.420 --> 53:23.420\nFight from there.\n\n53:23.420 --> 53:24.220\nStart from there.\n\n53:24.220 --> 53:25.860\nThat's why I'm bumming around the city.\n\n53:25.860 --> 53:27.020\nThat's why I ran into you today.\n\n53:27.020 --> 53:28.700\nThat's why I went, yeah, I'm not doing anything.\n\n53:28.700 --> 53:30.140\nI took an Uber here.\n\n53:30.140 --> 53:31.820\nI wish we could help each other.\n\n53:31.820 --> 53:34.340\nBut maybe we could just commiserate.\n\n53:34.340 --> 53:37.740\nBut I think there's a key difference between us,\n\n53:37.740 --> 53:41.100\nnot that I was searching for symmetry.\n\n53:41.100 --> 53:45.100\nBut I think it's important, because I'm searching myself.\n\n53:45.100 --> 53:51.140\nI'm going, it makes me insecure to hear you talk about being\n\n53:51.140 --> 53:56.300\nalone and working your craft.\n\n53:56.300 --> 53:59.780\nAnd I think musicians make me insecure for that reason,\n\n53:59.780 --> 54:01.660\nbecause that is something they do.\n\n54:01.660 --> 54:06.540\nAnd the part of a musician's career that I can relate to\n\n54:06.540 --> 54:11.340\nis the touring part, because that is a musician saying,\n\n54:11.340 --> 54:15.180\nas Dorothy Parker said, I don't like writing.\n\n54:15.180 --> 54:16.620\nI like having written.\n\n54:16.620 --> 54:20.420\nAnd a musician on tour is they're not\n\n54:20.420 --> 54:22.060\ngoing to say, thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n54:22.060 --> 54:23.580\nfor coming to this stadium.\n\n54:23.580 --> 54:26.860\nI'd like to write a song in front of you.\n\n54:26.860 --> 54:29.220\nThey can have their own religion about the songs they've\n\n54:29.220 --> 54:31.100\nwritten and the stuff they want to play from their old album,\n\n54:31.100 --> 54:35.180\nbut ultimately, it's like they're just,\n\n54:35.180 --> 54:36.980\nthat's what I can relate to.\n\n54:36.980 --> 54:39.780\nI feel like that's how I spend my life.\n\n54:39.780 --> 54:41.980\nBut there's something fucked up about that,\n\n54:41.980 --> 54:45.580\nbecause, and I worry about that, like I go, fuck,\n\n54:45.580 --> 54:48.740\nwhen's the last time you actually tested yourself?\n\n54:48.740 --> 54:52.420\nWhen's the last time you sat in a bathroom while the Grammys\n\n54:52.420 --> 54:53.860\nparty was happening?\n\n54:53.860 --> 54:57.140\nI don't go home and write a story.\n\n54:57.140 --> 54:58.940\nI play a video game.\n\n54:58.940 --> 55:00.380\nI watch forensic files.\n\n55:00.380 --> 55:03.260\nI don't want, I don't, I look at writing\n\n55:03.260 --> 55:05.460\nas like this thing that I do.\n\n55:05.460 --> 55:08.860\nLike it's like shitting a fucking egg.\n\n55:08.860 --> 55:10.420\nI look at that with songwriting.\n\n55:10.420 --> 55:11.660\nI look at it that way with songwriting.\n\n55:11.660 --> 55:13.620\nBut it's just disembodied guitar playing,\n\n55:13.620 --> 55:17.180\nI just think it's the greatest thing in the world.\n\n55:17.180 --> 55:20.860\nBut I wonder if I had spent, because how long would you\n\n55:20.860 --> 55:23.460\nknow, I don't know, like this is probably\n\n55:23.460 --> 55:24.620\na difficult question to answer.\n\n55:24.620 --> 55:28.100\nBut how long does your career really span?\n\n55:28.100 --> 55:31.660\nLike how old were you when, the first time someone said,\n\n55:31.660 --> 55:33.340\nJesus Christ, what the fuck?\n\n55:33.340 --> 55:34.900\n14.\n\n55:34.900 --> 55:38.180\nSo I feel like if I had spent, you know,\n\n55:38.180 --> 55:40.740\nlike somewhere around there, somebody said, like, you know,\n\n55:40.740 --> 55:42.220\nyou're really good at writing essays.\n\n55:42.220 --> 55:44.580\nYou should be on the high school paper or whatever.\n\n55:44.580 --> 55:48.340\nLike somewhere in our lives, somebody says,\n\n55:48.340 --> 55:52.940\nhey, you could get what you want by what you got.\n\n55:52.940 --> 55:59.420\nAnd when I talk to musicians, I get insecure,\n\n55:59.420 --> 56:02.940\nbecause I feel like I'm not, I don't practice.\n\n56:02.940 --> 56:04.260\nWell, I don't know that I practice.\n\n56:04.260 --> 56:06.660\nI think I just check up on it.\n\n56:06.660 --> 56:08.140\nYou know, I mean, you're talking.\n\n56:08.140 --> 56:09.100\nBut you write songs.\n\n56:09.100 --> 56:09.620\nYou talk.\n\n56:09.620 --> 56:10.620\nYou have conversations.\n\n56:10.620 --> 56:13.580\nYou going out and sitting in a coffee shop is practice.\n\n56:13.580 --> 56:15.700\nYou literally just practiced for the last five minutes\n\n56:15.700 --> 56:16.060\nstraight.\n\n56:16.060 --> 56:17.060\nThat was just riffing.\n\n56:17.060 --> 56:19.940\nWell, maybe that's why this, you know, maybe.\n\n56:19.940 --> 56:20.780\nThis is that.\n\n56:20.780 --> 56:24.780\nI go in and do it to make sure that it's still there,\n\n56:24.780 --> 56:29.020\nbecause if it's not, my entire argument for life is failed.\n\n56:29.020 --> 56:34.140\nLike someone said to me one time, a great lady\n\n56:34.140 --> 56:35.860\nworked in publishing.\n\n56:35.860 --> 56:39.780\nShe said to me, John, can you imagine being famous\n\n56:39.780 --> 56:42.180\nand knowing you're not talented?\n\n56:42.180 --> 56:43.660\nAnd I just went, whoa.\n\n56:43.660 --> 56:45.900\nAnd I'll never fail to put the fear of God into me.\n\n56:45.900 --> 56:50.340\nAnd when things get a little pear-shaped,\n\n56:50.340 --> 56:53.100\nor they get, or it's not even any more like,\n\n56:53.100 --> 56:53.940\nthings are too intense.\n\n56:53.940 --> 56:56.540\nDo you think anybody famous knows that they're not talented?\n\n56:56.540 --> 56:57.420\nYeah.\n\n56:57.420 --> 57:00.380\nThose people would be self-actualized.\n\n57:00.380 --> 57:02.820\nLike, I think fame makes you feel.\n\n57:02.820 --> 57:03.940\nThat's a really good question.\n\n57:03.940 --> 57:06.740\nWhere is the awareness?\n\n57:06.740 --> 57:10.780\nYeah, I mean, well, if I can't figure it out,\n\n57:10.780 --> 57:13.300\nthen how could an untalented person figure it out?\n\n57:13.300 --> 57:14.700\nYou could know it's for them.\n\n57:14.700 --> 57:19.980\nIf everyone is chanting at you, Donald, Donald, Donald.\n\n57:19.980 --> 57:21.420\nI riffed a name.\n\n57:21.420 --> 57:24.180\nYou'd be like, well, I must be good at something.\n\n57:24.180 --> 57:26.220\nI'm good at getting people to shout Donald.\n\n57:26.220 --> 57:27.660\nI think the entire thing.\n\n57:27.660 --> 57:31.060\nBut then nobody else that you like likes you.\n\n57:31.060 --> 57:31.900\nThat's how you know.\n\n57:31.900 --> 57:34.500\nYeah, but I think we're talking about like,\n\n57:34.500 --> 57:36.340\nSmash Mouth, or I don't know what.\n\n57:36.340 --> 57:39.700\nI don't have enough musical.\n\n57:39.700 --> 57:41.700\nIf you told me, Smash Mouth's fucking great.\n\n57:41.700 --> 57:43.460\nFuck you, you snob.\n\n57:43.460 --> 57:45.220\nI'd be like, OK, John Mayer.\n\n57:45.220 --> 57:49.780\nBut I just felt like bands that come\n\n57:49.780 --> 57:51.220\nin and out of nowhere or whatever\n\n57:51.220 --> 57:52.820\nto keep it in the musical realm.\n\n57:52.820 --> 57:55.660\nAnd they're like, oh, my god, they're amazing.\n\n57:55.660 --> 57:57.540\nThey got a hit on the Billboard charts.\n\n57:57.540 --> 58:01.700\nAnd we all go, or my music snob friends go, they're not shit.\n\n58:01.700 --> 58:02.740\nThey're not talented.\n\n58:02.740 --> 58:04.660\nThat's three power chords or whatever.\n\n58:04.660 --> 58:07.660\nDo you think those guys are like,\n\n58:07.660 --> 58:09.500\nthey know they're untalented?\n\n58:09.500 --> 58:11.140\nI don't think they know they're untalented.\n\n58:11.140 --> 58:13.300\nI think they're like, holy shit, we fucking hit it.\n\n58:13.300 --> 58:15.180\nI think we're talking about varying degrees\n\n58:15.180 --> 58:16.620\nof knowing you're untalented.\n\n58:16.620 --> 58:18.300\nI think they're all shades of the same thing.\n\n58:18.300 --> 58:20.180\nBy the way, the way your mind works,\n\n58:20.180 --> 58:22.460\nvery interesting because it's kind of like a Wonderland\n\n58:22.460 --> 58:24.140\nand you don't need to say it.\n\n58:24.140 --> 58:25.780\nBut I want to give you some.\n\n58:25.780 --> 58:29.340\nBut if you say it before the end of the show, it'll be a quote.\n\n58:29.340 --> 58:29.700\nI will.\n\n58:29.700 --> 58:31.260\nIs there a drinking game going on tonight?\n\n58:31.260 --> 58:34.220\nNo, it's just more of an achievement on my end.\n\n58:34.220 --> 58:35.060\nCan I do it now?\n\n58:35.060 --> 58:36.140\nWe can get it out of the way.\n\n58:36.140 --> 58:37.740\nIf you look, I didn't fish for it.\n\n58:37.740 --> 58:40.380\nBut if you want to say it, yeah, you didn't fish for it at all.\n\n58:40.380 --> 58:43.380\nYou find it interesting that a singer is just not singing\n\n58:43.380 --> 58:44.420\nright now and is just talking.\n\n58:44.420 --> 58:48.060\nLike the same in here is the ability to sing at any moment.\n\n58:48.060 --> 58:49.020\nAnd I'm not.\n\n58:49.020 --> 58:51.140\nI'm just talking, if you thought about this before.\n\n58:51.140 --> 58:53.180\nI've been thinking this whole time it's pretty weird\n\n58:53.180 --> 58:54.380\nhow he's not singing.\n\n58:54.380 --> 58:55.860\nYou know what I mean?\n\n58:55.860 --> 58:57.660\nNo, but when you're around a singer, you're like,\n\n58:57.660 --> 58:59.820\nthat singing voice is not doing its thing.\n\n58:59.820 --> 59:02.860\nIt's just talking.\n\n59:02.860 --> 59:04.780\nI guess I hadn't thought about that.\n\n59:04.780 --> 59:07.660\nOh, I think about it all the time.\n\n59:07.660 --> 59:10.860\nAre you right now thinking it's weird that you're not singing?\n\n59:10.860 --> 59:13.140\nNow I think it's weird that I can sing.\n\n59:13.140 --> 59:14.060\nI'm just not singing.\n\n59:14.060 --> 59:16.780\nYeah.\n\n59:16.780 --> 59:19.380\nA more naive person would think you were teeing up\n\n59:19.380 --> 59:21.100\na kind of musical number.\n\n59:21.100 --> 59:24.180\nI am, because when I do, it'll be fun.\n\n59:24.180 --> 59:25.420\nYou'll be like, that's right.\n\n59:25.420 --> 59:28.380\nThat was in that guy's throat the whole time.\n\n59:28.380 --> 59:30.620\nWell, what do we do?\n\n59:30.620 --> 59:32.500\nSo here I am talking.\n\n59:32.500 --> 59:33.860\nI'm a person who's talking.\n\n59:33.860 --> 59:36.500\nAnd at any moment that I want, I can go,\n\n59:36.500 --> 59:39.500\nyour mind is a wanderland.\n\n59:39.500 --> 59:41.820\nAnd then all of a sudden, I just start talking again.\n\n59:41.820 --> 59:43.860\nPeople wouldn't know that you were talking about me.\n\n59:43.860 --> 59:46.340\nSo if I was in the lyrics, see, this is.\n\n59:46.340 --> 59:48.140\nOK, it's a lot of cadence here.\n\n59:48.140 --> 59:49.140\nHold on a second.\n\n59:49.140 --> 59:51.540\nDan Harmon's mind is a wanderland.\n\n59:51.540 --> 59:53.700\nWell, you kind of said the Dan Harmon song.\n\n59:53.700 --> 59:56.460\nDan Harmon's mind is a wanderland.\n\n59:56.460 --> 59:58.060\nOK, well, that's.\n\n59:58.060 --> 59:59.740\nYeah, you don't have to take notes.\n\n59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.420\nLook at my face.\n\n01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.780\nThank you.\n\n01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.060\nAnd I'm talking, and I'm singing, and I'm talking,\n\n01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.020\nand I'm singing, and I'm talking.\n\n01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:07.860\nIsn't it strange?\n\n01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.380\nI think it's kind of strange.\n\n01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.300\nIt's weird that I could do it at any moment.\n\n01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.620\nI just choose not to.\n\n01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.020\nIt's a little Robert Klein in it, little Robert Klein.\n\n01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.580\nWhat are the things that hurt you?\n\n01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.820\nIn terms of this cloud of people,\n\n01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.860\nI get the sense from you that, I don't know.\n\n01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.820\nWhat are the adjectives that you wish?\n\n01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.500\nForget about whether or not you've\n\n01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.820\ncome to terms with the fact that you can't control people.\n\n01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.180\nBut what are the adjectives about you\n\n01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.700\nthat get used that really sting?\n\n01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:57.980\nWomanizer, douchebag, anything from the past.\n\n01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.660\nI find that right now, especially with the ability\n\n01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:05.140\nto consolidate tons of information really quickly,\n\n01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.500\nthe blind spot is how we deal with past.\n\n01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.260\nAnd I think everyone should be allowed a past\n\n01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.300\nas a blanket statement.\n\n01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.260\nI'm not defending anything overall.\n\n01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:19.620\nBut things as they exist in the past are the,\n\n01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.220\nis the sort of, that's the gun to my head\n\n01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.780\nin the hostage standoff between my happiness\n\n01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.140\nand feeling like I've got to dig out of a hole.\n\n01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:31.100\nAnd I find that the internet is fantastic at compiling\n\n01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.620\na dossier on you that fast.\n\n01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.900\nWith one comment, all it is is someone\n\n01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:39.900\nwho just won't let something go, or the last big signifying\n\n01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.020\npiece of information they had about you was negative.\n\n01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.340\nIf I ask, we don't know, unless we\n\n01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.780\nGoogle them to find out what their news is,\n\n01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.180\nwe don't know the goings on of everybody all day.\n\n01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.900\nAnd that's the mistake we make sometimes.\n\n01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.860\nSo people might not have had an updated take on me\n\n01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.580\nsince 2010.\n\n01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.020\nAnd I find it so disorienting.\n\n01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.860\nI find it such a distortion field of reality\n\n01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.420\nwhen I'm living my life in a way that I know is fair and kind\n\n01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:09.780\nand good and advanced and improved\n\n01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:15.340\nand finally together to have your past sort of brought\n\n01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.860\nto you again in what feels like really\n\n01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.660\nstark current clarity.\n\n01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.500\nYou have to really go, that's not true.\n\n01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.500\nSo you know what I'm saying?\n\n01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.380\nYeah, somebody rehashes it to build their website.\n\n01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.140\nSomebody pulls something up from 10 years ago.\n\n01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.740\nSomewhere in a comment thing, and you'll go up,\n\n01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.580\nand it'll just, in the middle of a great thing,\n\n01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:38.380\na great picture and a great thing and having a great moment.\n\n01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.340\nAnd it took me a really long time\n\n01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.340\nto get to the point where I can be like,\n\n01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.700\nget over it, not true.\n\n01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.660\nGet over it, grow up, it's not true.\n\n01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.060\nBut that's how you can get me is show me\n\n01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:53.340\nwhat feels like a threatening reemergence of my past.\n\n01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.900\nAnd it'll stop me, although lately I've\n\n01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.860\nfound a way to just practice looking at it and going,\n\n01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:02.460\nlong time ago, dude, come on, come on, let's carry on.\n\n01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.620\nThis might be your fault now that you're still bringing this up.\n\n01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.180\nThis might actually now be on you.\n\n01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.300\nI had a thing a couple days ago not\n\n01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.420\nto embarrass my girlfriend, but she was doing something\n\n01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.180\nthat I haven't done in five years, which\n\n01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:23.900\nis peruse the Harmontown subreddit.\n\n01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:31.340\nAnd I had this Me Too surfing expedition recently.\n\n01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:35.420\nI'm giving my master classes and apologies as we speak.\n\n01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:40.740\nBut I live, I survive whatever.\n\n01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.820\nAnd my girlfriend was in this subreddit\n\n01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.140\nwhere I haven't gone since way before that because no matter\n\n01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.980\nwhat, I'm not going to see anything there that's\n\n01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.140\ngoing to make me happy.\n\n01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.740\nI'll see a million things that might make me happy,\n\n01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.260\nbut I'll be numb to those things.\n\n01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.420\nAnd then one person will be like,\n\n01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.020\nI wonder if I could really fucking black this guy's\n\n01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.020\neye from this far.\n\n01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.420\nAnd that should be their domain.\n\n01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.820\nBut the weird thing is, and it's like,\n\n01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.180\nyou think you resolve this shit.\n\n01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:15.540\nAnd then I had this little, it was just a little episode\n\n01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.620\nbecause Cody got upset.\n\n01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.780\nAnd she sent me a screen grab of an exchange\n\n01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.580\nshe was having with a troll in that group\n\n01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.980\nand had to do with all this shit.\n\n01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.860\nAnd I got upset with her.\n\n01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.500\nAnd now our seam is broken.\n\n01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.660\nWe're not on the same page.\n\n01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:35.500\nAnd then I'm expressing to a writer friend of mine\n\n01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.180\nwho I'm working with in that room,\n\n01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.380\nI'm explaining the story to her.\n\n01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.980\nI'm like, this is happening and it's bad.\n\n01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.380\nAnd that writer, Leslie, is going,\n\n01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.900\nwell, I understand where she's coming from\n\n01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.940\nbecause I did this and that.\n\n01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.460\nAnd I'm telling this is all back straight\n\n01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:56.260\nto this moment that was actually genuinely weird for me.\n\n01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.980\nA world where I keep thinking that I'm done learning\n\n01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.860\nand I just want to die.\n\n01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:05.700\nI, like, this writer that I respect\n\n01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.860\nwho's like talking to me, she goes, like,\n\n01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:11.100\nshe goes, well, you know, and look, we all Google ourselves.\n\n01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.820\nAnd I exploded.\n\n01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:20.060\nI was like, no, we don't all Google ourselves.\n\n01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:24.140\nI literally cannot Google myself.\n\n01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.900\nDo you understand?\n\n01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.860\nDo any of you people understand what it's like\n\n01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.580\nto be unable to Google yourself?\n\n01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.420\nYes, I do.\n\n01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:42.140\nIt's a guilty pleasure for you when you wish you were famous,\n\n01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:47.300\nwhen you hope maybe, when you think about how shitty it might\n\n01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.020\nbe, when you get to the point where you are choking\n\n01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.340\non your own name, when you don't want\n\n01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.780\nto see your own face.\n\n01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.460\nI do not Google myself and have not.\n\n01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.740\nStop putting me in that drawer.\n\n01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:06.900\nAnd I wound down, I'm like, oh, shit, I got unresolved.\n\n01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.180\nThat's like when somebody accused you of masturbating\n\n01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.060\nas a kid and you really weren't.\n\n01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.060\nYeah.\n\n01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.260\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.420\nYes, especially.\n\n01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.700\nYes, John, yeah.\n\n01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:18.420\nThat's my entire childhood.\n\n01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.260\nI jerked off so many times when no one said anything.\n\n01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.460\nAnd then I spent too long doing my own laundry.\n\n01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:25.860\nAnd I come upstairs and my mom goes,\n\n01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.300\nreading, plead, playboy, magazines, much,\n\n01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.820\nstop, get out of my pants.\n\n01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.060\nI was drying my clothes.\n\n01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:31.980\nExactly what it is.\n\n01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.460\nYou want to know when I jerked off?\n\n01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.660\nIt was right behind you.\n\n01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.780\nYep.\n\n01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.740\nYep, right behind.\n\n01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.700\nBut yeah, I can't know.\n\n01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:42.540\nBut it was like, the weird thing is that I just jumped\n\n01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:48.340\non this woman because she was accidentally confusing me\n\n01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.420\nwith someone who googled themselves.\n\n01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.620\nI quit googling myself.\n\n01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.020\nI think a lot of celebrities quit googling themselves.\n\n01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.780\nIt doesn't offer any really good information.\n\n01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.020\nIt gives you a really bad cross-section of what's happening.\n\n01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.820\nIt's like you're not really pulling out what's really\n\n01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:05.660\nin the river.\n\n01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.060\nIt's only the money-making headlines.\n\n01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:07.780\nYeah, it's a weird.\n\n01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.340\nLook at what the fuck the river is, though.\n\n01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.260\nWell, now that's what I want to make sure\n\n01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.900\nwe talk about before whenever this thing is over, is over.\n\n01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.180\nYou made it sound a little bit like you're not enjoying it.\n\n01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:20.660\nNo, I am, but my well, so what I do now\n\n01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.060\nis I haven't googled myself in three, four years.\n\n01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.820\nBut when I told you this today, when\n\n01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.540\nI want to see something specific, a certain guitar\n\n01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:29.780\nthat I'm coming out with or something,\n\n01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.740\nI'll put the name of the guitar in first and then my name\n\n01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.980\nbecause I can't even bear to watch the autofill happen.\n\n01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.660\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.580\nSo and if I do, I just go, brah, brah, brah,\n\n01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.780\nJohn Mayer, PRS guitar.\n\n01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.460\nBecause I can't see what comes up like that.\n\n01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.060\nIt might be one of the words that I've mentioned.\n\n01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.980\nI don't know if I've shaken the Chevy Chase\n\n01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.820\nsyphilis from my autofill or not.\n\n01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.460\nI don't know.\n\n01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.060\nWell, that's just.\n\n01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.860\nBecause I won't look.\n\n01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.100\nI will literally, people think I'm joking.\n\n01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.860\nI'll close my eyes if there's some reason for me to type Dan.\n\n01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.300\nBecause it goes back to the past thing.\n\n01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.620\nAnd it goes like that until I finish typing.\n\n01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.940\nWhat should fucking happen online\n\n01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.540\nis that every year, everything that had ever\n\n01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.260\nbeen posted to the internet that is not\n\n01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.340\nsort of textual in a reference sense should blur.\n\n01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.580\nEvery year, it should blur 10%.\n\n01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.460\nSo that when you see an old story,\n\n01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.420\nwhen you see someone's old point of view, you can go,\n\n01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.740\nyeah, but it was pretty blurry.\n\n01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.060\nI couldn't make most of it out.\n\n01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.140\nBecause that's what happens in people's minds,\n\n01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.780\nin their hearts.\n\n01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.340\nThings blur over time.\n\n01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.220\nYeah, and I feel compelled to stop here and go, by the way.\n\n01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.620\nIt looks like because they just were not complaining.\n\n01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:35.260\nThey were not saying what was me.\n\n01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.500\nWe're talking about an island that you don't even\n\n01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.500\nknow if you're listening, whether or not\n\n01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.540\nyou want to get there.\n\n01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:48.500\nAnd I never signed up for a, I guess\n\n01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.180\nI always just thought the more attention you get, the better.\n\n01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:54.940\nThe more MySpace friends you have, the better.\n\n01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.700\nEvery metric is just like, well, you want more and not less.\n\n01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:04.460\nI want to go back in time and go, no, I'm artisanal.\n\n01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.140\nI want to squeeze it off and go, don't know me.\n\n01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.020\nI don't want strangers to know my name.\n\n01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.740\nWell, I do.\n\n01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.580\nAnd I think it's important to square up with that.\n\n01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.420\nAnd I think it's also important for anybody watching who's\n\n01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.180\na fan of either of ours.\n\n01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.060\nI think the one thing we haven't sort of laid out\n\n01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.780\nis, to what extent do we wrestle with this every day?\n\n01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.020\nWe haven't really given people context\n\n01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.380\nas to what fraction of our lives do we deal with this.\n\n01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:32.900\nThis is a very small, I want to say that I am magnifying\n\n01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.340\na very small experience.\n\n01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.100\nIt's 15% of the experience.\n\n01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.940\nAnd most of it, I almost want to say to the world,\n\n01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.180\ndon't worry, I'll handle it.\n\n01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.340\nAnd it's really handleable.\n\n01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:46.340\nWhat I find is interesting and sort of universal\n\n01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:52.580\nis how much we hand off to this voracious sort\n\n01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.860\nof invisible boa constrictor that just keeps consuming\n\n01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.580\nour thoughts that don't have a purpose.\n\n01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.100\nWaking up, I know you do the same thing.\n\n01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.740\nYou wake up and you read Twitter,\n\n01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:07.500\nand something seems to you to be so cognitively wrong.\n\n01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.540\nNot a bad opinion, not a bad idea,\n\n01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:12.300\nbut cognitively empirically wrong.\n\n01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.180\nAnd you stare at the blinds until it's\n\n01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.540\nseared into your eyes, the slats of light.\n\n01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.340\nAnd you haven't even gotten a coffee yet.\n\n01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:23.620\nAnd you're already trying to go, you're going, fuck.\n\n01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.820\nAnd you're trying to get out the knot in the necklace that\n\n01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.580\nis this whole thing.\n\n01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.580\nAnd the question is, how much are you\n\n01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.420\nwilling to trade of your life to do that, which seemingly\n\n01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.940\nhas no real actionable outcome, versus I'm just\n\n01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.740\ngoing to live a life to scale so that I can at least\n\n01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.980\nenjoy some of this stuff?\n\n01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.100\nThat's certainly what I've started.\n\n01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:45.980\nI came off Twitter.\n\n01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.260\nI got to enjoy my life.\n\n01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.500\nI feel like what Twitter is trying to do right now\n\n01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.780\nare basically like full court trick shots\n\n01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.220\ninstead of just like, let's just work off\n\n01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.220\nof basketball fundamentals.\n\n01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.820\nAnd every day is a failure to throw the ball off\n\n01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.780\nlike the McDonald's commercial.\n\n01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.660\nAnd it's like, well, we'll get them again tomorrow.\n\n01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.940\nThat's really interesting.\n\n01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.180\nAnd I go, why can't you piece this out?\n\n01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.900\nAnd the answer is because there's too many.\n\n01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.180\nIt's like, why can't you leave single file in an arena\n\n01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.380\nif someone screams fire?\n\n01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.620\nBecause there's chaos.\n\n01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.700\nBut you could get everybody out like that.\n\n01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.300\nIf you just went, row one, you're out.\n\n01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.100\nRow two, you're out.\n\n01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:25.620\nRow three.\n\n01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.180\nAnd so every day I watch the pile on.\n\n01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.220\nAnd I go, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.220\nAnd it's for things I'm allied with.\n\n01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.420\nBut I watch the course in which it takes.\n\n01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.940\nAnd I watch it every day.\n\n01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.660\nEvery day you wake up, it's a possibility\n\n01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.700\nthat we might get it.\n\n01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:43.020\nAnd within seconds you find out, no.\n\n01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.420\nAnd you find out there's people are getting trampled.\n\n01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.620\nThe only thing that nags at me is,\n\n01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.900\nhow do we know the difference between getting over 40\n\n01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.340\nand realizing that self-care is important\n\n01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.820\nand becoming old men saying, get off my line.\n\n01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.860\nI don't understand why the kids spend all their time online.\n\n01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:01.100\nI think the word that we're trying to get at is fatigue.\n\n01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.540\nThere is fatigue with each cycle.\n\n01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.460\nWith each cycle.\n\n01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.380\nThe difference is whether you're outputting.\n\n01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.260\nThe difference is whether we go into our bathrooms\n\n01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.700\nand play guitar and put stuff out.\n\n01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.180\nBecause if you say, get off Twitter, kids.\n\n01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:15.540\nI'm not on Twitter doing whatever the fuck you want.\n\n01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.220\nAnd you put out a single every month or whatever.\n\n01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.740\nIt's like, if you're exuding shit and people\n\n01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.300\nthat are on Twitter are not exuding shit,\n\n01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.780\nexcept for tweets, that's the answer to my question.\n\n01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.420\nBut I'll take you even deeper on fatigue.\n\n01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:31.300\nLet's go back to the play guitar in the bathroom thing.\n\n01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.620\nThere's fatigue in that.\n\n01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:40.900\n40 is not about some celebration of ordaining\n\n01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.500\nhow many years you've been alive for.\n\n01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.420\nIt's how long you've been doing, how your memory begins to,\n\n01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:50.020\nthe memory of being alive, the access you have to.\n\n01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.060\nThere's a certain fatigue where occasionally I'll say to myself,\n\n01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.740\njust about life in general, we still doing this?\n\n01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.460\nYeah.\n\n01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.180\nYou ever find yourself, you go, were you still at this?\n\n01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.620\nAnd it's not like we want to end this at all.\n\n01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.660\nYou just go, were you still at this?\n\n01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:06.740\nAnd the answer is, yep.\n\n01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.220\nAnd you go, OK.\n\n01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.100\nIt's like you see all the days line up.\n\n01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:18.060\nAnd you're like, yeah, I'm at 60,000 of 140,000.\n\n01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.140\nJust checking in.\n\n01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.900\nBut you don't even have to look at it in that numerical way.\n\n01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.740\nYou can just feel it.\n\n01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.100\nYou can kind of count cards without really counting cards.\n\n01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:26.700\nRight, for sure.\n\n01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.940\nYou just kind of feel it.\n\n01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.580\nIt's like, were you still at this?\n\n01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.060\nOK, what am I about to do?\n\n01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.740\nGo make another record.\n\n01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.700\nSo we're going to fight from scratch to have, yep.\n\n01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.740\nOK, and we're going to come home three out of four times\n\n01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.260\nwith nothing, with an empty net.\n\n01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:42.580\nWe're going to have to live off of something else that night?\n\n01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.300\nYep.\n\n01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.100\nWe're still at this.\n\n01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.020\nYep, why?\n\n01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.060\nIt's got to be that way.\n\n01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.780\nBecause it's all there is.\n\n01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.500\nBecause otherwise we won't sleep tonight.\n\n01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.260\nWe can't.\n\n01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.900\nIt won't work.\n\n01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.660\nLike I have to risk everything.\n\n01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.180\nI have to have everyone hate me.\n\n01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.500\nI have to do it.\n\n01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.060\nI have to prove something to myself.\n\n01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.820\nYeah.\n\n01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.700\nAnd where I think it gets really tricky\n\n01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:08.940\nis in relationship and family, getting a wife,\n\n01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:10.540\ngetting a girlfriend.\n\n01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:15.980\nThat takes a certain determination\n\n01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.300\nthat might not exist in my life like it should anymore.\n\n01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.660\nBecause my determination is taking\n\n01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:25.460\na natural dip, testosterone, determination.\n\n01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.300\nIt starts to just go down a little bit.\n\n01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.660\nOld jazz horn players don't play as long a line.\n\n01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:31.140\nYou know?\n\n01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:31.420\nThat's true.\n\n01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.180\nAnd vocalists do the same thing.\n\n01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:32.700\nVocalists.\n\n01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.580\nThey don't sing as like, oh, you guys\n\n01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.540\nused to burn on the saxophone with bop lines for four minutes.\n\n01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.500\nGo.\n\n01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.700\nBo-da-bo-da-bo-da.\n\n01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.700\nAnd everyone loves them.\n\n01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.140\nAnd everyone goes, that's the guy who used to burn.\n\n01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.260\nAnd I used to burn, and I'm trying to still burn.\n\n01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.340\nI think I've got two more burning things in me.\n\n01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.940\nThat's why I want to make sure I do on my next one.\n\n01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.140\nI feel like I have one more burn.\n\n01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.300\nYou have one more way to burn.\n\n01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.820\nYou motherfuckers wish.\n\n01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:55.980\nYou know, we don't get to say that.\n\n01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:56.780\nYou wish.\n\n01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.180\nWe don't get to say that.\n\n01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.500\nYou know, we wish we had like one or two burns.\n\n01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.340\nBut the truth is, the universe, whoever gave us the shit,\n\n01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.740\nis going to tell us when we get to stop burning.\n\n01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.900\nYou're going to find out mid-failed burn.\n\n01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.380\nHow many burns you got?\n\n01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:09.880\nYeah.\n\n01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.380\nFailed burn.\n\n01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.780\nBurn!\n\n01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.340\nThat's my first daughter's name.\n\n01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.380\nMid-fail burn.\n\n01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.100\nI wish I could retire.\n\n01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.580\nWe don't get to, you know, the deal.\n\n01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.500\nYeah.\n\n01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.020\nYou're going to be six burns in.\n\n01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:23.780\nYeah.\n\n01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.220\nI just mean like, and I agree.\n\n01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.820\nI'm not saying that's not what you're saying.\n\n01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.620\nBut I'll always be making records.\n\n01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:32.820\nBut like, burning things, like you listen to like 21 pilots.\n\n01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:33.980\nThat shit is burning.\n\n01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.740\nThat's a 21, 22-year-old kid who's got so many syllables.\n\n01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.060\nWhen you're young, you got syllables.\n\n01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:40.900\nSometimes I think too much.\n\n01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:41.900\nBa-ba-ba-da-da-da-da.\n\n01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.980\nI went and I had those thoughts.\n\n01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.220\nI wish somebody could bottle the smell.\n\n01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.620\nAnd they were like, I had those thoughts.\n\n01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.220\nI went that close to the wallpaper.\n\n01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:51.420\nAnd those are the kids that we send to war and convince to.\n\n01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:51.900\nYeah.\n\n01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.420\nDark is fun, Dan.\n\n01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.860\nThey're brains are on fire and we go, yeah, fuck you.\n\n01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.180\nYou're a child that you need to be.\n\n01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:01.660\nBut I did it.\n\n01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.900\nI went from, welcome to the real, what she said to me,\n\n01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:06.540\ncondescendingly, take a seat, take your life, blot it out.\n\n01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.580\nAnd we're not even halfway through the verse.\n\n01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.580\nNot even halfway through the first verse.\n\n01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.700\nThat's what happens when you're younger.\n\n01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:12.340\nYou burn.\n\n01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.020\nYou want to go out.\n\n01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:13.540\nYou want to drink.\n\n01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.140\nHi, my name is.\n\n01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:14.740\nHi, my name's John.\n\n01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.540\nHi, my name's John.\n\n01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.220\nAnd then you hopefully, through those actions,\n\n01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.420\nand you dial them in enough and get enough focus,\n\n01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.820\nyou go, oh, at the end of that nitro burn,\n\n01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.860\nI ended up with a wonderful wife, three kids,\n\n01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.020\nI got a house, I got a career, I got a thing.\n\n01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:30.140\nThe stages to which my career, the booster rocket\n\n01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.700\nworked and the way it burned to stick with this burn,\n\n01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.180\nmetaphor till it dies out, is that I have incredible career.\n\n01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.980\nI have an incredible mindset.\n\n01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.460\nI got to where I needed to get to and I went, oh, there's nobody.\n\n01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:45.860\nI forgot to pick someone up.\n\n01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.660\nAnd then add to that the trauma that everybody feels\n\n01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.020\nthrough the way that they live through their 20s for dating\n\n01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:51.860\nand 30s for dating.\n\n01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.780\nAnd I have that times 100 because I\n\n01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.100\nchose, in many ways, without knowing it,\n\n01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:59.740\nto do that in a very visible way that, in a way,\n\n01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:02.700\nmy brain is just fried from it.\n\n01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:03.820\nThat's the part that scares me.\n\n01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.020\nEverything else is a joy ride.\n\n01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:09.020\nThe part that scares me is that I might have missed the boat.\n\n01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.620\nAnd in which case, it would still be cool\n\n01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.500\nbecause I would just be like, rich uncle John,\n\n01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.140\nyou could come to his island and a drone comes out\n\n01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:15.860\nto get you first.\n\n01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.940\nAnd you're like, you start running after the drone.\n\n01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.860\nYou see the drone first, like war games.\n\n01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.180\nYou're running after the drone?\n\n01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.020\nRemember war games when they're going to see Joshua?\n\n01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.140\nYeah, there was a helicopter came.\n\n01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.420\nBut that was pre-drone.\n\n01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.540\nIf you just like your drone, you have to run after it\n\n01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.140\nbecause that's how fancy you are.\n\n01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.300\nThey would get off the boat.\n\n01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.340\nIt's John Mayer's drone.\n\n01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.860\nIt doesn't come hunting you.\n\n01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.940\nYou have to fucking chase it.\n\n01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.500\nI'm trying to make a good impression on my niece\n\n01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.300\nwho I haven't seen as she's seven, probably.\n\n01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.180\nI wouldn't have seen my niece in like seven years.\n\n01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.220\nAnd I'll give her the drone.\n\n01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.100\nIt's going to be hers.\n\n01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.620\nIf you chase the drone and catch it,\n\n01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.140\nyou can keep a John Mayer drone.\n\n01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:49.820\nThe John Mayer drone will go, you're\n\n01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.580\nmine is a wonderland.\n\n01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.900\nNow I'm doing an impression of people doing an impression of you.\n\n01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.460\nYou're bad.\n\n01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.980\nThe white noise, just all white noise.\n\n01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.300\nThat's the name of my next album.\n\n01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.820\nWe hear that you are a Rick and Morty fan.\n\n01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:02.300\nIs that true?\n\n01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:03.740\nHuge Rick and Morty fan.\n\n01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.300\nI'm such a big fan of Rick and Morty\n\n01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.900\nthat as I watch it, I lament the minutes I've already\n\n01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.380\nwatched it for.\n\n01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:09.940\nDo you know what I mean?\n\n01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.440\nYeah.\n\n01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:10.940\nLike up.\n\n01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:11.440\nYeah.\n\n01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.500\nFour minutes in.\n\n01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.060\nWhat's the, well, I mean, that seemed like a segue.\n\n01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.260\nWe could talk about Rick and Morty, but I actually,\n\n01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.540\nI don't know, I wanted to hear, like I asked you,\n\n01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.140\nyou said douchebag and womanizer,\n\n01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:28.180\nthese are things that sting, which I look at as like with,\n\n01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.860\nI'm just like marveling.\n\n01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.460\nI'm like, it must be nice to have\n\n01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:36.620\nbeing called a womanizer to your kryptonite.\n\n01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.660\nMaybe it's because when you talk,\n\n01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.940\nI want to fuck your brains out.\n\n01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.660\nI always tell people, if you think\n\n01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.940\nthat I thought that I was good looking growing up,\n\n01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.500\nwhy do you think I would have played\n\n01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.820\nguitar six hours a day?\n\n01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.420\nThere's my, there's your answer.\n\n01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.900\nI played guitar six hours a day.\n\n01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.340\nIf I had any inclination or belief in myself\n\n01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.740\nthat I was good looking, I'm sure I don't have the will\n\n01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.300\nto have done that.\n\n01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.500\nWhat are the things you like to hear?\n\n01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.060\nWhat are the things you wish to hear?\n\n01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:04.100\nOr when you hear them, that it's like fucking,\n\n01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.180\nlike even secretly, like, you're just like, god damn it,\n\n01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:07.700\nI love hearing that.\n\n01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.460\nI like when people say like, you're my Clapton.\n\n01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.620\nI like, because I can use that.\n\n01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.300\nThat's a good, clean, linear line item way\n\n01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.220\nto be like, that's what's going on.\n\n01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.220\nBecause you do want proof that you're\n\n01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.220\nliving your life in the format of your dreams as a kid.\n\n01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.340\nWhat does that mean to you, you're my Clapton?\n\n01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:26.340\nIt means everything I tried to be, I got to it.\n\n01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.100\nBecause I tried to be your Clapton.\n\n01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.300\nWell, because what was Clapton to you?\n\n01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:35.220\nAn incredible mix of blues guitar and mainstream music,\n\n01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:37.180\nwhich not to get super technical,\n\n01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.740\nbut blues music isn't really an idiom of music.\n\n01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:42.620\nIt's a style of writing.\n\n01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:47.020\nIt's a compositional form.\n\n01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.300\nAnd there's not a lot of money in blues.\n\n01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.020\nThere's not a lot of audience in blues.\n\n01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.140\nAnd part of me thinks it's because blues\n\n01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:58.140\nneeds to be mixed with another compound to come to life.\n\n01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:00.300\nAnd you could say, for everybody who came around,\n\n01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.860\nthey kind of were.\n\n01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.100\nAm I right in saying Stevie Ray Vaughan\n\n01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.020\nsort of did the same thing?\n\n01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.700\nYes, Stevie Ray Vaughan did the same thing.\n\n01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.220\nJimmy Hendricks did the same thing.\n\n01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:16.260\nAnd Clapton is the guy who fused really incredibly\n\n01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:20.380\nprestigious blues playing with pop music.\n\n01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.980\nAnd that's incredibly hard to do.\n\n01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.260\nTo get those two organisms to live together\n\n01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.780\nand not reject each other and just turn\n\n01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.820\ninto a blob and a Petri dish, it's really hard.\n\n01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:31.540\nLike nine out of 10 attempts to do it,\n\n01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.260\nyou just end up with nothing.\n\n01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:39.020\nSo I mean, that guy stands in his own universe.\n\n01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.860\nIt's in the way that you use it.\n\n01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.980\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.900\nDo you think that's a cool song?\n\n01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.980\nI think it's a funny song.\n\n01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.420\nThe thing I think is funny about it\n\n01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.660\nis that it's the only song I've ever heard that\n\n01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.980\nstarts mid-refrain.\n\n01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:54.820\nYeah, there's a couple.\n\n01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.140\nIt's really funny that that song just goes, all right.\n\n01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.100\nIt's in the world.\n\n01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.420\nNormally, a song like that should start with,\n\n01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:04.020\nsometimes you use things.\n\n01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:10.020\nMatt Bump, sometimes the way, boom, boom.\n\n01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.660\nThat was a big 80s trick, though.\n\n01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.300\nAnd then you build and build and build.\n\n01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.940\nAnd you're waiting for him to go.\n\n01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.660\nBut he was just like, I just think\n\n01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:18.500\nit's funny that the needle drops on that record.\n\n01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.940\nIt's like, two, three.\n\n01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.380\nIt's in the way that you use it.\n\n01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:23.860\nFuck it.\n\n01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.700\nAnd then they eventually come around\n\n01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.260\nto proving that that was the refrain.\n\n01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.820\nIt's like, that's not the verse.\n\n01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.580\nThat's the refrain.\n\n01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:32.100\nThat came from 80s producer mindset,\n\n01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.140\nwhich was like, gotta hit him with the hook.\n\n01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.060\nThere's no time.\n\n01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:35.780\nNo time for this.\n\n01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.340\nThere's no time.\n\n01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.540\nThese kids are going to buy a Pokemon instead of your record\n\n01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.500\nif you give them five measures.\n\n01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500\nThat's the way it is now.\n\n01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.020\nI mean, you've got to hit him with the mixtape in one song.\n\n01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:48.220\nOne, don't pick up the phone.\n\n01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.420\nYou know he's only one in the highway cone.\n\n01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.540\nTwo, don't poop in your shoe.\n\n01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.140\nI got the rules that tell you three.\n\n01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.540\nThis is the whole record in one song?\n\n01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.260\nI don't know.\n\n01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.220\nI was just thinking of like, you got to get,\n\n01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.380\nthat song reminds me of a BuzzFeed article.\n\n01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.220\nThat's like.\n\n01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.700\nOh, it's like a listicle song.\n\n01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.180\nYeah.\n\n01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:10.380\nI went skydiving in a narrow plane.\n\n01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.740\nYeah, that country has that a lot.\n\n01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.900\nHere's six ways to lose weight by Friday.\n\n01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.900\nYeah, like I would make it up and it'd be like,\n\n01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.020\nI went skydiving.\n\n01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.300\nI went mountain climbing.\n\n01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.060\nI walked 50,000 miles across the land.\n\n01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.260\nWe're only halfway through.\n\n01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:29.140\nI swam across the river.\n\n01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:31.820\nI walked across the gator, but there's\n\n01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.380\none thing that I'll never understand.\n\n01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.700\nAnd then a completely different phrase\n\n01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:42.020\nthat just lands like unbalanced into the title.\n\n01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.780\nWell, I don't know why you're not a bun for my hot dog.\n\n01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.260\nThat's right.\n\n01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.260\nYeah, that's right.\n\n01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.140\nAnd you're like, wait, what?\n\n01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.220\nWhere was the mountain guy?\n\n01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:51.420\nWhy would you climb a mountain?\n\n01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.020\nHow do we get there?\n\n01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.940\nWell, this was just misdirection.\n\n01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.940\nYeah.\n\n01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.460\nAnd at the last line, it's like, but check your back pocket.\n\n01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:01.300\nThat's right.\n\n01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:04.860\nI got your wallet.\n\n01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.100\nJust taking your wallet.\n\n01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.700\nI'll mix your metaphors, darling.\n\n01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:12.300\nI'll mix them better than a gun.\n\n01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.740\nI wrote a line one time.\n\n01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.260\nIt was just I couldn't handle it.\n\n01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:19.020\nI wouldn't put it, you're like a metaphor I've never heard\n\n01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.020\nbefore.\n\n01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.660\nAnd I went, that's so cyclical because no one really\n\n01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.180\nhas heard that metaphor before.\n\n01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.180\nAnd if you wondered, does John Mayer\n\n01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.060\nhave a theoretical limit to how poetic something can be?\n\n01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.820\nYes, that will never make the cut.\n\n01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:31.980\nThere it is, yeah.\n\n01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.140\nI thought in your body's in Wonderland,\n\n01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.820\nI know it's like, oh, it's your hit, and you're not like,\n\n01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.060\noh, it's also a most proud of it.\n\n01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:43.660\nBut I did think the verse where you compare,\n\n01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:46.820\nwould you say your nipples are like Epcot center?\n\n01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.980\nIt was, I pushed it.\n\n01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.540\nI think you're pushing the metaphor.\n\n01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.860\nYeah, it's like you didn't have to go through every part\n\n01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:57.220\nof the body and compare it to theme park.\n\n01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.140\nYour toes are like a quick pass.\n\n01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:02.100\nYeah, your toes are like little, little, little shrimp.\n\n01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:06.300\nAnd then I said, you have a langoustine pinky toe.\n\n01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.340\nIf you love a woman, just tell her you love her.\n\n01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.820\nA lot of times, that's good enough.\n\n01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.220\nWhen you love a woman.\n\n01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.820\nThat was a direct response to your body as a woman.\n\n01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:19.780\nBrian Adams wrote, when you really love a woman,\n\n01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.940\nis a way to tell me to shut the fuck up in your body\n\n01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.380\nand go on and on.\n\n01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.060\nYou don't have to write a cheesy song about how\n\n01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.060\nbody parts are like rights.\n\n01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.500\nBecause when you find yourself lying helpless in her arms,\n\n01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:39.460\nyou know you don't need a stupid song.\n\n01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:40.220\nI'm like, man.\n\n01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.660\nYour vagina's like the haunted hotel\n\n01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.140\nbefore they were using it to advertise the Eddie Murphy\n\n01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.620\nmovie.\n\n01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.180\nYour vagina is the classic version of that.\n\n01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.980\nI've got a fast pass to your titties.\n\n01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.780\nSo I'm going to eat at your naval restaurant.\n\n01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:05.060\nYou had that, Kaden, I'll take a fast pass to your titties.\n\n01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.460\nIt was very Western.\n\n01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.540\nI took a fast pass to your titties.\n\n01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.140\nI'm curious about the slo-bo tea.\n\n01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.980\nWell, I'm curious about singing.\n\n01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.300\nBecause, well, so people just have pipes, right?\n\n01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:19.420\nSo is that genetic?\n\n01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.860\nYeah, and it actually is.\n\n01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:24.620\nAs I get older, now I realize I can't take it personally\n\n01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.260\nif someone says I can't sing.\n\n01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.580\nOr I go like, this is the shape my voice is in.\n\n01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.140\nI literally can't change it.\n\n01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:33.700\nWhatever my pharynx is, whatever the larynx is,\n\n01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.700\nit's a shape.\n\n01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.100\nAnd it's like the shape of a wind instrument.\n\n01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.100\nSo I'm very good at singing low.\n\n01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.740\nAnd I'm very bad at singing high.\n\n01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.260\nIn fact, worse than ever, because I had some vocal issues.\n\n01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:44.900\nYou had surgery.\n\n01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.580\nYeah, surgery.\n\n01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.060\nLike you battled back.\n\n01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:47.660\nWhat's the answer?\n\n01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:48.500\nYeah, it's kind of awesome.\n\n01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.300\nThank you.\n\n01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.820\nI looked at it like Kobe would look at it, which is like,\n\n01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:54.300\nyeah, if you need to go into the knee, go into the knee.\n\n01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.660\nIf I can't play a season, I want a championship next year.\n\n01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.740\nSo go into the knee this year.\n\n01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.980\nWould you have continued just to play guitar\n\n01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:03.620\nif that had gone down?\n\n01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.580\nYeah, but I got to tell you I learned how much I love singing.\n\n01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.140\nBecause I did do that, and they're linked.\n\n01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.420\nI didn't think they were linked.\n\n01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:12.300\nOnce I got my voice back, I was like, OK, with what I have,\n\n01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.580\nwhich is still mostly capable.\n\n01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.580\nWhen people who can sing are singing,\n\n01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.500\nas a person who cannot sing and who occasionally then\n\n01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.140\nsings, like in karaoke, like the rest of us,\n\n01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:26.380\nand you have these moments where you're listening to yourself\n\n01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.220\nand you go, oh, I sound a little bit like George\n\n01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.620\nMichael for that one moment.\n\n01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:36.260\nWhen people who can sing, do you, is there dread?\n\n01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:39.260\nIf you're in front of a stadium and you're singing,\n\n01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:43.100\ndo you, is every note like an evil, conneval jump?\n\n01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:46.300\nOr are you just like, nah, I got this?\n\n01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:47.980\nSome are.\n\n01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.780\nOK, so when I feel like I have a well-slept reflexes in check,\n\n01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:57.140\nI sleep on a medicated pillow, prescription pillow.\n\n01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.220\nIt's on a slant, I sleep on my side.\n\n01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.820\nI hide it when company comes over.\n\n01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.140\nBut most of the time, I use it.\n\n01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:07.780\nThat's like the sexiness of John Mayer atmosphere.\n\n01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.740\nThe medicated pillow just bounces off.\n\n01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.580\nSorry, I have a prescription pillow.\n\n01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.780\nBut then you could also see, because I'm a singer.\n\n01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.900\nBut when I know that the facility is there,\n\n01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.100\nit's really, really fun.\n\n01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:26.540\nBut singers are a notoriously sensitive, hyper-focused,\n\n01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.500\nneurotic bunch, because the voice is never\n\n01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.300\nthe same way two days in a row.\n\n01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.460\nMy voice has never been the same way, any two days.\n\n01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:35.900\nIt's just a natural thing.\n\n01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.420\nYour voice changes.\n\n01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.300\nThere are things you could go for on the record that\n\n01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.140\ndon't sound the same live.\n\n01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.740\nAnd that's another thing I've come to live with over the years.\n\n01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.060\nBut when you're young, and it's the showcase,\n\n01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.580\nand you're an LA, let me tell you this, when you're an LA\n\n01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.420\nfor your showcase, and you're starting out,\n\n01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.300\nyou're playing the club, you will get sick.\n\n01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:54.220\nYou just will.\n\n01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.100\nYou just will get sick.\n\n01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.180\nYou'll wake up that day and go, ha, ha.\n\n01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.020\nAnd you live with that.\n\n01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.420\nAnd you go crazy for the day.\n\n01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.220\nYou take prednisone.\n\n01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.260\nEvery singer has prednisone stashed away.\n\n01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.060\nEvery singer dopes in that sense.\n\n01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.900\nAnd it's because there are horror stories.\n\n01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:07.820\nIt's up here.\n\n01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:12.260\nOr what, but have you, do you experience these moments\n\n01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.860\nwhere, like, what's the worst case scenario?\n\n01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.580\nBecause from the layman's perspective,\n\n01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.860\nall we understand is, like, oh, it's like the Rockstar game\n\n01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.780\nwhere, like, there's eight notes and you hit the note right.\n\n01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.780\nAnd then you professionals are like, oh, no,\n\n01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.300\nit's all this other shit.\n\n01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.460\nBut we look at it like, oh, Madonna canceled her gig.\n\n01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:35.500\nSorry, I'm dating myself.\n\n01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.700\nShe canceled her gig because she's got a sore throat.\n\n01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.500\nOK, well, that's the big, but to me,\n\n01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.260\nthe nightmare wouldn't be canceling a gig.\n\n01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.100\nIt would be, is there this theme?\n\n01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.940\nThe nightmare is canceling the gig\n\n01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.140\nbecause you just stare out your hotel window.\n\n01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.220\nHave you ever been in front of a bunch of people\n\n01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:53.220\nand been like, your body is a ha?\n\n01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.900\nYes, but I've learned that they really, most of the time,\n\n01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:57.700\ncan't tell.\n\n01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:58.900\nAnd you interpret, right?\n\n01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.340\nYeah, most of the time, they can't tell.\n\n01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.020\n98% of the time, they can't tell.\n\n01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.180\nAnd so that's my next question.\n\n01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.820\nLike, what, so it's not just this empirical thing\n\n01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.420\nbecause your voice, I can hear it,\n\n01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.740\neven though I don't even like music.\n\n01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:13.980\nI'm like, I get it.\n\n01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.740\nYou can get it by the way.\n\n01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.380\nI know why your voice is special.\n\n01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:17.420\nI can hear it.\n\n01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.020\nLike, you're listening to different shit,\n\n01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.340\nand you're going, shit, I lost 5% of the mayor sound.\n\n01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:28.180\nSo this is the difference between having a good performance\n\n01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.100\nand giving a good performance.\n\n01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:32.500\nYou can give a good performance, which means you liked it.\n\n01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:32.900\nYou liked it.\n\n01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:33.420\nYou liked it.\n\n01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.380\nBut I didn't have a good performance.\n\n01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.460\nAnd having a good performance is in the user experience\n\n01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.980\nof how it feels to have the auto mat arm go for the note,\n\n01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.180\npull it, have the muscles go reek like that,\n\n01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.700\nhave the air push through the right way,\n\n01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.420\nhave the microphone turned up loud enough,\n\n01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.540\nand the monitor's in the right way,\n\n01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:50.380\nand the thing bouncing around, the sound wave's\n\n01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:51.540\nbouncing around the room in the right way,\n\n01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.940\nand they come back to you in a way that says, you are God.\n\n01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:54.900\nAnd it feels good.\n\n01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:55.900\nThat's what I wanted to know.\n\n01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:59.700\nBecause actually, that's how normal people feel, too.\n\n01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.580\nWhen they accidentally hit a note,\n\n01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:02.540\nthat's why we sing in the shower.\n\n01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.220\nOh, I see what you're saying.\n\n01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.100\nBecause the shower makes us feel like that.\n\n01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.340\nDo you think that every normal person to use your parlance,\n\n01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.460\ndo you think that every one of them\n\n01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:14.060\nhas one pet favorite line from a song that you sing\n\n01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.740\nthat they picked up in the shower because it sounds?\n\n01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:21.580\nMicravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.\n\n01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.580\nYeah.\n\n01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:27.100\nSorry, it's a commercial from Milwaukee.\n\n01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:30.140\nNo, but it's more importantly, but yes, the answer\n\n01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.020\nto your question is yes.\n\n01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:31.580\nPeople like.\n\n01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:32.460\nDo you have one?\n\n01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.060\nIs there a song, like a little line you go,\n\n01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.100\nI still got it on that one.\n\n01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:35.900\nJust get it out.\n\n01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.540\nYeah, if I can hit any, like this is dating myself,\n\n01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:39.980\nbut any Philip Bailey.\n\n01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.460\nYeah.\n\n01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:44.180\nMy Michael McDonald is falling apart as I get older.\n\n01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:44.860\nAs I get older.\n\n01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.740\nBut so did his.\n\n01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:46.860\nRight, right, right, right.\n\n01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.220\nI'll just learn to sing how he sings now.\n\n01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:49.820\nI love those.\n\n01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.140\nI love listening to Easy Lover all the time.\n\n01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.980\nYeah, that's why we get along, because I'm a Phil Collins guy.\n\n01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.860\nWe never sung Easy Lover together.\n\n01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:58.980\nIt's such the drummer's mix of that song.\n\n01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.540\nBiddu-duh-duh-duh-duh, biddu-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\n\n01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:06.060\nBecause it's two, you know, doing drummers.\n\n01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:08.340\nSo you were like, oh, they had to agree on this track.\n\n01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:09.660\nThey really had to love this track,\n\n01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.020\nbecause it starts out with big drums.\n\n01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:14.020\nActually, that also starts out with Easy Lover.\n\n01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:14.500\nYeah.\n\n01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.100\nOh, you're right.\n\n01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:15.500\nStarts with the phrase.\n\n01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.380\nYou're absolutely right.\n\n01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.380\nIt starts with the fucking refrain.\n\n01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:18.780\nThat was the 80s thing, was like, hit.\n\n01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.220\nYou got to hit him.\n\n01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:22.180\nGot to hit him with the hook first.\n\n01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.380\nGot to hit him with the hook.\n\n01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.140\nGive him a hit.\n\n01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:25.420\nBut I thought actually to myself,\n\n01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:28.300\nthere's a sign of an amazingly good song.\n\n01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.660\nBecause when I hear it, and I wonder\n\n01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:33.940\nwhat it must have been like the night the artist finished it\n\n01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.100\nand sat back and played it for the manager.\n\n01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:38.260\nAnd imagine being like, Joel, come here.\n\n01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.060\nJoel, sit down.\n\n01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.020\nPress play.\n\n01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:42.460\nAnd you hear, biddu-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\n\n01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:46.860\nDun, dun, dun-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\n\n01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.980\nAnd Joel's like, I like it.\n\n01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:48.820\nYou're like, shut up, Joel.\n\n01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:49.340\nHow's it going?\n\n01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:49.820\nHold on.\n\n01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.820\nBiddu-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.\n\n01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:54.460\nYou're like, Easy Lover.\n\n01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.420\nAnd you're just like this.\n\n01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.180\nYup.\n\n01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.860\nThat's a victorious moment.\n\n01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:02.820\nI love the producer nod that's like, this is a hit.\n\n01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:03.460\nImagine that.\n\n01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.100\nEvery documentary where they just knew it right.\n\n01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:07.700\nBut I kind of think that, yeah, but it's\n\n01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.740\ninteresting to note that you feel the same feeling\n\n01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.220\nthat my uncle feels in the shower.\n\n01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:20.140\nThere are the, it's just that when you're feeling it,\n\n01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.900\nit's more in line with a bunch of people hearing it.\n\n01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.020\nBut we all feel it when we, that sensation of, fuck,\n\n01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.420\nI'm nailing it.\n\n01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.780\nAnd it's weird to me, as a person who doesn't understand\n\n01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:33.100\nanything about music or singing, like, what, yeah,\n\n01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:33.940\nwhat is that?\n\n01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.380\nBut that's a different podcast.\n\n01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.180\nI'll tell you, as a guitar player,\n\n01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:39.460\nanybody who picks a guitar can feel the same way I feel.\n\n01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.620\nIt's so scalable.\n\n01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:41.900\nIt's the same feeling.\n\n01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.020\nThat's what makes it a magic thing.\n\n01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.660\nLike, you take it home and you learn fire and rain.\n\n01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:50.860\nI promise you it has the same experiential bliss\n\n01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.220\nthat my writing gravity does.\n\n01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.380\nI'm sure of it.\n\n01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.180\nBut just imagine being like, hey, Dan,\n\n01:32:56.180 --> 01:32:57.340\ncan I tell you something?\n\n01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:57.900\nCheck this out.\n\n01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.460\nHere, have a seat.\n\n01:32:58.460 --> 01:32:59.380\nYou want to go, check?\n\n01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:03.220\nI was born by the river.\n\n01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:05.900\nLike, the moment in a little stream.\n\n01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.180\nIn the strings.\n\n01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.260\nJust like that river, and I'm watching to make sure\n\n01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:12.540\nyou don't get on your phone.\n\n01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:15.140\nEver since, gonna be alone.\n\n01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:17.620\nThat's the first time anybody's heard it.\n\n01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.220\nLong time coming, and I know.\n\n01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.500\nYou're like, he likes it.\n\n01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.700\nAnd then some guy goes, do the strings have\n\n01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.700\nto start from the beginning?\n\n01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.140\nYou go like, Bobby, I told you put tambourine in it.\n\n01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:35.260\nBobby, Bobby, I told you put tambourine.\n\n01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.340\nI told you, you're not going to hook up the recorder.\n\n01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.780\nI told you, my daughter played recorder.\n\n01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.260\nYou know, this is for Colgate Records.\n\n01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:43.740\nThey want it minty.\n\n01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.020\nThis doesn't feel minty.\n\n01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.020\nYou're going to say river, you're going to say field.\n\n01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.860\nYou was born by a field, Bobby.\n\n01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:56.780\nI miss the days where the lead singer would\n\n01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.100\ntalk to the drummer.\n\n01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.940\nWhat you going to play now?\n\n01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.380\nHave you ever seen the thing on YouTube,\n\n01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:06.340\nthe young ladies singing the jingles in the 80s\n\n01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.180\nfor the bread company?\n\n01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.660\nIt's a patty kick.\n\n01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:14.220\nPatty kicks, patty kicks.\n\n01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.860\nIt's like 40 minutes of her doing takes on this jingle.\n\n01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.580\nAnd your heart goes out to her, and she's just like,\n\n01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:26.180\nshe's in this sweater, and it's the 80s,\n\n01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:28.140\nand it's VHS, and she's just in this booth,\n\n01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.740\nand it's just over and over again, endless takes.\n\n01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.460\nShe's like, uh-huh, OK, all right, sorry.\n\n01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:33.660\nYeah.\n\n01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:40.500\nPatty kicks, patty kicks, because clearly what they're\n\n01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.260\nsaying is give it more bread.\n\n01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:48.180\nShe's not singing about something she feels anything\n\n01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.540\nabout, but she's trying.\n\n01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.180\nAnd then you just watch her reaching for it.\n\n01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:56.620\nAnd she's like, patty, you know that patty kicks are my bread.\n\n01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:59.100\nAnd then she keeps getting cut off so many times,\n\n01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.100\nyou never get to the, I guess you'd call it a bridge,\n\n01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.620\nbut it's a jingle.\n\n01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.020\nAnd that's the amazing part.\n\n01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.180\nIt's like 20 minutes into this reel.\n\n01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:10.980\nShe finally gets all the way to the point\n\n01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.700\nwhere you get to hear the rest of the song,\n\n01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.620\nand it's like a bridge.\n\n01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:18.580\nAnd she's like, because it's good bread.\n\n01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.300\nYou know, it's good bread.\n\n01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:29.140\nLike, that's the velhalla you get too.\n\n01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.420\nIf you jump through all those hoops,\n\n01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.020\nyou get to sing, it's good bread.\n\n01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.740\nAnd this poor woman, who's born with the voice of God,\n\n01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:41.100\neveryone's getting like the creatives are giving this gift.\n\n01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.380\nAnd then they're like, they're just\n\n01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.740\nputting these actual glass boxes.\n\n01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:49.420\nCan you give us a little more raisin on the raisin?\n\n01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:52.780\nBecause it's raisin, bread.\n\n01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.580\nIt's amazing.\n\n01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.540\nI just think it'd be so fun.\n\n01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.780\nThe realism of hearing a little bit of what she hears\n\n01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.940\non the track through her earphones, just like a little bit.\n\n01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:02.020\nYou just hear the music.\n\n01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:05.540\nYou just hear that little bit through her headphones.\n\n01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.540\nPatty kicks.\n\n01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:11.020\nPatty kicks.\n\n01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.220\nRun it back.\n\n01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:15.300\nI imagine that someone like you probably\n\n01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.500\nhas lived his whole career wondering,\n\n01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:23.140\nwhen do I get an opportunity to sing\n\n01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:30.900\nthe improvised hook for an improvised rap about just\n\n01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.260\nanything?\n\n01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:35.100\nWhen do I get to really let loose and just be John Mayer\n\n01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:38.300\non the Dan Harmon rap?\n\n01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:41.100\nWell, I believe now that the way that I\n\n01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:45.540\ncan speak to my abilities without sounding arrogant\n\n01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:49.980\nis to speak to my potential.\n\n01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:53.100\nI believe that I am a man of infinite potential.\n\n01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:55.020\nI believe that my potential is far greater\n\n01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.380\nthan anyone else's potential.\n\n01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:58.540\nAnd I believe that.\n\n01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:01.260\nSo I don't even know what I'm capable of.\n\n01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:03.380\nI am also just discovering.\n\n01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:05.700\nEvery day I wake up, if I choose to,\n\n01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:09.380\nI can put my hand in a goldfish and pull out something new,\n\n01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:12.940\nsomething I didn't know that I could do.\n\n01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.700\nThis is a super cool speech.\n\n01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.220\nYou caught me on the same night.\n\n01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:17.540\nI'm feeling the same way.\n\n01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.580\nI don't know if I can rap.\n\n01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:23.220\nAnd one might say that anything that's\n\n01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:26.180\ncome to me that has been deleterious in any way\n\n01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:29.580\nhas come because of my belief in my potential.\n\n01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.100\nYes.\n\n01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:30.740\nHoly shit.\n\n01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.140\nIt has all just been infinite potential.\n\n01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.140\nAnd this is why I feel like I get flattened out\n\n01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.860\nand two-dimensional when things go my way,\n\n01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:39.740\nbecause I lose the sight of my potential,\n\n01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.140\nbecause my potential is realized.\n\n01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.580\nAnd I don't feel at home there.\n\n01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.620\nSo whatever song you have, Dan Harmon,\n\n01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:49.460\nI want you to believe that I'm going to drop into it\n\n01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.460\nwith vigor and dedication, like it was my patty cakes.\n\n01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:55.860\nLet us bring this vigor.\n\n01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.460\nGive me a beat.\n\n01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:02.740\nDon't give me time to think about it.\n\n01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:05.380\nOh, shit.\n\n01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.500\nYo.\n\n01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.660\nYo.\n\n01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.100\nRap isn't about thinking.\n\n01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.300\nIt's the Titanic's not about sinking.\n\n01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.180\nIt's about floating on the ocean with water.\n\n01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.340\nRap is going from mothers to daughters.\n\n01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:20.940\nThe patriarchy has got to come down.\n\n01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.700\nI fucked your mama so hard, I turned her smile upside down.\n\n01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.460\nBut that doesn't mean she started frowning.\n\n01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:28.860\nIt just means happiness was inverted for her.\n\n01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.860\nMy name is Dan Harmon.\n\n01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:33.220\nI'm here to say that I'm here to say things in a rapping way.\n\n01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:36.500\nI like to rap west and rap to the east.\n\n01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.300\nI fucked your mama like a beast.\n\n01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.620\nBut let's talk about the earth and horizons.\n\n01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:43.540\nI fucked your mama, and it was surprising.\n\n01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:45.940\nI'm not trying to use the fuck your mama crutch.\n\n01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:50.060\nI'm not Starsky or Hutch.\n\n01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:51.460\nI'm rapping for real.\n\n01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.260\nFrom the top of my head, John Mayer's here to help me.\n\n01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:59.460\nI'm going to respect his involvement and not be hack.\n\n01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:02.580\nI'm going to flow from my head down to my heart\n\n01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:06.420\nand rap instead in a real way and rap from the soul\n\n01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.700\nand do it like rock and roll.\n\n01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:11.820\nI'm going to rap like a stream, rap like a mountain.\n\n01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.700\nI fucked your mama like she was a fountain.\n\n01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:14.700\nOK, stop.\n\n01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:15.860\nDon't stop.\n\n01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:16.980\nI didn't mean you stop.\n\n01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:18.500\nI'm rapping.\n\n01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.780\nTake it.\n\n01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.300\nDon't you know it's now or never?\n\n01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:25.020\nWe can't do it all so clever.\n\n01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.980\nWe've got to do it together.\n\n01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.940\nWe've got to do it together.\n\n01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:32.460\nDon't you know it's now or never?\n\n01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.220\nAll we've got to be is clever.\n\n01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.940\nDon't you know we've got to do it together.\n\n01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.020\nAll we've got to get together.\n\n01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.700\nBirds from a feather.\n\n01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:44.100\nThey flock together depending on the weather.\n\n01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.060\nWhen it's warm out, they go down to Miami.\n\n01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:52.900\nThey fuck your mama like Sammy, a friend of mine.\n\n01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:54.660\nJust give me a chance.\n\n01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.700\nAll right, give me a chance.\n\n01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.500\nJust give me a second.\n\n01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.860\nWe're OK to fail here.\n\n01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.500\nRap, rap.\n\n01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:02.660\nYou know it's now or never?\n\n01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.780\nTell your mama, check the weather.\n\n01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.580\nWhatever we do is clever when we all get together.\n\n01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:15.580\nYeah, when we rap, we join together and then we clap.\n\n01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:16.980\nAnd then we do it together.\n\n01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:17.700\nFriends.\n\n01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.540\nAnd then we're friends.\n\n01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:24.620\nAnd then it's like, yo, yo, when I went, I'm rapping.\n\n01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:25.220\nBumble.\n\n01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.860\nYeah, no, it's fine.\n\n01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.460\nStammer.\n\n01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.140\nYo, we keep rapping.\n\n01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.900\nFoot in a shoe, I fucked your mama and shot my glue.\n\n01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:37.020\nI put it on her envelope.\n\n01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.100\nAnd then we went off and got married.\n\n01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:39.900\nWe eloped.\n\n01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.380\nI proposed to her and she said yes.\n\n01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:44.700\nAnd then we went and met Hermann Hesse.\n\n01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.300\nHe was a Nazi war criminal, but he was fine.\n\n01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.860\nHe's not a good person.\n\n01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:53.100\nBut he allowed us to dine in his living room.\n\n01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.940\nHe gave us some shrooms.\n\n01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.660\nAnd we went in the backyard and we looked at her hands.\n\n01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.380\nAnd they looked like cosmic shards.\n\n01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.980\nAnd they were reflecting the moonlight.\n\n01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.500\nAnd we said, holy shit, humanity is United,\n\n01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.700\nlike loaves of bread.\n\n01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.540\nOh, shit, we're all yeast.\n\n01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:10.180\nAnd we're rising up to the west of the east.\n\n01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:13.940\nAnd then Herman is your daddy now.\n\n01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.300\nHe's been here with your mother.\n\n01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.100\nAnd he likes to tell the world about it.\n\n01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.980\nThere's no harm in harming.\n\n01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:23.260\nJohn Mayer.\n\n01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:24.180\nDon't you know that?\n\n01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:26.300\nThere's no harm in harming.\n\n01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.300\nHe and your daddy.\n\n01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:27.860\nJohn Mayer.\n\n01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.180\nHe could have broken the news.\n\n01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:33.900\nMaybe a little better, but what better time\n\n01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.020\nthan a freestyle line to let you know that he'll\n\n01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.620\nbe coming home to put you in your place\n\n01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.420\nvia your mama's face than harming.\n\n01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.900\nThere's no harm in harming.\n\n01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.500\nI should give you two different hooks\n\n01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:48.620\nto choose from in the mix.\n\n01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.620\nYeah, well, we're not going to edit it.\n\n01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.060\nHere's me at a different pitch.\n\n01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.460\nI'm doing a different sitch.\n\n01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.500\nI got my vocoder over here.\n\n01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:02.060\nI turned the knob, and now I'm sitting in a higher pitch.\n\n01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.100\nOK, we won't do that.\n\n01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.500\nJohn Mayer went to lunch one day, and he saw your mama.\n\n01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.180\nAnd he said, hey, and he said, my name's John Mayer.\n\n01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.180\nAnd she said, hi.\n\n01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:20.740\nAnd he said, I'm going to take you to the sky.\n\n01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.380\nAnd he sang, your body's a wonderland.\n\n01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:23.340\nBut what about my dick?\n\n01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.620\nAnd she said, I'm not standing in line for it.\n\n01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.220\nAnd he said, you don't have to.\n\n01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:28.260\nI'll take you to the front.\n\n01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:32.340\nAnd she said, yo, you got a fast pass to my front.\n\n01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:33.340\nYes!\n\n01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:33.840\nAll right.\n\n01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.340\nYes!\n\n01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:35.840\nYes!\n\n01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:42.020\n10 minutes left.\n\n01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.780\nHow it's called fast pass.\n\n01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:44.420\nYou're fearless.\n\n01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.020\nAs a window.\n\n01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.460\nYou don't let the fact that you can't think of anything\n\n01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.060\nstop you from going.\n\n01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:51.620\nNo, that's the virtue of it.\n\n01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:54.740\nYou might say my mind is a wonderland.\n\n01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:55.420\nHe did.\n\n01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:56.420\nHe already did.\n\n01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.740\nWell, he said it, but it was two different looks.\n\n01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.300\nHe said it in multiple ways.\n\n01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:00.800\nDarn it!\n\n01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:01.300\nDarn it!\n\n01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.300\nHe said it right.\n\n01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:03.100\nThat's beautiful.\n\n01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:03.600\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.300\nI gave you, there's no holland of a nana.\n\n01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:08.140\nYeah.\n\n01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.900\nAnd also, we came full circle because you got to actually\n\n01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:11.900\ndo some add-ins.\n\n01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.400\nI did.\n\n01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.540\nAt the top of the presentation, we\n\n01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.420\nsaid, who's the dude that does the rap add-ins?\n\n01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:15.920\nYep.\n\n01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.380\nYou said it, Marvin Hess.\n\n01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:18.300\nAnd I said, Sid Artha.\n\n01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:18.940\nI dropped Sid Artha.\n\n01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.020\nThat was perfect.\n\n01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.020\nI mean, come on.\n\n01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.220\nIt's hard to do.\n\n01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:22.740\nIt's hard to do.\n\n01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:23.660\nYou did it.\n\n01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:24.380\nIt's hard to do.\n\n01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:25.500\nIt is hard to do.\n\n01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.460\nI mean, I'm serious.\n\n01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.860\nI was thinking that whole time, you just buzzed it off Sid\n\n01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:29.360\nArtha.\n\n01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.980\nI couldn't do one.\n\n01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:31.480\nYeah.\n\n01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:31.980\nIt was great.\n\n01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:32.620\nIt was great.\n\n01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.820\nYou have to be an open channel, but not too open.\n\n01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:36.460\nI try to close my channels.\n\n01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:37.100\nYeah.\n\n01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.060\nI try to keep the aperture just as gaping wide as possible.\n\n01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:40.780\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:41.860\nWhy don't you guys get a room?\n\n01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.700\nYou know, he's not going to be back here next week.\n\n01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:44.660\nI won't be back next week.\n\n01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:45.860\nI didn't think he would.\n\n01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:47.660\nWell, you don't have to cozy up to him like this.\n\n01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.500\nI would say he's a guest.\n\n01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.140\nI'm trying to make him feel welcome\n\n01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.820\nand like he didn't make a mistake tonight.\n\n01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:51.820\nOK.\n\n01:43:51.820 --> 01:43:53.980\nWe'll try to walk a line where you don't make me feel\n\n01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:55.660\nunwelcome by just saying.\n\n01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.780\nI love that on the night of the Grammys,\n\n01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.860\nI wrote a song with Dan Harmon about the fact\n\n01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.180\nthat he's having copious amounts of sex with America's mother.\n\n01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.420\nAmerica's mother.\n\n01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.420\nNow, this does circle back to everything\n\n01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.740\nwe were talking about, being disruptive, being strange.\n\n01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:14.100\nOn Grammy night, I showed up here, and we jammed out.\n\n01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.900\nAnd my fate is unclear after this.\n\n01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:19.820\nWe'll probably win a Grammy next year for this.\n\n01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.100\nThat's the only reason I'm here.\n\n01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.420\nSo how do we put together?\n\n01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:26.340\nI was going to say, the one thing I didn't get to is,\n\n01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:28.660\nDan, the way your mind works, and I love being a map maker.\n\n01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:29.780\nWonderlandish.\n\n01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.820\nWonderlandish.\n\n01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:32.220\nOh, that's why I could never get to it.\n\n01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.060\nThere was the Wonderland smoke bomb went on.\n\n01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.300\nYou subdivide.\n\n01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:36.660\nYour brain cleaves.\n\n01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.140\nYou take one thing, you cut it into two.\n\n01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:39.900\nYou go because it's A and B. You take B,\n\n01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:43.180\nand you go because it's B with 1 and 2 and italics underneath.\n\n01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:45.580\nYou build, it's kind of increasingly,\n\n01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.140\nwhat's the mathematical theorem where you just\n\n01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.980\nkeep cutting the distance between here and the wall\n\n01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:52.300\nand you never get to the wall?\n\n01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.500\nADD, I don't know.\n\n01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500\nYeah, you have this thing where you continually\n\n01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:57.460\nkeep cutting, subdividing the idea.\n\n01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.100\nJesus, John Deere.\n\n01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:59.460\nAnd I like to do the opposite.\n\n01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:01.140\nI like to lump the ideas.\n\n01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:03.740\nAnd I would like, in the final five minutes,\n\n01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:05.580\nto put things into boxes a little bit.\n\n01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.780\nHow are things in general?\n\n01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.420\nAre you generally happy, though?\n\n01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.180\nFantastic.\n\n01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:10.820\nI'm generally fantastic, yeah.\n\n01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:13.220\nSo you're working in the little nooks and crannies\n\n01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.100\nand things.\n\n01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:18.260\nEverybody wants to maintain and get to a healthier place.\n\n01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:20.580\nYou just seem to be more in touch with what those things are.\n\n01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.540\nYou tend to.\n\n01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:22.820\nWhich may be called gratitude.\n\n01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:25.420\nLike, looking and going like, oh, here's the box I'm in.\n\n01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:28.060\nIt's pretty good compared to other people in Lebanon.\n\n01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:29.460\nI have to put things back into boxes\n\n01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:31.060\nif I take them out like we have.\n\n01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:33.900\nI think it's important to put them back in and go,\n\n01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:36.020\nso what is a great thing?\n\n01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.020\nWhat is something you love?\n\n01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.460\nWhat's a simple pleasure where you go,\n\n01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.460\ngod, I love being on this planet?\n\n01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.460\nMy girlfriend.\n\n01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.180\nOh, that's awesome.\n\n01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.460\nIs that you an alt-right guy?\n\n01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.780\nAre you going to call me a cuck now?\n\n01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.660\nNo, because I never fully figured out\n\n01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.940\nhow cuck the term applied to politics.\n\n01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:50.420\nYeah.\n\n01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.020\nI still don't understand.\n\n01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.420\nWell, what about just loving your guy?\n\n01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:53.420\nI love my girlfriend.\n\n01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.780\nI'm really happy to be with her.\n\n01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:56.140\nI'm so excited I found somebody.\n\n01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:57.580\nAnd it's not just because she's in the room.\n\n01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:00.620\nI swear to god, she's not usually here.\n\n01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.380\nShe may have left already, but I really genuinely\n\n01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:06.300\nlike it's a thing that I've found, not that she's a thing.\n\n01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.380\nIt's just so happy.\n\n01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.860\nI understand anybody would understand it.\n\n01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.580\nAnd forensic files.\n\n01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:11.420\nSo you do.\n\n01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:14.740\nSo we don't have to worry about you being in a constant state.\n\n01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:15.500\nYeah, no, no.\n\n01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.980\nWhen you're not hearing from me, I'm happy.\n\n01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:20.020\nHey, that's what I think is important.\n\n01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:22.820\nNo news is good news.\n\n01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:24.140\nThat made me feel better because I\n\n01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:28.980\ntend to wear the sympathetic residue of people's problems.\n\n01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:30.820\nThe more you go into something, I track it.\n\n01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:33.140\nMy brain has such traction on things that I wear.\n\n01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:36.140\nLike, if you ask me, what's that word that starts with a P\n\n01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:39.100\nthat's not, and I will text you four days later and be like,\n\n01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:40.740\nare you sure it doesn't start with an L?\n\n01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.220\nReally?\n\n01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:42.700\nYeah, I will assume.\n\n01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:44.740\nYou were going to walk out of here worried about me being\n\n01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.140\ndepressed?\n\n01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:47.780\nI would have texted you not worried about being depressed\n\n01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.860\nbecause you can handle yourself obviously here.\n\n01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:52.860\nBut I would probably have texted you other things\n\n01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:55.260\nto try to put into context what I wasn't sure you did or didn't.\n\n01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.420\nI'm truly, truly happy.\n\n01:46:57.420 --> 01:46:58.780\nI'm very happy.\n\n01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:02.300\nI'm frustrated at this current time with the fact\n\n01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:08.220\nthat the way out of this life is not, keeps changing.\n\n01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:10.380\nThe exit ramp keeps being updated.\n\n01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.460\nAnd it's a frustrating thing.\n\n01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:13.700\nBut that's called privilege.\n\n01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:18.380\nIt's like, well, I just wanted to know that I could,\n\n01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:20.780\nwith five years I had a plan, and they just\n\n01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.020\nkeep changing the exit ramp.\n\n01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.940\nAnd I'm like, these people.\n\n01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:28.700\nBut inside my car, it smells like pine.\n\n01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.660\nPhil Collins is playing.\n\n01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:32.660\nIt's very good.\n\n01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.340\nThere is nothing wrong.\n\n01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:37.980\nIt's you that's changing the plan.\n\n01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:39.980\nAnd that's the good news.\n\n01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.940\nWell, I guess I would argue with that.\n\n01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.300\nI think it's, I don't know.\n\n01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:47.260\nYou've got a strong, intelligent voice\n\n01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:51.100\nthat seems to be able to hold up against a lot of forces\n\n01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:54.060\nthat normally drive intelligent minds crazy.\n\n01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.460\nI'll probably be fine.\n\n01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.580\nI just didn't see myself lifting anything after 45.\n\n01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:06.180\nI just wanted, I had this image in my head.\n\n01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.940\nI thought I'd be retired by now.\n\n01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:10.220\nBecause my dad worked hard until a certain age.\n\n01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.580\nAnd I was like, well, that was dumb.\n\n01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.860\nYou should do it that earlier.\n\n01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.060\nCould you be retired if you had all the money in the world\n\n01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.540\nyou ever wanted?\n\n01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:16.500\nCould you do it?\n\n01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.500\nYes.\n\n01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.500\nCould you wake up tomorrow?\n\n01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:19.820\nMoney's in the bank, everything's good.\n\n01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.540\nYou couldn't spend it if you tried.\n\n01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:23.420\nYou would be OK being retired.\n\n01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.420\nDo you think that's true?\n\n01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:24.920\nNo.\n\n01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.780\nLook at the face.\n\n01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.260\nFuck no.\n\n01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:30.460\nNo, because you could have.\n\n01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:30.940\nYou could have.\n\n01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.140\nNo, no, I couldn't have.\n\n01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:32.940\nNo, I couldn't have.\n\n01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.140\nYou could have had about $80,000.\n\n01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.300\nIn LA, broke rider money, that's like 10 years.\n\n01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:39.100\nThis is like when people are like, everybody googles\n\n01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:41.340\nthemselves like, nope, can't Google myself.\n\n01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.540\nI fucking can't do it.\n\n01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.140\nI think it's you that moves the gold post.\n\n01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:44.860\nYeah, I think so.\n\n01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:45.900\nI mean, let's not.\n\n01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:48.700\nI mean, I like that you actually said gold post.\n\n01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:49.700\nIt's a kind of is.\n\n01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.740\nYou know, it's a kind of is like gold post at this point.\n\n01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.220\nOh, by the way, I don't know if you know.\n\n01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:55.220\nYou're a fan of Rick and Morty.\n\n01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:58.420\nYou know that Brandon does the voice of Mr. Goldenfold.\n\n01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.140\nThe math teacher.\n\n01:48:59.140 --> 01:48:59.740\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:00.380\nOh, that's great.\n\n01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.620\nJust trivia.\n\n01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.260\nThat's great.\n\n01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:05.540\nI like him very much because he's drawn just a little\n\n01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.420\ndifferently than everyone else.\n\n01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.860\nHe's drawn from a different kind of nomenclature\n\n01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.300\nthan everyone else on the show.\n\n01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:11.820\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.740\nIt looks like he stumbled in from a different cartoon.\n\n01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:16.860\nHe's based very much on a real life math teacher\n\n01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:21.620\nI had in seventh grade, whose last name I can't remember,\n\n01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:24.660\nbut it looks like some sort of animation exchange program.\n\n01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.060\nSomeone from Rick and Morty is in some other like Fat Albert\n\n01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.780\nEsk kind of show.\n\n01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:31.940\nI like that his name is Mr. Goldenfold,\n\n01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.460\nand the principal's name is Mr. Vagina.\n\n01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:37.420\nI don't know what the rest of the faculty is.\n\n01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.700\nEverything just.\n\n01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:40.420\nGreat Phil Hendry.\n\n01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:41.260\nThe great Phil Hendry.\n\n01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:45.060\nThe great Phil Hendry.\n\n01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:48.060\nAll right, well, obviously, you're not plugging anything.\n\n01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:51.220\nHey, go to John Mayer's Kickstarter.\n\n01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:54.540\nHe's trying to start an actual Wonderland.\n\n01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:57.420\nJust like me.\n\n01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:59.700\nYou know what, I would enjoy a couple of comments.\n\n01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.780\nI'll probably go creeping around for him or like,\n\n01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:03.580\nand this is the best I can do at this point in my life.\n\n01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:05.620\nAnd someone's like, don't love his music,\n\n01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:08.700\nbut funnier than I thought, which is still\n\n01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:09.500\nan insult to my music.\n\n01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.540\nWould you really like that?\n\n01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:11.620\nI'm really curious about that.\n\n01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.060\nWould you like that?\n\n01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.660\nI don't care if someone likes the music.\n\n01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.300\nPeople have to put up a lot of disclaimers\n\n01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:21.060\nlike, actually, got to say.\n\n01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:22.660\nFor someone who like me, they have to put up\n\n01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:23.860\nlike six or seven disclaimers.\n\n01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.060\nI got to say, not a fan of his music, and his past is shady,\n\n01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.460\nand I wasn't into this and that.\n\n01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.500\nYour body of Wonderland is dumb, but I\n\n01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:34.660\nhave to tell you in confidence that I do believe now,\n\n01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.260\nafter watching this podcast, that I now know nothing\n\n01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.140\nabout John Mayer, and I'm waiting for something positive\n\n01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:41.700\nto come along.\n\n01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.540\nI've settled all debts with the man.\n\n01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:44.700\nWe'll see what he comes out with next.\n\n01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.620\nI always see the opposite.\n\n01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:47.860\nWhen I see somebody go like, I love community,\n\n01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:50.260\nand I love Rick and Morty, and I've\n\n01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:54.500\nbeen trained now when I see those two statements.\n\n01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.580\nThose sound like great things, but I\n\n01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:59.380\nknow no one would say that online if they weren't\n\n01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.420\nabout to fucking tear me apart.\n\n01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:04.220\nThat's why I like the opposite, which is, don't love his music.\n\n01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:05.220\nHe's a giant piece of shit.\n\n01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.900\nI'm like, come, come, what?\n\n01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:10.020\nAnd, but I got to say, funnier than I thought.\n\n01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.860\nYes.\n\n01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:15.500\nI mean, I am super grateful for you coming by,\n\n01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.140\nnot just because you're super famous,\n\n01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:19.380\nand it was like an interesting star fucker win,\n\n01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.380\nbut honestly, I really wanted you to come on the show\n\n01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:26.340\nbecause we had a moment of eating pepperoni pizza,\n\n01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:32.460\nand I just, yeah, you exude an intelligence\n\n01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:36.740\nand an awareness that made me excited to talk to you,\n\n01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:40.900\nand I bet a lot of our listeners are happy for it.\n\n01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.580\nAnd it was, you don't do this a lot.\n\n01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.740\nYou're not on every podcast.\n\n01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:45.860\nI had to write some friends who've\n\n01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:48.060\nasked me to be on a podcast before, and I said I wouldn't.\n\n01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:50.500\nI literally texted them on the way here, literally.\n\n01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:52.660\nI actually honestly texted them on the way here,\n\n01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.860\nand I was like, just want to let you know,\n\n01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:55.540\nI'm going off to Dan Harmon's podcast.\n\n01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:57.620\nI've told you know in the past, but he cornered me,\n\n01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:59.500\nand told me that.\n\n01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:02.540\nI had to do it, and so I just want to let you know.\n\n01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.260\nSo yeah, I've lifted the embargo for this\n\n01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.060\nbecause I find you far too interesting.\n\n01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.300\nI think you are diseased with your own intelligence.\n\n01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.580\nWe could disappear up each other's asses.\n\n01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:13.860\nAnd the show title.\n\n01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:16.620\nWe have finally found the show title.\n\n01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:18.460\nDisappear up each other's asses.\n\n01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:18.940\nAnd that's right.\n\n01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:21.660\nNo, but I really want you to know how grateful I am.\n\n01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:24.100\nThat's so cool that you came out to the middle of Burbank\n\n01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:26.660\non a Sunday night by yourself and came here\n\n01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:32.180\nand shared your fears and insecurities and your pride\n\n01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:33.660\nand all the shit with us.\n\n01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:38.660\nLike, I love transparency and honesty, and your soul\n\n01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.500\nis the opposite of a wonderland.\n\n01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:41.220\nThank you, man.\n\n01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.300\nIt's a deep labyrinth.\n\n01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:42.940\nIt's a deep land.\n\n01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:43.940\nLand.\n\n01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.220\nThank you.\n\n01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.620\nAlso, there's other songs that he wrote.\n\n01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:48.100\nYep.\n\n01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:50.900\nOh, seven Grammys.\n\n01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.860\nSpencer, is there anything you?\n\n01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.380\nI thought there was a reason he kept hitting it.\n\n01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:56.580\nIs there anything you ever wanted to ask or say to John Mayer?\n\n01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:59.100\nNo, I just identify with a lot of the stuff\n\n01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:00.340\nyou were saying on stage.\n\n01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:04.220\nI don't know, I have the tiniest slice of tiny internet\n\n01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.980\nfame, but a lot of what you're saying\n\n01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.140\nis stuff that I've wrestled with and dealt with\n\n01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:10.380\nthat the past is very illuminating and helpful.\n\n01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:10.940\nOh, good.\n\n01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:11.440\nYeah.\n\n01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:15.580\nYeah, no, I mean, we could open that module up for an hour\n\n01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:18.460\nand go into the mechanics of how to process what\n\n01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.180\npeople say about you.\n\n01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:24.260\nBut most people give themselves up in the way\n\n01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.900\nthey write the first sentence.\n\n01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.140\nYou start seeing vocabulary.\n\n01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:30.900\nThey don't realize that they follow a pattern.\n\n01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:31.340\nWe do.\n\n01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:32.540\nWe know they follow a pattern.\n\n01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.860\nSo most of the time, people just out themselves\n\n01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.540\nas being lame in the first sentence.\n\n01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:37.420\nYou know what I mean?\n\n01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.380\nYeah.\n\n01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.300\nOccasionally, someone will get a good hit in,\n\n01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:42.060\nand then I'll be like, that's a good hit.\n\n01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:45.620\nLike, have you ever gone as far as finding out\n\n01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.660\nthe Twitter account of the person who wrote the article\n\n01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.140\nand you just think about reaching out?\n\n01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.900\nWell, I always look.\n\n01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.540\nI look at all of their accounts.\n\n01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:55.700\nBecause when somebody takes a shot at me,\n\n01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:59.860\nI always, I block all of them.\n\n01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:03.020\nAnd usually before I block them, I'll send them\n\n01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:07.700\na snapshot of their profile with their follower numbers\n\n01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.820\nand then the fact that they were following me\n\n01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.180\ncircled in red.\n\n01:54:11.180 --> 01:54:12.460\nAnd then I'll block them.\n\n01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:14.780\nBecause I'm just like, why are you following somebody\n\n01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:16.020\nand talking shit?\n\n01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:16.900\nYou're dumb.\n\n01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:18.060\nYour existence is dumb.\n\n01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:18.900\nI'll tell you why.\n\n01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.980\nThe whole thing comes down to an Acura Integra.\n\n01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:23.780\nI knew it.\n\n01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.060\nIt all comes down to an Acura Integra.\n\n01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.580\nBeautiful car.\n\n01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:30.020\nI'm sure it's a great value.\n\n01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:34.900\nPeople want you to have one so that Acura keeps giving money\n\n01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:37.020\nto the people who want you to have one.\n\n01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:39.620\n50% of the articles that are written on these sites\n\n01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:42.780\nthat try to sell you the Acura are very important.\n\n01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:44.260\nThey're meaningful.\n\n01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:48.260\nThe other 50% is absolute garbage meant to drive you\n\n01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:50.820\nto just nothing but sales and clicks.\n\n01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:55.500\nYour responsibility is to figure out which 50% is which\n\n01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:57.300\nand block out the dumb shit.\n\n01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.900\nThat's the challenge.\n\n01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:02.780\nIt all goes back to an Acura Integra.\n\n01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.300\nThat's true.\n\n01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:04.780\nAll right.\n\n01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:05.780\nThat's the closer.\n\n01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.060\nLet's fucking close the show.\n\n01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:08.900\nI'm not going to monopolize it.\n\n01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:12.420\nJohn Mayer, ladies and gentlemen, thank him for coming.\n\n01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:13.060\nThank you very much.\n\n01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:13.500\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.500\nYeah.\n\n01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:17.260\nAnd let's end our podcast.\n\n01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.140\nLet's all go do things that are relatively important,\n\n01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.060\nlike going to bed with Cody.\n\n01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.220\nAll right.\n\n01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:27.140\nI'm going to drive home and think about the worst thing I said.\n\n01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.100\nIt's going to get in my head.\n\n01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.260\nIt's going to corkscrew.\n\n01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:30.820\nIt's going to say, John, fuck you.\n\n01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.580\nThere's some things you just shouldn't do.\n\n01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:34.500\nYou're going to run the whole transcript through that brick.\n\n01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.340\nYou call the brain.\n\n01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.820\nAnd then you're going to complain.\n\n01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:38.380\nYou're going to ask if you can take it out.\n\n01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.180\nThe next time they put it up on the net,\n\n01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:42.700\nyou're going to say, uh, that thing I'd rather forget.\n\n01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.780\nCan we take the rap out?\n\n01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:44.700\nWe do it yet?\n\n01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:46.340\nI just don't want to hear from people telling me\n\n01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.140\nthat there was something I said, that they could get\n\n01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:51.060\nthe smell on me, that I was trying too hard in the backyard.\n\n01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.100\nI bought the milkshake, but it had lard.\n\n01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.700\nAnd it was all curdled.\n\n01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:56.140\nYeah, I don't want to be that way.\n\n01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:58.020\nSo I think I did it right.\n\n01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.180\nBut now that I did, that's why I kept rapping tonight.\n\n01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:02.580\nSo when I get in the car, I think about the rap.\n\n01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:05.300\nThis is the thing that I did that's crap,\n\n01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.140\nto make it off balance, to make it strange.\n\n01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:09.140\nIt's got to be strange.\n\n01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:12.620\nSo tomorrow is a new day, a new direction, a new way.\n\n01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:13.340\nI got to improve.\n\n01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.100\nI got to change.\n\n01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.260\nI did it too well tonight.\n\n01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.140\nThat wraps my brain.\n\n01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:17.460\nI got to get in the tub and wonder\n\n01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.660\nwhat I can write to tell you.\n\n01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:20.180\nCan you take a couple things out tonight?\n\n01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.180\nBecause I don't like two legs.\n\n01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180\nI don't like four legs.\n\n01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:24.820\nI don't like even pecs.\n\n01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.740\nI like shit missing.\n\n01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.460\nThat's when my brain goes, listen, out.\n\n01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:32.660\nOoh, opioid love, uh, up there in the tub, uh.\n\n01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:37.260\nHoly fuck, John, you just blew our fucking mind.\n\n01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:39.260\nYou buried the lead.\n\n01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:41.740\nYou fucking rap good.\n\n01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.340\nI'm embarrassed that I did it in front of you.\n\n01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.700\nYou can never come back
