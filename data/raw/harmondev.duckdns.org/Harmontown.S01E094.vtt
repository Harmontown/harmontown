{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nTeryl Audio\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:22.000\nLive from Austin, Texas and taught by Southwest Festival\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:30.000\nMy deep, deep pleasure to announce that Harmontown is now in session\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:36.000\nPlease welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:48.000\nThank you\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:50.000\nThank you very much\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:54.000\nHello Austin, how many of you from Austin?\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:59.000\nWow, okay that's great, that's nice, that's a cool city and they seem like good people\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nThis is the best town, I love it\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:06.000\nYeah, I mean we would normally say that in any city but we would be lying in most of them\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:10.000\nAustin is definitely always enchanting, you know what they call it Jeff?\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:13.000\nThey call it the San Francisco of Texas\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:14.000\nIs that true?\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nYeah, I do, I call it that\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:21.000\nThere's some facts about Austin, the typewriter was invented here\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:29.000\nIn 1842 it went to war with Oklahoma and won\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:33.000\nBecause they wanted it to be shaped like Texas\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:40.000\nAnd Oklahoma wanted to kind of like change the top square part of Texas and just be a box\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:46.000\nBut Oklahoma has to be shaped like a saucepan because Texas won\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nThe right to be shaped like Texas\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nGood job, what a great state, what a big great state\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nYou can see it from outer space\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:58.000\nIt's the only state that you can see from outer space\n\n01:58.000 --> 02:03.000\nIt's the only one that Google satellite maps can actually identify as a state\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:09.000\nIt's three times bigger than the Great Wall of China coiled up into a Texas shape\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.000\nThey just started allowing Asians in here as well\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nThey just started\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:20.000\nI think it's very progressive of you guys to finally make that leap\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:24.000\nTexas is one of the pioneers of Asian immigration\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:28.000\nThe song Yellow Rose of Texas is actually\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nAbout a lady named Rose\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:32.000\nIt's code for Asian\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:38.000\nGive me your Asian weary, your Asian huddled masses yearning to breathe free\n\n02:38.000 --> 02:42.000\nIn a big giant state you can see from outer space like your stupid Great Wall\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:45.000\nAnyway, but we don't want to localize the show\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nWe want to give you a taste of Harmontown as we do it in Los Angeles\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\nIn the back of a quiet comic book store\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:59.000\nWe're gathered here, we're podcasting live through YouTube\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nHey bar people, shut up\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:04.000\nNo, I mean, too much\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nThat doesn't matter\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:08.000\nIt kind of worked\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:13.000\nWe love you bar people\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:18.000\nOne of the perils of podcasting live is that YouTube has automated bots and drones\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nThat are detecting the music that we were playing\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nI was going to play some kick-ass local country music\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nBut we were afraid that it would shut down the podcast\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:28.000\nYeah, it detects copyrighted music\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:31.000\nSo we were playing some of our friends' bands\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:34.000\nDustin Marshall, our producer, has some friends with bands\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd you probably couldn't tell it from real music\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:41.000\nYou probably thought it was real music, didn't you?\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nWhere's the camera? Who's shooting this?\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nRight there?\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nJust some deal with the handheld thing?\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:50.000\nOn a VHS from 1978\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:51.000\nNo, it's it\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.000\nWow\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:55.000\nJeff's confused, we're not podcasting it video live\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:57.000\nOh, I thought it was actually video for YouTube as well\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nNo, no, you can do whatever you want physically\n\n03:59.000 --> 04:00.000\nWhatever you wanted to do\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nSo I should put my pass back on\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:05.000\nWhatever you felt you weren't allowed to do\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\nI don't know how technologies work\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nWe're here at South by Southwest\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:11.000\nBecause we're premiering the Harmontown documentary tonight\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:16.000\nIt's going to be good\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:17.000\nSpencer hasn't seen it\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nIt's amazing that Spencer hasn't seen it\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nBecause he's essentially the star of it\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nSpencer, I told him we had lunch today\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nSpencer and I had a nice little date this afternoon\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:27.000\nWe went to a photo booth, it was very romantic\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nA couple of people walking down the road saw Spencer\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\nThey were like, Spencer! Spencer!\n\n04:32.000 --> 04:34.000\nIt's going to fucking change everything for that guy\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nYeah, Jesus\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:40.000\nI had lunch with the guys that literally started\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:42.000\nKickstarter today\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nI have a wireless mic, Dan\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:46.000\nSo go on, I'm going to go retrieve my beer\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:47.000\nOkay\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nI'm going to test the limits of this microphone\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nThis is called crowd work\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nJeff, we're sending them out like an aqua knot\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:54.000\nHello, good to see you\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:55.000\nGood to see you\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:56.000\nPardon me\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nGet out of my way\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:58.000\nSorry, sorry\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:01.000\nThere you are, you little devil\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.000\nGo on, Dan\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\nHow far can you go?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:04.000\nHuh?\n\n05:04.000 --> 05:05.000\nFind out how far you can go\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:06.000\nShould we find out?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:07.000\nYeah\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:08.000\nLet's take it to the back\n\n05:08.000 --> 05:09.000\nAll right\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nIt's all right by that bar, people\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:12.000\nLet's check, check\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:13.000\nIt's still working, man\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:14.000\nWe can really get out\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.000\nWe can use this space\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:19.000\nI'm playing, I clicked a cue\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.000\nHello, how are you?\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:21.000\nCan I get you guys anything?\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nYou guys are good?\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nLike a dessert cart?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:26.000\nYeah, we can hear you\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:27.000\nI love it\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:28.000\nYeah\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:32.000\nSay something\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:33.000\nI'm out of material\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nCan you go outside on the street?\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nSee, I'm going to go outside\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:38.000\nCan I go with my beer?\n\n05:38.000 --> 05:40.000\nI'm going to leave my beer here\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:41.000\nAll right\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:42.000\nCheck\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:44.000\nClap if you can still hear me\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nCan you still hear me?\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nCheck, one, two\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nOne, two\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:49.000\nWow\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nHe sounds bad\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:56.000\nHe's out on rainy street\n\n05:56.000 --> 05:57.000\nFucking awesome\n\n05:58.000 --> 05:59.000\nI love this\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nOh, he can't hear us, though\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nLet's all pretend like we fell asleep\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nIt's very exciting\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nI told them I'll pretend like they fell asleep\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:12.000\nAll right\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nThat was a dumb joke to engineer\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:15.000\nOn the fly\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nGood job, Jeff\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:18.000\nSay what?\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nOh, my fucking beer, thank you, guys\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:21.000\nGod bless you, sir\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nThat's Tony\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:26.000\nI, yeah\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nSo it's been weird\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nThis movie has been looming in my life\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:33.000\nFor a long time\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nAnd I've well deserved it\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nBecause I was the one who was narcissistic enough to say\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:41.000\nMaybe we should make a movie about me\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.000\nBeing a narcissist\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nAnd I hired this great guy\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:46.000\nWell, I didn't hire him\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\nThat's probably a misnomer\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:50.000\nKind of partnered with Neil Berkeley\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:52.000\nAnd had to agree with him\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nLike, you know, I can't tell you how to make your movie\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nSo it's, you know, it doesn't show you\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nWhat a genius I am\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:04.000\nOn the level that I think I am\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:05.000\nRight\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:06.000\nIt shows you what a genius I am\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:09.000\nProbably kind of what's in reality\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nLike it just kind of shows me as a\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nJust sort of a fat drunk asshole\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nWhich is fine\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nBecause I'd rather be a bad person\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nThan make a bad documentary\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:24.000\nAnd I think that one of the most important ingredients\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.000\nOf a good documentary is a bad person\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nI think that's what you really, like, you need\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nSo we put Spencer in there\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nAnd he gets to be a good person\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nBut there's a lot to talk about\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:40.000\nIf we were doing a regular Harmontown show\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:44.000\nI would do some corrections\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.000\nI would do a correction segment right now\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:51.000\nOkay, can you play a sound cue for that?\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nCorrections!\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:56.000\nYo, yo, corrections\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.000\nSometimes I get things wrong\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nPeople correct me all day long\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nThey tell me you did it wrong\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nThat's why I'm doing the corrections song\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nCorrections\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nAustin loves, yeah, correction\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nAustin, Austin\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nYou're gonna get some entertainment tonight\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nThis show is no joke\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nYou're leaving here entertained\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nHow many of you are going to the movie later?\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nWho among you wanted to go to the movie but can't?\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nThat's a weird reaction\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:38.000\nHow many of you can't because of scheduling conflicts?\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nOkay, so you really just can't\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:43.000\nIs that being there turning people away?\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nIs it sold out?\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nOh, badges only\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nSo you guys don't have badges\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nStinking badges\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nElitism, what?\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:57.000\nWell, if you buy a ticket, do you still need a badge?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:02.000\nThere's a guy yelling out\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:04.000\nI wonder, Dan, if you and I will need our badges\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nWe should just give someone that looks a little bit like us our badge\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nYou can certainly give two people badges\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nI don't know if you guys got those badges\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nYou have to take the face recognition photo\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nIt wouldn't recognize my face\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nI could be Nick Nolte, I could be anybody in that photo\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.000\nBut I think I have five tickets in my pocket\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:23.000\nWe'll try to, I don't know if you don't need badges\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nBut you do need a ticket and we'll try to figure out a way\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nTo give them to the people that are most deserving\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nI say physical combat\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:33.000\nI'm just gonna break a big Texas-sized pool cube\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nAnd leave it on the floor\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nAnd walk out of the room\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nAlright\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nSo I said that Stan Winston looked great\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.000\nOn King of the Nerds on TBS\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nHe's been dead since 2006\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nCorrections!\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nYo, yo\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nI said a corpse looked great\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nHe was a dead person\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nHe's been dead for almost a decade\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd I said he looked great\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nCorrections\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nSomeone tweeted me who worked with Stan Winston\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:10.000\nI was like, he's been dead since 2006\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:12.000\nWho are you confusing him with?\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.000\nA guy that works at Stan Winston Studios\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nWhich, you know, made the poor choice to keep his name\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:21.000\nI mean, what business president is there there?\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nOh, Walt Disney\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nAnd I just assumed he was Stan Winston\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nI don't want to throw Aaron under the bus\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:30.000\nBut Aaron, I said, is that Stan Winston?\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:32.000\nAnd Aaron said yes\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nAnd she doesn't know who that is\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nShe's 29\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:39.000\nShe thinks that the Challenger Shuttle\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nIs the one we took from the hotel\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.000\nMake it fun of my young girlfriend\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.000\nIf being young is a crime\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:58.000\nWhy do I always brag about it?\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nAlright, so speaking of being young\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nIt's America's a young country, Jeff\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:08.000\nAnd as you know, it was built on the backs of unpaid labor\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:12.000\nI just made a good Freudian slip\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:16.000\nAn appropriate, it was built on the...\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.000\nI once said in the podcast\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:24.000\nThat America was the first country to make slavery illegal\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:26.000\nI was like, yeah, come on, look at the bright side\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.000\nSomebody tweeted me, you're full of shit\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:30.000\nIt's like way the opposite\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:32.000\nTerrible, terrible\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:34.000\nWe were doing it until yesterday\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.000\nAnd we hung onto it as long as we could\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nI think Italy outlawed it a long time ago\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:42.000\nWe were like, it's fine\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.000\nSo, sorry about that\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nEveryone\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:49.000\nWhat a bad thing to be wrong about\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:53.000\nI think I already corrected this one\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nBut I once said that the TSA was a private company\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.000\nAnd not a government agency\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nAgain, I don't want to throw her into the bus\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nBut Aaron\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:04.000\nAaron told me that\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:06.000\nAnd I just believed her\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nI don't Google anything Aaron says\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nIf I did, my IQ would go up like a thousand points\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:14.000\nI just believe everything she says\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.000\nBecause she's a woman and she's supposed to fill me\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nWith knowledge and life\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:20.000\nShe's my muse, so I'm like, oh really?\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:23.000\nOkay, I'll say that to everyone\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nThat's not a private company\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:28.000\nHowever, they can still go fuck themselves, right?\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nI don't know\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:32.000\nWell, they keep the nice people safe\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nWhen you're getting on the plane\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:36.000\nI'll take an airport by airport basis\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:38.000\nBecause some airports are cool\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\nAnd some airports are full of A-holes\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:42.000\nI don't know why they don't smile a little bit\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:44.000\nHave you guys flown in or out of Philadelphia?\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nFuck those TSA people, they're the worst\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nFuck Philadelphia TSA\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nAnybody in Philadelphia?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:53.000\nGet out, leave, sir\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nThe city of Brotherly\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nHurry up and take your shoes off\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nYou're from Philly, sir?\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nIs it just me or is it the angriest town in the world?\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nPeople are pretty angry there\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nTSA, yeah, that airport, wow\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:08.000\nNot good\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nIs it me or was that thing that happened in LA\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\nWhere a guy came into the airport and shot the whole thing up\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\nAnd shot a TSA guy, it was like\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.000\nThat didn't really get publicized that much\n\n13:16.000 --> 13:18.000\nWas that sort of a...\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nWhat airport was that?\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.000\nIt was LAX\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nWas it LAX?\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nOur airport\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nIt was a big deal for like a day and a half\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nKind of to some people\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd then it just went away\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nDid Aaron tell you that?\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nMaybe, I don't know, I should Google it\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:35.000\nAlright, that's the end of the correction segment\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.000\nYo, yo, now everything's gonna be right\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:41.000\nEverything I say is gonna be day or night\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nThere's nothing more right than that\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:46.000\nI fucked your mama cause she's not fat\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.000\nBut if she was, I'd still fuck her\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:52.000\nBecause you're a gentleman\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nYes\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:58.000\nCause I don't believe in socializing women\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.000\nTo be ashamed of their bodies\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:02.000\nI would fuck your mama no matter what\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:07.000\nI think it's shitty the way we treat our women\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd I will always be there for your mama\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nI like that there's people eating over there\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nThat have nothing to do with the show\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nThey're having chicken wings and you're talking about\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:18.000\nNo, yeah, they're just hanging out like Seth Rogen made a comic book\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:21.000\nOr something and they're like in the back waiting for it to be unveiled\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:24.000\nI got off the plane here at Austin International Airport\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nWhatever you call it\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:28.000\nAnd there's, you know how the people are waiting there with placards\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:30.000\nFor people that have like a car service\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:33.000\nAnd they'll say like S Thompson or J Anderson\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.000\nThere was a woman, a young gal\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:40.000\nHolding a sign the size of like a movie poster\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:43.000\nAnd in a font that was bigger than the font\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nThey used to announce the end of World War II\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:48.000\nSeth Rogen\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:50.000\nLike everyone else had a regular size thing\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:52.000\nIt's like give the guy a break\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.000\nAlso I found out today he flew in today\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.000\nThat was yesterday\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.000\nSomebody was fucking around\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.000\nSomebody was hoping Seth Rogen would just wander into their car\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:04.000\nIt was like Sandra Bernhardt and King of Comedy\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nLike she was just waiting\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:08.000\nSeth Rogen maybe\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:11.000\nShe probably had a couple behind that that were like\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nBarack Obama\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:17.000\nI'll take what I can get\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:20.000\nAlright let's do a new segment Jeff\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nDo you want the same musical cue or\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:24.000\nLet's do a different one\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:27.000\nThis segment is called\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nForrest Controversy\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:35.000\nForrest Controversy let's do\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:39.000\nForrest Controversy\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd we're going to argue about something\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nThat I decided to argue about\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nThat's not really an issue\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:48.000\nBut I'm deciding to make it an issue\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:51.000\nForrest Controversy\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:53.000\nAlright\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nThe show has it all you guys\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nThe show we're singing, we're dancing\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nI went outside\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:04.000\nThat's groundbreaking entertainment\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:07.000\nPetty cabs\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:10.000\nThe bicycle rickshaw things that you have here in this town\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nThey have them in San Francisco during Comic Con\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nYou get into a backseat of a big tricycle\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nAnd a guy drives you around\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nOr a girl\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nThey make me very uncomfortable\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nI don't like to use them\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nWhy?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\nI'm too close to the actual capitalism\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nIt's just like you\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nYou're also right up somebody's ass\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nYou have a butt right in your face the entire ride\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:38.000\nIt's too weird to be close enough\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:41.000\nTo a place that someone can bike you\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:44.000\nBut you choose not to walk\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:47.000\nSo they have to bike extra people\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nThat's weird\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:52.000\nI took one yesterday from the east side over there\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:56.000\nFrom that little yellow jacket social club\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.000\nThat plays rules\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.000\nYou couldn't get a cab\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nWe were promised when we came here\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nThere's a company called Uber\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nThat is like a private cab company\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:08.000\nYeah, fuck Uber\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.000\nThey're a sponsor\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:12.000\nFuck you\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nIf you don't know who Uber is\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:16.000\nI'm here to tell you that they're a bad company\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:18.000\nThey should be ashamed of themselves\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nI'll foot that 15 grand\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nFine\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:26.000\nI've made over songs in community\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.000\nI'll just write that check\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nOkay, good\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nI took a little cab\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nAt my height, a little tiny petite little thing\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nAnd she drove me and she was very cool\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nAnd I wanted to go somewhere that was pretty far\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\nBut you cannot get a taxi in this town right now\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nYou cannot get into a vehicle\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nAnd even if you do, you can't make it anywhere\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nSo the petty cab is kind of convenient\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nIt's convenient and that's why I said artificial controversy\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:52.000\nI'm sure it's a good thing\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:56.000\nI feel weird as a 41-year-old man\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:59.000\nClimbing my fat ass onto a bike\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:03.000\nAnd going like, you walk\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nYou walk for me\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:09.000\nMake your feet do more for my feet\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nI came from the east side\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nCame to the convention center\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:13.000\nWhich I think is right across the street\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:14.000\nTo get my badge\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.000\nAnd I ran a dispenser\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nIt's a dispenser and I were right in the same line together\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nI go, hey, I'm going to go to this other bar\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nFarther west side of town\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.000\nAnd I got this gal waiting outside in this petty cab\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nSo we get in it\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nAnd about two blocks later\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nA guy pulls up alongside her in another petty cab\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:31.000\nAnd she goes, hey, Eric, you want to do switchies?\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.000\nWe just got into his\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.000\nAnd he took over, especially like, yeah\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nI'm pretty uncomfortable about that\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nHe's like, we did double the weight\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nYou know, that was kind of...\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nYeah, and I was like, well someone else\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:49.000\nLike Aaron and I walked past a group of people\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nThat were coming out of a restaurant\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nAnd this young lady who had had a few margaritas\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nWith lunch was like, she just came out\n\n18:56.000 --> 19:00.000\nAnd I was just like, petty cab, petty cab\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nShe was just yelling it out\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nThen a guy came over\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:06.000\nAnd she's like, hello\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:07.000\nShe just yelled it out\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nAnd then she started talking to him about his rates\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:10.000\nBefore she...\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nShe was like, is it still $5?\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nAnd he was like, well, it's $5 of you, blah, blah, blah\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nAnd she's like, okay\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.000\nAnd got out and I was like, that's...\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.000\nI don't want to be that\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nThat was like the bellock to my Indiana\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nLike I didn't want...\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nI felt like I needed to confront that character\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nThat's why they call it a petty cab\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nI know, that's the thing\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nThat's also the word petty\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nIt's like, really, the emperor's clothes\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nAre just down the toilet\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nI just want to see something\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nBecause from up here\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nAnd I'm fine with this\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nBecause I've been through worse\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nUp here, it sounds like\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nAbsolutely no one in this room\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:46.000\nCan hear us at all\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:48.000\nAnd no one's listening\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nAnd everyone's just talking\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:53.000\nOkay, so you can hear me fine\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:54.000\nYou can hear me fine\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:55.000\nI just want...\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nI have weird OCD\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nI want to verify that\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nCan you keep talking, Jeff?\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nI just want to go back and...\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:06.000\nI want to know what it's like to be at this show\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nWandering amongst you like a lowland gorilla\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:11.000\nTo me, it seems like it's like being at LAX\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nOkay, these guys are just hanging out\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:14.000\nTalking, they're just talking\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.000\nThis guy's just pointing at his phone\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.000\nHe's telling these guys, you should look at my phone\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:20.000\nYou were drinking with me?\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.000\nI was blacked out\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nYou're trying to take advantage of my alcoholism\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nLike you could just tell me that\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:29.000\nWhat are you guys doing at South by Southwest?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nAre you premiering a film?\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nYes, yes\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nWill you tell the people?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nHave you all ever heard of Bitcoin?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:38.000\nBitcoin?\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:39.000\nYou all heard of Bitcoin?\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nOkay, if you heard of Bitcoin\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nYou know right now you can't get an iOS wallet\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nIn the Bitcoin store\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nI mean in the iOS store, right?\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nCome talk to me, alright?\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nAnd I can get you a Bitcoin wallet\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nRight now for your iPhone application\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:58.000\nWhat sort of weird hustles going on over there?\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nYou can't just hijack our show\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:01.000\nHold on, hold on\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:02.000\nOh shit, he's standing up\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nGod damn it\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nHold on\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nGod damn it\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:06.000\nLet me, if you want me to come up on stage\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nGet up here, get up here\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nCome up on stage\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:09.000\nAlright\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nAlright, here we go\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nHey, check this out, okay?\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nSo it's nothing illegitimate\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:20.000\nOkay\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nSomebody call the police\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nCall the police\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nAlright\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nYou smell great\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nI know I smell great\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nYou smell really good\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:29.000\nI gotta smell great\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nWhen you go back to the crowd eventually\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nI want everyone to take a little whiff of this guy\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:34.000\nEverybody smell me\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nYou smell like a fucking pantry\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nSmell me, okay\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nI'm gonna do it really quick, okay?\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:40.000\nFucking break it down\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:41.000\nIt's not illegitimate, okay?\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nWe're within the Apple\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nEnterprise developer solution\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:46.000\nBecause when you join\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nAnd when you get our application\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:50.000\nYou become a member\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nOf our cooperative, okay?\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nOf our prerogative?\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nCooperative\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.000\nOh God damn it\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nIt's not cooperative\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nNow check this out\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nYou can sue who you want to sue\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:00.000\nCooperatives, cooperatives\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:01.000\nListen, hold on, hold on\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nCooperatives were like a big thing a while ago\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nBecause people worked together\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nSo we built a cooperative\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:09.000\nTo allow all of us to work together with Bitcoin\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nFor the people who have our wallet\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:12.000\nTo get paid\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:13.000\nYou understand what I'm saying?\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:14.000\nSo it's like\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:15.000\nDistribution of wealth\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nWithout distribution of wealth\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nBecause the reason why we did it\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:20.000\nCan I do it real quick?\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.000\nIn this country\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nThe stage is all yours right?\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nThat's what's up\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nYou have the floor\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nThat's what's up, alright?\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nSo in this country\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:30.000\nWe feel like that it was an injustice, okay?\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nIt's an injustice that the country\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:34.000\nAdvertises a lottery\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:35.000\nTo the poorest people\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nYes, yes, yes\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nThat's injustice\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:38.000\nNow you got me on board\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:40.000\nYeah, that's injustice\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nSo check this out\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:43.000\nBut those same poor people\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nCan't invest in early stage startups\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.000\nThat's stupid\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nSo you tell poor people\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nHere, go invest in this lottery\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nSomebody got to win\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nIt might as well be you\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nBut you can't take that same money\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nAnd invest it in people, right?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nThat are right in your neighborhood\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.000\nRight\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nThere you go\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.000\nSo what we figured out is\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:06.000\nWhat we did was\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nWe said, okay\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nIf you have this situation\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:10.000\nWhere you have a cooperative\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nThat owns a piece of a company\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:13.000\nNow the cooperative\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nCan get paid from the company\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:16.000\nAnd the people who own\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:17.000\nThe part of the cooperative\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nGet the same benefits\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nAs early stage investors\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd it's all legal\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nIt's all legal\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nSo that's our spiel\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\nIf you want to get\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.000\nIn the cooperative\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:29.000\nIt's a free trial\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:30.000\nFor South by Southwest\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:32.000\nI'm down here in Harmontown\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nChilling\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nAnd guess what?\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nI'm going to let y'all know something\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nWhat's the major street name\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nIn Austin?\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nCesar Chavez\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nNo\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nTrinity\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nThat's where the L\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nThat's my name\n\n23:45.000 -->

Wilson\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:02.000\nAlright\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat's what's up\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nAlright\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nCheck it out\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:06.000\nThank you Lamar\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:07.000\nI'm going to sit down\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nThank you\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nThank you very much\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:10.000\nFor coming back here\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:11.000\nNo problem\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:12.000\nLamar Austin everybody\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nLamar Austin Wilson\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nSmell that guy\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nIt's a cooperative\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.000\nSmell him\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.000\nEverybody smell him\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nHe smells like a delicious forest\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nA delicious forest\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.000\nYeah\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:26.000\nI want to nestle near him\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nLamar Austin Houston\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nWilson\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nWilson\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nLamar Austin Wilson\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nThat was the best\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nAgain\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nI only have one question\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nWhat?\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nAll of that stuff was great\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nIt's a cooperative Bitcoin\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nLike get in on the ground floor\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nGather people's money\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nIf Bitcoin's a real thing\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:44.000\nThen it's a real currency\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:46.000\nLet's let people get involved in it\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nFrom the ground floor\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nThat aren't speculators\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nAnd carpet baggers\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nMy only question is\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:52.000\nWhy is he having a meeting about it\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:55.000\nIn the back of my fucking show?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nIt turned out fine\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nMaybe he's the shrewdest businessman of all time\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nWhen he knew there'd be a platform\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:04.000\nWhat if this was the cure for cancer podcast?\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:07.000\nWhat if I was trying to cure cancer\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:10.000\nAnd he's talking about fucking Bitcoin in the back\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:12.000\nThat would be a crime\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:15.000\nHe's lucky I have nothing to do tonight\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.000\nYou have no agendas\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:18.000\nI'm watching a movie about you\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:20.000\nI'm open\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nI'm fine\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.000\nEveryone here is on a higher moral high ground\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nThat's true\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nEvery documentary is about like\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nProbably\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nAbout saving the world\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nIt's a documentary about abortion\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nIt's a documentary about\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nI don't know\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nI can't rattle them off\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.000\nBecause I don't care\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nEvery documentary is largely a documentary\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nAbout us singing songs about dicks and balls\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nFor a month\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nYeah\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nThat was one of the big things that Neil\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nThe director regretted cutting out\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nWas the Pringles dick song\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nAnd the chicken noodle dick song\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nBut special features\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:56.000\nIt's a little over 90 minutes\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nThe documentary\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nBelieve me\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nThe guys\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nHe claims\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nHe's got a four hour version of the documentary\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nThat I'm sure we'll all get to see one day\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:06.000\nYeah\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nHe's also got 650 hours of everything\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nWe were talking\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nNeil and I\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.000\nAnd he was saying that\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nHe could put out the entire long version\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.000\nBecause some of the fans\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nThey'll probably cut together a better movie\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:19.000\nThan I made\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.000\nBecause that's how our fans are\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:21.000\nYeah\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nWe should just dump the entire\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\n500, 700 hours of all the footage\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nAnd let one of you weirdos\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nJust get in it\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:31.000\nAnd make like the perfect cut of it\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:32.000\nShould we bring Neil up here?\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nYeah, let's bring Neil\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nLooking good, baby\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nNeil Berkley\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.000\nLadies, feast your eyes\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:48.000\nOh, wow\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nOkay\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nYou said at the hotel\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nYou're like, we can't share an Uber\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:52.000\nBecause you got to change\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:53.000\nAnd we made fun of you\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nBut holy cow\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nYou changed\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:57.000\nThanks for bringing me up after Lamar\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nYeah\n\n26:58.000 --> 26:59.000\nHard to follow\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nBut the room got quiet\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nSo the way it works is\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nFor those of you who are just listening\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nThere's no way to express\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nHow dynamic that guy was on stage\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nHe took over the room\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:12.000\nWhatever you're doing Lamar\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.000\nI'm in, I'm in\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nHe took over the room\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nAnd then after he left\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nEverything got quieter\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nI don't think that's because\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nHe was making the noise\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nI think it's because everyone was like\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nI'm into it\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nI'm into Bitcoin\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nI think they're like\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nI think they're online\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nTrying to find out more about Bitcoin\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nHe made a good case\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nBut this is Neil Berkley\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nThroughout the movie is largely a ghost\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nBecause he's a good documentarian\n\n27:36.000 --> 27:38.000\nAs much as we were all stuck together on a bus\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.000\nWe want to incorporate the crew\n\n27:40.000 --> 27:42.000\nAnd the director and everybody\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nBecause we're all trapped\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nIn one vehicle for a month\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:48.000\nHe kind of insisted on being his ghostly figure\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nI was talking to the producer earlier\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:51.000\nAnd I said, I'm very nervous\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:52.000\nI hope people like this movie\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\nAnd he goes, do you know where you're showing it?\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:55.000\nIt's like asking kindergartners\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nDo they like these cupcakes?\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:58.000\nAll right\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:00.000\nI mean, not that you guys are easy\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.000\nOr anything\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nIt's just that you're driven\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nMainly by naps and sugar\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nBut yeah, I hope\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nI've been, I mean\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.000\nFor the last over a year\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\nWe've been living in a world\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nWhere this movie hasn't come out yet\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nAnd now we've, I don't care\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:18.000\nIf they hate it or love it\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nBut I can't wait to move\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:21.000\nAcross a threshold into a world\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\nWhere other people have seen this thing\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:25.000\nBecause I don't have no idea\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nI'm usually in total control\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:28.000\nOver how people see me\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:30.000\nWhether it seems from a distance\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.000\nLike I'm making an ass of myself\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:33.000\nI'm crucifying myself\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nI'm attacking others\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nI'm attacking myself\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.000\nIt's all my big control-free game\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nLike I'm always just going\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.000\nI control what happens\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nIf you come to shoot me\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:44.000\nYour bullets gonna go through\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:45.000\nA bigger hole than I blew\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nMoments before you came in the door\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nAnd that's how I like it\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nBut this movie is like\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nI fucked up\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI hired a great filmmaker\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nI had to make a deal with him\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nI got no control over this thing\n\n28:58.000 --> 28:59.000\nI have no idea\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nWhether it's good or bad\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nBecause I watch it\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nAnd I'm in it\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:04.000\nAnd I'm a narcissist\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nSo I love it\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.000\nBut at the same time\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:07.000\nI hate myself\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nSo I'm like\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nThis must be stupid\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nBecause I'm in it all the time\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:14.000\nMy line, what I tell people is\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:15.000\nWhy I think it's interesting\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nAnd why I made it was\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:18.000\nIt's not to decide\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:19.000\nWhether you love or hate Dan\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nIt's not about that\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:21.000\nIt's about understanding\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nWhy there's a roomful of people\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:24.000\nWatching him\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:25.000\nAnd listening to him talk\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nBecause you are all here\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.000\nBecause he speaks to you\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:29.000\nHe does something\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nThat you all are reacting to\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:32.000\nIt's explaining that\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nSo it's your fault\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nIt's all of your fault\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:38.000\nFor me, the movie really is not\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nNot about Dan\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nNot about our show\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.000\nIt's about Bitcoin\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:46.000\nThe show is never going to\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nReally recover from him\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nLeading the stage, is it?\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nWell, that's like saying\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nThis island is never going to recover\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:54.000\nFrom this papaya\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nI mean, you're right\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nWe should base this fucking industry on it\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nI was going to say\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nThe movie is about the fans of the show\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nBecause there's a group of people\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nThat showed up\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:06.000\nActually, what's your name right there\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nWith the beard and the glasses?\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nAndy\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nAndy, you want to come up for a second?\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.000\nOh, Andy Young, yeah\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:12.000\nAndy, come up\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nBecause this guy...\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nAndy Young\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nI want to apologize to Andy\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:19.000\nHe shot some footage\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:22.000\nWe didn't get to use any of it in the movie\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nAnd I'm very sorry\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nI'm very sorry about that\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nOne of the dudes told me\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nI was like, I'm going to go\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nWait, he did it though, isn't he?\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nI mean, he's...\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:30.000\nAndy's in the movie\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.000\nAndy came to the show that we did in Austin\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:33.000\nDuring the tour\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:34.000\nYes, you're in the movie\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:35.000\nYou're in the movie\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:36.000\nAnd he came back\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:37.000\nWas it your girlfriend or just female friend?\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.000\nNo, just a friend\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:39.000\nIs a shooter for me, Tennille\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.000\nTennille, right\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:41.000\nAnd they came back\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nAnd they did this really beautiful interview\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nAnd it was like\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nThat was pretty early on in our tour\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nAnd you came back with this\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:47.000\nGiant smile on your face\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:50.000\nAnd she had this great smile on her face\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:51.000\nAnd there's a really cool shot\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:52.000\nIn the documentary\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:53.000\nWhen you guys leave\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nOur green room\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.000\nThey walk out\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:58.000\nAnd you...\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nI think she's shooting you, right?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:00.000\nRight, yeah\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:02.000\nIs that in the film?\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:03.000\nHe gives this look\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nLike he just met the Rolling Stones\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nAnd it was so good\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:07.000\nAnd it's just like\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:08.000\nWe didn't do anything\n\n31:08.000 --> 31:09.000\nExcept to do our little show\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nBut there's this weird sort of awesome love\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nThere's these little bits in the film\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nWhere there's straight to camera interviews\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nWith our harmonians\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nAnd that's...\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nI mean, I'm a crier\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:20.000\nI get really emotional\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:21.000\nAnd I watch that stuff\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.000\nEverybody that sees it\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:24.000\nAlways talks about being brought to tears\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nIn those moments\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nThere's something strange about that\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:28.000\nBecause it's not like\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nThere's anybody on camera saying\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nI lost my baby\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:35.000\nAnd I use Harmontown to...\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nIt's just humanity\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nIt's just people's faces\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nAnd they're just saying\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:44.000\nI feel like I'm allowed to be me\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:46.000\nBecause this guy's such an asshole\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:49.000\nSo I sent a tweet out to all the fans\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nSaying if you want to be in Harmontown\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:54.000\nShoot your experience of going to the show\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:56.000\nShoot what you would do that day\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nGoing to Harmontown\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nAnd Andy's the only person that did it\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:00.000\nAnd he's in the movie\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nSo you all could have been in Harmontown\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nI haven't seen it yet\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nI haven't seen it yet\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nIt sounds like I cry in the movie\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:08.000\nI hope I don't cry\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nNo, you don't cry\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nI mean, that looks super cool\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:14.000\nLook out and smile right now\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:16.000\nHe's fucking adorable, right?\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:19.000\nSo that happens a lot throughout the movie\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:20.000\nWhere we meet people\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:22.000\nAnd there's just these...\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:24.000\nI don't even know if they know the camera's rolling\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:25.000\nThey're just kind of staring\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\nKind of absently into the lens\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:29.000\nAndy, now make a face like\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nYou just found out that you...\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.000\nYou're totally hungry\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:34.000\nAnd you're totally high\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nAnd you just found out that you forgot\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:39.000\nThat you put two Reese's Peanut Butter Cups\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nIn the freezer and you just found them\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nSo open the freezer jar\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:46.000\nAnd make that face at that moment of discovery\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:48.000\nThat's the face that he makes\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\nThat's the face!\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nAfter he interviews me\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:52.000\nThat was pretty much how I felt, yeah\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nWhich makes me feel like a bad person\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.000\nBecause I'm not worth that\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nI'm not a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nBut a freezer\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nNo, I think you are absolutely worth that\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nI think Neil made a great point of like\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nWhy people are in this room\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nBecause you make people want to get out of their chairs\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nAnd make something\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nAnd that's like why I was so interested\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nIn like, seeing the show\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nRight?\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nHow great is it to have them back on community?\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:12.000\nIt's amazing\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nThis town is full of awesome people\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nIn the movie\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.000\nAll the interviews are looking right in the camera\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:20.000\nVery Aero Morris\n\n33:20.000 --> 33:21.000\nI ripped that guy off\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nBecause, whatever\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nBut there's no lower thirds\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:27.000\nLike the fans right next to Ben Stiller\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:30.000\nHe is not more important than anyone else in the movie\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:32.000\nJack Black, Sarah Silverman\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:34.000\nIs right next to Andy and some fan\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.000\nNo one's name is down the corner\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nThey're all just people talking to the camera\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:40.000\nAndy, are you going to the movie?\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nOh, fuck yeah, I'll be there for sure, yeah\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.000\nDo you have a friend here\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nThat's not able to go to the movie\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:48.000\nBecause they don't have a ticket?\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nYeah, those dudes, I guess\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nYes, oh, of course, Dan\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nWell, it's two people\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:54.000\nYeah, oh, I'm going to fucking get mom here for this\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.000\nYeah, they're here somewhere\n\n33:56.000 --> 33:58.000\nYou guys, you have to make the face\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nWhen he gives them to you, you have to make the face\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:01.000\nEveryone's Andy's friend right now\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nMe! I love Andy\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nOh, that guy, yeah, of course\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nAll right, because they only have five of these\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nSo giving two to Andy Young\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nBecause he went to University of Texas\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nYeah, I'm so sorry about whoever\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nTries to mom me after this\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nYou're putting me in a really weird position\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nI'll get you, yeah, yeah\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nHow do these work? These are just like weird\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:22.000\nRipped apart when I got this thing\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:24.000\nThe sad part about this is that\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:27.000\nWhen Andy gets murdered in an alley later on\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nHe never got to see the movie\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:30.000\nYeah, yeah, we're going to\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:31.000\nThat's a double whammy\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nYeah, exactly, he didn't pan out\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:34.000\nThank you, Andy Young\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nWell, thank you guys, really appreciate it\n\n34:38.000 --> 34:40.000\nStoll of Harmontown, Andy Young\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:42.000\nBitcoin!\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nCooperative Bitcoin!\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nLamar!\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:47.000\nLamar!\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nI swear to God though, he's got a fucking point\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nI mean, not like that should be surprising\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nBut I think I get it\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nI'm not into economics, but I understand\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nLike, we keep arguing about Bitcoin\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nIn the writer's room at Rick and Morty\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nBut it's like, if this is an emergent currency\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nWhy are there people who\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nBarely have the internet\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.000\nWho are being locked out of it\n\n35:08.000 --> 35:10.000\nBefore it even fucking starts\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nIsn't that what his point is?\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:14.000\nLike, let's start like a credit union\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nWhere people can like, like, like\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nGet in on this shit\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nSo that if Bitcoin did turn into a thing\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nThat there would be people who were\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nPoor before it became a thing\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nThat as a result are now not poor\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nLet's make a new batch of\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nNuvo Reese\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:32.000\nI think that's what he meant\n\n35:32.000 --> 35:34.000\nIt's okay\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nIf I got that wrong\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:38.000\nTo be honest, I consider myself a good listener\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:40.000\nI was so dazzled by his scent\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.000\nThat I got to find out what\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:44.000\nDeodorant or Cologne?\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:46.000\nGod damn it, you kind of want to just nibble on it\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:48.000\nWhat if you found out that wasn't Cologne?\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:50.000\nWhat if that's what came out of Dartmouth?\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:52.000\nI think his sweat\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:54.000\nHis own sense of self worth\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:57.000\nOr then he's in the wrong business\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nLike, he should be bottling\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nLike the smell of Lamar Austin Wilson\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:06.000\nInstead, he's hooked into this Bitcoin thing\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:09.000\nBut he's cursed with this beautiful smell\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.000\nAlright, so what else is on the docket?\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:14.000\nLet me take a look at my...\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nNeil, what's your problem?\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nWhat do you want to talk about?\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nDid you know Stan Winston was dead?\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.000\nNo\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nOkay, do you like the TSA?\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:23.000\nNo\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:24.000\nOkay\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nOh, Neil, okay\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:28.000\nAlright, so I'm getting married to my fiancé\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:30.000\nRyan McGathey, who's in the movie\n\n36:32.000 --> 36:35.000\nI'm going to marry the fuck out of this woman\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:39.000\nAnd part of marrying the fuck out of somebody\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nUsually, traditionally\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:44.000\nIs like, you absorb them\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nInto your last name\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:49.000\nThe woman takes the last name of the man\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:52.000\nBut then in LA, especially among creatives, actors\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nAnd that kind of thing, they hyphenate\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nOh, I'm...\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nI'm Catherine Zeta\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nI'm going to marry\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:01.000\nTom Jones\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:02.000\nOliver Jones\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:05.000\nI'm going to become Catherine Zeta-Jones\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nI'm not giving up the Zeta\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nThat's probably not what happened with her\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:12.000\nBut, like, I need people to help me\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nWe don't know what to do\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:17.000\nI honestly don't want to force my last name on Aaron\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nAaron Harmon is a shitty name\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:23.000\nI don't\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:26.000\nHow about Dan and Aaron Lamar Austin Wilson\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nWhat about Dan McGathey?\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.000\nWell, I mean, there's that, but\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nI like Dan Harmon\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nI don't want to make her be Aaron Harmon\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nI don't want to be Dan McGathey\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nWhy don't you just keep your own names and not do that?\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nBecause what about the children?\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:44.000\nHuh?\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:45.000\nWhat are the children?\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nMake up an awesome last name\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nThen the middle name becomes McGathey or whatever\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nBut then what about their children?\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nWhat do we Spanish?\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:56.000\nThink about five generations from now\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:58.000\nThey're going to be like, my name is Ramon LaBea\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:01.000\nThat guy's in the movie\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:02.000\nWhat's up?\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.000\nThat guy's in the movie\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:04.000\nOh, in the front row?\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:05.000\nYeah\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:06.000\nAnyone here?\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:07.000\nI don't know\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nDo you know you're in the movie, sir, in the front row?\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nI don't know\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nThat's Mars, he's part of our police district\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.000\nMars is in the movie, yeah\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:15.000\nCongratulations\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:17.000\nStand up\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:20.000\nIf you would like to stand up, sorry\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:25.000\nI like your hair, a little dyed, toughed of hair\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:26.000\nI love that, it's very cool\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:29.000\nI like the idea of professional, keep your name\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nPersonal, take Harmon\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nAnd the kids get that\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nOh, so, okay\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:37.000\nYeah\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:38.000\nAlright\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:39.000\nI think that makes sense\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:40.000\nSorry, I missed that\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:41.000\nWhat was the pitch?\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:44.000\nYou can somehow compartmentalize your professional name\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nfrom your personal name\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:49.000\nAnd that the kids will just become Harmon's\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:51.000\nHyphenate\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nAnd the kids get her name\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nAlright, let's bring Erin up here because\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nYo, gonna marry this girl\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nGonna take her last name for a while\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:06.000\nShe's throwing t-shirts to the crowd\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.000\nErin McGatney saying it loud\n\n39:08.000 --> 39:11.000\nShe's gonna marry Dan Harmon soon\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nShe's gonna have a baby in her womb\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:16.000\nGonna, what are we gonna call that baby?\n\n39:16.000 --> 39:18.000\nI don't know, McGatney, maybe?\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nI just decided\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:24.000\nOkay\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:27.000\nI think that I'm going to\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:31.000\nI'm going to keep McGatney as my middle name\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nI'm gonna make Harmon my last name\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nAnd when we have children\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:39.000\nI'm gonna make a secret math and passageway\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nThat'll be like in their nursery\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nAnd they'll always see it there\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\nAnd it'll say McGatney Tunnel\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:49.000\nWe won't tell them that my maiden name is McGatney\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nBut then one day, we'll hire someone\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nTo come in as like a spray and say like\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nHey, psst\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nAnd he'll have eyeballs painted on his hands\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nSaffron, Saffron, over here\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:02.000\nSaffron, Saffron\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:04.000\nWe could talk about it later\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:06.000\nSaffron, Saffron, Cinnamon\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.000\nBoy and girl identical\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:11.000\nCinnamon, Tuparick, are you having strippers?\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nStickers\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:15.000\nTuparick, Harmon, McGatney\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nYou get in here right now\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:18.000\nApple\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:19.000\nSaffron\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:20.000\nYoda\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.000\nYou are due on the main stage right now\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:26.000\nAnd the hired actor will say\n\n40:26.000 --> 40:29.000\nHey, do you know you're special?\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:30.000\nAnd Saffron and Cinnamon will be like\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.000\nYes, yes, we know we're special\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:34.000\nWe know our father's like the most smart man in the world\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:36.000\nHe's told us a million times over\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:39.000\nIn that nursery book that he wrote especially for us\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nWe know that mom loves yarn\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:45.000\nAnd he'll be like\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nHey, no, here's a key\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nAnd there'll be a key to the passageway\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nAnd they'll go down the passageway\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:54.000\nAnd there'll be a room that will be illuminated by torches\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nWith like a giant banner that says\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nYou are in the gaffey\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nAnd they'll be like ashes\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nFor them to make ends on their forehead\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nAnd it will be like a secret club\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:08.000\nAnd then they'll find me sleeping\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nIn my\n\n41:12.000 --> 41:15.000\nAre you saving up for all the therapy time right now?\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nWhich sounds fucking horrifying\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:21.000\nDon't let your kids walk in a torchlet passageway\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.000\nThey'll find you sleeping in this tunnel in their nursery\n\n41:24.000 --> 41:26.000\nNo, no, no, I'll be in our room\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:29.000\nBut I'll be wearing one of those really beautiful\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nNicole Kidman dressing gowns\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nThat I imagine she wears\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:34.000\nFrom like Eyes Wide Shut?\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.000\nNo, from her life\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nI just imagine she wears night gowns\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nAnd they'll rouse me\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nAnd I'll say, yes, you are\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nYou're in the gaffey\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:46.000\nAnd so it'll be special\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:48.000\nIt'll be like the lady from the lake\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nYou know, I can make this a lot simpler\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nDon't have kids\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.000\nIt saves a lot of trouble\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nYou said that about a dog\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:57.000\nAnd you love our dog\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nYour dog's a weirdo, but I like him\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:02.000\nAll right\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nYeah, well, Neil's asking if we can tell a story\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:07.000\nAbout something\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nThe answer is yes, automatically\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:10.000\nWhat is it?\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nThe pickup shot\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:14.000\nAn idea you wear the same shirt\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:15.000\nFrom a year ago\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:16.000\nOh, Jesus Christ, Neil\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:17.000\nOkay, all right\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nI don't even bear it, I'm sorry\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nYeah, Neil, okay\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nHere's a dirty little secret about documentaries\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nYou shoot 650 hours\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.000\nYou edit it into 90 minutes\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:30.000\nAnd then depending on the structure of the 90 minutes\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:32.000\nYou may decide you need\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nLike maybe a shot, for instance\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nOf Dan Harmon leaving his house in the morning\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.000\nAnd that may be shot a year later\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nIn which case you try to match the shirt\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:45.000\nAnd if Dan Harmon has gained, let's say, 30 pounds\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nThat's how he'll find out\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nIs me walking down the sidewalk\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:56.000\nWith buttons flying off of my stomach\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nAs I move this way\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:02.000\nIt felt like I was too fat to play the role of myself\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:06.000\nTo be cast as myself\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.000\nHe came down and he said\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:10.000\nI'd like to think the cotton shrinks\n\n43:10.000 --> 43:12.000\nBut I think it's something else\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:15.000\nAnd then you sort of slowly squat down\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nUntil the shirt popped open\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nLike a treasure box\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nIt'd be great if you bent down fast enough\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nAnd the shirt just completely atomized\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nUntil you have missed\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:32.000\nI could just turn this\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nSpeaking of shirts and corrections\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:37.000\nWe have some shirts that are throughout some shirts\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nNice segue\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:44.000\nAnd I guess I've given Dan some wrong information\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:47.000\nBefore we went on tour, I suggested to Dan\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:50.000\nWe really should have merch on the tour\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nAnd Dan said, no, no, I don't want those people\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nTo have anything of me\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nAnd I said, no, I think they like you\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:57.000\nBig back and forth\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:01.000\nBut anyway, I designed all the t-shirts\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:04.000\nWith Jenny Fine artists and all the poster\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nShe did the art, I took the picture\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:09.000\nBut I was also put in charge of ordering all the shirts\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:12.000\nAnd I don't know how to order things\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:13.000\nAnd I was given a lot of advice\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nAnd I ordered a certain number of t-shirts\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nAnd there's a shot in the documentary\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:20.000\nYou'll see there's a shot with a ton of trash bags\n\n44:20.000 --> 44:22.000\nOutside of the bus\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nMore t-shirts than could fit on a bus\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:26.000\nAnd the bus driver said, look\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:29.000\nNo one, Van Halen doesn't have this many t-shirts\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nAnd I was like, no, no, no, you don't understand\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nAnd I was really stubborn\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nAnd I was yelling at this bus driver\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nWho's been on a thousand tours\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nTelling him that I knew everything about t-shirts\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:42.000\nWe sold a fifth of them\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nBut there are tons and tons of t-shirts\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:48.000\nBecause we didn't take Bitcoin\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nLamar off to a certain extent\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nIs the point of your story that we have a lot of t-shirts to give away?\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.000\nThe point of my story is that\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nSometimes I'm really sure about things that are incorrect\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:58.000\nBut also, Harmontown.com\n\n44:58.000 --> 45:00.000\nWe have a few left\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nWe have a few left\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.000\nWe have a few thousand shirts left\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nDid you already give away all the ones for tonight?\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:06.000\nThere are a few more\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nCasey is going to toss out some\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:10.000\nSorry, I couldn't really start\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nT-shirt tossing wrap\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nGive that guy in the backpack one, now you're\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:18.000\nWait, is there anybody here who feels\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:21.000\nMore deserving of a t-shirt than anybody else?\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nAlright, you miss, come up on stage\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:26.000\nMake your case, hold on to that Casey\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.000\nMiss, why do you feel that you deserve one of these\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nMore than the other people that want a t-shirt?\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nI don't know who Dan Harmon is\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:36.000\nI've never heard of him before\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nI've never watched Community\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:40.000\nAnd I'm here with my boyfriend who loves Dan Harmon\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:43.000\nAnd we walked towards 15 blocks in the rain\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nI didn't hear the last part\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nBut I hate myself enough to give her a t-shirt\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nI feel like she\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nYou did well, I feel that\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:54.000\nA lot of people might have said as much or more\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:56.000\nI feel that maybe you should wrap your case\n\n45:56.000 --> 46:00.000\nI feel that you should be able to wrap\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nYou should be able to wrap\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:05.000\n15 blocks in the rain, I don't know who Dan Harmon is\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:08.000\nMy boyfriend loves Dan Harmon\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nMy card is not waterproof\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:16.000\nAlright, that was a fiasco\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:19.000\nIf she was a child, this would be adorable\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nTriple X\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:24.000\nTiming and comedy is everything\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:25.000\nNow, what's your name?\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:26.000\nHeather\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nHeather, here's the thing, we have an XL\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:30.000\nAnd a triple XL left\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:32.000\nYou don't seem like any of the rest of us\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.000\nYou seem like a little tip of tea for that\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:35.000\nThe big one?\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:36.000\nOkay\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:37.000\nWhich one do you want, XL or triple X?\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:38.000\nTriple X\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:40.000\nDamn, alright\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:42.000\nThank you\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:44.000\nHeather, not even close\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:46.000\nHeather, everybody\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:51.000\nOkay, now, we have one XL left\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nThere's one XL left?\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nOkay, who feels the most XL tonight?\n\n46:58.000 --> 46:59.000\nWho's the gal in the way in the back?\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:02.000\nYou're not an XL, you're a tiny little whisper of a thing\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:05.000\nYeah, you, you're not an XL\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:08.000\nOh, she's getting closer, oh my god, no, I'm kidding\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.000\nYou want the XL?\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:14.000\nI'll just give it to her, fuck it\n\n47:14.000 --> 47:16.000\nAlright, she's small\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:18.000\nHuh, are we out?\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:19.000\nYou're from Australia?\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:21.000\nWhat part of Australia?\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.000\nPerth\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:24.000\nPerth, I love it\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nAre we out of shirts?\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nWe're out of shirts, sit down\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nThey make shirts out of\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:35.000\nHe can make a shot out of a plant, right?\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:38.000\nYou're a master of nature\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:41.000\nI only know about Australia from TV and movies\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nWe should have, we should have held up\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:46.000\nLike I should have held up the extra large and go\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:47.000\nAnd he goes, that's not a shirt\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.000\nAnd then you hold up the triple X, now that's a shirt\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:53.000\nAlright, well let's do the same similar process\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nWith these tickets to the movie\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:58.000\nI got three left, I want to feel satisfied\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:01.000\nDo more rapping for me\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:04.000\nThat wasn't going to be able to go to the movie\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:07.000\nThat really quote unquote deserves\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:11.000\nYou all deserve, I don't know how to do this selection\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nI'm afraid to look at them, I'm afraid to look at them\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nI don't know how to do this\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nI just want to try to\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:22.000\nWell don't go out, I want to hear people's stories\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:24.000\nYou know, I like the guy, hang on\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nHe's already coming up\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nI wasn't going to say somebody else\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:31.000\nWe're taking this guy, he already got a shirt\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nAlright, I did, yeah I got a shirt\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nBut I want to give him a hug\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:38.000\nI really love community and Rick and Morty\n\n48:38.000 --> 48:40.000\nI think they're fucking hilarious\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nI told them like five times, so\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:43.000\nThey're my favorite\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nDo you hate Harmontown?\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nHarmontown, I haven't seen it\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nI didn't know it existed until an hour ago\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nAlright, come on, I'm going out\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nDan, I have the guy\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nI'm almost certain I have the one\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:56.000\nWhat, you do?\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:57.000\nI think I do\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nAlright, what's your name by the way?\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:00.000\nNick\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:01.000\nNick?\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nNick Parkett\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nNick got like three photos with me\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:08.000\nAnd he had to keep adjusting the lighting and stuff\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nI didn't, there's a guy\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:13.000\nThat looks enough like George Lucas to be notable\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nWho's not raising his hand\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:16.000\nHe's pouting\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nBut his friends are pointing at him\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:20.000\nThe people next to him are nominating him\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:22.000\nAnd he's being a good person about it\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nSaying, I don't feel like I deserve this\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:26.000\nAre you willing to come up here sir?\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:27.000\nOkay\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nCome on up stage\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nYeah, sure\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nDo you need help?\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nYour friends think that you\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:36.000\nHello everybody\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nDeserve this, do you know why they would think that?\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:39.000\nWhat's your name first off?\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:40.000\nBrendan\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nBrendan, Brendan everybody\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:43.000\nDo I deserve it?\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nI mean, does anybody deserve anything?\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nRight, no, of course not\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nBut why do your friends think you deserve it?\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nNo, I don't have a ticket to the movie\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nI recently lost my job and I think that's a good reason\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.000\nThat's a great reason\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nIt's hard to find work\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nIt's hard to find work\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nAnd I'm looking\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nBut I think seeing the documentary will inspire me\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nTo become who I am\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nAre your friends going to the movie?\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nDo they have tickets?\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:09.000\nNo, no\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nBut they want you to go because they...\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nThey love me\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:16.000\nThey're rallying around you, they want you to go\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:17.000\nI'm gonna cry\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nWhat job did you lose, do you mind saying?\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nI was tech support\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nIt wasn't like my career goal kind of thing\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nWhat would your dream gig be?\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nLike pie in the sky\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nIf you could do anything and get paid\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.000\nTo do the dream gig\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.000\nAnd be embarrassing about it\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:34.000\nWhat would be the best way to make a living?\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:36.000\nActually voice over for Cartoon\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:38.000\nOh, fuck yeah, that's a good one\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nGive him a round of applause\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nAlright, okay\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nMake sure you give your name to somebody\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nOver there in the VIP section\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nThat says they work for Starbridge Industries\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:49.000\nThere's Casey Rubb\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nIf we can get you out to LA\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nTo do a voice for Rick and Morty\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nAnd here's...\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.000\nThat's awesome\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nBecause I can do that now\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:03.000\nAnd here's your ticket to the Harmontown from there\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nWhat a reward!\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nAwesome, man\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nYeah, Brendan, when you come to LA\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nMake sure that you come and join us\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nOn stage at Meltdown for Harmontown, man\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nThat's fucking great\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nAlso, if we could have him come up and maybe do a...\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nIf you got the wherewithal of Brendan\n\n51:21.000 --> 51:23.000\nTo come to LA, maybe we can have him sit in on a D&D\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nLike a little trial voice over thing\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nOne of these two remaining tickets\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nDoesn't have the barcode stub on it\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nIt got torn off\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nBut because there's two remaining tickets\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nI want to try something special\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nBecause my relationship with Erin\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nIs not exactly portrayed in a light\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.000\nThat makes everyone want to run out\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nAnd fall in love in the movie\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:45.000\nAnd yet I'm getting married to her\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nBecause I do love her\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nAnd I think that...\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nI wonder if there's a couple here tonight\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nThat came to South by Southwest\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nAlright\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nThis is extra progressive\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nIs this a female-female couple?\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nYes, you do\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nSweet, I love it\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nThat's just gonna make me feel better about myself all week\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nThere are also stairs over here\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nAlright\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nSo you guys are a couple\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nWhat are your name?\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nI'm K.D.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nBethany\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nAlright\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nI'm not allowed to say that's hot\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nBecause that's a bygone era\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nI think it's hot\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nDo you guys bicker over?\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.000\nDo you fight?\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nHow we feel about things\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nAnd we kind of get too intimate\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nTo some extent\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nIs one of you two\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nThe robot and the other one\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nThe plant goddess?\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nI think we're both pretty emotional\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nYeah, we're pretty emotional\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nJust together as a unit\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nAre you punished for explaining your feelings?\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nWe try not to punish each other\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nFor explaining our feelings\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nIt makes everything worse\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nBut there's\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nA lot of times when there's a balance\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:17.000\nWhat was your last big fight?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:19.000\nAnd it really yelled at these microphones\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nBecause we have to get\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nIt's kind of loud in here\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:25.000\nIt's gonna have to get pretty deep\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nDo you want me to explain?\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:29.000\nIf it's okay with you guys\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nI'm a sophomore\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nIn college right now\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:37.000\nAnd I was living with my parents before that\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nI moved out\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nBethany told me\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nI'm scared that you're gonna meet somebody new\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nI told her that's totally not a problem\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nI did end up\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nKind of falling for a person\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nAnd there was one night where we did\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nIt's so bad, I'm so sorry\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nBut I did\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nGet a little bit drunk\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nAnd I made out with her\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nAnd\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nIt was her worst nightmare\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nMy worst nightmare\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nMy god\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nAnd you forgave her?\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nYeah, I still love her\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nI shouldn't\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:15.000\nI think\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nI don't think you have to be embarrassed\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nFor forgiving her\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nI think that applause means\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nWe're all in love with a bunch of people\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nWho constantly let us down\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:27.000\nRight, Erin?\n\n54:27.000 --> 54:29.000\nAlright\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nI don't know why that got that reaction\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:33.000\nThat's what love is\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nIt's a partnership\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nIt's not a fucking\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nIt's not a holiday\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.000\nIt's teamwork\n\n54:41.000 --> 54:43.000\nAnd life is hard\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nAnd you go up and you go down\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:47.000\nAnd two people together go up and down at different times\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nAnd I'm not saying it should be expected\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nOr you're entitled to make mistakes\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nYou should be punished for them\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nAnd blah blah blah\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nI know how she feels\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nWhen she goes like\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nYeah, I still love her, I forgive her\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nFuck her\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nWhat she didn't tell you was that she gave me a free pass\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nTo fuck someone else\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nAlright\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nWho wants to come up and fuck Bethany right now?\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nThere's always a way\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nFor two human beings that can communicate\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nTo work these things out\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nFree pass\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nSo you guys seem pretty young though\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nI don't want to put pressure\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nAt something that shouldn't be pressured\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nIs this a serious relationship?\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nWe've been dating for two years\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nAnd the two of you come watch Harmontown\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nAnd the movie\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nThe movie\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nAnd\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nMaybe you'll get in because you've got the ripped one\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nAnd maybe you won't\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nThat should be the deciding factor\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:45.000\nWhether you guys stay together\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nWe'll figure it out\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nBethany and KD everybody\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nI think at the heart of it all\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nShouldn't stay in anything that's bad\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:57.000\nBut you and I have a really solid\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nGood relationship\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nOr we're willing to\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nFigure it out\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nI would never\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nI don't think\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nI could never\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nStray from fidelity\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.000\nBut I don't know how much\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nI get to pat myself on the back for that\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nBecause I just don't think\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nIt's just not in my blood\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nI think there are other people who are in love with each other\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nAnd sometimes they have like\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nI don't know, it's harder for them\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nTo be like\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nI never do anything that's that difficult\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nLike I never\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nI won't stop playing a video game\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nTo make you feel better\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nBut I know I would never cheat on you\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:39.000\nI know, what are the circumstances that would make that\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.000\nThat would make me feel better\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nEvery time I play a video game\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nNo, I'm just saying, you know\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nI'm a pretty selfish guy\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nI'm like a baby and I'm not proud of that\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nAnd I don't think that I'm allowed to be that\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:53.000\nWhat I'm saying is that I don't do\n\n56:53.000 --> 56:55.000\nIt's just to keep my relationship going\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nI would do anything to keep it going\n\n56:57.000 --> 56:59.000\nBut I'm pretty bad at it\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nI'm pretty flawed\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nI'm pretty like\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nPretty bad at remembering\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nIn moments of selfishness\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nThat something that I want\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nIsn't as important as making you happy\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nWell, I think we're both\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nVery flawed, but I think the good thing\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nAbout our relationship is that we are\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nOurselves all the time\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nSo the flaws aren't ever deal breakers\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nLike it's always a\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nWell, you're doing this shitty thing\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nLike I'm very messy in hotel rooms\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nFor example\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nYes, it's like the moment we\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nGo into the hotel room\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:35.000\nThe entire floor gets carpeted with\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.000\nIt's kind of a marathon\n\n57:37.000 --> 57:39.000\nYou guys are amazing\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:41.000\nI've traveled with you enough\n\n57:41.000 --> 57:43.000\nWe couldn't get to a hotel anywhere in the world\n\n57:43.000 --> 57:45.000\nThey will check in, beautiful hotel room\n\n57:45.000 --> 57:47.000\nI can knock on there\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nYou guys store 10 seconds after you got in there\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:51.000\nThere's not a bit of\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:53.000\nFloor that is not covered in luggage\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nIt's me\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nIt's not my parents house\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nClothes everywhere\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nIt's sort of like\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nBeing in a relationship with Jumanji\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nLike\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nThere's all of a sudden just elephants and monkeys\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nLike everywhere\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nThe understanding of our relationship is\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nEither you accept\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:15.000\nThat I'm weird in hotel rooms\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:17.000\nAnd I'll try to clean up\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:19.000\nYou never do\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nBut if you did, I would\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.000\nThe idea is, well, that's a flaw of yours\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:25.000\nWhen I accept that\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nSo let's move forward\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nThe thing is like your flaws, I accept\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nOther flaws and lots of relationships\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nI haven't accepted\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nI'm sorry to interrupt, have you seen\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nThe final cut of the film?\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nNot the final cut\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nBut close to it?\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nClose to it\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nLike Dan said, the relationship\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nComes off looking like a\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nReal poster for relationships\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nWell, it's not\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nThe best month\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:57.000\nIn the\n\n58:57.000 --> 58:59.000\nHistory of our relationship\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nAnd Dan can tell you\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nI've gone through a lot of\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nI was really torn up about it\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nWith our engagement and everything\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nI was bummed out that\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nOur relationship\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nDoesn't look so super cool\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nIn the\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nMovie\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nBut it's\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nHonest, it's everything that happened\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nI wish there were more moments with me smiling\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nI learned my big lesson\n\n59:25.000 --> 59:27.000\nFrom having a documentary made about me\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nThat from now on, whenever I do\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nDry humor, I'm always going to end it\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nWith bursting into laughter\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:35.000\nAnd kissing someone on the forehead and saying\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nI love you\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nBecause that's definitely what's missing\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nI had a lot more fun on tour\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nThan it showed in the movie\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nI was having a good time\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nBut it's\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nThere's literally a moment in the movie\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nWhere you're actually just asking me to say\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.000\nI love you and I won't do it\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nBecause I think it's funny\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nAnd it doesn't seem funny\n\n59:57.000 --> 59:59.000\nI think you put it very well\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nWhen you said it shows your relationship\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nNot at its best, not at its worst\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nIt's this middle ground of\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nWhat it's like\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nThe truth is\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nWe got in a really bad fight\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nEarly on, and it was never\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nReally resolved\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nAnd with my personality\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nAnd maybe this is me being a woman\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nOr maybe it's just me being Erin\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nBut I wanted to talk stuff out\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nWe didn't get to talk stuff out\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nBecause you were like, can we just\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nLike, let's just have fun\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nLike, can we deal with this later?\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nBut to me, it wasn't that big of a deal\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nBut because we didn't talk to it, I felt weird\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nAnd like you were rude to me\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nAnd I have this programming\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nIn me about relationships\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nWhere just because\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nObserving my mom and my dad\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nI'm not using it as an excuse of saying\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000\nThis is my big flaw\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nMy gender roles\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nAre based on the guy coming\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nHome and trying\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nTo prove that there's nothing\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nTo get worked up about\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nAnd that the woman is going\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nThere is a reason to get worked up\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nYou should be apologizing\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nAnd you should be doing something\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nThat the guy is supposed to go\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nNo, there isn't, be quiet\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nAnd that is the source\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nOf all of our difficulties\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nI'm always trying to avoid a fight\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nAnd I end up pausing them\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nI think during the tour especially\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nAnd in real life, like in normal life\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nYou're very conscious of being\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nA bad boyfriend or you're very worried\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nThat you're a bad boyfriend\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nAnd most of the time when you say that\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nI don't think that you're being a bad boyfriend\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nOr you were so worried\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nThat you were going to be a bad boyfriend\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nWhenever I would say anything\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nLike positive or negative, you'd be like\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nOkay, come on!\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nNo one cares about this!\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nYeah, but it would be about\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nThings that were positive or negative\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nOr just like hanging out\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nAnd I very much wanted to be one of the guys\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nHanging out, but I think\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nI would have been put in the position\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nBy you of like, come on Aaron\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nDon't start anything, but I wasn't\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nSad and it felt lonely and weird\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nBut I had a great time\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nAlright, so speaking of nobody caring about this\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nLet's bring up Spencer!\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nYeah\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nI know, but\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nWow\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nSo why don't you stand anywhere you want\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nOr sit there\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nWhat's up?

you were to say you had a cup\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nOf tea, then you could say\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nAnd then you see\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nThe key is you want to have vowels\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nSo you can move the wrap\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nOut of your bowels\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000\nLike taking a shit, you want it to slide out\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nI fucked your mama so hard\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nI got the gout\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nRich food is Austin style\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nI fucked your mama on the\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nEgyptian Nile\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nI fucked your mama in a river\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nI fucked your mama on a lake\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nI fucked your mama for the march of dimes\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nFor children's sake\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nI already fucking your mom\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nI fucked your mama with my friends\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nHarry and Tom\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nTim, go rap outside\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nGo rap outside on the street\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nYeah\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nOkay, I'm gonna try to keep the beat\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nI'm gonna try to do it\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nSomebody video this\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nKeep your phones out and video this right now\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nI'm gonna see if the mic still works\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nTrying to keep the beat\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nEven though I'm with some jerks\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nGotta keep the wrap going on the beat\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nTo rap on the rainy street\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nKinda went out here\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nAnd I can't hear you\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nBut here's what I'm saying\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nAnd here's what I'll do\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nI'm gonna rap on the street\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nI've always been from\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nSo now I got the beat\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nAll you motherfuckers through this glass\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nCan hear me rapping in Austin\n\n01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000\nLook at my ass\n\n01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000\nVisible when I pull down my pants\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nI'm gonna do a rainy street\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nAustin Texas dance\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nFuck it up\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nIn the street with style\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nI fucked your mama\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nAll the goddamn why\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nI gotta come back in\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nCause I'm going to get arrested\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nYo, I'm gonna get arrested\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nSome people that are looking at me\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nAnd they're pretty happy\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nThat they don't know me\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nOh shit, I'm really in trouble\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nBack inside\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nYo, yeah, bubble\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nYeah, did I stay on the beat?\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nYeah\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nFuck, yeah\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nNow I got it\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nYeah\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nIt's a lot to process\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nKinda wish I was in the audience instead of\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nIn the show\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nSo I could just sit back and figure out\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nWhat just happened\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nHolly\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nI saw your mama at Holly's house\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nDoesn't matter what her name is\n\n01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nThat rhymes with mouse\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000\nThat's the only word that you're gonna rhyme with\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nWendy\n\n01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000\nYeah\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nIt's a rapping game\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nSomeone\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nThat's your name\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nSee, it doesn't really matter\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nYo, Pete\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nYo, Scatter\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nIt's called Working the Crowd\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nI'm gonna say your name\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nShe said it out loud\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nIt's like it's improvised\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nBut you're really just rapping\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nIt just actually sucks\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nJesus\n\n01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000\nCan't get it\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nAlright\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nDid I really stay on the beat?\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nI turned it off\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nSo we could hear you better\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nYou were right on it, I put it back on\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nNo idea how embarrassing it was out there\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nFor real, it's just quiet\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nQuiet and rainy\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nThere's just people talking to their agent\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nOn the phone\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nAnd I was just like, I'm fat and stupid\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nAnd they were like, you're homeless\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nAnd you're in jail, you're gonna go to jail\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nBecause out there, you can't hear a single thing in here\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nNo, and you don't care\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nAbout anything in here\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nOut there\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nThat's the world, it's out there\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nThere's police out there\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nThere's a guy behind you in a hoodie trying to look to the glass and trying to figure out what you were going to\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nHe looked bummed out\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nAre you Ashton Kutcher?\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nWhy are you allowed to do this?\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nYou're going to jail\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nYou were a microphone away from crazy\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nThank god I had this\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nI kept pointing at it\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nI'm not hearing things\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nI'm not insane, I have a microphone\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nAlso, most of those windows\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nHave posters on them that we can see out\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nBut you really can't see\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nThere's only one window you can kind of see\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nThere's a lot of people out there doing what I was doing\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nAnd they're all criminals\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nThey're all in trouble\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nWe should give all the homeless people microphones\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nOr cooperative Bitcoin\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nGive them a chance\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nGive them a chance\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nI almost wonder\n\n01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000\nNah, he smells so good\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nAnd he was so charismatic\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nYou kind of wanted Lamar\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nYou kind of wanted Lamar to really have his pulpit\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nBut it doesn't matter\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nHe's probably gone\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nWe don't want to keep surfing that wave\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nDid Lamar leave?\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nHe's gone\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nNow you guys feel like you should have left\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nAlright, what's the next chapter?\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nLet's play some D&D\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nI think Spencer's probably ready for that\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nI guess\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nI'm ready\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nI'm ready for anything\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nI don't know\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nSpencer, I told him\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nMaybe we'll play D&D, maybe we won\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nIt's up to him\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nSpencer, you were away for a couple weeks\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nYou didn't play D&D\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nI should correct you\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nWe didn't play it with you\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nOh, I know\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nAlso, to be quite honest\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nThere's been about 17 other shows where we didn't really play D&D\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nAnd you were there\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nIt was still the time\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nWhile Spencer gets ready\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nLet's do our pain segment\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nOur human pain segment\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nWho's the most in pain?\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nThis hand is just like\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nImmediately\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nAre you willing to come up and talk about your pain?\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nCome on up\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nKatie\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nKatie, welcome Katie to the stage\n\n01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nWould you?\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nKatie, there you go\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nI'm so happy to be here\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nGood to meet you\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nYou seem pretty happy for somebody\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nThat's in a lot of pain\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nI'm really happy\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nI don't have a ticket\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nI don't have a ticket\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nWhat's going on in your life that brings you so much heartache?\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nOkay\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nHello everyone\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\nIt's like being in an airport\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nBut they're listening\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nThere's a sort of chuffa\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nBasically, I'm going to try to make it short\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nJust because I don't want to drag out the story\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nBut I just remember you guys talking\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nOn the podcast about how\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nYou can get very\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nOverwhelmed with emotion a lot in your life\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nAnd I just remember you mentioning\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nYou wearing a suit that's kind of like\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nYour defense\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nAnd that was something I really related to\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nA few years ago\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nWhen I had this really big up and down thing\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nWith this one guy\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nAnd it finally ended\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nI came to realize that\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nMy emotions overwhelm me\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nSo much\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nI don't know how to deal with it\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nAnd I feel like you guys might be able to relate to that\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nSo I just wanted to know\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nHow you\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nLived with that through your life\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nBecause I'm really lost\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nIs this a breakup that you're still going through?\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nIt ended when I was\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\n17 or 18\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nBut you keep thinking about it\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nPeople would always say you're too young\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nTo be in love, you don't know\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nWhat you're thinking, you're just a teenager\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nI always told them you can say that\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nHow long has it been?\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nSince we broke up\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nProbably like 5 years\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nAnd I don't talk to him anymore\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nWe didn't end on horrible terms\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nBut I'm pretty sure he doesn't want anything\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nTo do with me\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nYou've got one relationship\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nYou don't have contact with him\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nYou don't have mutual friends\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nWe do, but we don't see each other\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nI know he doesn't want to be around me\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nHave you dated anyone since then?\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nI did recently\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nFor a few weeks\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nThey were really good immediately\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nWe'd been dating for like a year\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nAnd then he said he realized\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nThat it wasn't a good time\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nIn his life for a relationship\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nBut I hadn't done anything wrong\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nThat's who he's lying\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nI was comforting, but it was still\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nKind of a big shock\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nI feel everything\n\n01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000\nVery, very strongly\n\n01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nI cripple under my emotions\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000\nWhat's the\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nIs there a main emotion that you feel like\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nIs it regret or loss or separation\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nI think just\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nSeparation from people who I feel like\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nI just enjoy being around them a lot\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nSo you lost a group of friends as well\n\n01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000\nWhen that went away?\n\n01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nJust one person\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nI cling very strongly to people\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nThat I feel like I can connect with\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nAnd then when I lose that, it's just\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nHave you been able to have a relationship since then\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000\nIn the last five years?\n\n01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nI just had this one recently, but it was only\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000\nThree weeks, and that ended\n\n01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000\nA couple of weeks ago\n\n01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nIs it because everyone casts a shadow\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nOver everything else? No, it was other reasons\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000\nTo me\n\n01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI don't know the details of it\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nAnd also, I've never\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000\nGone through anything like this\n\n01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nI wouldn't be able to really commiserate with you\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nBut I think the ability to\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nFeel strongly emotionally about something\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nIs the most important thing in the world\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000\nAnd I think that as I've grown up a little bit\n\n01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nI've learned to\n\n01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000\nWhen you talk about wearing a suit\n\n01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000\nA suit of armor, whatever our things are\n\n01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nThat we use to keep\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000\nThe world away\n\n01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000\nYou've learned as\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nAs you grow up that letting people in\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nIs really dangerous emotionally\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nAnd you pay a price for getting older\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nWe've all paid\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nPrices, no matter how old you are\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nIf you're in this room\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nI think I've gotten a little less emotional\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nAnd much better at finding\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nClever ways of keeping people at arms length\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nAnd that does not make\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nYour life better at all\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nI don't want to keep people at arms length\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nAnd after that big breakup happened\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nWhen I was younger, I felt like\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nThat Simon and Garfunkel song, I'm a rock\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nI wanted to be that because\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nIf I open up the floodgates\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nTo my feelings, I would never be able to control it\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nIt's just too much, so you cut it all off\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nConnecting with other human beings\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nIs the most wonderful thing in the world\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nBut people have accused me of being really aloof\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nAnd I can be and I am\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nBecause if I let everybody in\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nI'm so emotionally\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nA big radar antenna\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nFor whatever's wrong in the room\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nAnd if I open up that floodgate\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nI will fall on the ground\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nTo start crying\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nI'm exactly like that\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nI'm trying to hold it together right now\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nDo you have the triggers you go back to\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nDo you have songs you listen to\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nI was just kidding about him\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nLying\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nBut I mean\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nThe great news is\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nThat you're in this really exciting time in your life\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nWhere you feel\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nLike you said, you're starting to\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nYou're starting to cry\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nAnd that feels like a negative emotion\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nAnd I guess definitively it is\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nSo great, because this is the time\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nWhen you get to discover new things\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nAnd you should, you're going to be\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nWith other people\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nLike Claire Danes says\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nIn my so called life\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nGod bless her\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nIt hurts until it doesn't\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nSo\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nIf you're feeling bad right now\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nLike you're\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nGoing to meet other people\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nAnd this first experience\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nLike the pain of that, if you're feeling bad\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nYou look like a creative person\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nUse that energy to do as many\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nCrazy weird things as possible\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nShe's been hurting for five years\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nWhich at first glance is like\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nThat's on the fringe of the bell curve\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nI think you said\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nThat you've been hurting consistently for five years\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nWell, I mean things were very up and down\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nHe's a really vague person\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nSo I would always pour my heart out to him\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nAnd then he'd be like, yeah\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nI think he's become a legend in your mind\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nThat's not really a real person anymore\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nI know I had that person\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nIt's just really romantic\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nVery romantic\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nYou at this point have imagined him to be something\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nFor longer than you knew him\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nWhich is fine and doesn't make it\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nAny less real\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nBut it means that\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nYou get to free yourself\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nFrom that\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nI say how often are you checking in\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nWith them?\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nHow often are you checking in with the songs\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nAnd the pictures and Facebook\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nIt's not about this guy\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nIt's just about me realizing that I have this\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nMassive\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nStorehouse of emotions\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nTo deal with in my life\n\n01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000\nI say be that person\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nThe price that we pay\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nFor all the shit that we've gone through\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nThe painful stuff, the hurtful stuff\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nThe stuff that will never go away\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nIt shouldn't ever go away\n\n01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000\nBut that's the stuff that makes you creative\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nThat's the stuff that's\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nHuman beings as far as we know\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nThat turns pain into artwork\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nYes\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nWe tell stories, we sing songs\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nWe arrange flowers\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nWe do shit\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nThat's how we expiate our pain\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nAnd that creates\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nRelief for other people\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nWe turn our pain\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nDan's a painful person\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nAaron is Spencer as I am\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nAnd Neil as we all are\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nArtwork is\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nLetting other people experience your pain\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nFor them\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nAnd that's catharsis\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nI kind of want to do everything\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nI don't really know where to start\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nIf that makes any sense\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nLike I want to paint, I want to do movies\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nI want to do everything\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nI want to try, yeah\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nYour job is to figure out\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nHow you would explain to a stranger\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nWhether through visuals\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\nOr audio\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nOr feeling or whatever\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nHow do you transmit that pain to them\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nBecause it can't hurt them at all\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nAll it can do is make them go\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nHoly shit, I felt that way once\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nAnd if you felt that way for five years\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nThat speaks well to your potential\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nTo transmit to other people\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nAnd it's all about you, it's definitely not about this guy\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nI think most importantly\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nFocus on\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nWhat makes you so\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nCool\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nObviously like the entrance that you're going in\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nBefore into the castle that is\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nLove and like a relationship\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nThat's like stabilized or whatever\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nI know I didn't get into that\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nQuote-unquote castle\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nUntil\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nUntil later\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nAnd was in a lot of relationships\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nBut the like\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nYou get to\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nReally figure out why you're cool\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nDon't fall into the trap of focusing on the other person\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nBecause that's easy, that's easy to focus on\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nOther people and whatever else\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nRight, I think the two biggest things\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nI want to know is like\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nThe only person who feels completely\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nJust like kicked into the ground\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nBy how strongly I feel\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nStuff, I feel like\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nI wonder if there's anybody out there that's ever felt\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nActually absolutely emotionally devastated\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nI'm four years past a girlfriend\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nAnd I'm still constantly thinking about her\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nI know exactly what you're talking about\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nYeah, I just want to be able to\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nFeel like everybody just\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nAlways has all their shit together\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nAnd I'm the only one\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nI mean I know that's irrational\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nProfessor, do you have street\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nWell yeah, I mean everyone fakes it like that\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nYou just got to get good at faking it\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nI mean I think that's what I do\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nDo you bring it back up, do you have songs\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nDo you have pictures you look at, do you\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nNo, it was all on my old phone\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nAnd I have a new phone now but\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nI always\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nThat's a good idea\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nThat's hilarious, having a new phone\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nNothing's funnier than the iPhone 5S\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nGold\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nWell\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nThat's what you're talking about\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nThere's nothing you could do about it\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nFeelings are like seasons, they just fucking happen\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nAnd you either get in a house or you get wet\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nYeah, I mean I've accepted that they're there\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nI just want to be able to like\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nSurvive and turn it into something\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nGood and not just me like crying\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nLike I want to make it something positive\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nHere's the thing\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nEveryone in this room I think\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nShares that with you\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nI think that's part of being a human being\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nBut\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nThat's my own thing which makes us\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nAs human beings the greatest thing in the world\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nBecause we all share sorrow\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nBut we all have individual sorrow\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nAnd that's the flag that you get to wave\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nThat makes us\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nThat's all I got going for me right now\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nThe danger is that you let\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nYour emotionalness, your sensitivity\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nDon't let that harden you\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nDon't put a shell up\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nBecause that'll turn you, that'll age you\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nThat'll make you bitter\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nThat'll make you unhappy\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nWe're going to stop getting\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nThe full version of Katie\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nBe emotional\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nBe a wreck, be a weirdo\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nAnd don't ever apologize for it\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nBecause I'm going to start crying right now\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nBecause this is the greatest thing in the world\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nAnd be proud that you came here and told 200 people\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nAbout your feelings and what hurts you\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nAnd they aren't hating you for it\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nThey're digging it\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nGo out in the crowd right now\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nAnd see how many people will shake your hand\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nRight now\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nYeah, take Katie, show Katie\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nWhat it's like to be a fucking hitman\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nYeah\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nAnd then go get a free pass with Bethany\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nBecause she's giving it away\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nI think about the things she's describing\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nI think about the movie, Say Anything\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nWith Jack Puzak\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nLike, what's it, Lily Taylor\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nIs that the, I'm going to say the play\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nIs the character who's constantly obsessed\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nWith her ex-boyfriend\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nWith her songs about him\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nLike, she's characterized\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nThat archetype is like\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nOh, she should get over him\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nBut really what she should do is keep playing guitar\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nAnd like really figuring out\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nHow to get that shit out\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nBecause one of those songs will hit\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nLike, I think it is her responsibility\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nTo wipe her ass with the world\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nThat's what an artist should do\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nThe most empowering feeling is\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nRealizing like\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nTwo years after the fact someone's broken up with you\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nAnd you've written all these songs\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nAnd you're angry and being like\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nHoly shit, this person that I've been getting over\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nIs a projection that I created\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nSo now I double-a-own this person\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nAnd I made $8 off of him\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nBut how do you feel about the idea\n\n01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nThat love is the same chemical\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nLike, if we don't trigger it\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nIt dissipates\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nIt's a very analog thing\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nYeah, it's true, but how do you\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nTrigger it?\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nShe's not hanging out\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nYeah, I mean\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nI feel like no matter what, this is certainly the best\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nD&D we've ever done\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nDo you think you're prepared\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nTo do a little ad hoc D&D\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nA noisy hotel lobby?\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nYou guys are good\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nIt's really loud over there\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nYou guys are still good, you can hear us and everything\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nAlso, Katie, thank you\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nThat was one of my favorite Harmontown moments of all time\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nKatie, do you have tickets to the show?\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nTo the documentary?\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nI'm just going to give away these tickets\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nReally fast\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nThere are a couple of people\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nI know you don't have tickets\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nIt's exciting this is for the live crowd\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nI don't know\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nKatie, do you have tickets?\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nOkay, cool\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nThose are tickets\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nSomeone just came up and handed me tickets\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nI feel like this is\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nEven though it's not like optimum sound\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nThis is not like the normal comfort\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nOf a small theater\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nI really like what's going on\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nI'm in a very good\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nHarmontown mood\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nIt's a lovely town\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nYou guys are\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nSome of the best versions of what\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nIt's nice to look out and see\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nIt makes us feel very safe\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nI'm getting all sappy now, thanks Katie\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nSpencer\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nTwo or more weeks off\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nIs there something special about this D&D session?\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nBecause we haven't played D&D in Los Angeles\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nFor weeks\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nIt's special in that\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nI prepared it in this very room\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nTwenty minutes ago\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nIs it sort of separate? Is it non-canonical?\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nWhat's happening? I'm scared\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nWhat's happening? It's non-canonical\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nNo, it's canonical\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nShould it be non-canonical?\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\nDo you want me to hand out the sheets?\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nI want everyone to do everything\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nAnyway\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nI mean\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nWhat's happening? I'm sorry\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nI'm just so wasted\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nDid you find weed since we last talked about that?\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nYeah, no, this guy\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nFor real? Yeah, no\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nFound it within himself\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nThis is exciting\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nSo, what's up you guys?\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nNeil Berkley is going to play Chris de Burghh\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nBecause Kumail is in Austin\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nBut he's doing a panel right now\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nI know\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nAre you really fine?\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nNo\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nAre you booing me?\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nThey're booing Kumail for being a bad friend\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nThat motherfucker is on every bus in town\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nThat's so cool\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nYou can see Kumail's little face everywhere\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nI love that\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nIt's amazing\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nIs that yours?\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nOh, you drive a pedicab? And you've got Kumail's picture on it?\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nThat's awesome\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nThat's Austin\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nWhat's up?\n\n01:30:29.000 -->

met\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nOur heroes had just been released\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nBy the Bone Sages\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nBy the Bone Sages of Tormod\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nTorn\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nAfter agreeing to slay the Marsh Minotaur\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nThe party headed towards\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nThe Farmers Market to look for clues\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nJesus Christ, is that me?\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nAfter a brief chat with\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nJoe to be cheesy\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nThe gang went over a hill and discovered a cave\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nCovered in bones\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nOur heroes entered the cave despite\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nMonstrous whales coming with deep\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nWithin the cavern\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nWithin, keep saying within, the dark\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nDagnus\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nOur heroes encountered the Marsh Minotaur\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nWho was actually a pretty cool guy\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nAnd actually not a guy at all\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nBut a girl\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nAfter deeming the Minotaur to be too honorable\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nTo be killed in cold blood\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nThe gang banded together with it\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nBut what would they do?\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nHow would they escape?\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nAnd what of their skull curse?\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nAnd what about the Tarragon of Virtue?\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nIs that still something that people\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nAre paying attention to?\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nWe'll find out this time\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nNo, we won't, we'll find out sometime\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nSo you guys might not know what's going on\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nBut this time it's justified\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nOkay, so I\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nDescribe the surrounding exactly\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nWhat we're looking at right now\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nOkay, so you're in this\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nDank dark cave\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nIt's covered in bones and feces\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nThere's the Marsh Minotaur\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nTowering above you\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nHer udders in full display\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nShe's in the cave\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nShe's in the cave\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nShe's in the cave\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nShe's like\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nHey Marsh\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nHey guys\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nDo you have a name?\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nI think I said I had a name\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nWhat do you want to call me?\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nMeredith\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nMeredith\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nThat was my name, yeah\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nDo you know anything about the Tarragon of Virtue?\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nI mean\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nI've heard it's in paradise\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nI don't really know much about that\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nI'm just in a cave\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nYou're in a cave\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nAlright, well I'm sober as a judge\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nAnd I'm not angry\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nYou're sober?\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nWell, maybe not as a judge\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nBut\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nI'm sober as a relaxed judge\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nAnd I\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nIronically I can't hear anything\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nBut I think that we should\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nWe should\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nHead out of wherever we are\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nAre there any exits or\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nEgrests in this cave?\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nThese are pretty straightforward\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nThey got like one exit\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nIsn't it notable that Meredith\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nIsn't the\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nMinotaur that we were seeking after?\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nSay again?\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nIs that a thing?\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nWe agreed to go kill the Marsh Minotaur\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nWhen we got out of the\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nBone Sages Tribunal\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nYeah, it was part of the terms of your release\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nYeah, Meredith isn't it\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nI walk towards the entrance to the cave\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nAnd say let's get the hell out of here\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nGet out of the cave and into the\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nDusty gray darkness of the Underworld\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nIt's all\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nDusty and gray\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nOver the hill you know that\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nThe city of Tormatorre\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nIs just right over there, but I mean\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nDo you want to go back there? I don't know\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nYou gotta get out of here, right?\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nWe gotta find the tarragon of virtue\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nHow do you get to Paradise?\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\nParadise is above ground says Meredith\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nIt's above ground and we are underground\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nDon't we have a thing that can make a staircase\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nYeah, you had to rape a cyber skeleton\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nAnd it got destroyed in that\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nSo no, you don't\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nYou raped a skeleton?\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nIt was a cyber spider\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nDid I say skeleton, cyber spider?\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nA lot of mistakes from me\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nYou're telling me\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nBut you walk out of the cave\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nI already said that, you're in the dusty\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nGray dustness of the Underworld\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nThe Minotaur goes\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nYou guys want to get out of here?\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nYeah\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nYeah, me too\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000\nI've been down here for too long\n\n01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000\nI've never even seen this marsh\n\n01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nI mean, I have\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000\nThat's where I'm

01:34:57.000\nCan I ride you?\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nYou don't do like piggybacks or anything like that?\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nI mean, I'm sure it's possible\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nI'm not down with that\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nShe says, well, climbing upon Mulraine, Sedona\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nIt's very heavy\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nHe climbs upon Mulraine, Sedona?\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nShe does\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nTo the... there\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nSo Meredith is riding you

marsh\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nThere's no marsh down here, that's above ground\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nIs it above ground marsh?\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nYeah, that's where I'm from, I just got sucked down here\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nHave we left the cave yet?\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nYeah, we're in the Underworld proper\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nWe're in the Dusty Dark Grayness\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nI don't know this\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nI'm assuming you guys must have fell down here\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\nalong with a castle\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nWe killed Admiral Darkstar and the castle\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nall collapsed and we killed a bunch of people\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nand we got in a lot of trouble for it\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nSo there's a hole in the ceiling, right?\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\nMaybe we can get out of that hole\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nA hole\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nto climb up out of\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nI climb up the hole\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nYou're not by the hole because you've trekked\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nquite a long way\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nRight, we went to Skeleton Town and got accused\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nof all kinds of things\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nOkay, let's walk back towards the hole\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nentry\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nSure, yeah, that's happening\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nAs you tread through the Dusty Darkness\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nyou see your footprints that lead to the city\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nthose were the footprints you did\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\nyou made when you were walking towards the city\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nthat one time\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nYou also note a pair of wolf-like footprints\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nlike that of a wolf\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nlike that of two wolves\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nmaybe more than two wolves\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nmuch newer than your own\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nand then you reach the Crumbling\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nRuin Castle\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nbut all is not right\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nYou see, the dark stone blocks of Dark Stars\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nForest are faded with age\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nand look to be crumbling to dust\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nas if they've endured millennia of history\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nthe dark stone blocks\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nthey're just crumbling all over the place\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nbrilliant sunlight\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nstreams down from the hole in the ceiling\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nhundreds of yards above your heads\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nIs it climbable, the surface of the hole?\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nBar\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nBar, quiet\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nWe're doing important work over here\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nI don't know if anyone else is having the same feeling\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nbut I know when I was in high school\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nand used to play games like this in a cafeteria\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nit was identical to this\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nI mean, let's be loud but not so loud\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nthat they come over and yell at us\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nwith a bar\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nI don't think anyone's going to yell at us\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nEveryone at the bar, help us out please\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nI really don't think that's going to work\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nUse a rap song\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nThere's other shitty bars to go to\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nGo to those\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nugly bars in Austin\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nWe head towards a goddamn hole in the ceiling\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000\nI'm going to go sit at the bar and do this\n\n01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nYou head up\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nI'm going to play at the bar\n\n01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000\nI'm going to confront these assholes\n\n01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000\nI'll do it\n\n01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000\nAll they've learned is that when that happens\n\n01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nthey get to sell their products\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nThat's the only precedent we've seen\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nLet's sit right here\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nPlease, loud motherfuckers\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nI'm going to stand next to this Newsy\n\n01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nI go to the...\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nI start climbing the side of the hole\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nThere's no side of the hole\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\nImagine if there was a hole in the ceiling\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nof this very building\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nYou couldn't just climb up into thin air\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nI know I've asked you this a thousand times\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nbut it's my sun rod\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nThat's that stick with the button\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nThat's like a flashlight\n\n01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000\nThe thing that got destroyed\n\n01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000\nThe Meredith\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000\nShe speaks up\n\n01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000\nThat's a big hole\n\n01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nYou need some sort of crazy, ridiculous ladder\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nto get up there\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nOr a teleport cape\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nWhich I have\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nThat's cool\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nTeleport cape\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000\nYou teleport to the surface\n\n01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000\nSharpies is above\n\n01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000\non the surface world\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nat the rim of this hole\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nalone\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nI use my springy shoes\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000\nYou're what now?\n\n01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000\nI have shoes of springy\n\n01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000\nYou jump 20 feet straight into the air\n\n01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nI try to reach down\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nThe hole is 700 yards deep\n\n01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000\nI have a scape artist\n\n01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000\nWhere I am to the top of the hole\n\n01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000\nNot without a solid plan\n\n01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000\nor some way to ascend 700 yards\n\n01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000\nBy escaping as an artist\n\n01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nYou draw a depiction of your brilliant escape\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nI do\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000\nIt doesn't happen though\n\n01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000\nIt's not that loud over there\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000\nIt just sounds loud\n\n01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nIt's the high ceilings I think\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nI'm looking around\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nfor materials on the surface world\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000\nto see if there's a way that I could\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000\nmake a 700 meter ladder\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000\nIt's frozen tundra\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000\nThere's no vegetation\n\n01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000\nor anything as far as I can see\n\n01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000\nIn fact, there's not really anything\n\n01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000\nCan I climb out?\n\n01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nYour climate kit does include rope\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000\nbut it's only 150 feet of rope\n\n01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000\nIt's not quite enough\n\n01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nIf you call it down to me, I think I can make a ladder\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000\nI have rope and supplies\n\n01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000\nHey, make a ladder\n\n01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000\nIt's less than 700 yards\n\n01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000\nof ladder\n\n01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000\nMeredith again speaks up\n\n01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000\nI actually\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000\nhave a ladder\n\n01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nYeah, yeah, I have it\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nIf I take this acid\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000\nCan I have a visual\n\n01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000\nthat I'm out of the cave?\n\n01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nNo, it's like burning, killing you\n\n01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nCan I use the lyre of building to get us out of here?\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000\nYou could, but it takes some time\n\n01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nMeredith just said she has a ladder\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nI do\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000\nA several hundred foot ladder?\n\n01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nOh, yeah, this is like a ridiculous ladder\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nOh, let's use the ladder\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nCan we use your ladder?\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nI mean, I don't have it with me, but trust me\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000\nIt's like crazy, we're talking\n\n01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000\nIt was forged in the pits of Skaldor\n\n01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000\nby double giants\n\n01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nShe says she has a ladder, but it's not with her\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000\nIt's forged in the pits of Skaldor\n\n01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000\nI might have jumped the gun on this teleportation\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nIs there a coffee place up there?\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nNope, just a bunch of snow\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000\nMeredith, where's the ladder?\n\n01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000\nI'll go get it, it's back in the cave\n\n01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nTime passes\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000\nWhile time passes, you guys\n\n01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nshould talk about your greatest fears\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nShe runs into the darkness\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000\nCommitment\n\n01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nI imagine that I am at\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nan afternoon party\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nand someone says\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000\nlet's create something really cool\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000\nand I reach in my pockets\n\n01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nand I look at my hands\n\n01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000\nand they're pool cubes\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000\nIt's my greatest fear\n\n01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nI like that\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000\nI'm going first\n\n01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000\nMy greatest fear is her telling that story again\n\n01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nKidding\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000\nHypothermia\n\n01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000\nA serious relationship\n\n01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nMy greatest fear\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nPumas\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000\nSure\n\n01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000\nMeredith comes back\n\n01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000\nShe's carrying a crazy ladder\n\n01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000\nIt's like crazy\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000\nI helped Meredith put the ladder\n\n01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nup right so we can get up there\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nIt's very difficult to do that because this ladder\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nis 700 yards long\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nI use my barbarian strength\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000\nto help the ladder get up\n\n01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000\nAs hard as it is, it is in fact possible\n\n01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000\nand you accomplish this task\n\n01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nThe ladder, it sets up\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000\nShe's like, we best climb this\n\n01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000\nBut don't worry, I mean yes, worry\n\n01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000\nPlease be worried\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000\nIt's a crazy ladder\n\n01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000\nWhat sort of craziness might happen?\n\n01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000\nYou might go crazy\n\n01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000\nI don't give a shit\n\n01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000\nI'm a barbarian, I start climbing the ladder\n\n01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000\nI'll hold the top\n\n01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000\nYou start climbing the ladder\n\n01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000\nand as you ascend, you see\n\n01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000\nPumas\n\n01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000\nOn the ladder\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000\nPumas\n\n01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000\nYou're terrified\n\n01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000\nYou can't move\n\n01:43:01.000 -->

experienced that, it hurts a lot\n\n01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000\nYou keep climbing\n\n01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000\nAnd you keep climbing\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nAnd Mulraine, you

making the ladder slippery\n\n01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000\nIt's hard to deal with\n\n01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000\nGirl, you're bleeding\n\n01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000\nI know this is

ladder\n\n01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000\nWith your newfound confidence\n\n01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000\nYou just soar to the top\n\n01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000\nand see Sharpie\n\n01:51:55.000 -->

01:52:27.000\nYou're bleeding\n\n01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000\nYou're bleeding and climbing\n\n01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000\nYou get to the top and you see\n\n01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000\nyou see a fire\n\n01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000\nand Sharpie and Christopher\n\n01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000\nHello\n\n01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000\nAre we all up here?

out\n\n01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000\nI put it in my back pocket\n\n01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000\nand I start climbing up the ladder again\n\n01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000\nYou keep climbing up this slick\n\n01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000\nbloody ladder\n\n01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000\nMulraine lost her mind a few rounds ago, guys\n\n01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000\nI'm committed to this\n\n01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000\nThe ladder is bloody\n\n01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000\nand it's slippery\n\n01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000\nOkay, so the ladder is bloody\n\n01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000\nI decide I want to become a shadow\n\n01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000\nso I cover myself\n\n01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000\nwith all the blood that I can find\n\n01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000\nso I'm as dark as possible\n\n01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000\nand it happens\n\n01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000\nAnd like Carrie, I rise\n\n01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000\non the rope

01:53:57.000\nYou've seen pictures of Carrie\n\n01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000\nYou've seen GIFs\n\n01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000\nGIFs?\n\n01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000\nBut you understand the concept of Carrie\n\n01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000\nOh, yeah, she's like a girl\n\n01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000\nand she doesn't have friends\n\n01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000\nand then she kills herself\n\n01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000\nShe gets teased\n\n01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000\nand covered in blood\n\n01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000\nand then she kills everyone\n\n01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000\nWell, that's a triumphant story, right?\n\n01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000\nI think so\n\n01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000\nI saw Carrie and I was like\n\n01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000\nI was

even more slippery\n\n01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000\nSo that happens?\n\n01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000\nYeah, definitely\n\n01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000\nMulraine, are you coming up or

to the top of the ladder\n\n01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000\nand you see all of your good friends\n\n01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000\nsurrounding a fire\n\n01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000\nWe made it to the top of the ladder\n\n01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000\nThat was harder than it looked\n\n01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000\nNext week we're going to pay our gas bill\n\n01:55:05.000 -->

01:59:17.000\nWe got two hours until the film\n\n01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000\nWe'll meet you guys around here\n\n01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000\nFirst off\n\n01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000\nMr. Harmon\n\n01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000\nI want to thank you for supporting the film last year\n\n01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000\nThank you so much\n\n01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000\nI really appreciate that\n\n01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000\nI was making some friends of ours\n\n01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000\nIt's a great film\n\n01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000\nIt's a great film\n\n01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000\nSecond\n\n01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000\nMy question is for Spencer\n\n01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000\nDo you have a lot of offers\n\n01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000\nto go to different conventions\n\n01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000\nand DM games for them?\n\n01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000\nNo\n\n01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000\nThat's all\n\n01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000\nI mean you'd think there'd be some of that\n\n02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000\nTake that\n\n02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000\nThank you\n\n02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000\nThank you\n\n02:00:07.000 -->

02:00:17.000\nYeah\n\n02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000\nTasty\n\n02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000\nDo you want a wrap for us?\n\n02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000\nYo\n\n02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000\nThis guy is going to ask a question\n\n02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000\nYou're still got a hand\n\n02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000\nDid you\n\n02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000\ndrink?\n\n02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000\nEver?\n\n02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000\nNo, I was just saying\n\n02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000\nIt scared the shit out of me\n\n02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000\nI can't see in the bottom\n\n02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000\nOh shit, I see where this is going\n\n02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000\nThis is like a\n\n02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000\nsame type alcohol thing\n\n02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000\nThen I realized, oh god\n\n02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000\nIt's a kettle of wine\n\n02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000\nThey're paying for this\n\n02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000\nCool, thanks\n\n02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000\nThis guy loves alcohol\n\n02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000\nThey certainly paid for\n\n02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000\nall of my\n\n02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000\nself abuse over the years\n\n02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000\nOr was that guy just asking for a free drink?\n\n02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000\nI don't know, we'll never know\n\n02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000\nI think the audience is enthusiastic\n\n02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000\nHe doesn't disappear\n\n02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000\nYeah, I've paid for it\n\n02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000\nThat was the world's worst mic drop\n\n02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000\nShe doesn't want to pay for that\n\n02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000\nOnce I dropped the mic\n\n02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000\nand then I had to pay for the mic\n\n02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000\nafterwards\n\n02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000\nWe might have to pay for it\n\n02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000\nI'm very sorry\n\n02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000\nSpencer\n\n02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000\nWe love me\n\n02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000\nDan, thank you for everything\n\n02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000\nfor the show\n\n02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000\nhelping me win 65 bucks\n\n02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000\nAll that\n\n02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000\nExplain yourself\n\n02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000\nThey did that pub quiz a couple weeks ago\n\n02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000\nand our team won\n\n02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000\n500 bucks at least\n\n02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000\nSo I got 60 bucks\n\n02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000\n62 bucks out of that\n\n02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000\nThank you\n\n02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000\nWhere is it?\n\n02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000\nI've already worried about the person below\n\n02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000\nAnd the rest you just wasted\n\n02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000\nDuring the filmmaking process\n\n02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000\nDid you realize that Spencer was a hero\n\n02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000\nor was it after Dan's revelation\n\n02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000\nat what point\n\n02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000\nDo you realize\n\n02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000\nthat you can see me in the movie\n\n02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000\nat the exact point where Neil puts it\n\n02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000\nThat's the point where I kind of realized\n\n02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000\nIt's both tongue in cheek\n\n02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000\nand tongue out of cheek\n\n02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000\nwhere those expressions mean\n\n02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000\nThere's 650 hours of footage\n\n02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000\nNeil had to deal with the fact\n\n02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000\nthat his documentary subject was a guy\n\n02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000\nwho thinks he knows at any given time\n\n02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000\nat what point in the story they're at\n\n02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000\nSo there's a lot of stuff on the cutting-edge floor\n\n02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000\nof me explaining that we're pros and cons\n\n02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000\nwhen we're not at all\n\n02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000\nSo it was up to Neil at the end\n\n02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000\nIt was his movie\n\n02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000\nIt was important for me to realize\n\n02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000\nat a certain point that\n\n02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000\nNothing's really happening\n\n02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000\nto me, transformatively\n\n02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000\nI'm going to be an asshole when the end of this tour\n\n02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000\nAnd I didn't realize\n\n02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000\nat that exact point\n\n02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000\nin the tour where it comes in the movie\n\n02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000\nI made that\n\n02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000\nV-Log entry\n\n02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000\nI wanted to help with that\n\n02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000\nbut it was true\n\n02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000\nSo I think Spencer's the hero\n\n02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000\nwho should focus on him\n\n02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000\nBut also\n\n02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000\nAaron told me at one point\n\n02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000\nI remember\n\n02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000\nwatching early cuts\n\n02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000\nand had a little nausea\n\n02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000\nabout what I was thinking\n\n02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000\nI was just, I don't know\n\n02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000\nNeil was having trouble fighting the story\n\n02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000\nHe didn't even need to have one\n\n02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000\nBut if you try to tell a story about me\n\n02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000\nor footage about me\n\n02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000\nthis is going to be too dark\n\n02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000\nand I remember Aaron telling me\n\n02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000\njust tell them to think about Spencer\n\n02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000\nbut it was obviously a thing\n\n02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000\nand I did tell Neil about that\n\n02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000\nand I didn't tell Neil\n\n02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000\nwhat the idea was\n\n02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000\nbecause Neil was going\n\n02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000\nthrough the forest while shooting us\n\n02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000\nI don't know\n\n02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000\nI'm so happy to see\n\n02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000\nthat he's got a huge fan\n\n02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000\nfor relationships\n\n02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000\nwhile he's shooting me\n\n02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000\nBut it was her idea\n\n02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000\nand I think it was\n\n02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000\nthat was the thing\n\n02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000\nthe journey with Spencer\n\n02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000\nthat was the big saving grace\n\n02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000\nNeil instead of interviews\n\n02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000\nlike the things\n\n02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000\nthat footage of me in the bathroom\n\n02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000\nlike drunk and babbling\n\n02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000\nbut I think Neil on Spencer's journey\n\n02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000\nwas the backbone\n\n02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000\nwhile I was going to be\n\n02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000\nI'm just an asshole\n\n02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000\nI'm an asshole at the end\n\n02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000\nSpencer in the meantime\n\n02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000\nI'm an asshole dude\n\n02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000\nfor the guys\n\n02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000\nThank you\n\n02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000\nYou're welcome\n\n02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000\nI'm shaking so much\n\n02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000\nI don't know why\n\n02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000\nI'm just like everyone in that movie\n\n02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000\nFirst off, fantastic movie\n\n02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000\nThe podcast\n\n02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000\nmy life has been pretty crazy\n\n02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000\nthe last few years\n\n02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000\nand podcasts is one of my favorite discoveries\n\n02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000\nand you go to work\n\n02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000\nand it sits there and I listen to it\n\n02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000\nand what I appreciate is it's not funny\n\n02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000\nbut there's a lot of time that talks about\n\n02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000\nreally serious things\n\n02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000\nand extensively it takes all its time\n\n02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000\nand one time you talk about it\n\n02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000\nwhich is cults\n\n02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000\nI grew up in a religious cult\n\n02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000\nand so I was like the hit really close to home\n\n02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000\nand a lot of things that are being said\n\n02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000\nwas like wow\n\n02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000\nit's like someone who is even there\n\n02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000\nkind of understands this\n\n02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000\nand talks about it\n\n02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000\nat what point did the show\n\n02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000\nthat\n\n02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000\nwhat
