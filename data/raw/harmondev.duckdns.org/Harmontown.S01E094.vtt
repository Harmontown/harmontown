Live from Austin, Texas and taught by Southwest Festival

00:22.000 --> 00:30.000
My deep, deep pleasure to announce that Harmontown is now in session

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Thank you

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Thank you very much

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello Austin, how many of you from Austin?

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Wow, okay that's great, that's nice, that's a cool city and they seem like good people

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
This is the best town, I love it

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah, I mean we would normally say that in any city but we would be lying in most of them

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Austin is definitely always enchanting, you know what they call it Jeff?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
They call it the San Francisco of Texas

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Is that true?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, I do, I call it that

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
There's some facts about Austin, the typewriter was invented here

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
In 1842 it went to war with Oklahoma and won

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Because they wanted it to be shaped like Texas

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
And Oklahoma wanted to kind of like change the top square part of Texas and just be a box

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
But Oklahoma has to be shaped like a saucepan because Texas won

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
The right to be shaped like Texas

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Good job, what a great state, what a big great state

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
You can see it from outer space

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
It's the only state that you can see from outer space

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
It's the only one that Google satellite maps can actually identify as a state

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
It's three times bigger than the Great Wall of China coiled up into a Texas shape

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
They just started allowing Asians in here as well

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
They just started

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I think it's very progressive of you guys to finally make that leap

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Texas is one of the pioneers of Asian immigration

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
The song Yellow Rose of Texas is actually

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
About a lady named Rose

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's code for Asian

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
Give me your Asian weary, your Asian huddled masses yearning to breathe free

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
In a big giant state you can see from outer space like your stupid Great Wall

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Anyway, but we don't want to localize the show

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
We want to give you a taste of Harmontown as we do it in Los Angeles

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
In the back of a quiet comic book store

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
We're gathered here, we're podcasting live through YouTube

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Hey bar people, shut up

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
No, I mean, too much

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
That doesn't matter

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It kind of worked

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
We love you bar people

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
One of the perils of podcasting live is that YouTube has automated bots and drones

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
That are detecting the music that we were playing

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I was going to play some kick-ass local country music

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But we were afraid that it would shut down the podcast

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Yeah, it detects copyrighted music

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
So we were playing some of our friends' bands

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Dustin Marshall, our producer, has some friends with bands

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And you probably couldn't tell it from real music

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You probably thought it was real music, didn't you?

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Where's the camera? Who's shooting this?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Right there?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Just some deal with the handheld thing?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
On a VHS from 1978

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
No, it's it

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Wow

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Jeff's confused, we're not podcasting it video live

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh, I thought it was actually video for YouTube as well

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
No, no, you can do whatever you want physically

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Whatever you wanted to do

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So I should put my pass back on

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Whatever you felt you weren't allowed to do

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't know how technologies work

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
We're here at South by Southwest

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Because we're premiering the Harmontown documentary tonight

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
It's going to be good

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Spencer hasn't seen it

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
It's amazing that Spencer hasn't seen it

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Because he's essentially the star of it

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Spencer, I told him we had lunch today

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Spencer and I had a nice little date this afternoon

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
We went to a photo booth, it was very romantic

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
A couple of people walking down the road saw Spencer

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
They were like, Spencer! Spencer!

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
It's going to fucking change everything for that guy

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, Jesus

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I had lunch with the guys that literally started

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Kickstarter today

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I have a wireless mic, Dan

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
So go on, I'm going to go retrieve my beer

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Okay

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm going to test the limits of this microphone

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
This is called crowd work

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Jeff, we're sending them out like an aqua knot

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Hello, good to see you

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Good to see you

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Pardon me

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Get out of my way

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Sorry, sorry

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
There you are, you little devil

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Go on, Dan

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
How far can you go?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Huh?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Find out how far you can go

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Should we find out?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Let's take it to the back

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
All right

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It's all right by that bar, people

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Let's check, check

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
It's still working, man

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
We can really get out

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
We can use this space

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm playing, I clicked a cue

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Hello, how are you?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Can I get you guys anything?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
You guys are good?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Like a dessert cart?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Yeah, we can hear you

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
I love it

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Say something

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm out of material

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Can you go outside on the street?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
See, I'm going to go outside

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Can I go with my beer?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm going to leave my beer here

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
All right

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Check

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Clap if you can still hear me

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Can you still hear me?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Check, one, two

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
One, two

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Wow

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
He sounds bad

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
He's out on rainy street

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Fucking awesome

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I love this

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh, he can't hear us, though

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Let's all pretend like we fell asleep

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
It's very exciting

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I told them I'll pretend like they fell asleep

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
All right

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
That was a dumb joke to engineer

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
On the fly

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Good job, Jeff

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Say what?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, my fucking beer, thank you, guys

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
God bless you, sir

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
That's Tony

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I, yeah

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So it's been weird

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
This movie has been looming in my life

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
For a long time

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
And I've well deserved it

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Because I was the one who was narcissistic enough to say

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Maybe we should make a movie about me

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Being a narcissist

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And I hired this great guy

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, I didn't hire him

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
That's probably a misnomer

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Kind of partnered with Neil Berkeley

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
And had to agree with him

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
Like, you know, I can't tell you how to make your movie

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
So it's, you know, it doesn't show you

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
What a genius I am

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
On the level that I think I am

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Right

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
It shows you what a genius I am

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Probably kind of what's in reality

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Like it just kind of shows me as a

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Just sort of a fat drunk asshole

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Which is fine

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Because I'd rather be a bad person

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Than make a bad documentary

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
And I think that one of the most important ingredients

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Of a good documentary is a bad person

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I think that's what you really, like, you need

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
So we put Spencer in there

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And he gets to be a good person

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But there's a lot to talk about

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
If we were doing a regular Harmontown show

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
I would do some corrections

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I would do a correction segment right now

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Okay, can you play a sound cue for that?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Corrections!

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Yo, yo, corrections

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Sometimes I get things wrong

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
People correct me all day long

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
They tell me you did it wrong

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
That's why I'm doing the corrections song

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Corrections

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Austin loves, yeah, correction

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Austin, Austin

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You're gonna get some entertainment tonight

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
This show is no joke

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
You're leaving here entertained

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
How many of you are going to the movie later?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Who among you wanted to go to the movie but can't?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's a weird reaction

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
How many of you can't because of scheduling conflicts?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Okay, so you really just can't

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Is that being there turning people away?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Is it sold out?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Oh, badges only

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So you guys don't have badges

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Stinking badges

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Elitism, what?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
Well, if you buy a ticket, do you still need a badge?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
There's a guy yelling out

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I wonder, Dan, if you and I will need our badges

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
We should just give someone that looks a little bit like us our badge

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
You can certainly give two people badges

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I don't know if you guys got those badges

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You have to take the face recognition photo

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
It wouldn't recognize my face

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I could be Nick Nolte, I could be anybody in that photo

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
But I think I have five tickets in my pocket

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
We'll try to, I don't know if you don't need badges

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
But you do need a ticket and we'll try to figure out a way

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
To give them to the people that are most deserving

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I say physical combat

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I'm just gonna break a big Texas-sized pool cube

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And leave it on the floor

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
And walk out of the room

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Alright

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
So I said that Stan Winston looked great

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
On King of the Nerds on TBS

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
He's been dead since 2006

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Corrections!

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Yo, yo

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I said a corpse looked great

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
He was a dead person

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
He's been dead for almost a decade

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And I said he looked great

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Corrections

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
Someone tweeted me who worked with Stan Winston

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I was like, he's been dead since 2006

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Who are you confusing him with?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
A guy that works at Stan Winston Studios

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Which, you know, made the poor choice to keep his name

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I mean, what business president is there there?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh, Walt Disney

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
And I just assumed he was Stan Winston

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I don't want to throw Aaron under the bus

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But Aaron, I said, is that Stan Winston?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And Aaron said yes

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And she doesn't know who that is

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
She's 29

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
She thinks that the Challenger Shuttle

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Is the one we took from the hotel

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Make it fun of my young girlfriend

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
If being young is a crime

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Why do I always brag about it?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Alright, so speaking of being young

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
It's America's a young country, Jeff

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
And as you know, it was built on the backs of unpaid labor

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I just made a good Freudian slip

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
An appropriate, it was built on the...

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
I once said in the podcast

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
That America was the first country to make slavery illegal

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I was like, yeah, come on, look at the bright side

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Somebody tweeted me, you're full of shit

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It's like way the opposite

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Terrible, terrible

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We were doing it until yesterday

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
And we hung onto it as long as we could

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I think Italy outlawed it a long time ago

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
We were like, it's fine

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So, sorry about that

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Everyone

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
What a bad thing to be wrong about

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I think I already corrected this one

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
But I once said that the TSA was a private company

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And not a government agency

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Again, I don't want to throw her into the bus

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
But Aaron

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Aaron told me that

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And I just believed her

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I don't Google anything Aaron says

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
If I did, my IQ would go up like a thousand points

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I just believe everything she says

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Because she's a woman and she's supposed to fill me

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
With knowledge and life

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
She's my muse, so I'm like, oh really?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, I'll say that to everyone

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
That's not a private company

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
However, they can still go fuck themselves, right?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I don't know

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Well, they keep the nice people safe

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
When you're getting on the plane

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I'll take an airport by airport basis

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Because some airports are cool

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And some airports are full of A-holes

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't know why they don't smile a little bit

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Have you guys flown in or out of Philadelphia?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Fuck those TSA people, they're the worst

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Fuck Philadelphia TSA

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Anybody in Philadelphia?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Get out, leave, sir

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
The city of Brotherly

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Hurry up and take your shoes off

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
You're from Philly, sir?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Is it just me or is it the angriest town in the world?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
People are pretty angry there

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
TSA, yeah, that airport, wow

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Not good

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Is it me or was that thing that happened in LA

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Where a guy came into the airport and shot the whole thing up

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And shot a TSA guy, it was like

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
That didn't really get publicized that much

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Was that sort of a...

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
What airport was that?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
It was LAX

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Was it LAX?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Our airport

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
It was a big deal for like a day and a half

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Kind of to some people

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And then it just went away

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Did Aaron tell you that?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Maybe, I don't know, I should Google it

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Alright, that's the end of the correction segment

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Yo, yo, now everything's gonna be right

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Everything I say is gonna be day or night

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
There's nothing more right than that

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I fucked your mama cause she's not fat

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But if she was, I'd still fuck her

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Because you're a gentleman

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Yes

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Cause I don't believe in socializing women

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
To be ashamed of their bodies

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I would fuck your mama no matter what

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I think it's shitty the way we treat our women

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And I will always be there for your mama

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I like that there's people eating over there

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
That have nothing to do with the show

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
They're having chicken wings and you're talking about

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
No, yeah, they're just hanging out like Seth Rogen made a comic book

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Or something and they're like in the back waiting for it to be unveiled

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I got off the plane here at Austin International Airport

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Whatever you call it

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
And there's, you know how the people are waiting there with placards

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
For people that have like a car service

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
And they'll say like S Thompson or J Anderson

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
There was a woman, a young gal

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
Holding a sign the size of like a movie poster

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
And in a font that was bigger than the font

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
They used to announce the end of World War II

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Seth Rogen

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Like everyone else had a regular size thing

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
It's like give the guy a break

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Also I found out today he flew in today

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
That was yesterday

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Somebody was fucking around

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Somebody was hoping Seth Rogen would just wander into their car

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It was like Sandra Bernhardt and King of Comedy

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Like she was just waiting

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Seth Rogen maybe

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
She probably had a couple behind that that were like

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Barack Obama

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
I'll take what I can get

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Alright let's do a new segment Jeff

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Do you want the same musical cue or

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Let's do a different one

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
This segment is called

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Forrest Controversy

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
Forrest Controversy let's do

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Forrest Controversy

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And we're going to argue about something

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That I decided to argue about

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's not really an issue

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
But I'm deciding to make it an issue

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Forrest Controversy

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Alright

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The show has it all you guys

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The show we're singing, we're dancing

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I went outside

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That's groundbreaking entertainment

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Petty cabs

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
The bicycle rickshaw things that you have here in this town

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
They have them in San Francisco during Comic Con

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
You get into a backseat of a big tricycle

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And a guy drives you around

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Or a girl

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
They make me very uncomfortable

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I don't like to use them

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Why?

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm too close to the actual capitalism

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's just like you

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You're also right up somebody's ass

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You have a butt right in your face the entire ride

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
It's too weird to be close enough

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
To a place that someone can bike you

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
But you choose not to walk

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
So they have to bike extra people

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That's weird

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
I took one yesterday from the east side over there

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
From that little yellow jacket social club

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
That plays rules

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
You couldn't get a cab

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
We were promised when we came here

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
There's a company called Uber

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
That is like a private cab company

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, fuck Uber

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
They're a sponsor

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Fuck you

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
If you don't know who Uber is

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm here to tell you that they're a bad company

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
They should be ashamed of themselves

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I'll foot that 15 grand

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Fine

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I've made over songs in community

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I'll just write that check

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Okay, good

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I took a little cab

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
At my height, a little tiny petite little thing

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
And she drove me and she was very cool

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And I wanted to go somewhere that was pretty far

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
But you cannot get a taxi in this town right now

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You cannot get into a vehicle

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
And even if you do, you can't make it anywhere

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
So the petty cab is kind of convenient

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It's convenient and that's why I said artificial controversy

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm sure it's a good thing

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
I feel weird as a 41-year-old man

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Climbing my fat ass onto a bike

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
And going like, you walk

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You walk for me

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Make your feet do more for my feet

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I came from the east side

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Came to the convention center

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Which I think is right across the street

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
To get my badge

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
And I ran a dispenser

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
It's a dispenser and I were right in the same line together

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I go, hey, I'm going to go to this other bar

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Farther west side of town

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
And I got this gal waiting outside in this petty cab

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
So we get in it

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And about two blocks later

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
A guy pulls up alongside her in another petty cab

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
And she goes, hey, Eric, you want to do switchies?

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
We just got into his

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And he took over, especially like, yeah

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I'm pretty uncomfortable about that

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
He's like, we did double the weight

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
You know, that was kind of...

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, and I was like, well someone else

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Like Aaron and I walked past a group of people

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That were coming out of a restaurant

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
And this young lady who had had a few margaritas

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
With lunch was like, she just came out

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And I was just like, petty cab, petty cab

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
She was just yelling it out

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Then a guy came over

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And she's like, hello

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
She just yelled it out

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And then she started talking to him about his rates

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Before she...

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
She was like, is it still $5?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
And he was like, well, it's $5 of you, blah, blah, blah

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
And she's like, okay

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And got out and I was like, that's...

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
I don't want to be that

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
That was like the bellock to my Indiana

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Like I didn't want...

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I felt like I needed to confront that character

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
That's why they call it a petty cab

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I know, that's the thing

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
That's also the word petty

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
It's like, really, the emperor's clothes

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Are just down the toilet

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I just want to see something

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Because from up here

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
And I'm fine with this

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Because I've been through worse

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Up here, it sounds like

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Absolutely no one in this room

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Can hear us at all

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
And no one's listening

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
And everyone's just talking

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Okay, so you can hear me fine

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
You can hear me fine

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I just want...

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
I have weird OCD

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I want to verify that

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Can you keep talking, Jeff?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I just want to go back and...

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
I want to know what it's like to be at this show

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Wandering amongst you like a lowland gorilla

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
To me, it seems like it's like being at LAX

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Okay, these guys are just hanging out

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Talking, they're just talking

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
This guy's just pointing at his phone

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
He's telling these guys, you should look at my phone

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
You were drinking with me?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I was blacked out

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
You're trying to take advantage of my alcoholism

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Like you could just tell me that

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
What are you guys doing at South by Southwest?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Are you premiering a film?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Yes, yes

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Will you tell the people?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Have you all ever heard of Bitcoin?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Bitcoin?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You all heard of Bitcoin?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Okay, if you heard of Bitcoin

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
You know right now you can't get an iOS wallet

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
In the Bitcoin store

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I mean in the iOS store, right?

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Come talk to me, alright?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And I can get you a Bitcoin wallet

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Right now for your iPhone application

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
What sort of weird hustles going on over there?

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
You can't just hijack our show

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Hold on, hold on

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh shit, he's standing up

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
God damn it

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Hold on

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
God damn it

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Let me, if you want me to come up on stage

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Get up here, get up here

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Come up on stage

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Alright

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Alright, here we go

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Hey, check this out, okay?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
So it's nothing illegitimate

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Okay

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Somebody call the police

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Call the police

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Alright

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
You smell great

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I know I smell great

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
You smell really good

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I gotta smell great

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
When you go back to the crowd eventually

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I want everyone to take a little whiff of this guy

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Everybody smell me

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
You smell like a fucking pantry

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Smell me, okay

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm gonna do it really quick, okay?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Fucking break it down

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
It's not illegitimate, okay?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
We're within the Apple

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Enterprise developer solution

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Because when you join

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And when you get our application

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
You become a member

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Of our cooperative, okay?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Of our prerogative?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Cooperative

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Oh God damn it

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
It's not cooperative

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Now check this out

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
You can sue who you want to sue

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Cooperatives, cooperatives

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Listen, hold on, hold on

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Cooperatives were like a big thing a while ago

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Because people worked together

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
So we built a cooperative

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
To allow all of us to work together with Bitcoin

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
For the people who have our wallet

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
To get paid

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
You understand what I'm saying?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
So it's like

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Distribution of wealth

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Without distribution of wealth

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Because the reason why we did it

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Can I do it real quick?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
In this country

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
The stage is all yours right?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
That's what's up

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
You have the floor

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
That's what's up, alright?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
So in this country

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
We feel like that it was an injustice, okay?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It's an injustice that the country

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Advertises a lottery

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
To the poorest people

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Yes, yes, yes

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
That's injustice

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Now you got me on board

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Yeah, that's injustice

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So check this out

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
But those same poor people

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Can't invest in early stage startups

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
That's stupid

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
So you tell poor people

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Here, go invest in this lottery

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Somebody got to win

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
It might as well be you

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
But you can't take that same money

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
And invest it in people, right?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
That are right in your neighborhood

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
Right

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
There you go

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So what we figured out is

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
What we did was

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
We said, okay

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
If you have this situation

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Where you have a cooperative

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
That owns a piece of a company

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Now the cooperative

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Can get paid from the company

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
And the people who own

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
The part of the cooperative

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Get the same benefits

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
As early stage investors

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And it's all legal

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It's all legal

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So that's our spiel

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
If you want to get

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
In the cooperative

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
It's a free trial

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
For South by Southwest

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm down here in Harmontown

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Chilling

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
And guess what?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm going to let y'all know something

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
What's the major street name

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
In Austin?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Cesar Chavez

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
No

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Trinity

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
That's where the L

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
That's my name

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Guess what my middle name is

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Wait, what's your name?

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
My first name is Lamar

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
My middle name is

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
What's the city?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
This is my town

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Your name is Lamar Austin?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
My name is Lamar Austin Wilson

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Alright

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
That's what's up

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Alright

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Check it out

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Thank you Lamar

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
I'm going to sit down

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Thank you

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Thank you very much

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
For coming back here

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
No problem

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Lamar Austin everybody

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Lamar Austin Wilson

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Smell that guy

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
It's a cooperative

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Smell him

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Everybody smell him

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
He smells like a delicious forest

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
A delicious forest

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I want to nestle near him

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Lamar Austin Houston

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Wilson

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Wilson

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Lamar Austin Wilson

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
That was the best

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Again

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
I only have one question

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
What?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
All of that stuff was great

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
It's a cooperative Bitcoin

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Like get in on the ground floor

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Gather people's money

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
If Bitcoin's a real thing

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Then it's a real currency

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Let's let people get involved in it

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
From the ground floor

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
That aren't speculators

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
And carpet baggers

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
My only question is

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Why is he having a meeting about it

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
In the back of my fucking show?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
It turned out fine

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Maybe he's the shrewdest businessman of all time

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
When he knew there'd be a platform

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
What if this was the cure for cancer podcast?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
What if I was trying to cure cancer

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
And he's talking about fucking Bitcoin in the back

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
That would be a crime

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
He's lucky I have nothing to do tonight

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
You have no agendas

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I'm watching a movie about you

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I'm open

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I'm fine

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Everyone here is on a higher moral high ground

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
That's true

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Every documentary is about like

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Probably

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
About saving the world

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
It's a documentary about abortion

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
It's a documentary about

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
I don't know

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
I can't rattle them off

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Because I don't care

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Every documentary is largely a documentary

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
About us singing songs about dicks and balls

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
For a month

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
That was one of the big things that Neil

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
The director regretted cutting out

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Was the Pringles dick song

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And the chicken noodle dick song

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
But special features

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
It's a little over 90 minutes

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
The documentary

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Believe me

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
The guys

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
He claims

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
He's got a four hour version of the documentary

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
That I'm sure we'll all get to see one day

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Yeah

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
He's also got 650 hours of everything

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
We were talking

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Neil and I

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
And he was saying that

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
He could put out the entire long version

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Because some of the fans

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
They'll probably cut together a better movie

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Than I made

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Because that's how our fans are

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
We should just dump the entire

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
500, 700 hours of all the footage

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
And let one of you weirdos

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Just get in it

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
And make like the perfect cut of it

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Should we bring Neil up here?

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah, let's bring Neil

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Looking good, baby

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Neil Berkley

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Ladies, feast your eyes

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh, wow

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Okay

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
You said at the hotel

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
You're like, we can't share an Uber

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Because you got to change

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
And we made fun of you

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
But holy cow

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
You changed

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Thanks for bringing me up after Lamar

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Hard to follow

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
But the room got quiet

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
So the way it works is

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
For those of you who are just listening

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
There's no way to express

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
How dynamic that guy was on stage

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
He took over the room

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Whatever you're doing Lamar

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I'm in, I'm in

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
He took over the room

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
And then after he left

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Everything got quieter

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
I don't think that's because

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
He was making the noise

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
I think it's because everyone was like

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm into it

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I'm into Bitcoin

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
I think they're like

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I think they're online

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Trying to find out more about Bitcoin

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
He made a good case

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
But this is Neil Berkley

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Throughout the movie is largely a ghost

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Because he's a good documentarian

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
As much as we were all stuck together on a bus

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
We want to incorporate the crew

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
And the director and everybody

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Because we're all trapped

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
In one vehicle for a month

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
He kind of insisted on being his ghostly figure

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I was talking to the producer earlier

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
And I said, I'm very nervous

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
I hope people like this movie

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And he goes, do you know where you're showing it?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
It's like asking kindergartners

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Do they like these cupcakes?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
All right

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I mean, not that you guys are easy

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Or anything

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
It's just that you're driven

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Mainly by naps and sugar

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But yeah, I hope

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I've been, I mean

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
For the last over a year

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
We've been living in a world

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Where this movie hasn't come out yet

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
And now we've, I don't care

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
If they hate it or love it

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But I can't wait to move

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Across a threshold into a world

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Where other people have seen this thing

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Because I don't have no idea

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm usually in total control

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Over how people see me

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Whether it seems from a distance

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Like I'm making an ass of myself

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
I'm crucifying myself

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm attacking others

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm attacking myself

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
It's all my big control-free game

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Like I'm always just going

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
I control what happens

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
If you come to shoot me

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Your bullets gonna go through

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
A bigger hole than I blew

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Moments before you came in the door

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And that's how I like it

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
But this movie is like

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I fucked up

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I hired a great filmmaker

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I had to make a deal with him

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I got no control over this thing

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
I have no idea

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Whether it's good or bad

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Because I watch it

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
And I'm in it

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
And I'm a narcissist

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
So I love it

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
But at the same time

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
I hate myself

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
So I'm like

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
This must be stupid

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Because I'm in it all the time

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
My line, what I tell people is

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Why I think it's interesting

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
And why I made it was

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
It's not to decide

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Whether you love or hate Dan

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
It's not about that

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It's about understanding

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Why there's a roomful of people

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Watching him

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
And listening to him talk

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Because you are all here

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Because he speaks to you

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
He does something

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
That you all are reacting to

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
It's explaining that

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
So it's your fault

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
It's all of your fault

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
For me, the movie really is not

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
Not about Dan

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Not about our show

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
It's about Bitcoin

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
The show is never going to

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Really recover from him

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Leading the stage, is it?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Well, that's like saying

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
This island is never going to recover

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
From this papaya

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I mean, you're right

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
We should base this fucking industry on it

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I was going to say

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The movie is about the fans of the show

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Because there's a group of people

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
That showed up

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Actually, what's your name right there

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
With the beard and the glasses?

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Andy

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Andy, you want to come up for a second?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, Andy Young, yeah

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Andy, come up

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Because this guy...

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Andy Young

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I want to apologize to Andy

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
He shot some footage

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
We didn't get to use any of it in the movie

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
And I'm very sorry

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
I'm very sorry about that

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
One of the dudes told me

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
I was like, I'm going to go

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Wait, he did it though, isn't he?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
I mean, he's...

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Andy's in the movie

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Andy came to the show that we did in Austin

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
During the tour

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Yes, you're in the movie

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
You're in the movie

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
And he came back

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Was it your girlfriend or just female friend?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
No, just a friend

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Is a shooter for me, Tennille

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Tennille, right

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
And they came back

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
And they did this really beautiful interview

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
And it was like

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
That was pretty early on in our tour

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
And you came back with this

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Giant smile on your face

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
And she had this great smile on her face

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
And there's a really cool shot

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
In the documentary

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
When you guys leave

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Our green room

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
They walk out

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
And you...

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I think she's shooting you, right?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Right, yeah

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Is that in the film?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
He gives this look

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Like he just met the Rolling Stones

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
And it was so good

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
And it's just like

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
We didn't do anything

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Except to do our little show

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
But there's this weird sort of awesome love

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
There's these little bits in the film

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Where there's straight to camera interviews

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
With our harmonians

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
And that's...

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
I mean, I'm a crier

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I get really emotional

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
And I watch that stuff

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Everybody that sees it

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Always talks about being brought to tears

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
In those moments

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
There's something strange about that

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Because it's not like

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
There's anybody on camera saying

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
I lost my baby

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
And I use Harmontown to...

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
It's just humanity

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
It's just people's faces

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
And they're just saying

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
I feel like I'm allowed to be me

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Because this guy's such an asshole

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
So I sent a tweet out to all the fans

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Saying if you want to be in Harmontown

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Shoot your experience of going to the show

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Shoot what you would do that day

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Going to Harmontown

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And Andy's the only person that did it

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
And he's in the movie

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
So you all could have been in Harmontown

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I haven't seen it yet

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I haven't seen it yet

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
It sounds like I cry in the movie

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
I hope I don't cry

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
No, you don't cry

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I mean, that looks super cool

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
Look out and smile right now

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
He's fucking adorable, right?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
So that happens a lot throughout the movie

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Where we meet people

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
And there's just these...

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I don't even know if they know the camera's rolling

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
They're just kind of staring

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Kind of absently into the lens

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
Andy, now make a face like

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
You just found out that you...

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
You're totally hungry

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And you're totally high

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And you just found out that you forgot

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
That you put two Reese's Peanut Butter Cups

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
In the freezer and you just found them

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
So open the freezer jar

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
And make that face at that moment of discovery

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That's the face that he makes

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
That's the face!

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
After he interviews me

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
That was pretty much how I felt, yeah

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Which makes me feel like a bad person

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Because I'm not worth that

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I'm not a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
But a freezer

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
No, I think you are absolutely worth that

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I think Neil made a great point of like

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Why people are in this room

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Because you make people want to get out of their chairs

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
And make something

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
And that's like why I was so interested

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
In like, seeing the show

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Right?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
How great is it to have them back on community?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
It's amazing

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
This town is full of awesome people

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
In the movie

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
All the interviews are looking right in the camera

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Very Aero Morris

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
I ripped that guy off

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Because, whatever

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
But there's no lower thirds

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
Like the fans right next to Ben Stiller

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
He is not more important than anyone else in the movie

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Jack Black, Sarah Silverman

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Is right next to Andy and some fan

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
No one's name is down the corner

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
They're all just people talking to the camera

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Andy, are you going to the movie?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Oh, fuck yeah, I'll be there for sure, yeah

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Do you have a friend here

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
That's not able to go to the movie

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Because they don't have a ticket?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Yeah, those dudes, I guess

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Yes, oh, of course, Dan

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Well, it's two people

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Yeah, oh, I'm going to fucking get mom here for this

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah, they're here somewhere

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
You guys, you have to make the face

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
When he gives them to you, you have to make the face

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Everyone's Andy's friend right now

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Me! I love Andy

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Oh, that guy, yeah, of course

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
All right, because they only have five of these

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
So giving two to Andy Young

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Because he went to University of Texas

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah, I'm so sorry about whoever

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Tries to mom me after this

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You're putting me in a really weird position

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
I'll get you, yeah, yeah

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
How do these work? These are just like weird

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Ripped apart when I got this thing

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
The sad part about this is that

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
When Andy gets murdered in an alley later on

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
He never got to see the movie

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Yeah, yeah, we're going to

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
That's a double whammy

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Yeah, exactly, he didn't pan out

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Thank you, Andy Young

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Well, thank you guys, really appreciate it

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Stoll of Harmontown, Andy Young

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Bitcoin!

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Cooperative Bitcoin!

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Lamar!

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Lamar!

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I swear to God though, he's got a fucking point

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
I mean, not like that should be surprising

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
But I think I get it

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm not into economics, but I understand

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Like, we keep arguing about Bitcoin

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
In the writer's room at Rick and Morty

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
But it's like, if this is an emergent currency

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Why are there people who

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Barely have the internet

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Who are being locked out of it

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Before it even fucking starts

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Isn't that what his point is?

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
Like, let's start like a credit union

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Where people can like, like, like

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Get in on this shit

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
So that if Bitcoin did turn into a thing

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
That there would be people who were

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Poor before it became a thing

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
That as a result are now not poor

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Let's make a new batch of

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Nuvo Reese

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
I think that's what he meant

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
It's okay

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
If I got that wrong

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
To be honest, I consider myself a good listener

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I was so dazzled by his scent

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
That I got to find out what

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Deodorant or Cologne?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
God damn it, you kind of want to just nibble on it

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
What if you found out that wasn't Cologne?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
What if that's what came out of Dartmouth?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I think his sweat

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
His own sense of self worth

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Or then he's in the wrong business

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Like, he should be bottling

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Like the smell of Lamar Austin Wilson

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Instead, he's hooked into this Bitcoin thing

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
But he's cursed with this beautiful smell

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Alright, so what else is on the docket?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Let me take a look at my...

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Neil, what's your problem?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
What do you want to talk about?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Did you know Stan Winston was dead?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
No

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Okay, do you like the TSA?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
No

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Okay

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, Neil, okay

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Alright, so I'm getting married to my fiancé

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Ryan McGathey, who's in the movie

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
I'm going to marry the fuck out of this woman

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
And part of marrying the fuck out of somebody

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Usually, traditionally

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Is like, you absorb them

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Into your last name

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
The woman takes the last name of the man

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
But then in LA, especially among creatives, actors

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And that kind of thing, they hyphenate

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Oh, I'm...

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I'm Catherine Zeta

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I'm going to marry

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Tom Jones

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Oliver Jones

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm going to become Catherine Zeta-Jones

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm not giving up the Zeta

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
That's probably not what happened with her

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
But, like, I need people to help me

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
We don't know what to do

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
I honestly don't want to force my last name on Aaron

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Aaron Harmon is a shitty name

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
How about Dan and Aaron Lamar Austin Wilson

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
What about Dan McGathey?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Well, I mean, there's that, but

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I like Dan Harmon

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I don't want to make her be Aaron Harmon

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I don't want to be Dan McGathey

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Why don't you just keep your own names and not do that?

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Because what about the children?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Huh?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
What are the children?

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Make up an awesome last name

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Then the middle name becomes McGathey or whatever

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
But then what about their children?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
What do we Spanish?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Think about five generations from now

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
They're going to be like, my name is Ramon LaBea

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
That guy's in the movie

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
What's up?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
That guy's in the movie

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Oh, in the front row?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Anyone here?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
I don't know

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Do you know you're in the movie, sir, in the front row?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I don't know

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
That's Mars, he's part of our police district

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Mars is in the movie, yeah

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Congratulations

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Stand up

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
If you would like to stand up, sorry

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
I like your hair, a little dyed, toughed of hair

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
I love that, it's very cool

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
I like the idea of professional, keep your name

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Personal, take Harmon

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
And the kids get that

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Oh, so, okay

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Yeah

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Alright

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
I think that makes sense

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Sorry, I missed that

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
What was the pitch?

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
You can somehow compartmentalize your professional name

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
from your personal name

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
And that the kids will just become Harmon's

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Hyphenate

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
And the kids get her name

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Alright, let's bring Erin up here because

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Yo, gonna marry this girl

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Gonna take her last name for a while

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
She's throwing t-shirts to the crowd

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Erin McGatney saying it loud

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
She's gonna marry Dan Harmon soon

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
She's gonna have a baby in her womb

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Gonna, what are we gonna call that baby?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I don't know, McGatney, maybe?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I just decided

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Okay

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
I think that I'm going to

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
I'm going to keep McGatney as my middle name

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
I'm gonna make Harmon my last name

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And when we have children

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
I'm gonna make a secret math and passageway

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
That'll be like in their nursery

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And they'll always see it there

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
And it'll say McGatney Tunnel

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
We won't tell them that my maiden name is McGatney

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But then one day, we'll hire someone

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
To come in as like a spray and say like

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Hey, psst

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And he'll have eyeballs painted on his hands

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Saffron, Saffron, over here

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Saffron, Saffron

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
We could talk about it later

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Saffron, Saffron, Cinnamon

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Boy and girl identical

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Cinnamon, Tuparick, are you having strippers?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Stickers

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Tuparick, Harmon, McGatney

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
You get in here right now

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Apple

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Saffron

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Yoda

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
You are due on the main stage right now

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
And the hired actor will say

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Hey, do you know you're special?

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
And Saffron and Cinnamon will be like

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Yes, yes, we know we're special

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
We know our father's like the most smart man in the world

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
He's told us a million times over

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
In that nursery book that he wrote especially for us

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
We know that mom loves yarn

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
And he'll be like

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Hey, no, here's a key

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
And there'll be a key to the passageway

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And they'll go down the passageway

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
And there'll be a room that will be illuminated by torches

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
With like a giant banner that says

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
You are in the gaffey

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
And they'll be like ashes

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
For them to make ends on their forehead

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And it will be like a secret club

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
And then they'll find me sleeping

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
In my

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
Are you saving up for all the therapy time right now?

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Which sounds fucking horrifying

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
Don't let your kids walk in a torchlet passageway

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
They'll find you sleeping in this tunnel in their nursery

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
No, no, no, I'll be in our room

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
But I'll be wearing one of those really beautiful

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Nicole Kidman dressing gowns

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That I imagine she wears

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
From like Eyes Wide Shut?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
No, from her life

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
I just imagine she wears night gowns

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And they'll rouse me

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And I'll say, yes, you are

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
You're in the gaffey

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And so it'll be special

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
It'll be like the lady from the lake

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
You know, I can make this a lot simpler

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Don't have kids

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
It saves a lot of trouble

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You said that about a dog

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
And you love our dog

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Your dog's a weirdo, but I like him

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
All right

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah, well, Neil's asking if we can tell a story

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
About something

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
The answer is yes, automatically

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
What is it?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
The pickup shot

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
An idea you wear the same shirt

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
From a year ago

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Oh, Jesus Christ, Neil

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Okay, all right

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I don't even bear it, I'm sorry

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Yeah, Neil, okay

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Here's a dirty little secret about documentaries

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
You shoot 650 hours

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
You edit it into 90 minutes

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And then depending on the structure of the 90 minutes

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
You may decide you need

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Like maybe a shot, for instance

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Of Dan Harmon leaving his house in the morning

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
And that may be shot a year later

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
In which case you try to match the shirt

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
And if Dan Harmon has gained, let's say, 30 pounds

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
That's how he'll find out

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Is me walking down the sidewalk

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
With buttons flying off of my stomach

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
As I move this way

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
It felt like I was too fat to play the role of myself

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
To be cast as myself

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
He came down and he said

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I'd like to think the cotton shrinks

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But I think it's something else

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
And then you sort of slowly squat down

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Until the shirt popped open

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Like a treasure box

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
It'd be great if you bent down fast enough

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And the shirt just completely atomized

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Until you have missed

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I could just turn this

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Speaking of shirts and corrections

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
We have some shirts that are throughout some shirts

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Nice segue

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
And I guess I've given Dan some wrong information

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Before we went on tour, I suggested to Dan

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
We really should have merch on the tour

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
And Dan said, no, no, I don't want those people

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
To have anything of me

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
And I said, no, I think they like you

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Big back and forth

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
But anyway, I designed all the t-shirts

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
With Jenny Fine artists and all the poster

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
She did the art, I took the picture

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
But I was also put in charge of ordering all the shirts

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
And I don't know how to order things

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
And I was given a lot of advice

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And I ordered a certain number of t-shirts

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And there's a shot in the documentary

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
You'll see there's a shot with a ton of trash bags

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Outside of the bus

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
More t-shirts than could fit on a bus

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
And the bus driver said, look

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
No one, Van Halen doesn't have this many t-shirts

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
And I was like, no, no, no, you don't understand

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And I was really stubborn

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And I was yelling at this bus driver

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Who's been on a thousand tours

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Telling him that I knew everything about t-shirts

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
We sold a fifth of them

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
But there are tons and tons of t-shirts

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Because we didn't take Bitcoin

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Lamar off to a certain extent

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Is the point of your story that we have a lot of t-shirts to give away?

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
The point of my story is that

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Sometimes I'm really sure about things that are incorrect

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
But also, Harmontown.com

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
We have a few left

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
We have a few left

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
We have a few thousand shirts left

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Did you already give away all the ones for tonight?

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
There are a few more

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Casey is going to toss out some

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Sorry, I couldn't really start

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
T-shirt tossing wrap

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Give that guy in the backpack one, now you're

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Wait, is there anybody here who feels

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
More deserving of a t-shirt than anybody else?

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Alright, you miss, come up on stage

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Make your case, hold on to that Casey

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Miss, why do you feel that you deserve one of these

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
More than the other people that want a t-shirt?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
I don't know who Dan Harmon is

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I've never heard of him before

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I've never watched Community

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And I'm here with my boyfriend who loves Dan Harmon

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
And we walked towards 15 blocks in the rain

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I didn't hear the last part

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
But I hate myself enough to give her a t-shirt

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
I feel like she

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
You did well, I feel that

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
A lot of people might have said as much or more

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I feel that maybe you should wrap your case

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
I feel that you should be able to wrap

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
You should be able to wrap

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
15 blocks in the rain, I don't know who Dan Harmon is

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
My boyfriend loves Dan Harmon

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
My card is not waterproof

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Alright, that was a fiasco

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
If she was a child, this would be adorable

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Triple X

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
Timing and comedy is everything

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Now, what's your name?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Heather

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Heather, here's the thing, we have an XL

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And a triple XL left

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
You don't seem like any of the rest of us

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
You seem like a little tip of tea for that

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
The big one?

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Okay

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Which one do you want, XL or triple X?

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Triple X

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Damn, alright

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Thank you

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Heather, not even close

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Heather, everybody

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
Okay, now, we have one XL left

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
There's one XL left?

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Okay, who feels the most XL tonight?

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Who's the gal in the way in the back?

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
You're not an XL, you're a tiny little whisper of a thing

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah, you, you're not an XL

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Oh, she's getting closer, oh my god, no, I'm kidding

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
You want the XL?

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
I'll just give it to her, fuck it

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Alright, she's small

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Huh, are we out?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
You're from Australia?

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
What part of Australia?

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Perth

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Perth, I love it

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Are we out of shirts?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
We're out of shirts, sit down

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
They make shirts out of

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
He can make a shot out of a plant, right?

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
You're a master of nature

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
I only know about Australia from TV and movies

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
We should have, we should have held up

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Like I should have held up the extra large and go

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
And he goes, that's not a shirt

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
And then you hold up the triple X, now that's a shirt

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Alright, well let's do the same similar process

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
With these tickets to the movie

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
I got three left, I want to feel satisfied

47:58.000 --> 48:01.000
Do more rapping for me

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
That wasn't going to be able to go to the movie

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
That really quote unquote deserves

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
You all deserve, I don't know how to do this selection

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I'm afraid to look at them, I'm afraid to look at them

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I don't know how to do this

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I just want to try to

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
Well don't go out, I want to hear people's stories

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You know, I like the guy, hang on

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
He's already coming up

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I wasn't going to say somebody else

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
We're taking this guy, he already got a shirt

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Alright, I did, yeah I got a shirt

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
But I want to give him a hug

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
I really love community and Rick and Morty

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I think they're fucking hilarious

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I told them like five times, so

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
They're my favorite

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Do you hate Harmontown?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Harmontown, I haven't seen it

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I didn't know it existed until an hour ago

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Alright, come on, I'm going out

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Dan, I have the guy

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I'm almost certain I have the one

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
What, you do?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
I think I do

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Alright, what's your name by the way?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Nick

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Nick?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Nick Parkett

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Nick got like three photos with me

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
And he had to keep adjusting the lighting and stuff

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I didn't, there's a guy

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
That looks enough like George Lucas to be notable

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Who's not raising his hand

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
He's pouting

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
But his friends are pointing at him

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
The people next to him are nominating him

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
And he's being a good person about it

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Saying, I don't feel like I deserve this

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Are you willing to come up here sir?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Okay

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Come on up stage

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Yeah, sure

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Do you need help?

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Your friends think that you

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Hello everybody

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Deserve this, do you know why they would think that?

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
What's your name first off?

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Brendan

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Brendan, Brendan everybody

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Do I deserve it?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I mean, does anybody deserve anything?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Right, no, of course not

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
But why do your friends think you deserve it?

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
No, I don't have a ticket to the movie

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
I recently lost my job and I think that's a good reason

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
That's a great reason

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
It's hard to find work

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
It's hard to find work

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And I'm looking

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
But I think seeing the documentary will inspire me

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
To become who I am

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Are your friends going to the movie?

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Do they have tickets?

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
No, no

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
But they want you to go because they...

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
They love me

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
They're rallying around you, they want you to go

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
I'm gonna cry

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
What job did you lose, do you mind saying?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I was tech support

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
It wasn't like my career goal kind of thing

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
What would your dream gig be?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Like pie in the sky

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
If you could do anything and get paid

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
To do the dream gig

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
And be embarrassing about it

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
What would be the best way to make a living?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Actually voice over for Cartoon

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Oh, fuck yeah, that's a good one

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Give him a round of applause

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Alright, okay

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Make sure you give your name to somebody

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Over there in the VIP section

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
That says they work for Starbridge Industries

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
There's Casey Rubb

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
If we can get you out to LA

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
To do a voice for Rick and Morty

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
And here's...

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
That's awesome

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Because I can do that now

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
And here's your ticket to the Harmontown from there

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
What a reward!

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Awesome, man

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Yeah, Brendan, when you come to LA

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Make sure that you come and join us

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
On stage at Meltdown for Harmontown, man

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
That's fucking great

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Also, if we could have him come up and maybe do a...

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
If you got the wherewithal of Brendan

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
To come to LA, maybe we can have him sit in on a D&D

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Like a little trial voice over thing

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
One of these two remaining tickets

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Doesn't have the barcode stub on it

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
It got torn off

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
But because there's two remaining tickets

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I want to try something special

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Because my relationship with Erin

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Is not exactly portrayed in a light

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That makes everyone want to run out

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And fall in love in the movie

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And yet I'm getting married to her

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Because I do love her

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
And I think that...

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I wonder if there's a couple here tonight

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
That came to South by Southwest

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Alright

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
This is extra progressive

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Is this a female-female couple?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Yes, you do

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Sweet, I love it

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
That's just gonna make me feel better about myself all week

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
There are also stairs over here

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Alright

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
So you guys are a couple

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
What are your name?

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I'm K.D.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Bethany

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Alright

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I'm not allowed to say that's hot

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Because that's a bygone era

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I think it's hot

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Do you guys bicker over?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Do you fight?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
How we feel about things

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And we kind of get too intimate

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
To some extent

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Is one of you two

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
The robot and the other one

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
The plant goddess?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I think we're both pretty emotional

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Yeah, we're pretty emotional

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Just together as a unit

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Are you punished for explaining your feelings?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
We try not to punish each other

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
For explaining our feelings

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
It makes everything worse

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
But there's

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
A lot of times when there's a balance

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
What was your last big fight?

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
And it really yelled at these microphones

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Because we have to get

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
It's kind of loud in here

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
It's gonna have to get pretty deep

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Do you want me to explain?

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
If it's okay with you guys

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I'm a sophomore

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
In college right now

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And I was living with my parents before that

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I moved out

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Bethany told me

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I'm scared that you're gonna meet somebody new

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I told her that's totally not a problem

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I did end up

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Kind of falling for a person

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And there was one night where we did

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
It's so bad, I'm so sorry

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
But I did

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Get a little bit drunk

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
And I made out with her

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
And

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It was her worst nightmare

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
My worst nightmare

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
My god

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
And you forgave her?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Yeah, I still love her

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I shouldn't

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I think

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I don't think you have to be embarrassed

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
For forgiving her

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I think that applause means

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
We're all in love with a bunch of people

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Who constantly let us down

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Right, Erin?

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Alright

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I don't know why that got that reaction

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
That's what love is

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
It's a partnership

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
It's not a fucking

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
It's not a holiday

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It's teamwork

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
And life is hard

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And you go up and you go down

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
And two people together go up and down at different times

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And I'm not saying it should be expected

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Or you're entitled to make mistakes

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
You should be punished for them

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And blah blah blah

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I know how she feels

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
When she goes like

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah, I still love her, I forgive her

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Fuck her

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
What she didn't tell you was that she gave me a free pass

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
To fuck someone else

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Alright

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Who wants to come up and fuck Bethany right now?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
There's always a way

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
For two human beings that can communicate

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
To work these things out

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Free pass

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
So you guys seem pretty young though

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I don't want to put pressure

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
At something that shouldn't be pressured

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Is this a serious relationship?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
We've been dating for two years

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
And the two of you come watch Harmontown

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
And the movie

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
The movie

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
And

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Maybe you'll get in because you've got the ripped one

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
And maybe you won't

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
That should be the deciding factor

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Whether you guys stay together

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
We'll figure it out

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Bethany and KD everybody

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I think at the heart of it all

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Shouldn't stay in anything that's bad

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
But you and I have a really solid

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Good relationship

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Or we're willing to

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Figure it out

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I would never

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I don't think

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I could never

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Stray from fidelity

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
But I don't know how much

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I get to pat myself on the back for that

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Because I just don't think

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
It's just not in my blood

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I think there are other people who are in love with each other

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
And sometimes they have like

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
I don't know, it's harder for them

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
To be like

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I never do anything that's that difficult

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Like I never

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I won't stop playing a video game

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
To make you feel better

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
But I know I would never cheat on you

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I know, what are the circumstances that would make that

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That would make me feel better

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Every time I play a video game

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
No, I'm just saying, you know

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I'm a pretty selfish guy

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
I'm like a baby and I'm not proud of that

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
And I don't think that I'm allowed to be that

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
What I'm saying is that I don't do

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
It's just to keep my relationship going

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I would do anything to keep it going

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
But I'm pretty bad at it

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I'm pretty flawed

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm pretty like

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Pretty bad at remembering

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
In moments of selfishness

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
That something that I want

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Isn't as important as making you happy

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Well, I think we're both

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Very flawed, but I think the good thing

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
About our relationship is that we are

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Ourselves all the time

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
So the flaws aren't ever deal breakers

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Like it's always a

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Well, you're doing this shitty thing

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Like I'm very messy in hotel rooms

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
For example

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Yes, it's like the moment we

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Go into the hotel room

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
The entire floor gets carpeted with

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
It's kind of a marathon

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
You guys are amazing

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I've traveled with you enough

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
We couldn't get to a hotel anywhere in the world

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
They will check in, beautiful hotel room

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I can knock on there

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
You guys store 10 seconds after you got in there

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
There's not a bit of

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Floor that is not covered in luggage

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
It's me

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
It's not my parents house

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Clothes everywhere

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
It's sort of like

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Being in a relationship with Jumanji

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Like

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
There's all of a sudden just elephants and monkeys

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Like everywhere

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
The understanding of our relationship is

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Either you accept

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
That I'm weird in hotel rooms

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
And I'll try to clean up

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
You never do

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
But if you did, I would

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
The idea is, well, that's a flaw of yours

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
When I accept that

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
So let's move forward

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
The thing is like your flaws, I accept

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Other flaws and lots of relationships

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I haven't accepted

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I'm sorry to interrupt, have you seen

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
The final cut of the film?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Not the final cut

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But close to it?

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Close to it

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
What do you think?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Like Dan said, the relationship

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Comes off looking like a

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Real poster for relationships

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Well, it's not

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
The best month

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
In the

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
History of our relationship

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And Dan can tell you

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I've gone through a lot of

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I was really torn up about it

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
With our engagement and everything

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I was bummed out that

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Our relationship

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Doesn't look so super cool

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
In the

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Movie

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
But it's

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Honest, it's everything that happened

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
I wish there were more moments with me smiling

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I learned my big lesson

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
From having a documentary made about me

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
That from now on, whenever I do

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Dry humor, I'm always going to end it

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
With bursting into laughter

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
And kissing someone on the forehead and saying

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I love you

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Because that's definitely what's missing

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I had a lot more fun on tour

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Than it showed in the movie

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I was having a good time

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
But it's

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
There's literally a moment in the movie

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Where you're actually just asking me to say

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
I love you and I won't do it

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Because I think it's funny

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And it doesn't seem funny

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I think you put it very well

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
When you said it shows your relationship

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Not at its best, not at its worst

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It's this middle ground of

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
What it's like

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
The truth is

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
We got in a really bad fight

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Early on, and it was never

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Really resolved

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And with my personality

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And maybe this is me being a woman

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Or maybe it's just me being Erin

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
But I wanted to talk stuff out

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
We didn't get to talk stuff out

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Because you were like, can we just

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Like, let's just have fun

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Like, can we deal with this later?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
But to me, it wasn't that big of a deal

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
But because we didn't talk to it, I felt weird

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And like you were rude to me

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And I have this programming

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
In me about relationships

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Where just because

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Observing my mom and my dad

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm not using it as an excuse of saying

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
This is my big flaw

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
My gender roles

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Are based on the guy coming

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Home and trying

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
To prove that there's nothing

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
To get worked up about

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
And that the woman is going

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
There is a reason to get worked up

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
You should be apologizing

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And you should be doing something

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
That the guy is supposed to go

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
No, there isn't, be quiet

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And that is the source

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Of all of our difficulties

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I'm always trying to avoid a fight

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And I end up pausing them

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I think during the tour especially

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And in real life, like in normal life

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You're very conscious of being

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
A bad boyfriend or you're very worried

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
That you're a bad boyfriend

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And most of the time when you say that

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I don't think that you're being a bad boyfriend

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Or you were so worried

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
That you were going to be a bad boyfriend

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Whenever I would say anything

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Like positive or negative, you'd be like

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Okay, come on!

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
No one cares about this!

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah, but it would be about

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Things that were positive or negative

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Or just like hanging out

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And I very much wanted to be one of the guys

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Hanging out, but I think

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I would have been put in the position

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
By you of like, come on Aaron

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Don't start anything, but I wasn't

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Sad and it felt lonely and weird

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
But I had a great time

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Alright, so speaking of nobody caring about this

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Let's bring up Spencer!

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I know, but

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Wow

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
So why don't you stand anywhere you want

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Or sit there

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
What's up? Are you guys having a good time?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Is anybody drunk right now?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Are we all going to go home

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And safely and securely

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Transfer files using Dropbox?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yeah!

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Yeah, Lamar!

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I just made $800

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Holy shit!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That's not true

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I just love Dropbox

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Spencer and I just had lunch

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And you were breaking it down about Bitcoin to me

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Because what I didn't know is that the

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
What's that? The Gox or what the hell?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Yeah, Mt. Gox

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
The trader of Bitcoins originally started off

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
As Magic Card

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Depository, that's so fucking awesome

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I'm all up in Magic and Bitcoin

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I'm in all of that

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I dig it

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Spencer, how are you holding up on this trip?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I'm having a good time

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I've been more drunk here

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Than I've ever ever been

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Yeah!

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Yeah, drinking

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Spencer and I went out to

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
The mean-eyed cat yesterday

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And with that little

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Country bar

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Spencer on a beer and a half is the coolest

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Spencer in the fucking world

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And Spencer's already really cool

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I hadn't eaten in like 14 hours

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That beer was my breakfast

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And it was afternoon

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It's like a hug from the inside

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I'm the kind of drunk who talks about

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
How drunk they are

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That's terrible, I'm sorry

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I'm just so wasted

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
But

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah, well that's the problem

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
If anybody's got a joint later on

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Hook up or other up

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Not that that's legal or anything

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
No, it's totally illegal, don't do it

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We appreciate the law

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So we just shriek weed

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
What?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Spencer, how do you feel about this film coming out?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because you have not seen this

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I have not seen it, I'm terrified

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I'm told I come out well

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But that terrifies me even more

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I don't want people to like me

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Yeah

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
You don't want people to like you

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You probably don't want people to not like you

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Yeah, it's a hard balance to strike

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Yeah

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Kind of an impossible tightrope

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I want everyone to do all stuff for me

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Without bothering me in any way

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It's hard

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Well that's what they're going to do tonight

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
They're going to watch a movie about you and love you

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Whether you like it or not

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Yeah man, I'm going to get so laid

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
You're a bashful

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
An introverted person

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You said bashful, but I thought you said a bathful

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
What the fuck does that mean?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You're a bit of a bathful

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Dirty water, mostly

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Some soap

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
What I'm trying to say is

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I'd like to have a bath with you later on

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I'm down

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You're a shy guy, but you're about to be thrust into

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
At least many stardom in this

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Because you really do emerge as a heroic figure

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
In this I would say

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah, sure

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I'm a heroic figure, you guys

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Look at all this heroism

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I mean, you're the one that goes on a journey

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Because you get to go to New York for the first time

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Right? You would never been there

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Yeah, I got to look at the M&M store

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Got all

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
All the M&M's

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
What's your take on the M&M store at Times Square?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Why is there an M&M store?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I mean, there's already a gas station

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I don't get it

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Every store is theoretically

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
A M&M store

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I mean, you can get M&M's anywhere

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Why would you seek out M&M's at a specific location?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I don't get it

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Why would you be fans of M&M's

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Like they're a franchise?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I just love chocolate, but that extra

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Coding shell

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
You know how when you go to Las Vegas

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You're walking down the strip

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And you're like, can we stop for a second?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I need a lot of M&M's

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I just want all blue ones

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Custom made

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And they need to be in a $70 container

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Spencer, what city did you most

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Identify with on the tour?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
What city did I most

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Identify with?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
What was Spencer Town?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I mean, probably New York, right?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Because everyone just ignores you

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And you can tell everybody to fuck off

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And there's people pissing in subways

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It's cool, it's cool

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I don't know

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
It's raining

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
605

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Jesus Christ

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Lamar, you still here?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
The movie's at 9.30

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I cut off Aaron to bring Spencer off

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I thought that we were going to be up here

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Talking about our relationship forever

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Aaron, let's do a new segment called

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Aaron has more to say about our

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Relationship

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Yeah

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yeah

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yeah

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Tenderness is a hot thing

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Reach it out

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Singaling, you got to take your hand

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
In mine, it's a team effort

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It's going to be fine together

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Somebody just walked into the hotel

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Because we were doing this in a tavern

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
In a hotel lobby

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Somebody just came to the front door

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And passed by the doorway to where we are

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And had absolutely no idea what the fuck

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Was going on

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The look was one of consternation

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I'm here for the Bitcoin

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Cooperative

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I don't have more to say

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I just felt vulnerable and that I felt embarrassed

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The use of speaking of no one caring

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And I was like, oh no, I've done it again

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I brought down the podcast again

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I was doing a bit, I was doing a segue bit

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Speaking of no one caring, let's bring up Spencer

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I was trying to keep the show on the road

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Because I thought we were running out of time

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I didn't know we were in one of those holy shit

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
What are we going to do for two hours?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Let's do a rap about all the fun things that Dan's done in Austin

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Austin

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Rap

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Austin

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Can't hear the music

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Can't hear the beat, beyond beat

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Just grabbing and moving my feet

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Wait for the beat, okay

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Now I got the beat

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Let's do a rap

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Dan, why don't you do the rap about

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Finding out that you're going to die tomorrow

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And all the things you want to get done

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Go!

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Okay, alright, new suggestion

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Dark

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Oh shit

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Oh, yeah

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Oh shit

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Oh, oh, oh shit

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Ice tea is going to die

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Tomorrow

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
It's going to spend the next day in sorrow

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I got a bucket list

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Of things to do

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
My name is Ice Tea, motherfucker

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
How do you do? I'm from the streets

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I'm from the gangster life

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Like a knife, that's gross

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm sorry

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I'm a jury, evocative of violence

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I don't do that

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
See?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Easy words to rhyme

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
End with A-O-I-E

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
That's fine

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
For instance, if you can end a line with

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Day, then you can say that

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
You're way or you're gay

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
If you end a line with the word

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Me, then you could say

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That you bent at the knee

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
If you were to say you had a cup

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Of tea, then you could say

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And then you see

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The key is you want to have vowels

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
So you can move the wrap

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Out of your bowels

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Like taking a shit, you want it to slide out

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I fucked your mama so hard

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I got the gout

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Rich food is Austin style

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I fucked your mama on the

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Egyptian Nile

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I fucked your mama in a river

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I fucked your mama on a lake

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I fucked your mama for the march of dimes

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
For children's sake

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I already fucking your mom

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I fucked your mama with my friends

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Harry and Tom

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Tim, go rap outside

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Go rap outside on the street

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Okay, I'm gonna try to keep the beat

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I'm gonna try to do it

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Somebody video this

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Keep your phones out and video this right now

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I'm gonna see if the mic still works

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Trying to keep the beat

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Even though I'm with some jerks

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Gotta keep the wrap going on the beat

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
To rap on the rainy street

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Kinda went out here

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And I can't hear you

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
But here's what I'm saying

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And here's what I'll do

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I'm gonna rap on the street

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I've always been from

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So now I got the beat

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
All you motherfuckers through this glass

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Can hear me rapping in Austin

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Look at my ass

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Visible when I pull down my pants

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I'm gonna do a rainy street

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Austin Texas dance

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Fuck it up

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
In the street with style

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I fucked your mama

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
All the goddamn why

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I gotta come back in

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Cause I'm going to get arrested

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Yo, I'm gonna get arrested

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Some people that are looking at me

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And they're pretty happy

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That they don't know me

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Oh shit, I'm really in trouble

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Back inside

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Yo, yeah, bubble

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah, did I stay on the beat?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Yeah

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Fuck, yeah

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Now I got it

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Yeah

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
It's a lot to process

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Kinda wish I was in the audience instead of

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
In the show

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
So I could just sit back and figure out

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
What just happened

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
What's your name?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Holly

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I saw your mama at Holly's house

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Doesn't matter what her name is

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
That rhymes with mouse

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
That's the only word that you're gonna rhyme with

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
What's your name?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Wendy

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Yeah

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It's a rapping game

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Someone

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
That's your name

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
See, it doesn't really matter

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yo, Pete

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Yo, Scatter

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It's called Working the Crowd

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'm gonna say your name

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
She said it out loud

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
It's like it's improvised

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
But you're really just rapping

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It just actually sucks

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Jesus

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Can't get it

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Alright

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Did I really stay on the beat?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I turned it off

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So we could hear you better

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You were right on it, I put it back on

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
No idea how embarrassing it was out there

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
For real, it's just quiet

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Quiet and rainy

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
There's just people talking to their agent

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
On the phone

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And I was just like, I'm fat and stupid

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And they were like, you're homeless

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And you're in jail, you're gonna go to jail

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Because out there, you can't hear a single thing in here

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
No, and you don't care

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
About anything in here

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Out there

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That's the world, it's out there

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
There's police out there

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
There's a guy behind you in a hoodie trying to look to the glass and trying to figure out what you were going to

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
He looked bummed out

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Are you Ashton Kutcher?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Why are you allowed to do this?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
You're going to jail

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You were a microphone away from crazy

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Thank god I had this

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I kept pointing at it

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I'm not hearing things

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I'm not insane, I have a microphone

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Also, most of those windows

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Have posters on them that we can see out

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
But you really can't see

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
There's only one window you can kind of see

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
There's a lot of people out there doing what I was doing

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And they're all criminals

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
They're all in trouble

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
We should give all the homeless people microphones

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Or cooperative Bitcoin

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Give them a chance

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Give them a chance

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I almost wonder

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Nah, he smells so good

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And he was so charismatic

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
You kind of wanted Lamar

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
You kind of wanted Lamar to really have his pulpit

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
But it doesn't matter

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
He's probably gone

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
We don't want to keep surfing that wave

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Did Lamar leave?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
He's gone

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Now you guys feel like you should have left

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Alright, what's the next chapter?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Let's play some D&D

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I think Spencer's probably ready for that

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I guess

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'm ready

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I'm ready for anything

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I don't know

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Spencer, I told him

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Maybe we'll play D&D, maybe we won

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It's up to him

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Spencer, you were away for a couple weeks

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You didn't play D&D

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I should correct you

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
We didn't play it with you

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Oh, I know

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Also, to be quite honest

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
There's been about 17 other shows where we didn't really play D&D

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And you were there

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
It was still the time

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
While Spencer gets ready

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Let's do our pain segment

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Our human pain segment

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Who's the most in pain?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
This hand is just like

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Immediately

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Are you willing to come up and talk about your pain?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Come on up

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Katie

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Katie, welcome Katie to the stage

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Would you?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Katie, there you go

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I'm so happy to be here

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Good to meet you

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You seem pretty happy for somebody

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
That's in a lot of pain

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I'm really happy

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I don't have a ticket

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I don't have a ticket

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
What's going on in your life that brings you so much heartache?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Okay

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Hello everyone

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
It's like being in an airport

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
But they're listening

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
There's a sort of chuffa

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Basically, I'm going to try to make it short

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Just because I don't want to drag out the story

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But I just remember you guys talking

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
On the podcast about how

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
You can get very

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Overwhelmed with emotion a lot in your life

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And I just remember you mentioning

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You wearing a suit that's kind of like

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Your defense

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And that was something I really related to

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
A few years ago

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
When I had this really big up and down thing

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
With this one guy

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And it finally ended

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I came to realize that

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
My emotions overwhelm me

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So much

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I don't know how to deal with it

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And I feel like you guys might be able to relate to that

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So I just wanted to know

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
How you

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Lived with that through your life

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Because I'm really lost

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Is this a breakup that you're still going through?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
It ended when I was

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
17 or 18

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But you keep thinking about it

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
People would always say you're too young

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
To be in love, you don't know

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
What you're thinking, you're just a teenager

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I always told them you can say that

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
How long has it been?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Since we broke up

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Probably like 5 years

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And I don't talk to him anymore

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
We didn't end on horrible terms

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
But I'm pretty sure he doesn't want anything

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
To do with me

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
You've got one relationship

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
You don't have contact with him

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
You don't have mutual friends

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
We do, but we don't see each other

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I know he doesn't want to be around me

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Have you dated anyone since then?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I did recently

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
For a few weeks

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
They were really good immediately

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
We'd been dating for like a year

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And then he said he realized

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
That it wasn't a good time

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
In his life for a relationship

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
But I hadn't done anything wrong

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
That's who he's lying

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
I was comforting, but it was still

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Kind of a big shock

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I feel everything

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Very, very strongly

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I cripple under my emotions

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
What's the

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Is there a main emotion that you feel like

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Is it regret or loss or separation

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I think just

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Separation from people who I feel like

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I just enjoy being around them a lot

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So you lost a group of friends as well

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
When that went away?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Just one person

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I cling very strongly to people

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
That I feel like I can connect with

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And then when I lose that, it's just

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Have you been able to have a relationship since then

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
In the last five years?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I just had this one recently, but it was only

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Three weeks, and that ended

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
A couple of weeks ago

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Is it because everyone casts a shadow

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Over everything else? No, it was other reasons

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
To me

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I don't know the details of it

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And also, I've never

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Gone through anything like this

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I wouldn't be able to really commiserate with you

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
But I think the ability to

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Feel strongly emotionally about something

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Is the most important thing in the world

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And I think that as I've grown up a little bit

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I've learned to

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
When you talk about wearing a suit

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
A suit of armor, whatever our things are

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
That we use to keep

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
The world away

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
You've learned as

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
As you grow up that letting people in

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Is really dangerous emotionally

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And you pay a price for getting older

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
We've all paid

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Prices, no matter how old you are

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
If you're in this room

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I think I've gotten a little less emotional

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And much better at finding

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Clever ways of keeping people at arms length

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And that does not make

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Your life better at all

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I don't want to keep people at arms length

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
And after that big breakup happened

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
When I was younger, I felt like

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
That Simon and Garfunkel song, I'm a rock

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I wanted to be that because

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
If I open up the floodgates

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
To my feelings, I would never be able to control it

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It's just too much, so you cut it all off

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Connecting with other human beings

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Is the most wonderful thing in the world

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But people have accused me of being really aloof

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And I can be and I am

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Because if I let everybody in

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I'm so emotionally

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
A big radar antenna

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
For whatever's wrong in the room

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
And if I open up that floodgate

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I will fall on the ground

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
To start crying

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I'm exactly like that

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I'm trying to hold it together right now

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Do you have the triggers you go back to

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Do you have songs you listen to

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I was just kidding about him

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Lying

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
But I mean

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
The great news is

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
That you're in this really exciting time in your life

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Where you feel

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Like you said, you're starting to

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
You're starting to cry

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And that feels like a negative emotion

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And I guess definitively it is

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So great, because this is the time

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
When you get to discover new things

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And you should, you're going to be

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
With other people

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Like Claire Danes says

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
In my so called life

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
God bless her

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It hurts until it doesn't

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
If you're feeling bad right now

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Like you're

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Going to meet other people

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And this first experience

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Like the pain of that, if you're feeling bad

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You look like a creative person

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Use that energy to do as many

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Crazy weird things as possible

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
She's been hurting for five years

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Which at first glance is like

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
That's on the fringe of the bell curve

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I think you said

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
That you've been hurting consistently for five years

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Well, I mean things were very up and down

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
He's a really vague person

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
So I would always pour my heart out to him

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And then he'd be like, yeah

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I think he's become a legend in your mind

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
That's not really a real person anymore

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I know I had that person

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It's just really romantic

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Very romantic

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
You at this point have imagined him to be something

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
For longer than you knew him

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Which is fine and doesn't make it

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Any less real

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
But it means that

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
You get to free yourself

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
From that

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I say how often are you checking in

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
With them?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
How often are you checking in with the songs

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And the pictures and Facebook

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It's not about this guy

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It's just about me realizing that I have this

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Massive

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Storehouse of emotions

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
To deal with in my life

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I say be that person

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
The price that we pay

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
For all the shit that we've gone through

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The painful stuff, the hurtful stuff

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
The stuff that will never go away

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
It shouldn't ever go away

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But that's the stuff that makes you creative

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
That's the stuff that's

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Human beings as far as we know

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That turns pain into artwork

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Yes

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
We tell stories, we sing songs

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
We arrange flowers

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
We do shit

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That's how we expiate our pain

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that creates

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Relief for other people

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
We turn our pain

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Dan's a painful person

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Aaron is Spencer as I am

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And Neil as we all are

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Artwork is

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Letting other people experience your pain

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
For them

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And that's catharsis

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I kind of want to do everything

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I don't really know where to start

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
If that makes any sense

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Like I want to paint, I want to do movies

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I want to do everything

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I want to try, yeah

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Your job is to figure out

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
How you would explain to a stranger

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Whether through visuals

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Or audio

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Or feeling or whatever

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
How do you transmit that pain to them

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Because it can't hurt them at all

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
All it can do is make them go

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Holy shit, I felt that way once

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And if you felt that way for five years

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
That speaks well to your potential

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
To transmit to other people

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And it's all about you, it's definitely not about this guy

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I think most importantly

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Focus on

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
What makes you so

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Cool

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Obviously like the entrance that you're going in

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Before into the castle that is

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Love and like a relationship

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
That's like stabilized or whatever

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I know I didn't get into that

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Quote-unquote castle

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Until

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Until later

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And was in a lot of relationships

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
But the like

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
You get to

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Really figure out why you're cool

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Don't fall into the trap of focusing on the other person

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Because that's easy, that's easy to focus on

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Other people and whatever else

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Right, I think the two biggest things

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I want to know is like

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
The only person who feels completely

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Just like kicked into the ground

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
By how strongly I feel

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Stuff, I feel like

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I wonder if there's anybody out there that's ever felt

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Actually absolutely emotionally devastated

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm four years past a girlfriend

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And I'm still constantly thinking about her

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I know exactly what you're talking about

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Yeah, I just want to be able to

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Feel like everybody just

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Always has all their shit together

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
And I'm the only one

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I mean I know that's irrational

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Professor, do you have street

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Well yeah, I mean everyone fakes it like that

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
You just got to get good at faking it

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I mean I think that's what I do

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Do you bring it back up, do you have songs

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Do you have pictures you look at, do you

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
No, it was all on my old phone

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And I have a new phone now but

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I always

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
That's a good idea

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
That's hilarious, having a new phone

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Nothing's funnier than the iPhone 5S

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Gold

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Well

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
That's what you're talking about

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
There's nothing you could do about it

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Feelings are like seasons, they just fucking happen

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
And you either get in a house or you get wet

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Yeah, I mean I've accepted that they're there

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I just want to be able to like

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Survive and turn it into something

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Good and not just me like crying

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Like I want to make it something positive

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Here's the thing

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Everyone in this room I think

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Shares that with you

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I think that's part of being a human being

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
But

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
That's my own thing which makes us

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
As human beings the greatest thing in the world

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Because we all share sorrow

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
But we all have individual sorrow

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
And that's the flag that you get to wave

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
That makes us

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
That's all I got going for me right now

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
The danger is that you let

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Your emotionalness, your sensitivity

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Don't let that harden you

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Don't put a shell up

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Because that'll turn you, that'll age you

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
That'll make you bitter

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
That'll make you unhappy

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
We're going to stop getting

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
The full version of Katie

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Be emotional

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Be a wreck, be a weirdo

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And don't ever apologize for it

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Because I'm going to start crying right now

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Because this is the greatest thing in the world

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And be proud that you came here and told 200 people

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
About your feelings and what hurts you

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And they aren't hating you for it

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
They're digging it

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Go out in the crowd right now

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And see how many people will shake your hand

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Right now

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Yeah, take Katie, show Katie

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
What it's like to be a fucking hitman

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Yeah

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
And then go get a free pass with Bethany

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Because she's giving it away

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I think about the things she's describing

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I think about the movie, Say Anything

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
With Jack Puzak

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Like, what's it, Lily Taylor

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Is that the, I'm going to say the play

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Is the character who's constantly obsessed

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
With her ex-boyfriend

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
With her songs about him

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Like, she's characterized

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That archetype is like

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Oh, she should get over him

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
But really what she should do is keep playing guitar

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And like really figuring out

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
How to get that shit out

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Because one of those songs will hit

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Like, I think it is her responsibility

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
To wipe her ass with the world

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
That's what an artist should do

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
The most empowering feeling is

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Realizing like

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Two years after the fact someone's broken up with you

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
And you've written all these songs

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And you're angry and being like

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Holy shit, this person that I've been getting over

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Is a projection that I created

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So now I double-a-own this person

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And I made $8 off of him

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
But how do you feel about the idea

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
That love is the same chemical

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Like, if we don't trigger it

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It dissipates

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
It's a very analog thing

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Yeah, it's true, but how do you

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Trigger it?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
She's not hanging out

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Yeah, I mean

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I feel like no matter what, this is certainly the best

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
D&D we've ever done

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Do you think you're prepared

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
To do a little ad hoc D&D

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
A noisy hotel lobby?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You guys are good

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It's really loud over there

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You guys are still good, you can hear us and everything

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Also, Katie, thank you

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
That was one of my favorite Harmontown moments of all time

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Katie, do you have tickets to the show?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
To the documentary?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I'm just going to give away these tickets

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Really fast

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
There are a couple of people

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I know you don't have tickets

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
It's exciting this is for the live crowd

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I don't know

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Katie, do you have tickets?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Okay, cool

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Those are tickets

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Someone just came up and handed me tickets

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
I feel like this is

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Even though it's not like optimum sound

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
This is not like the normal comfort

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Of a small theater

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I really like what's going on

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I'm in a very good

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Harmontown mood

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
It's a lovely town

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
You guys are

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Some of the best versions of what

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
It's nice to look out and see

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
It makes us feel very safe

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I'm getting all sappy now, thanks Katie

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Spencer

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Two or more weeks off

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Is there something special about this D&D session?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Because we haven't played D&D in Los Angeles

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
For weeks

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It's special in that

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
I prepared it in this very room

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Twenty minutes ago

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Is it sort of separate? Is it non-canonical?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
What's happening? I'm scared

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
What's happening? It's non-canonical

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
No, it's canonical

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Should it be non-canonical?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Do you want me to hand out the sheets?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I want everyone to do everything

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Anyway

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I mean

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
What's happening? I'm sorry

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I'm just so wasted

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Did you find weed since we last talked about that?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Yeah, no, this guy

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
For real? Yeah, no

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Found it within himself

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
This is exciting

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
So, what's up you guys?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Neil Berkley is going to play Chris de Burghh

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Because Kumail is in Austin

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
But he's doing a panel right now

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I know

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Are you really fine?

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
No

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Are you booing me?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
They're booing Kumail for being a bad friend

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
That motherfucker is on every bus in town

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
That's so cool

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
You can see Kumail's little face everywhere

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I love that

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
It's amazing

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Is that yours?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Oh, you drive a pedicab? And you've got Kumail's picture on it?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That's awesome

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
That's Austin

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
What's up?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Spencer, are you good to go?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Bar shut the fuck up

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Thank you

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But look

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
But also have a good time

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
But shut the fuck up

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Okay

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
When we last met

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Our heroes had just been released

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
By the Bone Sages

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
By the Bone Sages of Tormod

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Torn

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
After agreeing to slay the Marsh Minotaur

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
The party headed towards

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
The Farmers Market to look for clues

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Jesus Christ, is that me?

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
After a brief chat with

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Joe to be cheesy

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
The gang went over a hill and discovered a cave

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Covered in bones

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Our heroes entered the cave despite

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Monstrous whales coming with deep

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Within the cavern

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Within, keep saying within, the dark

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Dagnus

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Our heroes encountered the Marsh Minotaur

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Who was actually a pretty cool guy

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And actually not a guy at all

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
But a girl

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
After deeming the Minotaur to be too honorable

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
To be killed in cold blood

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
The gang banded together with it

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But what would they do?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
How would they escape?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And what of their skull curse?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
And what about the Tarragon of Virtue?

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Is that still something that people

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Are paying attention to?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
We'll find out this time

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
No, we won't, we'll find out sometime

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So you guys might not know what's going on

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
But this time it's justified

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Okay, so I

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Describe the surrounding exactly

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
What we're looking at right now

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Okay, so you're in this

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Dank dark cave

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
It's covered in bones and feces

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
There's the Marsh Minotaur

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Towering above you

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Her udders in full display

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
She's in the cave

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
She's in the cave

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
She's in the cave

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
She's like

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Hey Marsh

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Hey guys

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Do you have a name?

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I think I said I had a name

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
What do you want to call me?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Meredith

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Meredith

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
That was my name, yeah

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Do you know anything about the Tarragon of Virtue?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I mean

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I've heard it's in paradise

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I don't really know much about that

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I'm just in a cave

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You're in a cave

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Alright, well I'm sober as a judge

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And I'm not angry

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
You're sober?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Well, maybe not as a judge

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I'm sober as a relaxed judge

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And I

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Ironically I can't hear anything

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
But I think that we should

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
We should

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Head out of wherever we are

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Are there any exits or

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Egrests in this cave?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
These are pretty straightforward

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
They got like one exit

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Isn't it notable that Meredith

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Isn't the

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Minotaur that we were seeking after?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Say again?

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Is that a thing?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
We agreed to go kill the Marsh Minotaur

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
When we got out of the

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Bone Sages Tribunal

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Yeah, it was part of the terms of your release

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Yeah, Meredith isn't it

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
I walk towards the entrance to the cave

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And say let's get the hell out of here

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Get out of the cave and into the

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Dusty gray darkness of the Underworld

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
It's all

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Dusty and gray

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Over the hill you know that

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
The city of Tormatorre

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Is just right over there, but I mean

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Do you want to go back there? I don't know

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You gotta get out of here, right?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
We gotta find the tarragon of virtue

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
How do you get to Paradise?

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Paradise is above ground says Meredith

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
It's above ground and we are underground

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Don't we have a thing that can make a staircase

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Yeah, you had to rape a cyber skeleton

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And it got destroyed in that

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
So no, you don't

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
You raped a skeleton?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
It was a cyber spider

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Did I say skeleton, cyber spider?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
A lot of mistakes from me

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
You're telling me

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
But you walk out of the cave

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I already said that, you're in the dusty

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Gray dustness of the Underworld

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
The Minotaur goes

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
You guys want to get out of here?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Yeah

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Yeah, me too

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I've been down here for too long

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I've never even seen this marsh

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I mean, I have

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
That's where I'm from

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Meredith, may I ride you?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
No, I'm a bipedal creature

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I don't get written

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Can I ride you?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
You don't do like piggybacks or anything like that?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I mean, I'm sure it's possible

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I'm not down with that

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
She says, well, climbing upon Mulraine, Sedona

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It's very heavy

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
He climbs upon Mulraine, Sedona?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
She does

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
To the... there

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
So Meredith is riding you right now?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Yeah, I feel her udders against my back

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Oh, yeah

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Let's go into the marsh

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
There's no marsh down here, that's above ground

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Is it above ground marsh?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Yeah, that's where I'm from, I just got sucked down here

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Have we left the cave yet?

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Yeah, we're in the Underworld proper

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
We're in the Dusty Dark Grayness

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I don't know this

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I'm assuming you guys must have fell down here

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
along with a castle

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
We killed Admiral Darkstar and the castle

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
all collapsed and we killed a bunch of people

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
and we got in a lot of trouble for it

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
So there's a hole in the ceiling, right?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Maybe we can get out of that hole

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
A hole

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
to climb up out of

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I climb up the hole

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
You're not by the hole because you've trekked

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
quite a long way

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Right, we went to Skeleton Town and got accused

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
of all kinds of things

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Okay, let's walk back towards the hole

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
entry

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Sure, yeah, that's happening

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
As you tread through the Dusty Darkness

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
you see your footprints that lead to the city

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
those were the footprints you did

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
you made when you were walking towards the city

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
that one time

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
You also note a pair of wolf-like footprints

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
like that of a wolf

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
like that of two wolves

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
maybe more than two wolves

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
much newer than your own

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and then you reach the Crumbling

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Ruin Castle

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
but all is not right

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
You see, the dark stone blocks of Dark Stars

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Forest are faded with age

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
and look to be crumbling to dust

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
as if they've endured millennia of history

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
the dark stone blocks

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
they're just crumbling all over the place

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
brilliant sunlight

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
streams down from the hole in the ceiling

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
hundreds of yards above your heads

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Is it climbable, the surface of the hole?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Bar

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Bar, quiet

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
We're doing important work over here

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I don't know if anyone else is having the same feeling

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
but I know when I was in high school

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and used to play games like this in a cafeteria

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
it was identical to this

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I mean, let's be loud but not so loud

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
that they come over and yell at us

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
with a bar

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I don't think anyone's going to yell at us

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Everyone at the bar, help us out please

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I really don't think that's going to work

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Use a rap song

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
There's other shitty bars to go to

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Go to those

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
ugly bars in Austin

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
What's happening?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
We head towards a goddamn hole in the ceiling

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I'm going to go sit at the bar and do this

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
You head up

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I'm going to play at the bar

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
I'm going to confront these assholes

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I'll do it

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
All they've learned is that when that happens

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
they get to sell their products

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
That's the only precedent we've seen

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Let's sit right here

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Please, loud motherfuckers

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I'm going to stand next to this Newsy

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I go to the...

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I start climbing the side of the hole

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
There's no side of the hole

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Imagine if there was a hole in the ceiling

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
of this very building

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
You couldn't just climb up into thin air

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I know I've asked you this a thousand times

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
but it's my sun rod

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
That's that stick with the button

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
That's like a flashlight

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
The thing that got destroyed

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
The Meredith

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
She speaks up

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
That's a big hole

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
You need some sort of crazy, ridiculous ladder

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
to get up there

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Or a teleport cape

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Which I have

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
That's cool

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Teleport cape

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
You teleport to the surface

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Sharpies is above

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
on the surface world

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
at the rim of this hole

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
alone

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I use my springy shoes

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
You're what now?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
I have shoes of springy

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You jump 20 feet straight into the air

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
I try to reach down

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
The hole is 700 yards deep

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I have a scape artist

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Where I am to the top of the hole

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Not without a solid plan

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
or some way to ascend 700 yards

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
By escaping as an artist

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You draw a depiction of your brilliant escape

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I do

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It doesn't happen though

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
It's not that loud over there

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
It just sounds loud

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
It's the high ceilings I think

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I'm looking around

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
for materials on the surface world

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
to see if there's a way that I could

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
make a 700 meter ladder

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
It's frozen tundra

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
There's no vegetation

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
or anything as far as I can see

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
In fact, there's not really anything

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Can I climb out?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Your climate kit does include rope

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
but it's only 150 feet of rope

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
It's not quite enough

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
If you call it down to me, I think I can make a ladder

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
I have rope and supplies

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Hey, make a ladder

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
It's less than 700 yards

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
of ladder

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Meredith again speaks up

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I actually

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
have a ladder

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yeah, yeah, I have it

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
If I take this acid

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Can I have a visual

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
that I'm out of the cave?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
No, it's like burning, killing you

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Can I use the lyre of building to get us out of here?

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
You could, but it takes some time

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Meredith just said she has a ladder

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I do

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
A several hundred foot ladder?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Oh, yeah, this is like a ridiculous ladder

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Oh, let's use the ladder

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Can we use your ladder?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I mean, I don't have it with me, but trust me

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
It's like crazy, we're talking

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It was forged in the pits of Skaldor

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
by double giants

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
She says she has a ladder, but it's not with her

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
It's forged in the pits of Skaldor

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I might have jumped the gun on this teleportation

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Is there a coffee place up there?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Nope, just a bunch of snow

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Meredith, where's the ladder?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I'll go get it, it's back in the cave

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Time passes

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
While time passes, you guys

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
should talk about your greatest fears

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
She runs into the darkness

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Commitment

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I imagine that I am at

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
an afternoon party

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
and someone says

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
let's create something really cool

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
and I reach in my pockets

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
and I look at my hands

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
and they're pool cubes

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
It's my greatest fear

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I like that

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I'm going first

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
My greatest fear is her telling that story again

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Kidding

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Hypothermia

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
A serious relationship

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
My greatest fear

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Pumas

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Sure

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Meredith comes back

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
She's carrying a crazy ladder

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
It's like crazy

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I helped Meredith put the ladder

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
up right so we can get up there

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It's very difficult to do that because this ladder

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
is 700 yards long

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I use my barbarian strength

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
to help the ladder get up

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
As hard as it is, it is in fact possible

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
and you accomplish this task

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
The ladder, it sets up

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
She's like, we best climb this

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
But don't worry, I mean yes, worry

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Please be worried

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
It's a crazy ladder

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
What sort of craziness might happen?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
You might go crazy

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I don't give a shit

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
I'm a barbarian, I start climbing the ladder

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I'll hold the top

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
You start climbing the ladder

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
and as you ascend, you see

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Pumas

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
On the ladder

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Pumas

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
You're terrified

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
You can't move

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I'm stuck on the ladder

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
You see your friend Quark

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
climb 10 feet up the ladder

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I'm plus 10 against Pumas

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Wait, what?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
No, I'm kidding. I was paying attention to the

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
side conversation going on

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I failed my will save on that one

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
You sure did, Quark

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You sure did, and you're seeing Pumas

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Guys, get off this ladder, there's Pumas everywhere

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
We're all gonna die

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
We don't see any Pumas

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
This ladder is fucking lousy with Pumas

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I stab Quark

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
in the thigh with a dagger

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
You can't reach that high

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
He's 10 feet up

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
So I do it, and then I pretend it was a joke

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
and I put it in my pocket

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You do that

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
It does come off like a joke

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Everything's fine, you guys

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
What does someone else want to do?

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Can I use a spell on him

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
that's like

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
from this high up

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
If I have, for instance

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Oh, I don't know

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
For instance

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
a little thing called

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Cause Fear

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
No, that won't work

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Pumas!

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I have a poison dagger, can I take care of them with that?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
If I were to use Charm Person

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Could I just make him happy

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
enough to climb a ladder

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
and stop caring about Pumas?

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
No, he'd just be a good friend of yours

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
that was also terrified

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
But he wouldn't overcome his fear

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
No, it would be like

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
he's feeling both of those things

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
He'd get real confused and horny probably

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Meredith, what's the deal with her?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Say again?

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
So what?

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
They're not real Pumas

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
They're imaginary Pumas

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Meredith, what's the deal

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
with these hallucinations?

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
How do we get past that?

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Meredith, why would you offer as a crazy ladder?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I'm sorry, do you have any 700-yard-long ladders?

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I'm sorry, why are you going along

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
with us on this journey

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
if you don't want to help us?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Because I want to go back to the marsh

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
I start kissing Meredith's neck

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
She's not comfortable with it, but she allows it

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Guys, I'm getting killed by Pumas up here

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Yeah, you feel Puma claws

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
smashing into your flesh

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Can I use my fast stealth to climb the ladder?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Yes, stealthily

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I do that

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
You climb up, you seem like

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
someone can see you

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
You get to quark

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
and you can even climb over him without him noticing you

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
There's Pumas everywhere

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
You get 30 feet above him

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
and then you see

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
a very aggressive looking woman on the ladder

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
climbing down

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
It's your mother

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
We gotta go to dinner, we are late

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
What are you wearing? Are you kidding me?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
This is the big day

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Fine

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It's terrifying

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
If you're not getting that from my reading

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Do I have to get past her?

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I mean, you have to deal with it

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Do I have to overcome this emotionally?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I don't know, man

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Probably

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I start climbing up the ladder

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
You climb up the ladder

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
and you climb and you climb

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
You get right up to where quark is

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
and it seems like the ladder is on

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
It's just broken

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
It's a bit cracked and messed up

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
with your craft skills

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I've got to reach into my pockets

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Then there's nothing in your pockets

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
We can see her!

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Pumas!

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I leap off the ladder

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
head first into the cave

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
That happens

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
The fuck is going on down there?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Just climb up the ladder

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
This is a crazy ladder, Sharpie

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
You land head first

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Taking

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
19 damage

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Jesus Christ

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
What's your HP up?

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Can I throw my climb?

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Am I on top of the hole?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Hold on, I've got to see this

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
This is how you die

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
19 plus 23

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
What's 19 plus 23?

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
You're not...

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I'm sorry, you're not dead

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
You're just very injured

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
and you think you slipped a disc

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Spencer, am I on top of the hole?

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
No, you're about 10 feet

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
No, 20 feet above him

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
but it's still several hundred feet

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
We've got a long way to go

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And there's fucking pumas

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
It's all over the place

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So I keep climbing the ladder

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Yeah, with your significant other

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
who keeps haranguing you

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Incessantly

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Wow, Spencer, you're really hitting home here

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I know, it's terrifying, isn't it?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
She's just going on, now she's being passive aggressive

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Why am I with someone?

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
You're doing a really great job

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
climbing up the ladder

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Great, you're so strong

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
You're everything

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
like my guy friend

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
I build a fire

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
up here, a campfire

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Okay, that happens

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
It's very soothing

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
and starts to warm your cold bones

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I keep trying to press on

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
because I'm so scared of the pumas

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
You use that fear attack to climb away

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Running away from the pumas

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
They slash at your belly and back

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
You take some damage of some sort

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Seven damage

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Is your fake pumas?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I mean, are they? No, alright

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
I keep climbing, I'm tough

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
You get 80 feet up, you're pretty far up

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Alright

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
There's a puma on your back

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
You got no idea, Spencer

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Oh cool, Neil, is that a stain on your shirt?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Neat, you're like Jackson Pollock

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You're going to be the coolest guy in this party

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Great, don't change

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I tell her I'll be in the car

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
when she's ready

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Yeah, she's like

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
you always say that

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
But then she doesn't speak anymore

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Yay, that's all it takes

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Sometimes

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Mulrainee is writhing on the floor, right?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Yeah, yeah, in pain

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I take out my

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
a dagger

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
and I

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
put it on the ground

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
That's my move

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
You place the dagger

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
gently on the ground

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
or not gently, whatever you want

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
What does other people do?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I keep climbing

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Puma damage

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Puma's been on my back so long

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
now I should become like a scarf

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I'm getting used to this Puma

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
It is kind of warm

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
You get 100 feet up

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
as Christopher also keeps climbing

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
You guys are maybe halfway up the ladder

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
I climb too

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Alright, but as you climb up

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
It's fine, you don't seem anything anymore

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
It's almost as if the slip disc

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
might have deactivated

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
some part of the delirium factor

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
That's how

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
vertebrae works

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
That's what chiropractors would tell you

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Well, that's true

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
We all keep climbing up

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
You keep climbing up and you keep taking Puma damage

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Puma damage?

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
It's not fun

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Imaginary Puma damage

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
That's my current pitch for the name of the episode

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
You get more than halfway up

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
You guys are all the way almost up

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Mulraine's trailing behind

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
She's a bit slow because she has a slip disc

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
That's very painful

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
If anyone's ever experienced that, it hurts a lot

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
You keep climbing

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And you keep climbing

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And Mulraine, you see

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Quark

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
He's covered in gash marks

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
He's bleeding heavily

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
It's making the ladder slippery

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
It's hard to deal with

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Girl, you're bleeding

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I know this is Puma's

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Puma damage

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
I miss that girl

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
and I play everything I do by Pitera

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
You feel

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
contemplative

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
or something

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
I honestly didn't hear what you just said

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
I keep climbing

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Yeah, you keep climbing and bleeding

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Bleeding all over the ladder

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
But you get

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
to where Neil is

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I mean, Christopher

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
How close are we at the top?

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
You're very close

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
You're pretty close

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
You're not quite close

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
But you're almost getting to pretty close

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Can I use my climbing kit now?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Am I 150 feet away?

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I use my climbing kit

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
It makes it so much easier

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
You have no risk of falling off the ladder

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
With your newfound confidence

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
You just soar to the top

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
and see Sharpie

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
He's made a fire

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I've made a fire

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
That happens

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I go into a barbarian rage

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
to shrug off these

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
perceived Pumas

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
and I use all my barbarian powers

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
to climb up to the final wave

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Raging like a barbarian

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
You attempt to climb the ladder

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
like a raging person

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
with anger problems might climb a ladder

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Uh, yeah, yeah, you climb it

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
You're bleeding

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
You're bleeding and climbing

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
You get to the top and you see

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
you see a fire

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
and Sharpie and Christopher

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Hello

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Are we all up here? Is Mulraine still down?

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Mulraine's still coming up

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Mulraine, get up here

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Can I throw her down to the climbing tool?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Yeah, yeah, you can lower her

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I do that

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I try to catch it with my mouth

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Yeah, you catch it right in your mouth

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Did you roll a 20?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I rolled a 15

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
It was dropping straight down

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Right in the teeth

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Alright, I get the climbing kit

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and I swallow it

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It's very large to swallow

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
You can't even fit it in your mouth

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
I gag on it, I take it out

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I put it in my back pocket

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
and I start climbing up the ladder again

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
You keep climbing up this slick

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
bloody ladder

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Mulraine lost her mind a few rounds ago, guys

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I'm committed to this

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
The ladder is bloody

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
and it's slippery

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Okay, so the ladder is bloody

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I decide I want to become a shadow

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
so I cover myself

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
with all the blood that I can find

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
so I'm as dark as possible

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
and it happens

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And like Carrie, I rise

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
on the rope ladder

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I mean, what?

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I never saw Carrie

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
She's covered in blood, Spencer

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
You've seen pictures of Carrie

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
You've seen GIFs

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
GIFs?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
But you understand the concept of Carrie

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Oh, yeah, she's like a girl

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
and she doesn't have friends

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
and then she kills herself

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
She gets teased

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
and covered in blood

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
and then she kills everyone

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Well, that's a triumphant story, right?

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
I think so

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I saw Carrie and I was like

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
I was Carrie

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Most of my friends were Carrie

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
So I cover myself on blood like Carrie

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
It makes it really even more slippery

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
So that happens?

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Yeah, definitely

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Mulraine, are you coming up or what?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I'm kind of confused

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I'm covered in blood, I continue to climb up the ladder

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
You continue to climb up the ladder?

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I use the climbing kit

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Using the climbing kit to secure your ascent

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You get to the top of the ladder

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
and you see all of your good friends

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
surrounding a fire

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
We made it to the top of the ladder

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
That was harder than it looked

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Next week we're going to pay our gas bill

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Meredith also climbs the ladder

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and she crests the top

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
and gets up there with you guys

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Thanks for all that help

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Great ladder

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yeah man, it's crazy, let me tell you

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I guess it's true what they say about

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Minotaur ladders

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
What do they say about Minotaur ladders?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
They're shitty

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
They're terrible counterproductive ladders

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
They're like the Uber of ladders

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I didn't make this ladder

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
It was forged in the pits of Skaldor

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
by double giants

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
They don't work

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I sing our

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
of course our song about

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
how we're going to go into battle

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
or get back to a marsh

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You sing that, how does it go?

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
How does it go?

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Through dungeons dark

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
and campfires hot

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Through the sauce

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
in cooking pots

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
We are dwarves

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
and people too

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
When you make three movies

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
out of one book

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
There's stuff that

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
you have to fill

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
With

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
extra time

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
So much to kill

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Golden dragon

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
bass

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
in all kinds of forges

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
All of the characters

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
will live to the end

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
We already know that

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
We read the book

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
When we were nine

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
And so we know

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
All 20 of these people

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
will be fine

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
But you made

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
70 movies

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
about it

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
So now we have to watch

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Orlando Bloom CG

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
jump across barrels

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Let's have a tan everybody

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Thank you for coming!

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Erin McGathy

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Spencer Crittenden

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
I want to thank

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
all of our guests

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
There's too many a name

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
but you guys are all wonderful

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Thank you for dealing with

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Sorry to borrow people that I was an asshole

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Austin this has been one of my favorites

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I'm Jeff Davis

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Please put it together one more time for the mayor

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
of Ironman 10

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Dan Harmon

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
The San Francisco of Texas

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
There's signed posters up here

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Who wants signed posters?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Come over and grab them

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
We'll see you at the movie, we'll see you at the after party

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
We love you

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Austin

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Greater city in the world

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Every secessionist

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Your flag's got to be

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
bigger than the country's

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Everybody's gonna have fun

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
That's a Nerman legend

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
It's not true about Texas

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Independent state

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Gonna wreck this shit

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Big state

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Pretty big for a motherfucking state

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Pretty big can't clean your plate

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I got barbecue on it

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Gonna chop slate

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
It's butt fuck

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Jeff Davis

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Music cue change

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I fucked you so hard

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
The music changed

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
That's the show everybody

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I love you Spencer

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I love everybody

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Spencer

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Go see him in the movie

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Sorry for those who couldn't get into the movie

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
We just

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
We do?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
But figure that out

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Let's all just hang out and have a drink

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
We got two hours until the film

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
We'll meet you guys around here

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
First off

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Mr. Harmon

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
I want to thank you for supporting the film last year

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Thank you so much

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
I really appreciate that

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I was making some friends of ours

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
It's a great film

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
It's a great film

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Second

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
My question is for Spencer

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Do you have a lot of offers

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
to go to different conventions

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
and DM games for them?

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
No

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
That's all

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I mean you'd think there'd be some of that

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Take that

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Thank you

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Thank you

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Sorry

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
How about a poison for work

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Yeah

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Over here please

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Yeah

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Tasty

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Do you want a wrap for us?

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Yo

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
This guy is going to ask a question

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
You're still got a hand

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Did you

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
drink?

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Ever?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
No, I was just saying

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
It scared the shit out of me

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I can't see in the bottom

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Oh shit, I see where this is going

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
This is like a

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
same type alcohol thing

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Then I realized, oh god

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
It's a kettle of wine

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
They're paying for this

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Cool, thanks

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
This guy loves alcohol

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
They certainly paid for

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
all of my

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
self abuse over the years

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Or was that guy just asking for a free drink?

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I don't know, we'll never know

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I think the audience is enthusiastic

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
He doesn't disappear

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Yeah, I've paid for it

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
That was the world's worst mic drop

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
She doesn't want to pay for that

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Once I dropped the mic

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
and then I had to pay for the mic

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
afterwards

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
We might have to pay for it

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
I'm very sorry

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Spencer

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
We love me

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Dan, thank you for everything

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
for the show

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
helping me win 65 bucks

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
All that

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Explain yourself

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
They did that pub quiz a couple weeks ago

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
and our team won

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
500 bucks at least

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
So I got 60 bucks

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
62 bucks out of that

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Thank you

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Where is it?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I've already worried about the person below

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And the rest you just wasted

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
During the filmmaking process

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Did you realize that Spencer was a hero

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
or was it after Dan's revelation

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
at what point

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Do you realize

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
that you can see me in the movie

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
at the exact point where Neil puts it

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
That's the point where I kind of realized

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
It's both tongue in cheek

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
and tongue out of cheek

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
where those expressions mean

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
There's 650 hours of footage

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Neil had to deal with the fact

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
that his documentary subject was a guy

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
who thinks he knows at any given time

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
at what point in the story they're at

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So there's a lot of stuff on the cutting-edge floor

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
of me explaining that we're pros and cons

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
when we're not at all

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
So it was up to Neil at the end

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
It was his movie

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
It was important for me to realize

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
at a certain point that

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Nothing's really happening

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
to me, transformatively

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I'm going to be an asshole when the end of this tour

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
And I didn't realize

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
at that exact point

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
in the tour where it comes in the movie

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I made that

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
V-Log entry

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I wanted to help with that

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
but it was true

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
So I think Spencer's the hero

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
who should focus on him

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But also

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Aaron told me at one point

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I remember

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
watching early cuts

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
and had a little nausea

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
about what I was thinking

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I was just, I don't know

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Neil was having trouble fighting the story

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
He didn't even need to have one

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
But if you try to tell a story about me

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
or footage about me

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
this is going to be too dark

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
and I remember Aaron telling me

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
just tell them to think about Spencer

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
but it was obviously a thing

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
and I did tell Neil about that

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
and I didn't tell Neil

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
what the idea was

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
because Neil was going

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
through the forest while shooting us

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
I don't know

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I'm so happy to see

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
that he's got a huge fan

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
for relationships

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
while he's shooting me

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
But it was her idea

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
and I think it was

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
that was the thing

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
the journey with Spencer

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
that was the big saving grace

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Neil instead of interviews

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
like the things

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
that footage of me in the bathroom

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
like drunk and babbling

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
but I think Neil on Spencer's journey

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
was the backbone

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
while I was going to be

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I'm just an asshole

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I'm an asshole at the end

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Spencer in the meantime

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I'm an asshole dude

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
for the guys

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Thank you

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
You're welcome

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I'm shaking so much

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I don't know why

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I'm just like everyone in that movie

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
First off, fantastic movie

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
The podcast

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
my life has been pretty crazy

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
the last few years

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and podcasts is one of my favorite discoveries

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
and you go to work

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
and it sits there and I listen to it

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
and what I appreciate is it's not funny

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
but there's a lot of time that talks about

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
really serious things

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
and extensively it takes all its time

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
and one time you talk about it

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
which is cults

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
I grew up in a religious cult

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
and so I was like the hit really close to home

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
and a lot of things that are being said

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
was like wow

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
it's like someone who is even there

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
kind of understands this

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
and talks about it

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
at what point did the show

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
that

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
what point did you feel like

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
comfortable to be like

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
this show has a comedy element to it

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
but we want to talk about serious topics

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
and we feel free to

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
go back and forth between comedy

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
and serious

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
whatever that really means

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
The first time I failed to go last

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
I've just been over that

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
I'm just honest enough to cope with that

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
that we're doing that

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
A comedy show implies that you have an act

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
and you have material

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
that you are prepared for

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
a paying audience and we don't have one

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
we found that

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I think pretty quickly

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Dan is in the studio show

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
at Meltdown because

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
they offered me a slot

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
to do a thing where we colonize the moon

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
ours isn't really a comedy show

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
it's funny but I think

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
that when we're being funny

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
there are moments

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
where we're connecting with strangers

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
and

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
there's always going to be comedy

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
out of that when it's sincere

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
so our best moments

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
are human moments with strangers

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
when our shows become

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
this beautiful Muppet show

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
full of weirdos

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
that could all have

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
their own show

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
laughs are really our most work thing

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
for the show

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
they are

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
most things about Dan's

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
beautiful ability to freestyle

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
rap

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I kind of want to know what you're going to do

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
you can't carry that out

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Dan, this is not intense

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
but I'm sorry

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
fuck yeah, this is about me

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
so my parents

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
my parents

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
my parents went through

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
a drug rehabilitation program

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
that became a religious cult

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
and my dad was second in command

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
and then he started drinking

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
and then he got in the accident and killed two people

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
and they went to prison and then the religious cult

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
turned on my entire family

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
can you talk to me honestly

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
after this

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
it's a great documentary

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
get some questions and make a movie

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
you can make a movie

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
yeah, I want to be a filmmaker

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
and I also want to tell the story

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
my dad just got out of prison

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
two days ago

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
and

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
he said that night

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
it's like that day, I got my dad and

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
he said it right now

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
no

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
that is

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
yeah

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
that's what I want to tell you now

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
is that Lamar?

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
his name is Lamar

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
he misses you

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I'm sorry

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
I feel like I'm on like

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
the time you get tested

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
because I went through like this seven years

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
that morning

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
I worked at the Austin Film Society

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
and I was two feet away from

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Johnny Depp at one point

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
so in the morning I get my dad out of prison

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
he's been there for six and a half years

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
that night, two feet away from Johnny Depp

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
two days later

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
right next to everyone

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
he's part of my favorite podcast

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
and it's nuts

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I don't know

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I don't know what to say

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
I'm glad you're here

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
yes, I am too

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I worked there at that building

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
and I was out of town

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
and it broke my heart

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
and I rushed all the way back to town

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
so I could see the screen

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
I wouldn't have given anything to have been there

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
but my friends had Andy over there

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
he was on the show I heard

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
so that made Morgan accept me

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Andy

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Andy, yes

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Andy, come up and have a look

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
come up and have a look

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
come up and have a look

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I just didn't know what to do

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
oh man

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
thank you so much

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
oh jeez, there's a lot of people here

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
I didn't think it would be this way

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
this is weird

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
what was your name?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
my name is Stefan

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
thank you so much

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I was trying to somehow help you

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
but you didn't

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Stefan, it's not on the video

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
it's on the video

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
it's all good

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
that was a good one

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
you came up with the live podcast

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
that we did

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Lamar, it's not that good

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
he was here before me

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
it's whole, whole

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
yeah, you have to hurt

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
you asked my staff

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
first of all

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I just wanted to thank Dan Harmon

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
for putting your stories

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
stuff up on channel 101

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I'm glad people find me

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
from the grammar

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
drum

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
no, it's great

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
I'm looking for anything I can

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
so I have a question for

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Neil

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I thought it was a really interesting choice

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
the way that you tease

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
what sounds like some uncontrollable

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
anger issues

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
that Dan has

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
but to never actually show any of it

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
and with 650 hours of footage

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I'm sure that you had some

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
could you just talk a little bit about that?

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
not really, no

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
thank you

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
a lot of people say it happens

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Dan said

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I wish

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I wish I had worn my camera

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
while I was doing that

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
or behaving that way

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
the worst I get is

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
with the person that's supposed to work with me

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
with Aaron

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
it feels good

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
that that comes across in the film

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
because that's a crime I do commit

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
but

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I don't throw things

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I don't hurt

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
people or anything

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
it's like I go from

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
being a big glue

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
thumb-sucking asshole

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
being

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
crazy and stuff

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I just didn't mean

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
because people aren't giving me what I want

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
and

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Aaron who bears the grunge of it

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
the film touches on that

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I don't know

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
it's a conversation

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
it's a conversation

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
there was a moment where I said

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Dan

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
what is the worst part of you

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
being your fans

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
what can make them not line up to be your autograph

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
what can make them say

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
maybe this is a bad guy

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
and he said

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
this is how I've been dating a relationship

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
and Jeff says

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
you brought up a list of tears

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
you brought these things up

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
so it was never

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
captured on camera

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
but it was a discussion we had

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
so to me that was like

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
if there's a low point

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
if there's a scary moment

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
what is it about Dan that his fans

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
need to know about

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
and it's his behavior

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
that stuff's all real

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
there's a real

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
petty competitive part of me

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
that wants to really hammer that home

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
but

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
that said

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I am in a relationship

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
with my hero

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
this person that you guys all look up to

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I look up to him just as much

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
I

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
published a book with all this writing

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
and I

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
admire

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
I really admire this person

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
more so than just a boyfriend

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
I really look up to him

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
and I ask him for advice

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
and I ask him for life advice

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
and when I get set in a relationship

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
I'll say to him

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
I'm not sad because I feel

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
like you were sitting earlier

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
like how do I deal with that

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
and he gives me advice in that way

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
most of the time that works out

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
the tour

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
it's all accurate

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
it was a weird time for us

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
because I think Dan felt like

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
not to put this on you

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
but it seems like over that

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
month it felt like you were maybe

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
assuming that I was going to say hi

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
but I'm so

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I'm the luckiest person in the entire world

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I was watching the movie and I've seen it before

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
crying thinking about how lucky I am

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
how many of us are able to say

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I really look up to the person that I'm with

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
like I look up to him

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
like he's a professor

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
or a father

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
he's my father

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
totally gross

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
no, no, he's not my father

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
but I really look up to him

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
he's not my

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
he's not actually not literally my father

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
no, I mean I

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
I admire him and I also admire him

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
because he supports me more than

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
anyone else in the world

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
and so much, don't be mistaken

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
but there's no, he's not taking any favors

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
by thing with me

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
I'm incredibly shitty and I put on the money

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
with nacho cheese all over my face

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
and my body, like I'm disgusting

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I'm equally disgusting

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I have told Dan some secrets about

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
my body this last two weekends

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
and I'm really shocked and we're perfect

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
it's like, do you want me to fool him?

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
what was this?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
what was this?

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
I don't know

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
something like a documentary about her

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
so I could be out of focus in the background

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
pushing a shopping cart

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
it's called

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
my documentary is called a macacan tape

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
and it's short

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Lamar, everybody

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Lamar, you have a question?

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
okay, so

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
first of all, I want to know who's the best smelly man

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
in Austin

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
you fished for that

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
you fished for that a little bit

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
oh, he didn't say she could just give you some baseball right away

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
no, but seriously

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
but that is hours ago

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
you might not smell like a good hard man

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
maybe not

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
do you want to mention any smells of like

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
the most delicious

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
for us

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
no, but seriously

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
I was back there watching the movie

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
I came here late

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
and I started to realize

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
you're the worst man ever

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
listen, listen

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
listen, listen

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I'm dead serious

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
I'm dead serious

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
I just don't have that big point

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
no, no, no, no

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
I started cheering up man

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
because let me tell you why

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
because I realized how amazing my freaking life is

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
right?

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
because I did not realize you

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
was the dude that created community

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
right?

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
so

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
thank you

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
no, seriously, I did

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
crazy names

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I just like the creativity

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I don't try to remember history names

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
I just like

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
no, I'm not, I promise I'm not

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
but seriously, so I started cheering up

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
because I was like, are you kidding me

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
I got called up on stage

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
by the dude who created the show

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
that I love the most

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
you know what I'm saying? which season?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
every season

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
don't say any season

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
don't say any season

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
I don't know

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
who did this though?

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
market season

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
you gonna say any other season?

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
here's the question

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I don't know man

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
so where's my question man

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
so you didn't do the market season?

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I don't know

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
I don't know

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I have a

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
too bad period

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I like the monkey season

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
this is a better documentary right now

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
you made it

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
you made it

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
I liked it because of the last song of the

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
show

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I got this moringtole

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
so I got this moringtole

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
so it wasn't you

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
but I still

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
like the show

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I got a question for my man

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
you got a question too?

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
yes

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
because I love my life so much

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
so how did it feel when I was watching this show?

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
like how did it feel

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
to get on the show

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
with Harmontown and just be plucked out of

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
like I watched that part

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
you said that but I mean then

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
you probably won't ever be a warrior right now

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
so I'm gonna ask you a question

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
how did it feel to just be like

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
plucked out of like

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
nowhere and to become like

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
a really loved individual

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
you don't understand

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
did you tell him Lamar?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
yeah

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
I mean

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
it felt a while like

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
not that bad

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
it felt like it didn't like nothing happened

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
for a long time I was just kind of

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
going through the flow and I was like

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
really understanding

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
myself as a part of Harmontown

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
because you know on Harmontown people come up

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
on stages the thing that audience members do

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
I was an audience member that came up

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
on stage right? I didn't think about

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
being on Harmontown really until like

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
the tour was like a third of the way through

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
and I was like oh

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I made this

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
this is something I do

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
and I

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
it never really hit me until that part

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
so I was like geez this is pretty

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
freaking cool right?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
and then I just kept rolling with it

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
and then afterwards it was just

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
regular to the knee at that point

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I don't know man I don't feel like

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
it affected me as much as it should

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
and for that I can change

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
thank you Lamar

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
thank you Lamar

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Lamar, thanks for coming to Harmontown

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
we'll see you in a bit more

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
so Lamar I'm working on a cooperative

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
head-holding

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
sorry

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
what happened? what happened?

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
he just opened for you

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I don't want to thank everybody

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
very much on one of them

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
this amazing group on here

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I want to thank all of you

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
and good evening, thanks for being here

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
thank you

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
