WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
This wiggling town can give it more credit

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I thought about my space

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session!

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Are you a guest comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani?

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Ken Harmon!

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
It feels like a town, a town

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Thank you!

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Guest comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Good to have him back!

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Alright, I got dressed in the dark again

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
and I put on one of Aaron's sweatshirts

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
You know what? I was going to tell you I really like that sweatshirt

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
You know what? Maybe I need to have the confidence to wear tiny people's clothing

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Because every time I do, people go like, oh, have you lost weight?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
And I'm like, no, you should say the opposite

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm bursting out of the little doll clothing

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
It's also purple, that's also part of the vibe

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, well that's good, it's modern

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It's my favorite color, purple

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I don't want to talk about fashion

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
You should start every episode like that

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I want to talk about people with children

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
and how they should stop bringing them to fucking hipster parties

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm 41, it's already hard for me to be at a party of 25-year-olds

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I don't want your fucking three-year-old

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
wandering around bumping into walls at 8.30pm

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
when there's a campfire over here and a keg over there

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
It's like, nahhh!

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
This should get fucking spider whiskers on her face

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
because you're a 25-year-old parent

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
You're so close to fucking everything up already

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
and it's so hard for me to be at a party

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
and your three-year-old is complaining about shit

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
and I'm the only other one other than this person

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
that's not going to talk to anybody

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
So I'm stuck with your three-year-old

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
but then I have a choice between looking like a pedophile

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
and looking like a curmudgeon

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
because your kid's going like, I don't like this, I don't like that

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
and I'm biting my tongue because I'm like, bitch, no one cares what you like

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Look at me, I created community, I ain't talking to anybody either

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Just keep eating dirt

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
and their names, their names are always like Hunter or Dagobah

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Ophelia, Dagobah, stop, Chewbacca, Chewbacca, go to...

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
The worst thing isn't the kids

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
because the kids are fine, whatever, they're dumb

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
they're as dumb as their parents and worse

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
because they don't know how to read yet

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
but their parents are the worst

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
because their parents are 25-years-old

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
and their parents think that producing another silver-like hipster out of their loins

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
licenses them to be the same people they were at a party only now louder

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
They now, I get to be the big doofus lumbering around the party

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
only now, every once in a while, I get to go, Clement, what are you doing?

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
Clement, Clement, god damn it, shut the fuck up

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
shut up, stop yelling at your kid, like talking over

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
like, what are you doing, what are we saying, what are we doing?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
There's a lot of we

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
when you go to the farmer's market, it's a fucking nightmare

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
over there

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Who's, what's going on over there, buddy?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Yeah

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
You're occupying space with other human beings

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
those same people will complain about cell phone usage in a bar

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Hey buddy, take that phone outside

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
just take your fucking three-year-old away from my life

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
get him out of here

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
hey, suspender, what are you doing over there?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
the itsy-bitsy spider

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
shut the fuck up, I'm trying to drink

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
it's like, there's a fire

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
at child level, we're in a backyard

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
get your kid home

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
you had a child, you're out

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
yeah, tap out at society

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
you know the rules, you know the rules

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
you reproduced, you're out of there

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
there's beer here, there's fun here, you're gone

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
you replicated

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
get out of society

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
go play itsy-bitsy spider if it's so fucking fun

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
you're acting like it's fun because I'm here

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
it's not fun, itsy-bitsy spider

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
it's repetitive and derivative and shitty

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
like your kids

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
yeah

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
it's the 27 dresses of shit you say to kids

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
the Matthew McConaughey didn't know how to commit so he wrote a marriage column for a...

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
I think that's a plot of seven Matthew McConaughey movies

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
he doesn't know how to commit, girls

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I will say, I don't know much about parties

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
but if your options at parties are either looking like a curmudgeon or a pedophile

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
go with curmudgeon

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
well then I'm gonna tell a lot of little girls to fuck off

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
yeah, that's better than, is the creator of community trying to seduce our child?

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
because I went to, you know, I have a wife now

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
and I...

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
which ratchets me up into suspicion of pedophilia by like

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
150%

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
yeah, why would he get married if he didn't want to fuck kids?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm just saying, I fit the profile even more

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm one white van away from like

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
it's...

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm just saying like, my wife

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
the girlfriend where it sticks in my throat now

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
my wife, my wife

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
made a bunch of pies for a pie party

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and we took him to a backyard

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
she's 30

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm 41, I don't have pie parties

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
we went to a backyard

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
that's exactly the age difference between my dad and my mom, 11 years

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
she was 16 though, so

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
I guess my dad got married because he was a pedophile

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
it was a different time

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
it was on the bubble

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
and it was on the Pakistani Riviera

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
where, you know, blame it on Rio

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
laws are cheap and life is cheaper

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
and everything is controlled indirectly by a distant a la goblin

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
did you call him Allah goblin?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
is that what you called him?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
no, Allah goblin

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
oh, I thought you said Allah goblin

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
no

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
you know, this is going everywhere

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
we're not laid back people

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I never said Allah goblin

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
tell your friends, I did not say that

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
alright, settle down guys

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
put that away

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Allah goblin

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
it's like a monopoly, but it's with a bunch of old rich people

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
not Allah goblin

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
no, no, Allah is not a goblin

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
if you're watching this

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
he is, he's watching everything

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
he doesn't need fucking YouTube to see this

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
it's not Allah, I'm worried about offending

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
it's his goblins

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
it's his biggest fans

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
so I wanted to, okay, so keep your fucking...

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
if you're 25 and you had a kid

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
you're still a child

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
learn to interact with your child

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
and have a handle on them before you take them to a party where I'm going to be

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
because I'm already at a party with children

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
like you, a 25-year-old

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
and now you're fucking spouting

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
like little Mogwai

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I'm going to mention all of you in my suicide note

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I'm going to go suspender and itsy bitsy spider

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
and that's why Hemingway is done with all of you

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I'm barely hanging on for dear life

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I don't like, because it's also weird

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
if you meet a baby and the baby doesn't like you

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
everyone's like, what's the fucks wrong with you?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
it's a stupid baby

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I love telling kids to fuck off

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
fuck you, and then they start liking you

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
it's like the oldest lesson in the book

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
it does kind of sound like you're trying to fuck the children

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
my wife made some pies for a pie party

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
we took them to the pie party

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
there was this grubby little girl, this little fucking urchin

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
rolling around in the dirt

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
and she was like, as people put the pies down on the table

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I was watching her, no one else was watching her

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
do you sound like the wrong side?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I was watching her

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
that's the wrong side of the curmudgeon pedophile

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
when I was watching that party, I saw her

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I noticed her, by the way

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
now we realize what my problem is

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
alright, I surrender, you're right

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
but she was digging into the pies

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
we're going to eat those, you fucking grub

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
where's your hipster parents?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
they wouldn't let you eat their fucking shit

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
with your grubby gremlin hands

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
that's my wife's pie, you bitch

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
and then Erin put her pie down

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
and one of her fucking 11 awesome pies was like this bacon pie

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
and the little girl looked at the pie

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
she was going from pie to pie, digging into it

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
with her fucking claws

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
her little hepatitis claws

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
her little dirt talons

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
that she was just using to play with worms

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and be like, this worm should marry this worm

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
okay, now pie time

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
and it's like, now we're all like, why am I sick?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
why am I dying?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
her Ebola paws

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
so she's digging, I'm watching her digging

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
no one's stopping the kid

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
no one's conscious of the kid, I'm the only one

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
because I'm either a curmudgeon or a pedophile

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
and I watch her, she digs

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
pie, pie, pie, she's going from pie to pie

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and she's like, it's like my dog

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
she's like, maybe it's like off the rim

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
she's like grabbing little crusts

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and like their mouth and her claw and her mouth

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
and then Erin sets one of her pies down

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and it's a bacon pie and the little girl looks at the pie

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
and she goes, I don't know

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
I don't like bacon that much

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
and I, oh

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I wanted to go bitch, no one cares what you like

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
yeah, no one cares what you like

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
and you're going to spend the next 80 years

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
if you're lucky learning that

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
no one cares what you like, no one

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
you, it's you

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
in a fucking vast sea of apathy

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
you fucking

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
like who put it in your head already at this age

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
those are the first words you're learning to farm

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm not sure about this kind of pie

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
fuck you, 9-11 should have happened then

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
to her?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I didn't say any of that to her, I'm like

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
okay

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
you should have explained to her, she probably doesn't know what 9-11 is

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
you should have killed her

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I'm not engaging her

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
but then I'm sitting down by the fire in the backyard

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
which can burn a human being

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and then she's like, I wanted to sit there

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and then her parents are finally

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
her parents come to the stage and goes

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
the chairs are hers, and I'm like

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
okay, but in my head I'm thinking

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
then take her in a fucking dark corner and set her shit straight

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
it's a chair by a fire

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
they're sociopaths

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
kids are sociopaths

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
stop replicating

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
and partying

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I'm gonna do it, the world needs

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
where Dan Harmon's, I'm gonna make them

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I'm gonna keep them in my ivory tower

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
and teach them to rule over you

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm gonna show them dolls

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
and say, this is what?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
a normal person, what's your job?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
control them

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm not gonna make it your problem

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
you will meet them at 16

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
when they emerge cross-legged floating

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
they're like

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
lifting your cars with their

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
magneto powers

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
they'll come out and they'll be like

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I don't like bacon that much, I'm like fuck

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I'm fucked up

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
what did I teach you

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
alright, one thing quick before

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
we bring out our special guests

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I wanted to do, you have your

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I have this text exchange with Rob all day

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I don't know if this will translate

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
my friend Rob Schrab

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
who is a known

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
yeah, you're a big fan of his

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
cause he's a terrible person

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
so here's a

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
text exchange I had with him today

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
you're gonna read Rob's parts

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I'll read my own parts

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
is blue you

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
or is white you? blue is me

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't see color but

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
to me white is everyone

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
oh thank you

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
you're welcome

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
you just gotta apply yourself

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
that's my problem

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
and later on

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
we have some lesbian women

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
coming up but I don't even know that

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
to me they're both white women

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I don't know

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I don't see sexual preference

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
I just see that they're beautiful white women

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
one of them might be Latin

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I don't know, her last name is Esposito

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
she doesn't look super Latin

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
yeah, good for her

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
alright

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
alright so

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
here we go, I'll be Rob Schrab

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
okay, so I get this text from Rob

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
this is like what it's like to be his friend

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
have you ever seen

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
all that jazz?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
out of nowhere

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
once when I was a kid

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
it's a Bob Fosse biopic

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
that Bob Fosse wrote and directed

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
yeah, I vaguely remember it

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Roy Scheider

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
dies in the end

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I knew it was about Fosse but I didn't know

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
he had a hand in the movie

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
you should do make a movie like that

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
good idea

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
you should call it all that jazz

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
so if you have fantasies about me

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I said um

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
yeah, that's a separate text

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
um, is it's own text

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
I feel like you kind of walked me down a path on that one

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
you know

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
because you like jazz

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and jazz is still

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
in caps

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
he keeps capitalizing jazz

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
like it's an Adams family member

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
because those are the only things that are capitalized

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
you know, because you like jazz

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
I think I got it, yeah

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
when's the last time you saw Rocky?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
this is hours later

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
guess when I was younger

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't know

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
20?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
you should make a movie like Rocky

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
but base it off of your life

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
would it be called

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
would that scan?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
smell butt

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
what is that?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
that sounds nothing like Rocky

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
it has two syllables

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
that's the only similarity

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
I wasn't trying to

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
is that a requirement?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
well, it's a movie like Rocky

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
and it's about my life

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
but the title reflects none of those facts

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
nobody looking for the movie will be able to find it

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and nobody that comes across the title

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
will know if it's something in which they'd be interested

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
end of conversation

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
he really did

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
all that jazz was quite a long walk

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
he really

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
like

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
keep fantasizing

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
about being friends with Rob Schrab

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
if you want

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
why don't we bring out our guests

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
they have a new

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
is it new feral audio podcast?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
it's a feral audio podcast

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
why do you always like new things?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
it's like that fucking 3 year old wandering around

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
digging her dirty hands into pies

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
maybe this has been a podcast

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
for 60 years

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
that's called put your hands together

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and they're also like

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
recently accidentally

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
virally noted

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
for these buzzfeed

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
is it buzzfeed videos?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
ask a lesbian

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
welcome Cameron Esposito

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and Ria Butcher

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
hello

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
anywhere that makes you comfortable

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
are you guys

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
drinking?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
folks do you want to?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
we're generally not drinking folks

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
which is totally weird for the comedy world

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
I know that Ria we talked about

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
in the green room is

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
a remarkable

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
image of a vegan

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
vegan or vegetarian?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
even in the womb

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
your mother

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
even though you're from Akron Ohio

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
it's not like you're from a bubble

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
you're not from some google bubble

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
in space

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
but your mom never ate meat

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
so even in the womb

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
your body, your blood, none of it

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
has ever touched meat

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and you've just never eaten meat

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
and look at you

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Michael J. Fox

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Michael J. Foxy

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
your twitter avatar

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
is like you in the drawing

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
of somebody made of you in the orange vest

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
I think it's my tumblr avatar

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
or something but yeah it's me as Marty

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
you're super into back to the future

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
super into back to the future

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
you love it a lot

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
you know I watched Teen Wolf

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
two days ago and I hadn't seen it

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
in like 20 years

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
he had Teen Wolf and Back to the Future

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
the same year

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Back to the Future was number one

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Teen Wolf was number two and he was on

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Family Ties

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
he was sleeping in his car

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
in between Back to the Future and Family Ties

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
because he would go shoot

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Back to the Future at night

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and then he would shoot Family Ties during the day

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Teen Wolf is a terrible movie

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
does it not hold up?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
it's a guy turns into a werewolf

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
and nothing happens

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I believe he's good at basketball

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
that's nothing

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
just practice

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
get good at basketball

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
but I remember it being about

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I remember it being about being yourself

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
as opposed to falling back

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
on the thing that makes you

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I don't know

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
marketable

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I also think it kind of came out at this time when

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I figured that somebody would be very good at sports

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
it wasn't really

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
this is like a pre-Jordan era

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
they would have to be a wolf

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
to be good at basketball

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
if they're white

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
they'd have to be a wolf

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
something about that movie

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
that really registered with me

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I'm sure it doesn't hold up

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I'm informed and inspired

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
by a bunch of crap that I watch

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and it's like this doesn't hold up

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
but the really

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
impacting thing creatively about Teen Wolf

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
was that they were doing this

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
like traditional

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
garbage-y 80s movie

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
he's a wolf and it's blah blah blah

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
and then there's that moment

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
the plot point where

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
he turns into a werewolf on the basketball court

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
and instead of going left

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
they go right

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
it's just like some writer thought

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
what if he turned into a werewolf

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
on the basketball court and then

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
everyone went

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
or then he starts dribbling the basketball

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
and it's like if basketball

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
is so fucking important to you

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
you have to stop the game because

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I turned into a werewolf or you gotta play werewolf

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
a basketball against a werewolf

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
and then they just go right

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
instead of left and the movie continues along

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
the lines of like what if being a werewolf

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
was just a metaphor for being like

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I don't know what

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
that's a coming out story I just realized that

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
in a world where

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
we still needed more movies about it being okay

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
to be something it was like teen wolf

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
was actually a cautionary tale

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
sent from the past to today

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
maybe for people going like

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
hey lesbian, hey differently

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
abled person, hey black person

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
don't let your superpower

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
like uh

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
don't forget to just play basketball

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
yeah when you guys

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
came out did you guys get really good at basketball

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I got really good at basketball

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I mean I did get this haircut

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
which I feel like is probably

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
pretty teen wolf informed

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
well I feel like

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
because I watched the movie Frozen last year

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
on a plane and I was

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
like alone watching this movie and I just hadn't read

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
anything about it because I don't like to read about movies before I've seen them

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
and I had no idea that that movie

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
is just about a gay person

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
like that movie is about a gay person

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
she just wants to be left alone

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
well she's like

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I have to hide who I am

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
because my parents don't like me

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
also men are terrible

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
a lot of what she says

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
she's super gay

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
she's like gotta wear gloves

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
that's part of being a lesbian all the time

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
and I was like

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
on a plane just wanted to like make a friend

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
so I could just be like this is a gay movie for kids

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
you know but

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I don't talk to people on planes

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
this is a lot of other like Frozen though

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
you could interpret that a couple different ways

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I never looked at that through a gay lens

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I look at everything through a gay lens

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
did you want a gay lens

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
yeah I went to gay lens crafters

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
did you bring the gay lens

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I want to look at it

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
oh my god

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
the A team was

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
the gay team

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Mr. T just wanted to fuck everybody

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
but he wasn't allowed to

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
that's not what being gay means

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
like early gay

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
you're too young for the back to the future

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
you seem like a youngster

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
maybe it's just the vegetarian

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
it's the vegetarian and the lesbianism

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
she's 42

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
it's a fountain of youth

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
when we were doing the community Christmas episode

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
with the stop motion

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
we watched all the rank and bass stuff

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
and I was stricken by the

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
really kind of healthy

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
super by our modern lens

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
progressive

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
thinly, properly veiled

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
pro-gay

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
endorsement that was the elf that just wanted to be

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
he wanted to be a dentist

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
and he was like I don't want to be an elf

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I want to be a dentist

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
they say I was born an elf but I'm not

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I was born a dentist

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I want to take care of teeth and I want to do that stuff

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
and he did a little dance number

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I was looking and he was like wow this is like really

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
we don't have this much craft

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
these days now that we're

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
actually trying to accomplish this

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I really do like what is Rudolph

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
these are all gay stories

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
everything is gay

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Jesus was gay

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Jesus was totally gay

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
that's why they killed him

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Buddha was gay

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Buddha was just a big gay bear

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
what about Muhammad

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
say it into the camera

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
don't tell him

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
say it into the camera

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
why is it always this camera for the

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I don't know

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
straight feed

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
yeah it's going right to the headquarters

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
it's the Camel Cam

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
but like for instance back to the future

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Superhold is up that's a fucking great movie

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
yes it is

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Teen Wolf is not

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
it reminds you that you were a dumb kid

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
saying you didn't like bacon but you like Teen Wolf

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
right yeah yeah yeah

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
and I don't want to hear your bullshit

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
because there are people in this audience

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
that will stick up for space balls for God's sake

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
so fuck them

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
but the truth is

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
you just don't like movies with the word space in the title

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
the truth is Goonies doesn't even hold up

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
like the sacrosanct wonderful

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
fuck off

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
fuck off

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
it doesn't hold up

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
it is not a movie it is garbage

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
it's a pile of spaghetti

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
spilled out at your feet

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
asking you to figure it out

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
it doesn't make any sense

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
nothing

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
when you set it next to Back to the Future

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
which is

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I'll be very careful mother fucker

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Back to the Future's screenplay

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
took seven years to write

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
like they were writing that for seven years

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
and a couple of those years

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
interviews I've read

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Bob Gale was wrestling with

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
what would happen if

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
in the car with the mom at the prom

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
and

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
you've probably delved into this stuff

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
and read about this

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
at the end of it all

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
they realized

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
it took them forever to come up with the simplest thing

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
in the world which is that the mom kisses

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
the son and then she goes

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I don't like it

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
it's like kissing my brother

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
it's like I'm kissing my brother

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
yeah and it was like that took years

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
they were stuck on that for years

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I mean they also wanted him to time travel

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
in a refrigerator

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
which then showed up in Crystal Skull

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm sure all of you know

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
but yeah

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
that screenplay is like

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
it's like the tightest screenplay ever made

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
there's like not a wasted minute

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
no that's interesting

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
what?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
because I think you forgot about the movie Alien

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
you don't like Alien?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
no I love Alien

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
but like if we're talking about tight screenplays

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
not a wasted shot

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Back to the Future

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Alien was

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Alien's a tight screenplay

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
tight screenplay

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
but which one is more fun?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
at the end when Sigourney takes off her outfit

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
and she's just wearing a tight screenplay

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
that is a tight screenplay

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
you can see everything

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
all the notes

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
all the acts

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I just keep thinking about all the arguments

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I have a movie to watch with Aaron

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm gonna be a lesbian so bad

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
you guys are arguing about

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
two different kinds of good movies

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
yes

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
when was the last time you saw

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Burton's Batman

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
we were just watching it before we came over here

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I can't abide it

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
garbage

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
oh wow

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
garbage

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
we were watching it we couldn't believe that it held up

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
actually I'm gonna say something very unpopular

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
which is that I don't like

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Christopher

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I don't like Christopher Nolan's movies

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
very much

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
because I think he

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
he's like really

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
he's just like

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
what is it would you say?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I wouldn't say awful let's go with a more intelligent analysis

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
I just think he

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
he thinks he's

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
pretty smart a dude

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
and sometimes he wraps

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
a pretty

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
cool bow around

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
a nonsense word

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I was a little disillusioned

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
and then I went back and watched

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
we watched Burton's Batman and I was like

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
oh this is like an amazing movie

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I haven't watched it in a while

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
it was like five or six years

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I'll watch it again with Aaron

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
we'll check it out

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
there is no way Tim Burton's Batman is better than The Dark Knight

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
well

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
we've got a live one here

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
well I mean

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
it depends on how you want to see your Batman

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
do you want to see like a whiny guy

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
that can't get his voice to come out right

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
because he's trying to get over an accent

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
or do you want to see like a dude who's like

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
pretty sweet to Kim Basinger the whole time

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
he's like never

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
he's like never that much of an ass

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
he's just like I got this whole other thing going on

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
yes or no like are you in or out

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
and she's like I'm an adult person

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
that's in control of myself

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
and also I'm in

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
then The Dark Knight's just like

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
God my mother's so big I can't stop crying

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I think are you are you

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Rhea are you do you disagree with this stuff

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
are you a Christian Bale like Batman fan

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
well I enjoy The Dark Knight but that's about it

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
right like I'm definitely more of a Michael Keaton Batman

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
and I keep watching The Dark Knight

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
over and over again because

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
it's sort of like

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
it's like a Scorsese movie it's like

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I just keep like I just

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
but and I think that that points to like

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
the guy is like a really powerful director

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
really powerful cinematographer

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
and most importantly what you can observe

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
from everything laying around it

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
obviously Heath Ledger is the

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
like is the thing that we're going

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
back to I think

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
it's that plus the

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
the foundation that Christopher Nolan

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
cast over everything I'll even

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
once in a while I'll be like

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
did I not get inception

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
and then you're like oh no

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
he didn't get inception

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
and it's like every time like

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
the logical part of my brain

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
the writer part of my brain goes this is

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
insipid this is garbage but

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
my eyeball part of my brain which is

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
never stimulated I'm always like god damn it

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
it's so fucking good though absolutely it's

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
he's making gorgeous things but the problem is that

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
so The Matrix

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
is a great example of making

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
a beautiful movie where they're like oh

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
does this also make sense and I feel like

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
for Christopher Nolan if he was just like hey I'm a

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
gorgeous artist I make gorgeous stuff I should get

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
good screenplays yeah

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
exactly I wish he wasn't always just like

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
guys I gotta explain why this is so

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
pretty by writing it

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
yeah gotta go through it

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
get away from the typewriter that's all it is

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
when's the last time you saw okay so then

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I would say this absolutely Heath Ledger

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Joker's great but we were really

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
also enjoying

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Nicholson's Joker just because it's like such a stretch

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
for him it's very funny that's why

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I kind of want to watch it again I just

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I since

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Tim Burton

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
like he is so

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
theatrical and everything it's like I get

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I get distracted by

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
I feel

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
I like I feel like the

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
crooked doorways and the purples and the everything

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
like I feel distracted

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
by them everything's on a sound

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
stage in a Batman that's what I really

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
think

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
that when Nolan did Batman

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
the thrilling thing was that

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
we were in genuine exteriors using locations

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
and that things felt paramilitary

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
the cosmetics

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
made you allowed you to

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
believe in Batman in a visceral

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
way and whereas

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
like I don't like you can

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
see the dangers of

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Burton's Batman in

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
what's his names Batman

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I refuse to say

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
yes

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
his name should not be spoken

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
with the purple nipples and the

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Daeglo brain fights

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
it's kind of like well

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
didn't Burton set you up to do this

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
isn't this what you liked it's like

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
when I watch Burton's Batman I'm like

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
yeah what are we doing we're like

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
revving this like fish shaped

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
roller coaster car through a sound

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
stage and having these acrobats

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
kick box each other and stuff

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
yeah I mean even Burton

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
evolved from Burton in like ways that

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
people maybe should have

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
just stay with the scissor hands unless with the

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
yeah scissor hands with the guy

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
let's digress

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
we lived in Chicago at the time

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
actually when they filmed The Dark Knight

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
which is also interesting because that was

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
very much a part I mean nothing is

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
well before that nothing was really filmed there

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
now they really encourage filming but did you

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
ever see any I remember they would put up

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
signs and they would say that a movie that

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
was being filmed there called First Kiss

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Rory's First Kiss

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
yes that's right and it was Batman

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
cause I actually worked at a screen printing

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
company at the time that was

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
making like the emblems and stuff for

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
the Gotham City police

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
so they were making like in a robe for Harvey

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Dent which never got made but

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
yeah it was all for Rory's First Kiss

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
and I worked on the street on LaSalle street

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
where they filmed the like final charge

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
and they were and it was all labeled as

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Rory's First Kiss but there was like a Gotham City

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Helicopter so

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
alright

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
so I want to let you guys go

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
because you have the birthday party to go to

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
and I promise not to keep you

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
but you're pot I'm not

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
kicking you out yet but I want to announce that

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
cause I'm terrible at letting people go

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
you have a podcast called Put Your Hands Together

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
which is like a stand up podcast

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
where you can come to see podcast

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
comedian people do

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
comic things

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
you guys run it together and you're like hosting it

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
I haven't

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
you're rapping

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
go ahead sorry

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
it felt like you were trying to figure out what a show is

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
well I'm not sure

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
they have a podcast but it's a stand up format

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I don't know if the stand up

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
come and talk about their lives

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
on the thing or if it's a live podcast

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
where you guys are hosting a stand up show

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
it's a great question

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
yeah it's a show

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I just spilled so much

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
water in my crotch

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
so much it's all the way through

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
but it's every Tuesday night at the UCB

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
and it's a live stand up show

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
that runs for 75 minutes

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
and Ri and I co-host it

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
and we do hilarious jokes

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
and then also stand ups come and perform

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
and we didn't think that this

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
we took a real risk when we started it two years ago

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
because we just said like maybe if we do this

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
stand ups will let us use their material

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
and most of them do

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
we never we say you can have your set cut

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
if you want it and we can do an interview instead

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and that's also fine and sometimes you just get

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
like a great interview with somebody who's about to go on

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Conan and they're like practicing their Conan set

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
but a lot of it is just like

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
material which is awesome because

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
there are so many people that

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
don't get a chance to be

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
like I don't know if LA ever realizes how lucky

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
LA is because everybody just lives here

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
so you can go to a show at the meltdown or at the UCB

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and it's just like oh these people are only in

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
like majorly big budgeted

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
films not like enormously big budgeted

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
like we can't believe it's just like Louis C.K.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
and not like Louis C.K. writing

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Jerry Seinfeld like what are like

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
this is bullshit

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
we can't believe we're just like not watching

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Maria Bamford and also Sarah Silverman

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
doing the arms for each other from behind

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
like this

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
so you're spoiled audiences

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
but people in Kansas City they don't get to hear

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
eight great

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
comics on the same show they don't get to hear anything

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
they don't get to hear anything there's no

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
airs in Kansas City

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
they got nothing out there

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Missouri and Kansas

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
sounds free America

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and the thing that doesn't need to be

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
plugged is these

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
charming awesome

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
like mother friendly Ask a Lesbian

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
there's this video that's like

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
billions and zillions of

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
more views than community has had

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Nielsen numbers just and

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
we were talking about in the greener like how does that happen

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
what does that happen we made a video called Ask a Lesbian

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
and it's like pretty it's there's

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
nothing really shocking in there it's like

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I hear the questions for Ask a Lesbian is

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
saying no never really

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I've had this argument so many times thank you

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
it's not a thing

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
you could have just called us

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
whenever you had that argument

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
we will come and defend you

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
yes you can I'm giving you the permission

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
weird question

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
not that I'm not

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I honestly wanted to be a real thing

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
but if you think about it scientifically

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
it doesn't make sense it's not doing anything

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
for anybody well now come on

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
if you're a lesbian couple and you're out there and you want to

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
be with each other I think also you guys would agree

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
with me go ahead try it

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I have had women debate me after shows

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
like only a couple

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
there's always like a couple lesbians that are like I do it

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
and I love it and I

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
don't believe them because

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
you've been a lesbian for three weeks

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
yeah what are you rubbing

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
what's going on with your thighs

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
you can get them so

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
they always walk up to you really uncomfortable

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
they're like oh it's

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
totally a thing they got no

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
pants on they're just real winnie the pooh

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
oh legged

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
because the things you're trying to get

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
to align are very small

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
yeah in the grand scheme of

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
things and you should just you should just

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
grab them I mean just grab

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
like before you should rub them together you should just

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
grab them grab them because gay men

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I doubt even gay men

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
have a big flappy thing coming out

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and I bet I bet they spend very

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
little time just rubbing them together

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
no yeah and they can

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
they can do it

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
they could just like

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
tap them together and I bet they don't

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
a lot that's amazing

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
well I think that people are really

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
confused about what lesbian sex looks like

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
because of lesbian porn

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
because lesbian porn is always like it's like

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
two women scissoring they have super long fingernails a pizza guy

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
comes he's like do you want me and they're like

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
yes so then it's all labeled

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
lesbian and it's just like very

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
even the movie blue is the warmest color has like

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
27 minutes of scissoring

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
one question one question

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
you kind of sidestepped as a joke

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
in your video the I think

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
it was like one of the first questions is

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
do you get excited

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
looking at your own boobs

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
which is a question I never even thought to ask

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
no but you also

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
sidestepped it with a joke you did is there an answer

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
to that question is that

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I'm gonna guess no you don't

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
yeah well not your own right you're not

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
turned on you're probably like hey these are

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
great boobs this is so great that someone

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
else gets to enjoy them or whatever

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
you know what the lesbians

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
answer

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
go ahead

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
well um I what do you

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
want to answer first and all I mean usually

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I you know look in the mirror and give full

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
eye contact to the boobs and then I'm like you're

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
doing great but

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
well I think that so here's the thing I

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
mean uh

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
what don't answer

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
what don't be stressed it's okay I'm comfy

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
with my body thank you so much for protecting us

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
because you were between two men who were like

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
why are your boobs like so

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I really appreciate that

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
but it's okay we're friends with Kumail

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
and Dan's a great dude we're on it's okay

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I'm curious what could be I'm curious

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
though about that that outburst what could be

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
gained by not answering what could possibly

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
be happening and I really I don't mean that

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
rhetorically what what could be happening are we

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
bullying by asking no I think maybe it's just like

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
you know anytime you ask a woman about her bod

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
there's like a bit of a revelatory thing there

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
but I mean I to me I just say that no I don't get

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
returned on my my my own bod but I do think

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
sometimes I'm like you looking great in them

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
undies but um

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
real tight screenplay

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I've never seen purple screenplays

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
before

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
that's a lacy screenplay

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I think I think young lady whoever

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
whoever felt compelled to be protective like that

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I want to be clear about this I was asking

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
because they made a video and that was one of the

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
questions in the video I wasn't like like like

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
calling you guys up and like

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
we got called up here from this

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
we stopped

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I wanted to answer you know it's like

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
the question was asked and answered in this

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
viral video some seem a million people and I was

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
like I wanted to do like a little director's cut

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
of it like is there is there an actual

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
answer that question I have a I have like

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
an even more personal answer which is really

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
a probably two person which is that

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
Ria has better boobs than I do

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
why are people clapping?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I have great boobs but I think

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
she's got the better boobs but that's kind of

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
cool thing about being a lesbian is you're like

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
you've got the boobs and I

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
have a what do I have

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
the money

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
say something a beautiful face

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
a beautiful face

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
a beautiful face

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I don't know

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
you have a great ass

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
thank you for God's sake

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
what about the hole

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I'm sorry this is disgusting

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
the other question

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
did you say

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
what about the hole

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
the other question I had never

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
thought to ask until you guys told me that

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
you just recently got engaged or you got

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
engaged this year

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and I think

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
if you're a straight guy in the audience

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
you may suppress it because you live in

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Los Angeles but there's probably an

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
immediate question of like who proposed

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
like how do you

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
that was my first question I was like here's a

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
lesbian question who proposed and I

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
don't know where joke separates from

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
reality but and I think the answer is

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
you just don't but the answer from

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
you guys was that Ria because she has

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
like

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
like

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
it's easier to kneel down

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
oh yeah I can't

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
like

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
well yeah Ria proposed but that was just

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
because

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
why was it you and not me

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
do you know the hair

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I feel like I

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
knew that I wanted to be with you but I was

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
like too shy to do that and then we

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
went to this top of it we were in Griffith

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
park we're in the top of this beautiful mountain

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I like hiking Ria hates hiking she woke me up

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
really early in the morning was like let's go for a hike

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
and I just like didn't think anything was weird

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
and also she didn't tell me to like

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
put on good clothes because so

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I was wearing garbage

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
jean shorts and very much and like

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
a sun hat that goes all the way around

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
yeah we had

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
water bottles

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Ria sat in

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
gum right before

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
she sat in gums all over her ass

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
and then and then a hawk

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
flew by and then she

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
got down and proposed but the funny thing about

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
getting proposed to at the top of a mountain is

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
that you never think about like

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
now we have to go down

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
we're just up here

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
we didn't even have service we couldn't call anybody

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
we just had to like

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
we want to hike back down

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
and then get close

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and go to brunch like what do you want to do

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I got to change the laundry

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
had you guys

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
discussed before that you were going to get married

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
was it a total surprise

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
like a lot of nowadays

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I would think a lot of couples are like hey we're going to get married

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
yeah we'll get married at some point

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
was it a conversation you guys had

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
I think when we moved out here together that I just figured

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
like

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
like as long as Ria

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
doesn't move back to Chicago

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
we're getting married

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
that was kind of the thought in my mind and then

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
had you guys talked about it

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I don't think we did I think we maybe talked about it and like

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I'm going to marry you

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
that's talking about it

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
that's talking about it

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
I mean that could be the most devastating

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
talking about it there is

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
we are in moments of passion we're like

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I'm going to marry you and it's like oh shit

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
like

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I mean you can't just change your mind

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
about that like and yet sometimes

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
it's something you really want to say

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
alright well

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
one more thing you know what she called my dad

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
for real

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I did not have the balls to do that

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I did not

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
my girlfriend's

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
girlfriend's my wife's

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
girlfriend at the time her

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
yeah I should have done that

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
you got permission?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
yes I did

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I'll say this I didn't need it

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
he was like I don't need to give you this

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
but I really appreciate you talking to me about it first

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
before you did it

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
which is the key dad response

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
perfect response

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
dad can we get a dad transplant

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
for these folks I'm sure my dad

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
yeah I'll take one too

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
he's a tiny Italian crying man

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
and I just knew

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
that he would need to hear from Rhea

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
and so I just actually told her that

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
like if you ever think about it you should talk to my dad

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
just because like not that he is possessive

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
but just that he would just like

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
that would make him happy till the day he died

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
like he just would be like I like Rhea

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I'm going to die in a second

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
please come in here

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I have to tell you again

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
like this will be his last words

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
that and I love your mother

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
that's the other one

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
your mother

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
no

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
that would be a terrible revenge

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
what

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
yeah

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I know you guys are human beings

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
and individuals and not representative

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
of anything and not symbolic and icons

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
but that makes me want to cry so much

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
the idea of a

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
dad of a

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
going giving his blessing

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
that makes me like so

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
I just want to

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
melt into a liberal puddle

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
and

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
like slow into some

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
gutter and just join

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Obama in heaven

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
and rain down

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
in every country

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
make everything green and vegan

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
and

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
just turn the moon

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
into a

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
rainbow

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I don't know

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
which is this podcast

which is also on Farrell

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
what are you doing what are you doing

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I'm just taking a moment to plug this podcast

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I do it's called the X Files Files

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Rhea does it all the time

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
should listen to that should listen to you and your wife

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
talking on the indoor kids

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
should have

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
your wife come by as a guest I keep thinking

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
yeah yeah well she used to be a couples

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
therapist and yeah well she's not

well you're not doing a show here next week so

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
couple weeks okay but

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
yeah alright look at these empty

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
seats they were delightful huh look at this limitless

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
potential

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
we never did find out what

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
they thought of each other's whole

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
life

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
which they brought up

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I wish

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I wish we could have gotten to the bottom

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
of lesbianism as I call it

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
as a

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
lifestyle choice

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
what makes you choose it I forgot to

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
ask them that

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
why lesbianism

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
why not survivalism

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
or

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
doomsday prepping

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
like it's a hobby

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
yeah

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
some people collect stamps some people are lesbians

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
let's bring

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
somebody out here

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
whose name I kind of changed

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
recently

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
my wife Erin

47:45.000 --> 47:57.000
Kathy Harmon

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
hello do you

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
get turned on by your boobs

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
um

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
it was kind of loud backstage

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
do I get turned on by my boobs

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
yeah

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
no

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
it was a callback and we can move on

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
maybe I should say yes

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
maybe that sucks there yeah

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
it's just so around

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
and I look at them

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I'm like that's you

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
and I'm like but they're like

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
candies on a on hills

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
of

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I often wonder when I get

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and get out of the shower

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
and I see myself in the mirror and I'm just like

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
what in the world

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
who would ever

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
why

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
you got out of the shower this morning

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
and I woke up to a naked

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
and I was like oh

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
and I will admit most of my sexual

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
turn on andness was from the fact that I knew

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
that you had just taken a shower

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I control the market

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
the bar is low

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
yeah

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
kumail is going to look like Greg Luganis

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
and he's got a swimmer's body

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
yeah

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
the height of male attractiveness Greg Luganis

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I guess I

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
just popped in my head

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Greg Luganis was very sexy

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
but mostly known for having AIDS and being a gay diver

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I would

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I guess I'm more progressive than you guys

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
I just see him as a fit man

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
yeah he was just a hot

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
bod to you so progressive

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I'm definitely on the

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Tim Burton Batman

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
in that camp

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
and not mention Danny DeVito

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
as the penguin

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
that performance is so amazing

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
dark night too dark

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
no one

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
and why did they spell night wrong

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
oh boy

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
rude

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
it's like it's day and night I know

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
there's no k

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I can't do my impression of my wife's

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
this is

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
me at the altar

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
having spent

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
a day and a half

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
almost physically nauseous

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
like retching like thinking

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
like I gotta write these vows

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I gotta memorize these vows

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I gotta make these vows right

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
and I gotta do them good

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
and then here's my impression of my wife

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
the officiant goes like

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
they've written their own vows

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
and Erin goes

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
well you know

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
what

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
she didn't write her vows

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
she just improvised them

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
she was like you know I love you and stuff

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
but then she did have a highly

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
choreographed dance and song

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
no she did

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
her love was not a

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
up for debate

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I just thought it was funny

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I think the writing of the vows

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
and the memorization of the vows

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
is a thing maybe for the groom

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
because I did

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I am thankful looking back on it

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
that I had something

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
otherwise I would have been melting down

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
thinking about the idea that I was getting married

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
and instead I was melting down

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
like a sixth grader about to go play

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Marco Polo in a play

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I was like memorizing my lines

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I was just pacing back and forth

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I was like who is this person

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I told you to cherish you

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I got to memorize these things

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
it kept me sane during

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
a very crazy threshold

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
yeah I was keeping the secret of

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
that performance

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
but like right before we got married

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
when we did our

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
first look photo op

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I don't know if you and Emily did that

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
no we went and got married

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
at a 5

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
50 times no we have been married many times

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
but we just went to like the

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
what's it called town hall

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
the square

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
we went to the square, got married

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
the pit

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
we went down to the mosh pit

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
got married

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
and then told my parents so we didn't have

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
what's the first look photograph

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
they do photographers now

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
because

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
it makes more sense to take pictures

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
before the wedding than after the ceremony

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
you do a

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
first quote unquote first look photograph

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
that's supposed to take place of

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
the photos that you would get

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
when the bride is first walking down the aisle

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
so it's a very

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
stage thing where Dan's back

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
is to me and I walk up and they're like

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
alright Dan turn around

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
like before the wedding here's your

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
bride and then there are a bunch of people

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
taking pictures of it

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
but during that Dan was like

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
so are you gonna read your vows

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
are you memorized

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
and I was like oh I

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I knew I'd forgotten something

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
have not done that yet

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
I was very focused on

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
all the other details of the wedding

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
and I also thought that I was going to be like

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
struck by some inspiration

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
for my vows which I guess never happened

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I promise to dinosaur you

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
to

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
like there would be some news item that would come through

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
you will be my big elephant

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
cause we were at the natural

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
history museum and there were dinosaurs and elephants

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
everywhere

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
the cat that fought off that dog

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
that tried to kill that child

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
you can see it right now on YouTube

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I promise to not do that to you

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
or to do that for you

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
alright anyways

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
yeah we got married it was fun

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
you thought you were usual suspects or wedding vows

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
yes

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
your vows were great and it was good

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
also because I had done

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
that other thing which is basically vows

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I sang

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
the karaoke version of I'll stand by you

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
while my bridesmaids did a choreographed dance

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
holding

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
giant cardboard heads of Dan's face

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
it was

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
fine

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
that's good

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
yeah

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
and at our final rehearsal

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Dan was texting me

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
and I wasn't answering his text because I was singing

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I'll stand by you and imagining

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
this whole thing and he got very

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
mad at me cause I wasn't returning his

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
text and I couldn't

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
it's pretty ironic to not respond to someone

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
because you're too busy singing I'll stand by you

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
for them

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
alright

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
well the only thing left to do

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
is to bring up Spencer Crittenden

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
thank you thank you very much

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
lovely applause and it made me

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
feel eight times more self

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
estimatious

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
this will make you feel self-estimatious

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
yeah Spencer had his hair down

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
at the wedding and you look like a

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
fucking romance novel cover

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I looked like maybe I might have

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
had a cover to something like 25

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
years ago or something

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
definitely past my prime

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
romance novel coverman

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
but I you know I also

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
got some interesting text from Rob

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Schrab earlier today

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I missed that

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
yeah I did as well

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
we'll almost fill you in

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
because this morning

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I got a text from Rob Schrab

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I mean this afternoon

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
have you seen all that jazz

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I also got that

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
yeah yeah

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
that's so rude he texted

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
I thought we were having a moment

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
you said no

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
of course not that's fucking

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
yeah no

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
he responds it's a Bob Fosse

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
biopic that Bob Fosse

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
wrote and directed

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
to which I responded is it good

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
and he said yeah

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Harmon should make a movie like that

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
he's nothing if not

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
consistent

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
did he go on to tell you

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
no I said

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
you should tell him that and then he didn't respond

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
I'd like to read my

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
text conversation with Rob Schrab

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
this is crazy he knew we had

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
the show tonight so he like

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
was like I will be part of this show now

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
maybe or maybe he

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
like texted Spencer sincerely

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Spencer said tell Dan

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
and then he texted me

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
what time did he text you

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
oh mine was 107

oh damn

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
let's find this

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
cause we can piece a whole story together

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I'm gonna read

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
this is just like serial

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Rob says

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
that was no payphone

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
mine was at 12.52pm

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
mine is at 107pm

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
he was just that excited by the

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
my Rob texts me

have you ever seen all that jazz

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I say

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
yeah but not for a super long

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
time and maybe not all the way through

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
everyone's responding sincerely and he's just

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
eating it up

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
he's just trying to get to

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
all that jazz

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Rob says it's a Bob Fosse biopic

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
that Bob Fosse wrote

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
and directed

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
and I said yep I'm familiar

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and then Rob says

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Harmon should make a movie like that

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and I said yeah I think he could

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
write a really funny musical

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
and then Rob says you could call it

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
all that jazz

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
but he never told you all that jazz

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
no

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
what lines is he trying

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
what is he doing

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
because he was last

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
so by then

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
maybe

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
he was already strangling her

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
that's more serial

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
what

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
oh that's more serial

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
got it yeah yeah yeah

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
wow I'm really confused

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
this is this new thing I feel left out

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
that I didn't get a text asking

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
if I've seen all that jazz

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
we can only hope

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I feel embarrassed by how

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
connected I felt to Rob during that

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
conversation because I had

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
actually written a text and then deleted it

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
because I was like this is too much

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
actually when I saw Book of Mormon

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I thought Dan would write a really great musical

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
it's so good that you're bringing this up

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
and we should all encourage him to write a musical

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
yeah jazz sounds like jazz

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I think his online persona

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
came out of the computer killed the real Rob

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
and is now

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
fucking walking around talking to us

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
and eating food and stuff

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
it's like virtuosity

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
he was at your wedding

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
his avatar

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Schrab was at my wedding

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
he was my best man

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
and Schrab before as we're about to walk down the aisle

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
he's still holding

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
the best man's supposed to hold

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
like the rings and stuff

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
he not only has both

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
like ring boxes

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
from the ring store

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I've never been married before

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I don't know what he's supposed to do

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
but I know he's doing it wrong

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
he's going like what do I do

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
he's holding a bag from a ring store

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
with just a bunch of shit in it

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I'm like

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
give me that

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
put the rings in your pocket

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
we had had a rehearsal

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
but then during the wedding Rob

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I was like here in that

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
and had the two boxes

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
and you don't know

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
it's like why don't you know

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
it's a wedding

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
you can plan it

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
you can rehearse it

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
it was very charming, very Rob

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
it was a really great wedding

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I had a great time that night

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Spencer you disappeared

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
anytime I go to a party

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I kind of leave early

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
so I didn't stay too long

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
did you stay through the violence?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
are you fucking kidding me

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
okay what were the vows?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Dan's

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Dan's came second

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
they did

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
they were about ghost fighting

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
and fighting as a ghost

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I did vow that

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
if I die before Aaron I will protect her

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
with ghost powers

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
that was one of my many

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
awesomely written vows

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
and then if it got

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
too weird for her I would allow her

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I would go away

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I would not haunt her second husband

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I would just wait for her to die

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
but then her second husband should fuck off

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
because

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
our love is eternal

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
you really killed at our wedding

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
both you guys did

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I was very moved

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
by your vows

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
also the whole experience of walking down

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
an aisle

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and seeing all these people you haven't seen in a long time

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
and also the bride is hidden

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
before

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
the wedding

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
you don't know who she's going to be

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
hanging up upstairs

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
while you were talking to our friend

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
so walking down the aisle was this very weird

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
wizard of Oz moment

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
and you were there

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
it didn't really stick out

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I get to walk around

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
you hung out

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
you were saying hi to people in line

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
it seems a little unfair

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
the groom gets to just walk around

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
get married

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
see you want to get married

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
and meanwhile I was googling vows

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
literally googling

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
vow ideas

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I thought that

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
one more thing about the wedding

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
who cares except us

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I thought

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I anticipated that I would be unable to say

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
my vows because I thought that would be the height of the emotional

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
point

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
because I was killing

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
and I was like this is great I'm killing

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
no

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
once I was doing the vows

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
it wasn't that hard to get through

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
the peak of the emotion

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
for me was when you were walking down

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
the aisle and because our friend

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Matt Gorely was singing Daniel Johnston's

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
true love will find you in the end

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
everything was

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
two century overload

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
anyways that was nice

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I got it all out of my system then

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Jesus Christ

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
and then the rest

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
was like I killed as you said

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
alright I have a quick

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I have a very obvious question

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
do things feel different

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I feel like

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
now I finally get to nail it

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
because I feel like I was

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
we were saving ourselves

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I feel like I was a bad

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
being a

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
single guy

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I don't know I feel like

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I feel like this makes more sense

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
you know

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
yeah

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
yeah

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
that resonates with me emotionally

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and also you want to tell them about

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
the thing that happened

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
in our sleep even unconsciously

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
sure

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
yeah this week

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
you

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
and maybe

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
you can attest to this how long were you guys

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
engaged before you got married

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
we just got married

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
we went

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
to the pit

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
we went to the pit and got married and called my parents

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and were like hey I'm married do you want to meet my wife

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
they said yes

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
which is great

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
that sounds great

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I think that like the

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
with us like with this engagement

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
period and I'll just speak for myself

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
like everything was like

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
alright we're playing this

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
this football game

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
he's passing the ball the certain way

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I don't know why I wanted to do

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
football

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
yeah why would you pick the thing you know nothing about

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
side note I had

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
45 seconds today where I thought I really like soccer

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
was it the only 45 seconds

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
where a goal was scored during the game

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
it was this moment where

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Shakira is singing

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and I love Shakira

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
the world

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
soccer world football was on and the teams

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
are all soft drinks

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
and one guy

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
this sounds like a dream you had

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and my dad was

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
naked from the waist down

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
um

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
they were playing

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
that's your go to for what your dreams are like

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
because it's okay because it was a dream

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
but it's also upsetting

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
um

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I actually do have a lot of drinks where my dad's like

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Donald Duck

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
uh

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Anywho

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
no no anywho

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
no no rest of the night

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
rest of the night is questions and answers

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
do you not have those dreams where I like someone

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
where my dad's dick is no

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
but I've never dreamt of my dad's

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
dick

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I've only fanned sorry

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
sorry

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
go ahead

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
goblin a la approves

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
um

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I had a dream that Michael Jordan was trying to kill me

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
go ahead though

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
it's not important but there were

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I turned on the television

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
and uh soccer

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
was on and

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
the ball was going so fast

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
and then someone

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
like they kicked the ball

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and then you know they pretend to be hurt all the time

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
and this guy just fell back on his back

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
and I was like oh

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
and then everybody on his team was like oh no

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
and I was like this is really

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
interesting and crazy

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
but then for like the next 30 seconds I was like

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
no no no

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
boring

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I will say this to go back to an earlier question you had

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
we got married and then she was like

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I've never got proposed to

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
and so randomly a couple years later I proposed to her

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
after we've been married

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
good what did you do

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
for your proposal

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
we were in Montauk

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
we were

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
just staying at a hotel

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
vacation that weekend and it was at night

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
and we were playing video games

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and I was like hey let's go for a walk at the beach

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
and she was like it's kind of cold

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
and I was like no let's go for a walk

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
on the fucking beach

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
and so I forced her out

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
and it was kind of cold

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and I was like will you marry me

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
can we go back inside

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I heard you did bro

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
come on

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
there was a horrifying

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
crab there

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
it was the worst thing I've ever seen

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
for the size or just ugly

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
it was ugly and big

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
and like sideways walking

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
like

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
it was a nightmare thing

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
it was the crab of your new life together

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
it will not always

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
look pretty but it will

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
be efficient and protected

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and it has a shell

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
I was talking Erin about

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I'm telling you tell them the story

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
because if I tell it it's not fun

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
about what I apparently

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
did in my sleep

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
right so

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
this last week

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
a few nights ago

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I was leading up to just saying that

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
during the engagement

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
being married feels less stressful

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
to me it feels like

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
well yeah we bought the house

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and now here we are

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
it's falling apart but

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
made my bed

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
lock and load

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
lock and load

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
anyway a few nights ago

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Dan talks in his sleep pretty frequently

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
and a few nights ago

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
was farting in his sleep

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
and there were

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
because and I'll just help

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
clean this up

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
maybe you are a noble knight

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I think everyone knows why people fart

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
but explain

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
but more so for me because

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
that's the wedding approach

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
there was a certain point where I was like

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'm not going to lose anymore weight by our wedding

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I'm going to look like a fat piece of shit in our photos

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
so I just started eating a lot of ice cream

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
and I think

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I may be lactose intolerant

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
every day

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
for their

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I lost 30 pounds in 30 days

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
and at some point I was like fuck it

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
where

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Spencer was he having you get ice cream

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
well not ice cream

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
but just peanut butter

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
and just anything on a corn cob

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
butter shower

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I would have a shower brought him with butter

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I'm not mad about you eating ice cream

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
it's just hilarious

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
based on like you're coming home

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
and me saying I really worked hard today

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I was like cool cool cool me too

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I didn't say I never said me too

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I just was like cool cool

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
but meanwhile you were eating ice cream

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
ice cream the horror

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
of foods

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
so this is why you were farting in your sleep

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
so Dan has

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
farted in his sleep before

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and has woken himself up

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
and sometimes has

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
there have been a couple occasions

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
where he's farted in his sleep

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
and like what?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
what come on

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
come on

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
can we let's pull it together

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
not an exaggeration

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
in his sleep he talks to me like

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I'm his second maid on a submarine

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and I

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
am getting water in the boat

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
and he's like let's

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
be professional

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
water in the boat

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
yeah

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
but a few nights ago

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Dan I think the

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
most

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
I'm going to say

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
majestic

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
but not in a way that I think

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
in a the grossest

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
the most like

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
triumphant beginning of a symphony

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
by Beethoven

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
that's all horns fart

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
happened for a very

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
long comical time

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I was awake

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and Dan was asleep

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and it was it was absurd

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
there were highs and lows

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
there were like emotional like

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
oh god will they

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
oh okay good they're safe

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
in this

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
fart and I knew that Dan was going to

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
wake up that fart sounds like it had

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
more pluck than teen wolf

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
yeah

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
absolutely

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
it was a steel magnolia's fart

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
at the end of it

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I was just

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
looking at him because I knew he would

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
wake up and he didn't open his eyes

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and just said husband

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
and that is that story

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
if I told that story

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
it would be like what are you

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
bragging about

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
yeah I don't know

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
husband

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
husband

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I'm assuming that was shame based

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
like I was like

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
maybe in my dream I was looking at myself

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
farting I was yelling at myself

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
you had a great tact

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
to that fart

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
you lost 30 pounds in 30 days

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
that's crazy

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
kind of yeah

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I'm keeping them a secret somewhere

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
what did you do

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I did

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I did a

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
doctor prescribed

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
it's kind of embarrassing but I guess it worked out

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
you don't have to talk about it I was just curious

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
no it's fine

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I ate a bunch of tapeworms

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
and then stared at pictures of

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Rebecca Gayheart from 1995

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
because that's what they had

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
no I went to a doctor

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and prescribed this diet which is basically

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
100 calories a day

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
what?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
it's starvation

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
you don't have to do it women

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
you don't have to

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I loved her

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
and never asked for any of this

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
and

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
got fat to inspire her

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
hoping she would catch on

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
we're getting married

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
we can be fatter than ever

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
a lot of it was like that diet

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
sounds crazy no one could ever do that

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I should see if I could do that

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
so yeah

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I think technically I lost

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
because I was losing weight because I was exercising

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
a lot before

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
the doctor prescribed

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
this mattering of applause in this room

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
is very confusing

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
there's so many factions of people

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
there's the lady that thinks

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
that if I talk to lesbians about their boobs

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
like the prisoner

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
is happening

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
but she's quiet well you're talking about losing 30 pounds

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
the exercise freaks in the back

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
exercise is the way to go

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I think also

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
30 pounds sounds like

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
a lot

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I'm 5'10 so like 30 pounds on me

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
like isn't as crazy

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
30 pounds is a lot

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
500 calories a day

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
what did you eat like what did it look like

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
can I ask I don't know if it's interesting

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I'm so curious

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I didn't do it for the full time

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
but like my day was

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
an apple

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
and then like

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
a half a chicken breast

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and vegetables

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
the main thing was like having no additives

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
and no

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
that was kind of the

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
thing

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
you weren't allowed to wear oil based makeup

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
like the doctor that prescribed it

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
it was a whole thing

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
also the doctor who prescribed it

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
sounded exactly like Werner Herzog

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
which was

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
a thing

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
this is not something

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
to take lightly

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I will give you this

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
cautiously

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
you will look good

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
but at what cost

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I was into it because over the last year

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I put on weight that I didn't

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
want which is usually the case

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
yeah I just wanted to

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
lose it quickly

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
but no matter what you're shaped like

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
you're a beautiful human being and you shouldn't let people convince you

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
or worse yourself convince you

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
the fact that you look how you look

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
did I get her back

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
yeah you got her back

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
your body does not define you

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
am I getting this right

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I see pictures of myself

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and I'm skinny or fat and I'm like

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I wasn't happy back then either

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
the shape of your body

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
is a lot like money

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
you'd be surprised how miserable you can be

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
looking really good

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
and how happy you can be being really fat

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
however you look

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
how you look it's how you want to look

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
you look that way because you want to look that way

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
it's over my threshold

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
of feeling comfortable

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I mean we both get there

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
but you and I are going to be

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
we're going to take a journey together

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
where we're like

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
we're going to

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
our favorite pastime is never going to be hiking

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I'm not ruling it out

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
but you and I are at our best

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
when we are watching a movie

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
and there's probably some ice cream

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
involved

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I don't want to

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
hinge our happiness

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
on how we look

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I want us to be happy

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
it's a rollercoaster

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I think from where you're sitting

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
this diet that I did

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
also I did not lose 30 pounds

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
on the diet

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
you told me at one point that you lost 30 pounds

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I was going by you

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I was talking about

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
when I had started exercising

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
really hard

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
for like two months I was exercising so much

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
and I just

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I just lost

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I didn't lose a lot of weight

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
and then I went to Berner Herzog

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
and he said you are healthy enough

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
if you want to make this commitment

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
there is

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
an agreement you must make

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
he gave me a physical

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
and during the physical which was terrifying

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I kept on asking him which I've never done

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
with a doctor before like

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
safe

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
safe

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
it is a strange word

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
capable of so much

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
damage

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I will not play the recording

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Nazi Germany was safe

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
for the Nazis

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
this penguin

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
stomach is safe

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
not for herring

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
but for the penguin

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
he did say several times

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
oh so tall

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
that does sound like a Nazi

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
so tall

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
your skeleton

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
so elongated

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
so

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
fireplace mental worthy

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
what what

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I was asking

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
just because I stress a lot

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
about what I eat

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
and I feel bad

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
if I don't eat well

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and it's been like this since I was probably 14

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I've worried about how much I weigh

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
since then

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
till today all the time

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
were your parents stressed out about your

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
no they didn't

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
which is good they shouldn't

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
where do you think that came from when you were 14

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I don't know but I remember eating fried chicken once

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
and being like I am so horrible

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
and it's still like that

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
and I love eating

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
so if I eat something bad

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I get like really

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I feel really really horrible about it

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
and then it's like

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
it's just me it's on myself

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
it's not nobody else

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
that has put any of this pressure on me

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I can't remember who it was

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
it was like some writer or something that mentioned

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
running into you

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
and I ran into Camille

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
and I was talking to him for a while

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
but he was like coming out of the gym

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and I was really distracted

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
by his

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
immense upper body

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
yeah you look great

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
that's the nicest thing I've ever heard

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
like you were just talking to him

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
like ah it's so good to see you

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
ah I'm coming

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
alright we'll deal with that in a second

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
ok

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
bit from column A bit from column B

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I tried to launch into my Camille

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I can't

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I can't

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I can't talk like Camille

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I always have to go to the word cunt

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I can't do that

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I can't

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
can you talk like Camille

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I can't

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
you are

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
they were

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
distracted by how overwhelmingly

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
powerful

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
and sexy your body was

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
backed away from it

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
affected and disturbed

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
that's the effect I'm going for

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
there is one day when you came to

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Nerdmelt

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
before a Harmontown show

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
where everyone was like whoa

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
what

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
you're fine

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I know I'm fine

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
but it's just

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
people don't

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
we think about these things we think about

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
ourselves

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
but I think we don't tend to say

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
well you know Camille could really

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
beef up

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
nobody cares

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
but then when you come in

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and your arms are

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
large and you've got that neon

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
muscle T

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
neon muscle T

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
and there's a moment

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I was like wow

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Spencer how do you feel about your body

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
oh it's terrible

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
it's a real train wreck

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
over here

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I get up and I survey the damage

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
and I'm like well

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
we better get to work

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
but not to work fixing it

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
to work doing my job

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
and then I get home from work and I'm tired

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I wonder how to tell people

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I know for sure

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
that people in the world are supposed to

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
they're supposed to

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
hold themselves to a different standard

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
they're holding themselves physically

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
for sure but at the same time

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
there's also a total acknowledgement

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
of the fact that we're a disgusting nation

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
that we are definitely

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
we should

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
keep ourselves healthy and stuff

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
that's a totally different thing from being sexy

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
like our standards

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
of what we look like and whether or not

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
we're beautiful people

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
has totally different from whether or not

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
you are happy in yourself

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
and whether you feel good

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I know I'm never

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I think I'm just generally obsessed

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I'm just always conscious of like

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I look like a piece of shit

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I'm like a piece of garbage

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
but then there's moments where I'm like

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
oh I really look like a piece of shit

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
I look like a piece of shit

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
it's never healthy

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
it never comes from a good place

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
body dysmorphia what's up

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
yeah

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
with the me losing

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
weight

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
like it really wasn't even

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
related to the wedding it just seemed

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
like a

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
good time to do it

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and I totally agree with you

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
and I'm not

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I'm not aspiring to

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
be like super

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
thin because I don't think I'm comfortable

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
super thin

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I just wanted to feel

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
like I don't know

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
like myself again

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
like a sexy piece of shit

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
alright yeah we did it

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
that's what we are two sexy pieces of shit

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
we got married together forever

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
alright

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Spencer do you think

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
what do you think

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I never know what's going on with you

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I just you know

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I don't know what you're saying man

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I don't know what you're trying to allege here

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
it's a lot to process

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
do you want to play D&D

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I always want to play D&D

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
should I get it out like I am

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
get it out

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I am

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
for the best man gift I guess it's a tradition

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
you get your best man gift and I get Rob a Segway

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
because he's directing a lot of

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
community episodes so I got him a Segway

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
so he could roll around the

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
the lot

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Spencer took a day and he made it look like

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Skutt the disposable assassin

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
aww

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
so Rob has like a little yellow robot

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
thing

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
now he can like roll around and write us all weird

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
texts about

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
so Rob's resting face is a Segway face

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
what do you mean

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
no I expected

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
everyone on stage to be like yes yes

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
no I mean like Rob's resting face

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
oh yeah he's got Segway

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
he always looks like he's on a Segway

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
yeah

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I'm Swiss but like I know this is stupid

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
yeah

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
slightly judgmental better than you

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
yeah yeah

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
to me Rob Schrab always looks like

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
he's reacting to someone unseen

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
who's disapproving of him so

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
that's almost the complete opposite of what

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
you guys are talking about like he's just always like

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
he's shaking his head like someone

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
anytime you walk into a room

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
no I'm saying it's defensive like that Segway face is defensive

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
it's like I know that you've attacked me and I'm going

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
to stand by my

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Segway

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Segway

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
so I was so jealous of his

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
because I wrote around on his I got my own

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
you guys are racing it

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
so I don't have a car

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
but I have a Segway

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Segway's are awesome

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
I've written one once and I had a great time

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
do you write it on a tour

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
yeah kind of I was in Miami

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
the worst place in America

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
no one who's been there

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
can disagree with me

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
but they have all those

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
shootings in all those clubs

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I mean it's got a lot going for it

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Segway's are like

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
rolling luggage to me it's the thing

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
that on paper it's like this is perfect

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
this is what everyone needs but then you look

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
at it and you're like

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I can't cross that threshold

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
rolling luggage

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
it's just like you look at it and you're like

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I can't cross that threshold

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
what is it like when you look at it

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
you're just like I mean

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
you know you see

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
something and it's like it's like a fanny

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
pack you know you just look at it and you're

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
like yeah it's like you can't

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
you get it you get it

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
completely but you're not going there

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
you know you sound like Margaret

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Joe

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I'm not going there

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
she's not it's a fanny pack

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I agree with you

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
walk around the witch

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
yeah well I mean I walk around

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
sure I love it

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I've traveled with you

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
and I walk a lot

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
yeah you do we all do

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
you seem uncomfortable when you're carrying

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
your bag Dan also has a thing

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
against rolling luggage

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I have a bag that I call 360

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
you get me a bag that has

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
it's a double bag and then it

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
transforms into a rolly

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
and I slowly started just

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
rolling with it

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
why don't you like rolling luggage

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
same as Spencer I looked at it

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
and I was like yeah

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
you're not going to cross that threshold

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
it's the only way to describe it

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
you get it

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
that makes you like the cool kid in high school

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
that makes fun of the kid with a rolling bag

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
those kids were

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
fucking lame

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
that's what it comes from

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
you see those kids and you kick their backpacks

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
because it's like fuck you

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
but in your mid 20's

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
might not be comfortable

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
well that's why I don't kick them anymore

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I just don't partake

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
when you travel on a plane

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
you have to have a rolling luggage

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
you do not

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
you do not

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
it really makes your life so much easier

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
agreed

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
well I don't know if that's true

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
it makes your life easier during certain

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
specific stretches

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
but then you're exchanging that

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
when you're looking at yourself in the mirror

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and you're just

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
it's fun

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
also if you're going down a ramp

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
you can let it go and you can be like

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
who's going to get there first

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
you can play the who's going to get there first game

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
you know that fun

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
airport game

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
thanks for making new character sheets

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
you are committed to this

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
what

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
what is that

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
thank you that's a nice compliment

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
you're welcome

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I just figured out how to react to that just then

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I think if you could travel

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
with just a backpack you'd be the ultimate person

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
which is what I try to do

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
if I'm going to Miami for the weekend

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I'll just put a couple underwear in a backpack

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
and then I'm just like

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
they go are you checking

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I'm like what is anyone talking to me about anything for

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I got my shit on my back

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
no one can fuck with me ever

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
but then you say to your partner like where's the toothbrush

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and where's the prowess

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
where's my underwear

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
those don't fit in a backpack though

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I mean it's like pants that don't fit in a backpack

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
and I don't talk like that

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and you married me

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
and if that's how

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
you married a monster and that makes you worse

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
than a monster

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
you're like the rancor keeper and return to the Jedi

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
like the rancor

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
it was a grover

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
it was a grover voice

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
what happened to my character

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
why is Elmo so popular

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Elmo's a baby

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Elmo's a baby

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
he's certainly not intelligent

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
he has a lot of problems understanding

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
very basic concepts I've noticed

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Elmo's character is

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
literally a baby

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
yeah I know

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
that explains why he's so dumb

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
does this show have any value

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
for anybody anymore

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
it used to be like

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
well it was a learning show for kids

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and it

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
differentiated with the existing class system

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
because the kids lived on the street

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Sesame Street

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
the idea was

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
it was a street

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
it was like brownstone steps

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
and stuff it was like oh guess what

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
this is where you live

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
it was multi-ethnic and it was like revolutionary

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
teaching in a read

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
cut to Elmo that's some bullshit

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
that show got

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
caucasized

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I'll tell you that

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
what turned into bullshit

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
caucasized? yeah I'll figure it out later

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I'll write a blog about it

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I'll hashtag it

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
what does caucasized mean

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
look it up

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
it's like whitewash

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
don't look it up I made it up

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
it means whitewash

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
did you grow up with Sesame Street?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
nope see he's fine

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
yeah we didn't get Sesame Street

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
did you have an equivalent?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
was there like an educational Pakistani show that was

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
no

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
but there was a guy who would teach

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
you how to draw

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
should live next door

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
yeah

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
yeah he'd live next door

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I'd go over to his house

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
teach me how to draw

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
my parents hated him

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
no before I went

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
to school every day

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
they would show one cartoon

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
which was like Tom and Jerry or something

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
and there would be a guy who would teach you how to draw

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
and he would pronounce the colors wrong

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
like instead of yellow

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
he would call it yulo

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and then kids would send in drawings

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
and he would just fucking rip them apart

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
why

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
that was on Sesame Street

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
why haven't we been talking about this

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
for six years

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
what did you talk about?

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
what were his critiques

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
of the kids drawing?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
like very high level

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
but there's no balance

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
there's no perspective

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
the colors are all over the place

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
and it's like a five year old drill

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
sent it in

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
and he's like and this yulo over here

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
no sense

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
that sounds so good

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
so I would watch it

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and I loved watching it

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
when I was a kid I wanted to be a cartoonist

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
but I was never good at it

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
and I'll tell you the day I quit

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
there was a girl I had a crush on

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
this was the fifth grade

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
so the art teachers really liked me

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
and it was like if your drawing got an A

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
they would post it up outside the classroom

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
and I would always get an A because I was a good kid

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
but I couldn't draw so it would be all these beautiful drawings

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
and everyone would be like why is that there

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
oh it's Kamel he's a good kid

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
but one time

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
we had to draw our own hand

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and I couldn't get it right I erased it

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
and I drew it and I erased it and I drew it

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and then finally at the end of class I went up to my teacher

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
to show it like is this good

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
and it was her and Sana Raza

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
the girl I had a crush on in fifth grade

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and they both looked at this drawing

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
and they laughed and then they caught themselves

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
like they felt really bad for it

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
they were like haha oh

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
really really horrible

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
and that was the day

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I never spoke to Sana Raza again

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
and I decided I wouldn't be an artist

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I was really bad

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
it's good

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Sana Raza

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Sana Raza

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
you were born with a stencil

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
what do you mean

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I mean on your body

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
she's still giving you

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
shit for not drawing a hand right

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
all these years later

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
she's like why couldn't you just draw

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
a good hand

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
don't Sana Raza me

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I would

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
aww

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I was just bad at it

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I had a comic strip I would draw called Mr. Karate

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I was wondering what your main

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
what could you explain the hero of that

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Mr. Karate

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
he was a guy he knew Karate

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
he had no choice

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
his name was Mr. Karate

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
and

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
he would had a little radio

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and he would go and then

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
kick people's asses

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
he had a little radio

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
he would tune into the police scanner

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
oh it was a two way radio

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
it was a

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I just knew I could draw a box

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
so the radio was a box

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
and I could draw this one guy in profile

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
so his fights were always in profile

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
and I would draw

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
a bandana

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
who were the villains

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
just

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
like thieves and stuff

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
nothing too high level

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
how old were you

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
when you were drawing Mr. Karate

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
I probably quit

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I was probably like

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
11 or something 12

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
too old I think to

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
have dreams

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
anyway I still can't draw

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
all I could draw is a ninja turtle

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I can draw in Spectre Gadget

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Pac-Man and Garfield

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I could do Pac-Man

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
not like I can

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I bet not

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
we're talking circles

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
yeah Pac-Man the cartoon

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
nevermind it's not important

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
oh

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
alright we have five minutes

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
oh well we started 15 minutes

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
late so we really have 20 minutes

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
oh shit

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
these people have been waiting their whole lives for tonight

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
so we have 23 years

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
is that when they're dying

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
oh no that's when they were born

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
sorry math is no good

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
let's get it started right

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
right

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
are we getting the musical music

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
sounds like

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
shit

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
atmospheric

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
wow this must be great as a video podcast

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
oh fuck

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000

alive

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
alive

feel yourself

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
slip

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
you no longer crave

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
cigarettes or sauces

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
cigarettes and sauces

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
you

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
highly addictive sauces

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
are no longer a part of your life

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
visual eyes

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
can mail in your living room

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I'm going to stand up for myself

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
at work tomorrow

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
people

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
are going to remember

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
my name

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
you ever hear those tapes

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
and they're just making you want to kill yourself

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
because you're like holy shit this can be an ambition

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I'm going to affect people

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
people can see

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
you

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
alright here we go

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
people know who you are

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I have a right

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
to breeze

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
you may dungeon master

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I mean that's so much better isn't it

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
see

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
this is just going to be a bummer

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
when we last met

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
our heroes had just returned

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
from underground finding themselves

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
in an overgrown tomb

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
after teaming up with a ghost

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
named Lil Baskins the gang

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
trekked underground in pitch darkness

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
along the ghost way and then

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
slaughtered a pair of rhinoceri

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
for them their pelts

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
but after exiting the ghost way

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
our gang was waylaid by a

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
constructed ambush

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
two gnolls swearing vengeance

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
for their fallen packmate

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
summoned skeletons and began to attack

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
but dignity quickly stymied the onslaught

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
with some well placed diplomacy

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
after talking down

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
the furry monsters

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Sharpie got to the bottom of their pain

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
and after a fierce negotiation

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
sold an ancient and priceless artifact

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
to the gnolls for 9000 gold

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
the gnolls slipped away

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
with the mystical artifact

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
leaving our heroes alone in the cold

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
but where would they go

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
what would they do

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
and how would they keep from freezing to death

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
find out now

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
on an all new Harmontown

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I examine my surroundings

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I can examine my surroundings

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
you are allowed

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
to examine your surroundings

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
it's true it's true

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
you stand in a small graveyard in the woods

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
vines and kudzu coat the gravestones

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
and overtake the gates and walls

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
of the graveyard

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
past the trees and the forest to the north

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
are the bone white faces

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
of the northern mountains

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
the cold cuts through your rags like nothing

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
stripping warmth from your flesh

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
like the chill of the grave

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
it's freezing

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
darkness is falling

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
we have our cloaks of resistance

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
of all that crap right

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
they're not seeing you

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
to feel this cold

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
this is colder cold than you've ever killed

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
little baskets

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
find it so much colder out here than you

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
for the glow of your I told you so

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
it's just almost as if

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I anticipated this might happen

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
and wanted to warn against

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
you're doing the cabbage patch

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
on the end zone of our deaths

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
but I told you so right

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
yeah now we're dying

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
little little baskets

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
why is it so cold

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
because it's the north

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
sorry it's the north

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
why did you know it was going to be cold

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
just because it was

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
well I'm a guide I should know stuff like that

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
if there's going to be traffic or

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
can you can you guide us to

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
a less cold place

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
well not if the place you're going

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
that I'm guiding you to is in a

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
colder place no okay can we

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000

what what what can we do

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I don't know I mean you could probably

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
find someone who's selling pelts maybe

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
if there's any local

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
you know furriers

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
or you could hunt them

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
yourself I mean there's animals

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
they exist

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
we should go hunting yeah let's

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
go hunting

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
are you wearing a pelt I'm sorry

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I can't see no I'm a

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I'm a dead ghost

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
that's the worst kind

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
got it

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
what kind of animals are about

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
you know just squirrels

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
and woodland creatures

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
are there are there

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
woodland creatures such as bears

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
uh you know they're

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
hibernating at this time of year really

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
oh we could get them while they're sleeping

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
that's very true

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
is there a we can we

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
head towards our cave or we know they're

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
bear sleeping

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I don't think no you don't just know

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
if caves nearby with bears sleeping them

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
exist you can try and look for such a cave

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I suppose I thought you were a guide

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I'm a guide I'm not

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
a cave spelunker

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
we're gonna find a cave

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
and build a fire and live

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and just live our life

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
and possibly repopulate society

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
wait we have to form

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
a new alphabet a new history

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I'm on board

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
let's do we can have a new religion

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I have a ring of thick skin

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I'm assuming that's no you don't

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
he might

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
if you do it just increases

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
your armor class

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
okay so I figured

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I have an armulet of autumn I can't make

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
warm

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
well it it

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
currently is autumn so you could just

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
make it now

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Avenger

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
hey

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
fly into the winter sky

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and see if you can spy

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
a cavern

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
an opening we're looking for shelter

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
cave

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
alright let's do it

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
he does that

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
and he goes around in the air

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
and what he sees

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
is a cave

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
he comes down and tells you oh man

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
the trees they stop

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
there's this cave where they stop

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
fucking great

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
yeah let's do it

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
alright we're going to the cave

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
he points in the direction

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
with his little claw

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
how does he pull his wing

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000

can I do that

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I take a mental picture

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
can he give a thumbs up with his wing

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
no he doesn't have thumbs

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000

I mean

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
you know familiars are generally

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
animals that are much more intelligent

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
than they're in mundane counterparts

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
he uh

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
acceptable deeper crack

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
in a large rock

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
and you throw it into the cave and it illuminates

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
a larger space within that kind of

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
takes a turn to the right

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
grime you know I did my best

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
yeah you see

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
your stone off maybe a couple feet

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
away from them and it's just kind

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
of lurking

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
a bear starts stirring one of

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
them does

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
are we gonna kill these bears

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I guess we have

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
for goodness

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I take my

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
sword

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
are their necks near each other

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
you want to do one swipe

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
two bear heads

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
no they're kind of like

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
sleeping past each other

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
like they're head to foot of each other

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
oh they're 69ing

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
yeah sure it's more like

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
11ing

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
are they scissoring

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
that's not a thing

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
bears don't scissor

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
you have to be careful to get

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
the whole head off in one because it can't make any sound

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
otherwise it's gonna wake the other one up

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
you know the old expression

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
let sleeping beheaded

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
bears

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
lie

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
no time at all

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
behead them quickly and silently

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
they'll wake up

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I don't know why it's a thing it's not catchy at all

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
it kind of tapers off

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I'm going to

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
with my

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
rope

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
oh no

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I think you just cut the head off

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
with the sword

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
well I'm just thinking that if I tie

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
their necks

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
together I can prevent against the other one

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
but once you cut the ones head off

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
it's free again because

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
you see what I'm saying

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
no but if I tie both of their necks down while they're sleeping to

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
rocks

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
but why don't you just kill them

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
it makes sense

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
but I will take

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
can I cut with two hands

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
how ambidextrous am I

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I mean not super ambidextrous

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
you're going for both at the same time

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I feel like this is folly

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
they're too far away

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
the way their necks are positioned

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
you'd have to be really stretching in both directions

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
okay well how about this

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
I'm going to go to the

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
more Walter Math out looking one

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I'll go to the Jack Lemon

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
great I'll take the carrot

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
top

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
is there a carrot top bear

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
let's each take a bear

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
is there a carrot top bear

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
no there's not any bears that remind

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
me of historical bears

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
like carrot tops

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
why don't you just be ready

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
in case something happens

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
let's take a bear how many bears are there

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
there's two bears

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I'll supervise yeah

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
sorry I didn't hear there were two bears

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
don't supervise you're going to security guard

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
okay so I go to

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
the grumpier looking bear

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I'm going to hold up my sword

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Chris do you want to

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
yeah I mean I have a shortbow

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I have a ribbon dagger I have a poison dagger

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
what do I use I should use a poison dagger

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
and just

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
cut the head off

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
or in his eye

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
no into his brain

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
all right

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
maybe

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
what do you think what do you

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
think Sharpie you're supervising this

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
I think these bears are

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
going to die

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
and I cast bear light

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
no don't wake him up

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
what are you doing I don't want to wake him up

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
you cast bear light

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
why are you waking him up it's a light

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
only detectable by bears

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
it wakes him up

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
why I'm kidding

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I'm kidding

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
it's a mage bit

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
I won't wake up

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
these bears I'm kidding

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
you guys should have seen your faces

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
just kill the bears

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
just kill them kill them with your

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
edged weapons all right so I got

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
my poison dagger at the bear's throat

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
and she's got her sword at the bear's throat

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
you count to three yeah okay

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
well their throats are like on the ground

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
yeah well done

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
no like up against the ground

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
like you can't have your

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
you can't have your blade up against their throats

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
why not why can't we just punch down

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
because that'd be wedging

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
between the throat and dirt

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
like that'd be like if I slit a dagger

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
just across your throat

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
no it's better because there's a neck

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
on the ground we can just we can

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
punch down by the

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
neck

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
the sides of the neck meat that's not going to kill anything

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
uh what

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
well I if you

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
can I get someone from the audience

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
to lay down face

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
down

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
yeah face down

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
yeah alright so then I'm going to

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
cut his neck like this

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
that's not the throat that's the neck

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
okay you can do that

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I just want to cut off a head

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
okay sure thank you sir thank you

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
you can do that sorry it's just

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
oh the old neck versus throat debate

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
they're different

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
alright I have my

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
also the neck

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
goes all the way around

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
it sure does and the throat is a very

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
specific part of the neck

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
alright we put it to their necks

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
okay great thank you

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Jesus this fucking guide

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I just think it has to make sense

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
you guys said throat man

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
well maybe we want to get to the throat

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
from the long way

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
well you could do that definitely

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
yeah we'll start at the neck and get

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
to the throat

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
alright okay so you count to three

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Sharpie

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
bear like no

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
no no there's no such

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
spell you have nothing to worry about

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
there's no such spell are you yelling that

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
count to three could wake the bear up

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
you want me to cut to three are you

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
do you know ask her

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
on certain parts of town you might

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
I will drop a handkerchief what do you want

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000

count to three

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I didn't get a chance to have a good time

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
we're always facing off of enemies

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
that are bigger than us and there's

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
some sleeping bears we're adorable

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
it's a little sad

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
yeah I say if we can't do this

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
and have a little fun alright one

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
wait hold on hold on

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
now I was standing up and yelling at you

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
let me get back to my dagger

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
on the neck

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000

throat yeah who gives a shit

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
the dorsal surface of the

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
neck

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
so bears don't sleep on our faces

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
that's true

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
can't argue that

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
but none of them hibernate

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
one

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
two

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I get the habit I'm trying to lose

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
you find a sleeping bear

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
rather easily

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
or easy to slaughter

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
oh well that's sad

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
oh what did you

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
now I feel bad about it

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
they're both they're dead

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
oh yeah

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
gurgling

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
while struggling to cuddle you

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
while

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
while looking for her cubs

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
the

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
exsanguinated mammals

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
I don't what do you expect

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
you just you slid

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
sleeping bears throats

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
I cut the head and I

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
take the head off

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
and I throw it up in the air and get under it

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
so it lands on my own head like a crown

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
it it

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
oh wait

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
it does that

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
bear killer

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
let's get warm

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
that's your big line

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
after killing the bear

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
let's get warm

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
things are heating up

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
alright well

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
well okay so do we know how to

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
skin a bear

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I'm just gonna can I just go for it

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I'm just gonna cut off the

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
like an apple

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
the skin

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
like

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
like in a spiral

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
it's like when you order a drink with a twist

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
of bear

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
no no no

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
like if I was eating

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
a blueberry pie but I was

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
gluten free I cut off the crust

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
but I use the

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I like

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
that that got a more gross response

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
than us chopping a bear's head

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
off and wearing it as a crown

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
that was fine but not eating

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
the crust of a pie gross

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
monsters

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I should

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I'm gonna go down with my major light

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
and make sure the rest of the cave is

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
unoccupied oh it's a very shallow cave

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
there's not really anything

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
else to even explore

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
I just take a moment

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
to myself and I just go

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
life

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
all right

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
okay we start skinning

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
the bears yeah dignity manages

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
to cut off several several

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
ragged ragged chunks of pelt

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
that can probably be stitched

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
together or you know turned

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
into clothes in some way

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
just vomit it on

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
oh you know what I just found out

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I remembered I'm allergic to bear

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
pelt

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
fuck

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
no I mean

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I mean it's not like

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
we're not working for you I mean

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
we're gonna stay warm or we're gonna die

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
what was that test

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
they put a bear pelt on me

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
and it had a very bad reaction

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
what do you want us to find kangaroo

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
okay so I'm not allergic to kangaroo

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
maybe you could just wear mud

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
that's that's very harsh

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
not nice

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
I mean weird twist like we'll

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
we'll put on the bear and

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
can you stitch

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
I think so

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
she starts stitching the bear

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
she doesn't have any stitches

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
oh you're not you're not

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
what's her name not as far as I know

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
you're not what's her name

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I have thieves tools

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
would they have like needles and

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
no

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
okay

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I uh

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
well we're not going to be cold forever

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
maybe can you stand

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
between us with a coat of mud

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
to not be allergic

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
well but I don't know how

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
we're gonna stitch the bear pelt into

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
coats anyway

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
well I was just thinking about cutting the bear pelt

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
and then cutting like a whole like a poncho

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
oh yeah like a

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:43.000
like a circular

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
yeah two bear ponchos

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
and then you put a hole and then you drape over

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
like a Christmas tree skirt

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
yes and then a rope

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
around the waist so it looks like sleeves

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
oh you know how we fucked up

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
if we hadn't cut the bear's head all the way off

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
we could have had like a hoodie with like the bear head

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
that's fucking cool

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
but we cut the head all the way off

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
we can ask baskins for

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
to point us in the direction of

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
of more bears

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
oh baskins what are you doing

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
oh I'm just hanging out

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
what are you doing

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
uh

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
we're looking for an ending

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
trying to

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I'm pelting the bears to create

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
a bear fur poncho

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
that happens

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
you do that you make two ponchos

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
remember my mother

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
my mother

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
it's

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
it's uncomfortable

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
that's good that's good keep going

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
keep going that's the way that's where the ending is

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
she was a bear

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
she was a bear

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
oh no

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
she was a bear

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
my mom was a bear

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
so you just remembered that your mom was a bear

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
so we were walking into this cave and you were like where are the bears we can kill

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
and now you recall

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
my dad

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
we left my dad

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
somewhere

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
didn't we leave my dad somewhere

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
abril darkstar

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
the shards of power

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
uh

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
your mom's a bear

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
your mom's a good bear

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
weren't people

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I made that one up

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I found treasure

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I didn't

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
are you disgusted by us

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
bears

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
your mom

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
your mom's friends they did mahjong together

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
all these bears

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
uh

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I sit down and I start crying

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
hmm

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
hmm

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
hmm

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
hmm

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
hmm

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
I'm not gonna help

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
figure out an ending

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I'm sitting here

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I sit down and I start crying

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
and then my tears

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
fall down to the dirt

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
and then I look at the pattern of tears

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
and it spells out the end

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
no

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
do they continue

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
nope

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I'm not gonna help

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I notice that

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
the rate of my tears

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
and the distance

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
of my tears

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
stains on the ground

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
have a certain correlation

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
that allows me to invent

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
geometry

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I figure it out

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
if I'm not allowed to make a fishing pole

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I invent geometry

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
no

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I mean geometry already exists

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
at least fucking roll to see

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
at least roll to see if I invent geometry

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
why don't you roll

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
it's already invented

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
you don't know

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
it's not in the common history

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
you're not well educated

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
but I'm thinking that I invented it

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
in this moment

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
do they have

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
do they have trigonometry

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
what do they not have

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
they don't have trigonometry

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
well you don't know trigonometry

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
to invent it

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
but no one can

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
do it yet

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
so he knows just as much as anybody else

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
he knows that it should exist

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
that's more than most people

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
alright explain trigonometry

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
if you know it so bad

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
say anything about trigonometry

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
okay so you know geometry

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
like three of those

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
alright goodnight folks

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
let's have

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:57.000
we'll see you next week
