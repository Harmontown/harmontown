28:41.000\nare you a Christian Bale like Batman fan\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nwell I enjoy The Dark Knight but that's about it\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nright like I'm definitely more of a Michael Keaton Batman\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nand I keep watching The Dark Knight\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nover and over again because\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nit's sort of like\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nit's like a Scorsese movie it's like\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nI just keep like I just\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nbut and I think that that points to like\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nthe guy is like a really powerful director\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nreally powerful cinematographer\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nand most importantly what you can observe\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nfrom everything laying around it\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nobviously Heath Ledger is the\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nlike is the thing that we're going\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nback to I think\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nit's that plus the\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nthe foundation that Christopher Nolan\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\ncast over everything I'll even\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nonce in a while I'll be like\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\ndid I not get inception\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nand then you're like oh no\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nhe didn't get inception\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nand it's like every time like\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nthe logical part of my brain\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nthe writer part of my brain goes this is\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\ninsipid this is garbage but\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nmy eyeball part of my brain which is\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nnever stimulated I'm always like god damn it\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nit's so fucking good though absolutely it's\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nhe's making gorgeous things but the problem is that\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:45.000\nso The Matrix\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:47.000\nis a great example of making\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\na beautiful movie where they're like oh\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\ndoes this also make sense and I feel like\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nfor Christopher Nolan if he was just like hey I'm a\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:55.000\ngorgeous artist I make gorgeous stuff I should get\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\ngood screenplays yeah\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nexactly I wish he wasn't always just like\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nguys I gotta explain why this is so\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\npretty by writing it\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nyeah gotta go through it\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nget away from the typewriter that's all it is\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nwhen's the last time you saw okay so then\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nI would say this absolutely Heath Ledger\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nJoker's great but we were really\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nalso enjoying\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nNicholson's Joker just because it's like such a stretch\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nfor him it's very funny that's why\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nI kind of want to watch it again I just\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nI since\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nTim Burton\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nlike he is so\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\ntheatrical and everything it's like I get\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nI get distracted by\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nI feel\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nI like I feel like the\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\ncrooked doorways and the purples and the everything\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nlike I feel distracted\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nby them everything's on a sound\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nstage in a Batman that's what I really\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nthink\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nthat when Nolan did Batman\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nthe thrilling thing was that\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nwe were in genuine exteriors using locations\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nand that things felt paramilitary\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nthe cosmetics\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nmade you allowed you to\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nbelieve in Batman in a visceral\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nway and whereas\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nlike I don't like you can\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nsee the dangers of\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nBurton's Batman in\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nwhat's his names Batman\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nI refuse to say\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nyes\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nhis name should not be spoken\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nwith the purple nipples and the\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nDaeglo brain fights\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nit's kind of like well\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\ndidn't Burton set you up to do this\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nisn't this what you liked it's like\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nwhen I watch Burton's Batman I'm like\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nyeah what are we doing we're like\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nrevving this like fish shaped\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nroller coaster car through a sound\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nstage and having these acrobats\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nkick box each other and stuff\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nyeah I mean even Burton\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nevolved from Burton in like ways that\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\npeople maybe should have\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\njust stay with the scissor hands unless with the\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nyeah scissor hands with the guy\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nlet's digress\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nwe lived in Chicago at the time\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nactually when they filmed The Dark Knight\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nwhich is also interesting because that was\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nvery much a part I mean nothing is\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nwell before that nothing was really filmed there\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nnow they really encourage filming but did you\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\never see any I remember they would put up\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nsigns and they would say that a movie that\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nwas being filmed there called First Kiss\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nRory's First Kiss\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nyes that's right and it was Batman\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\ncause I actually worked at a screen printing\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\ncompany at the time that was\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nmaking like the emblems and stuff for\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nthe Gotham City police\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nso they were making like in a robe for Harvey\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nDent which never got made but\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nyeah it was all for Rory's First Kiss\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nand I worked on the street on LaSalle street\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nwhere they filmed the like final charge\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nand they were and it was all labeled as\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nRory's First Kiss but there was like a Gotham City\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nHelicopter so\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nalright\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nso I want to let you guys go\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nbecause you have the birthday party to go to\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nand I promise not to keep you\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nbut you're pot I'm not\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nkicking you out yet but I want to announce that\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\ncause I'm terrible at letting people go\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nyou have a podcast called Put Your Hands Together\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nwhich is like a stand up podcast\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nwhere you can come to see podcast\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\ncomedian people do\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\ncomic things\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nyou guys run it together and you're like hosting it\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nI haven't\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nyou're rapping\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\ngo ahead sorry\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nit felt like you were trying to figure out what a show is\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nwell I'm not sure\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nthey have a podcast but it's a stand up format\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI don't know if the stand up\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\ncome and talk about their lives\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\non the thing or if it's a live podcast\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nwhere you guys are hosting a stand up show\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nit's a great question\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nyeah it's a show\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nI just spilled so much\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nwater in my crotch\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nso much it's all the way through\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nbut it's every Tuesday night at the UCB\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nand it's a live stand up show\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nthat runs for 75 minutes\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nand Ri and I co-host it\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nand we do hilarious jokes\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nand then also stand ups come and perform\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nand we didn't think that this\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nwe took a real risk when we started it two years ago\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nbecause we just said like maybe if we do this\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nstand ups will let us use their material\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nand most of them do\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nwe never we say you can have your set cut\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nif you want it and we can do an interview instead\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nand that's also fine and sometimes you just get\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nlike a great interview with somebody who's about to go on\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nConan and they're like practicing their Conan set\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nbut a lot of it is just like\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nmaterial which is awesome because\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nthere are so many people that\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\ndon't get a chance to be\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nlike I don't know if LA ever realizes how lucky\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nLA is because everybody just lives here\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nso you can go to a show at the meltdown or at the UCB\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nand it's just like oh these people are only in\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nlike majorly big budgeted\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nfilms not like enormously big budgeted\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nlike we can't believe it's just like Louis C.K.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nand not like Louis C.K. writing\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nJerry Seinfeld like what are like\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nthis is bullshit\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nwe can't believe we're just like not watching\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nMaria Bamford and also Sarah Silverman\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\ndoing the arms for each other from behind\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nlike this\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nso you're spoiled audiences\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nbut people in Kansas City they don't get to hear\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\neight great\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\ncomics on the same show they don't get to hear anything\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nthey don't get to hear anything there's no\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nairs in Kansas City\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nthey got nothing out there\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nMissouri and Kansas\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nsounds free America\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nand the thing that doesn't need to be\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nplugged is these\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\ncharming awesome\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nlike mother friendly Ask a Lesbian\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nthere's this video that's like\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nbillions and zillions of\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nmore views than community has had\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nNielsen numbers just and\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nwe were talking about in the greener like how does that happen\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nwhat does that happen we made a video called Ask a Lesbian\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nand it's like pretty it's there's\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nnothing really shocking in there it's like\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nI hear the questions for Ask a Lesbian is\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nsaying

scientifically\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nit doesn't make sense it's not doing anything\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nfor anybody well now come on\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nif you're a lesbian couple

now\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nbecause\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nit makes more sense to take pictures\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nbefore the wedding than after the ceremony\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nyou do a\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nfirst quote unquote first look photograph\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nthat's supposed to take place of\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nthe photos that you would get\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nwhen the bride is first walking down the aisle\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nso it's a very\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nstage thing where Dan's back\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nis to me and I walk up and they're like\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nalright Dan turn around\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nlike before the wedding here's your\n\n52:39.000 -->

53:03.000\nand I also thought that I was going to be like\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nstruck by some inspiration\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nfor my vows which I guess never happened\n\n53:07.000 -->
