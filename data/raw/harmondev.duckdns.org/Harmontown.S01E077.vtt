{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:08.000\nI'm going to start off on a sad note, but for a good reason.\n\n00:08.000 --> 00:15.000\nLou Reed, baby.\n\n00:15.000 --> 00:20.000\nRest in peace, Lou Reed.\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:27.000\nLet's just groove on him for a moment.\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:38.000\nThat she wants to know, she wants to know why she's given half her life to people she hates now.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:39.000\nHello, Harvintown.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:46.000\nYes, it seems a melancholy note to begin the comedy show, but fuck it, Lou Reed passed away this morning.\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:55.000\nAnd let's dedicate this one to him, shall we?\n\n00:55.000 --> 01:02.000\nAnd as sad as this song seems, but she's not afraid.\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:03.000\nIt's fucking good stuff.\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:13.000\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harvintown, the king of sadness, Dan Harvint.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:18.000\nThank you.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:27.000\nIt's a special sleepy sad Harvintown, and it's not Lou Reed's fault, really, for dying.\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:28.000\nWell, is it?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nIt might be.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nNo, I was going to be sleepy and sad no matter what.\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:39.000\nMy girlfriend's out of town, and I don't know if I've ever been this apart from her this long.\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:40.000\nI can't remember.\n\n01:40.000 --> 01:41.000\nIt's been like four days?\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:43.000\nThat's the longest?\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:47.000\nYeah, we kind of just started spending every day together when we started hanging out.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nWhen is she back?\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nTuesday or something.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nIt's gonna be what?\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nNirana a week.\n\n01:55.000 --> 02:03.000\nShe left a basket of gifts next to the front door, one for each day that she's gone, that I can open.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:12.000\nWhich leads me to item number one in my segment tonight called Things Dan Harvint's Not Allowed to Complaint About,\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:16.000\nwhich item number one is my girlfriend loves me too much.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nI can't keep up.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:19.000\nHow am I supposed to match something like that?\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:26.000\nI'm reading that off of one of the gifts that she got me the first night, which is my new gold eye Harmon,\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:31.000\nwhich is this kind of hinged clasped kind of affair.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:35.000\nBut I guess item number two that I'm not allowed to complain about is this thing.\n\n02:35.000 --> 02:36.000\nIt sucks.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:41.000\nI mean, it's functionally.\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:42.000\nI mean, it's gorgeous.\n\n02:42.000 --> 02:46.000\nCertainly, aesthetically, it looks like exactly what you wanted.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nYeah, it's got a slender.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nIt's all love, no function.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nIt's got a sticker on the front that says eye Harmon with my silhouette on it.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.000\nIt's held together with the pen so that when you pull the pen out, it springs open.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:08.000\nBut it's one of those slippery, shitty, twisty pens that you have to twist to get the ink nub out of.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:15.000\nAnd also, the paper, it's like that paper that every three centimeters,\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:19.000\nthere's a random spot that won't take the ink, you know what I'm talking about?\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.000\nYeah.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:21.000\nIt's a piece of shit.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:27.000\nYeah, for me, the deal breaker is the quality of the paper.\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nYou want good paper that takes ink well.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:30.000\nI mean, yeah.\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nSo she loves me a lot.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:36.000\nHave you written any notes down in that one?\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:42.000\nWell, I wrote, Girlfriend Loves Me Too Much as the number one thing,\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:45.000\nbut I kept having to start over because the paper sucks.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nI had other stuff on there that I now can't remember.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nIt's going to be a bad show because of this thing.\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhat else has she gotten you so far?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nShe got me some throwing knives.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:01.000\nWhen I was younger, I used to throw knives in my backyard.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:08.000\nAnd so she got me some throwing knives and she put a target on the fence\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:11.000\nthat separates my place from my neighbor's place.\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:15.000\nIt's this really low fence.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:19.000\nEven if you hit the fence, you're still fucking up your own fence\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.000\nand probably your neighbor's fence.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nOr killing a child.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:25.000\nYeah, nine times out of ten.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:29.000\nIf you've ever played darts before, yeah, it's about 20% of the darts\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\ngo over the top of the board.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:35.000\nWhat were the circumstances that you came home one morning or day\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nand Jay Johnson and I were at your old apartment\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:40.000\nand we had taken actual kitchen knives.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nAnd you were just throwing them on a door in my apartment.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.000\nAt a wall.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.000\nAt a wall.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:48.000\nAnd we had destroyed a wall in your place.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:52.000\nI think the circumstances were booze and probably other drugs.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.000\nYeah, probably certainly drugs.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:57.000\nI think I went to work and came back and you guys were still doing it.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:02.000\nWe had taken like a bucket out and drawn a circle\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:06.000\nand then like a plate and drawn a smaller circle.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.000\nAnd we had numbered them and we were like betting a dollar a throw.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nAnd then I came home.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:15.000\nI got up, went to work, but I didn't get up.\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\nI stayed up all night with you guys, went to work, came home.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nAnd when I came home, when I opened my apartment's front door,\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:27.000\nconfetti fell.\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:30.000\nBecause one of the many dumb drunk things you guys did,\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\nit was set like a confetti trap.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:37.000\nAnd you were just, I came into this two red puffy,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nwe did adults like laughing and crying\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nbecause confetti had fallen on my head.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:46.000\nBut it was like, anyone watching objectively would have been like,\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:48.000\nthis is not worth celebrating.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:51.000\nThat confetti is alcoholism.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.000\nThis is a movie of the week.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:58.000\nAll right, so yeah, it's a sleepy, sad, harm at town.\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:04.000\nIt looks like the attendees agree, I think.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:06.000\nWe're not packed to the rafters here.\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:12.000\nYou know, part of what I blame for it is the Halloween people,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:14.000\nwhoever schedules Halloween.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\nPutting it on a Thursday afternoon?\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nIt's the worst possible day.\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nThere's no weekend leading up to it.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nNobody knows what to do.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:25.000\nAnd no one's going to dress up really joyfully on the day after Halloween.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nSome women are just dressing like a cat for two weeks in a row.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nThey don't know what to do.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:33.000\nThey're just like, I have a tail and I just encase.\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nA lot of people are doing nothing.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:41.000\nI was going to dress up as Erin in honor of her version of dressing up as me.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:46.000\nWell, she looked like Robert Smith in the cure.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:50.000\nBut you didn't want to dress as Spencer when I suggested let's all dress as Spencer\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:58.000\nbecause that wouldn't involve makeup and women's clothes.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:01.000\nYou keep pushing for second year of David Bowie in a row.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:02.000\nI wasn't pushing for that.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.000\nI was saying I was going to go for what's easy\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:11.000\nand you shouldn't dress up like your friends.\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:12.000\nGuy likes to dress as women.\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nThat's all I know.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nWhy women?\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:20.000\nDavid Bowie in Labyrinth is kind of a woman, but he's still a guy.\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nHe's the Goblin King.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nYou were Snow White one year.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:26.000\nI was.\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.000\nBut that was because my girlfriend at the time had a Snow White costume\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:32.000\nfrom her oversized roommate.\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.000\nI didn't know I was cornering you about this.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:36.000\nI thought this was...\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nI'll dress as women.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nI have multiple wigs at home.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:44.000\nAll right, let's bring up Spencer bright and early.\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:45.000\nRight now.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:52.000\nLet's keep this sleepy train rolling.\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:53.000\nHey.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.000\nHello.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:58.000\nHow's it going, you guys?\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\nAre you nice and sleepy, Spencer?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:02.000\nI'm pretty nice and sleepy.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nEverybody got their headache on?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nEverybody got a sleepy headache?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:11.000\nI woke up at 6 a.m. in Fairhaven, Washington, and flew in only moments ago.\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:19.000\nI woke up, took a two-hour drive to Seattle, flew, went straight to our D&D game with you guys.\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:20.000\nWe had our little...\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nIt was just Spencer, Dan, and Rob Schrab and I.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nThat was a pretty sleepy D&D game, too.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:29.000\nRob Schrab was supine through most of it.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nHe was actually laying down on his back.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:37.000\nVirmouth Facts is your turn. We'd wake up and he would cast some sort of spell.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:41.000\nWe killed lots of baddies, though.\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:45.000\nAll right, let's keep the sleepy train rolling.\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:48.000\nLet's get some of these sleepy people's problems.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nWho's depressed tonight?\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nAnd I'm not asking who's got a problem.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:03.000\nYou can just say, if you're depressed, if you're feeling like at the bottom of your bio-rhythmic curve,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.000\nnobody, everybody's walking on sunshine.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:09.000\nWell, no, I don't want people stepping into the role.\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nI'll pretend to be depressed.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nThat's nice. No, that's good.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nLet's look at that as a beautiful aurora borealis.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nHow are you real quick, just like to set the barometer?\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nAre you up, down, depressed?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:22.000\nI'm definitely down.\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.000\nBecause Aaron's gone or because what?\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:25.000\nAaron's gone.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:26.000\nI don't know why.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nI had kind of a headache all day.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:29.000\nYou know what?\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nI've been playing this video game that she got from me.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:39.000\nThat was her second gift to me, or Saturday's gift, was this Ellen Page, Willem Dafoe video game,\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:42.000\nwhere you're just like, it's one of those video games.\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.000\nI don't expect you to understand this.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nI know who Willem Dafoe is. That's it.\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:49.000\nI know, but there's this kind of video game.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:54.000\nI'm assuming it's the exact same company that made that Deep Rain or whatever it is, Hard Rain.\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:56.000\nHeavy Rain, thank you.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:03.000\nDeep Rain, Heavy Rain, Thick Rain, Wet Rain.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:08.000\nI played the whole game through this one, this Ellen Page, Willem Dafoe one.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.000\nIt's really weird.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:14.000\nOn paper, it shouldn't be fun at all because it really is just much more like you're watching a movie\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:18.000\nand they just kind of invite you to move along with your joystick.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:23.000\nYou can tell from observing what's happening that it probably doesn't matter what you do, basically,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:26.000\nbecause you can't die that I know of.\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:28.000\nIs it a shooter? Is it a thriller?\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt's kind of a sci-fi, Japanese, kind of chick flick.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:42.000\nI don't know how to describe the genre of the adventure you're on.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nSo you're just a protagonist in a film?\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:46.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd it's a sort of spiritual, dramatic thriller about supernatural powers and stuff.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:57.000\nYou just got to go through this 25-hour movie.\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nHad you asked for this video game?\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nNo, no, she just got it for me.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nIt was nice because I really wasn't in the mood to play Grand Theft Auto.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.000\nI love Grand Theft Auto.\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:10.000\nIt's working great, but I don't know what it is.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:14.000\nI wouldn't have played it otherwise, but having a new thing that I knew would probably take two days.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:18.000\nI just put it in and played it in my monogram PJs that she also got me.\n\n11:18.000 --> 11:25.000\nAnd she also got me dark chocolate peanut butter cup I missed her so much.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nBut I was Ellen Page all weekend.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.000\nMaybe that's why I'm depressed.\n\n11:28.000 --> 11:35.000\nI was just Ellen Page with this spiritual entity following me that I could use to open drawers and find clues.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:39.000\nSo I'm just feeling a little depressed.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nCan you choose to be Willem de Faul?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:42.000\nNo, you cannot.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:45.000\nAnd you wouldn't want to be. He's weird.\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nHe does not translate well to video game.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:50.000\nEllen Page works very well, whatever goop they put on your face,\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:54.000\nwhatever ping-pong balls they taped to your head to capture your movement and stuff.\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:57.000\nShe made a good protagonist for a video game, Willem de Faul.\n\n11:57.000 --> 12:01.000\nAll of the bad things about Willem de Faul come through in a video game.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.000\nAnd all of the humanity is left behind.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:08.000\nIf Gina Davis were eating a plate of Willem de Faul that came through a telepod,\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nshe would go, it's synthetic.\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:16.000\nWillem de Faul is 90% skull.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:20.000\nThere's a lot of skull to Willem de Faul.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.000\nHe's craggy.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:29.000\nWhen he and William Sadler were separated through the screen door of actors,\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:32.000\nSadler got a lot of the humanity.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:38.000\nAnd De Faul only got so much that's stripped away again by this game, so anyways.\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.000\nSo headache?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:40.000\nHeadache.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:41.000\nEllen Page video game.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:42.000\nI've been Ellen Page all weekend.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:43.000\nMissing Aaron.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nMissing Aaron.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:46.000\nSo throwing darts.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:50.000\nThere was last week too, the lady came up and that was weird, right?\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\nI loved it.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nI didn't listen to it.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nI was afraid to listen to it because I'm just so tired.\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:59.000\nThere's a lethargy to this too, like I'm just so tired of being a fucking bad person.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nSo tired.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nI don't think you were a bad person.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nEmotionally tired?\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.000\nIt's like you feel like your emotions are doing stuff.\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:06.000\nIs Lisa here right now by the way?\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nNo.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.000\nNo.\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:15.000\nShe got into a personal submarine and went to Tokyo.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:20.000\nI think one of the writers told me that somebody wrote an email saying she's resigned from the\n\n13:20.000 --> 13:21.000\nfandom or something.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nOh wow.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:27.000\nLook, I have no fucking horse in this race.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nEither does she, man.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:34.000\nShe came up here and was like, she had this sort of, I mean, you have a Christ complex,\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:38.000\nbut your Christ complex met hers.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:42.000\nAnd she was like, I just wish people would stop asking me what I thought about this stuff,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.000\nbut that's what the whole thing was for sale.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:50.000\nShe hated you, but loves community and hated being on stage, but clearly needed to be,\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nI don't know.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:57.000\nI think the biggest, the most unanticipated kind of blowback from that was that what should\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:03.000\nhave occurred to me, what sometimes happens at Harmontown is that in our haste to have\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:09.000\na dialogue, we forget that only a kind of diehard Harmontown person knows that coming\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:12.000\nup on stage is not a bad thing.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:16.000\nIt's not like coming up to a witness stand.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:18.000\nIt's not like you're under arrest for something.\n\n14:18.000 --> 14:22.000\nAnd I was a little thrown by the fact that she did not come up smiling.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:26.000\nI expected, when I say is so and so here, I expect that to be the equivalent of tickling\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\nthem.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:32.000\nAnd I said is so and so here, and she was like, well, I don't know.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:34.000\nAnd it was like, oh, shit, we fucked up.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nAnd how do you do it?\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nRed wire or blue wire?\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nAnd it didn't matter.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nBecause I am not skilled at that.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nDoes that mean she's never heard of Harmontown?\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nShe only loves community and never heard this show?\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:46.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:47.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:52.000\nThe first thing that I noticed was that she came up and it was contentious.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.000\nLike she came up in a very cross looking kind of posture.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nYeah.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:58.000\nIt's a shame.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:00.000\nIt's a bummer.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:03.000\nDid that, what was the fallout for you from that?\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:04.000\nThere hasn't been.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nI kind of like, I've taken the opportunity.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:10.000\nI was like, you know what, I got so many people I've talked to.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.000\nI'm still on Twitter because Twitter seems pretty safe.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nIt's just sort of like this trickling stream of garbage.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:21.000\nYou can't really mix it up or write an essay about how someone should be crucified or\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nsomething on Twitter.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nIt doesn't work.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:30.000\nSo I've been trying to wean myself off of, and this is such a sad thing to me.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nI grew up on the internet.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:37.000\nIf somebody is writing the world's lowest stakes biopic, you've got to circle the irony\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:45.000\nhere that from the age of 13, I was learning to interact with people on computers and always\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:50.000\nwanted to write television and ended up out in LA writing television in an era when this\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:56.000\ninternet thing that I had grown up on was actually starting to impact television and ended up\n\n15:56.000 --> 16:02.000\nwith this weird crossroads where I had the first TV show that was sort of so loved by\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:08.000\na previously unmeasured demographic that it actually was able to stay on the air, but\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:13.000\nat the same time was sort of like, it's just such an odd, weird, swirling thing.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:18.000\nIt was like my accessibility became part of a product.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:22.000\nI don't know where I started buying into that stock or that press.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:25.000\nI don't know what was fantasy, what was reality.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\nI just always knew, I still know one thing, which is that I would rather die than not\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:35.000\nbe able to talk about how I feel, and especially not in the medium that I understand where I\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:39.000\ncan truly express myself, which is the typed word.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:43.000\nAnd so that's always going to be a deal breaker for me, but the tragic irony of this whole\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:50.000\nthing is coming around to finally like, I'm back on the page now of all this.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:54.000\nI just got to get these suitcases in my hand standing outside the internet going like,\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nwhat happened?\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:01.000\nI'm just going to go do what rich people do.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:06.000\nI'm just going to shuffle around my house and my slippers and maybe I'll buy a boat.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:11.000\nAnd I'll just be like Instagramming me in a jet ski because I'm like, this is the life.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:14.000\nThis is what life is, but that was never what life was for me.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nLife was like, life was sitting in forums and talking.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nBut jet skis were built so that you could not take a selfie.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nRight.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nThat and Carpool Diem, we came up with that.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:26.000\nCarpool Diem.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:27.000\nCarpool Diem.\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.000\nDid anyone ever come up with Carpool Diem?\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:34.000\nDan and I drove here today and we were ashamed that nobody has come up with Carpool Diem.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nSomeone might have.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nWe don't know.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:42.000\nSo all of that, why do we bring Spencer up so early again?\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:46.000\nBecause he's a laugh a minute.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nSure.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nWhy are you throwing it to me?\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:51.000\nNo.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:52.000\nI mean, what is?\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:53.000\nOkay.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:56.000\nSo I'm going to throw Carpool Diem.\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:58.000\nCarpool Diem?\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:00.000\nCarpool Diem.\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:02.000\nI'm thinking you're too literal, man.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nCarpool Diem.\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:09.000\nToday's Carpool Diem because I got two people in my vehicle.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nIs that how you use it?\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:15.000\nOr are you like, hey man, Carpool Diem because that's wrong.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nCarpool Diem.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nYeah.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:20.000\nWhat the?\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:21.000\nCarpool.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nHow about this?\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nCarpool Two Diem.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nNo.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nSee, don't appease him.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:31.000\nHis thirst for logic just made a horrible slogan.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nI'm not suggesting anything.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nSpock didn't work in advertising.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:40.000\nSometimes you just go like, just do it, says Nike.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:43.000\nSpock would be like, just do what, Captain?\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:48.000\nAnd it'd be a fair question unless you were branding something.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nAll right.\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nThat's not my arena, you guys.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nI'm confident in admitting that.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:58.000\nBut what do people that don't get on the internet do?\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nGolf hobbies?\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nGolf.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:02.000\nWe should start golfing again.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.000\nFalconry.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:04.000\nThat'll make this show great.\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nPeople can show up and listen to our golf stories.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:11.000\nDan, I would suggest to you to start picking up Falconry.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:15.000\nI prefer joinery, you know, wood joining.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:16.000\nWood joining?\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:17.000\nYeah.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:21.000\nYou know, you create joints in wood and then join them together.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:24.000\nWhat's your favorite method of joining wood together?\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nOh, definitely the dovetail.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nReally?\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nNo.\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:29.000\nNo.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:32.000\nBecause I had you pick for a Mortis and Tennant man.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:36.000\nYou know, that was the thing I was trying to go for, but my brain couldn't think of.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:41.000\nWhen I worked at my book job, I actually read through a shit ton of joinery books.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:45.000\nAnd I knew about the Mortis and Tennant joint, but I couldn't think of it now because I've\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.000\nbeen doing all this other stuff at jobs.\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:49.000\nYeah.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:52.000\nMortis and Tennant, he was like arch enemies with Henry David Thoreau, right?\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:54.000\nNo, there were these two brothers.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nOne was tall and one was short.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:58.000\nThe short one had a club.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:03.000\nTennant was the guy that haunted Ebony's or Scrooge.\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nSo they call it joinery?\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nThey don't just call it carpentry?\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:08.000\nI have no idea.\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:12.000\nI think, yeah, joinery is like when you're not using like nails and shit.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:16.000\nYou're just, you're using slots and the way you stick the wood together.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:21.000\nThe art of non-adhesive wood joining.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nI think they use glue.\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:27.000\nAre you saying, Dan, you're in the market for a hobby that's not typing words to strangers\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nthat you never will meet and hate you for no reason?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:30.000\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:34.000\nHe's looking for something to do at this time, but that's what a hobby is essentially, right?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.000\nNo, no.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:36.000\nYou know what it is?\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:40.000\nIt's a healthy thing because what I somehow came, what started doing was like sucking energy\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\noff of the internet, which I don't think, you know, it's a medium.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:51.000\nLike you should, I, if I'm true to my lip service, like I should be getting pleasure\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.000\nfrom putting shit out, like expressing myself.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:59.000\nBut then I have to somehow become a person that actually doesn't look at the response,\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:04.000\nyou know, doesn't like pay attention, like never clicks the little A in the circle on\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:08.000\nthe Twitter client, which it just seems weird because sometimes people are saying like,\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nHey, you, you, you, you helped me or can I ask you a question?\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:18.000\nBut, but you just kind of want to be able to go like and just like kind of exhale without\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:21.000\ninhaling, without taking back.\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:24.000\nAnd what I'm wondering is, so what do I substitute?\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nCause I was like sucking energy off of things.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:33.000\nLike, like, like what do you do in normal life when you want to get energy?\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:36.000\nYou can't get on the internet and suck your little thumb.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:38.000\nAsk, ask people here what they do.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nI don't think, I think that they're pretty much like me.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nI don't know, but let's guys raise in his hand.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nYou go to bars alone and talk to strangers.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nUh, bars alone and talk to strangers.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nHe says, all right, that sounds good.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:56.000\nBut certainly what I was doing from 91 to 2009 for community started up.\n\n21:56.000 --> 22:00.000\nBut when you were, when you, like you said last week was last week.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:04.000\nUh, you said that, uh, writing is, uh, gross people asking for hugs.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:09.000\nLike, like it's you saying, like you're putting that stuff out there for the response.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:11.000\nIt's, it's, it's not you putting things out.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nIt's you receiving something back from them.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:17.000\nSo you, you have a relationship with the internet that I don't have.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:21.000\nI wouldn't have because I like, I couldn't do it.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:25.000\nLike you, you want the response.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:29.000\nYou can hear a thousand, uh, bits of praise and hear one bad thing.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:33.000\nAnd you'll obsess about that because you're looking for that information.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:38.000\nYou're, you're trying to triangulate who you are based on strangers input.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:39.000\nYeah.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:43.000\nSo I just want to know, like, what's the worst thing that somebody could say about you?\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:46.000\nBecause I want to move in that direction because I,\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\nwell, last week it was saying, don't talk.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:49.000\nRight.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nYeah.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nWhich is like saying, yeah.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nTie your shoe.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nDo anything different.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nStop doing what you're doing.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:58.000\nLike you, you have a huge like energetic reaction to anybody saying,\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nchange your behavior.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:03.000\nLike in the, uh, in the, in the, uh, what was the city,\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:08.000\nthe Pittsburgh show of the Harmon tour when like Erin came out and she'd been affected by something.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:11.000\nAnd she said, uh, like that hurt my feelings.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nAnd you said, I'm sorry that you were hurt.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:18.000\nAnd she was like, uh, well, are you, are you sorry that I'm hurt?\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nAre you sorry about what you said?\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd like it was all about behavior modification.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:26.000\nLike you don't, you don't, you don't want to be asked to change anything,\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.000\nwhich is nobody wants to ask to be changed anything.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:32.000\nWe don't want to have to change, but we all must.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.000\nWe all do have to adapt if we want to grow.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nBut anytime anybody asks you,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:40.000\nwhat if I want to grow into a person that never has to change?\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nWhat if I want to become like Godzilla?\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nYou have to change the most.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nI have to change into Godzilla.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nYou actually have to change DNA.\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nI do that by not caring what people think, right?\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\nSo I cut myself off from everybody, like Godzilla,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nand I slowly mutate into a giant lizard that breathes fire.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nWell, the fear for you is that if, if, if you had to change anything,\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nyou'd be sacrificing your identity.\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nYou lose who you, you are, who you were.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:07.000\nBut, but, but the only thing that I am is a person that doesn't want to be told what to do.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:09.000\nWell, that's not true.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nYou're the guy that likes to do a million things.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:15.000\nOne of the things about you is that you hate being told to change,\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nbut changes is adaptation and evolution.\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nIt doesn't mean changing identity or changing essence.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:24.000\nYou're never going to change your essential qualities,\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:27.000\nbut you could like, you know, you could change,\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:30.000\nyou could learn to soften this about yourself\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:32.000\nor enhance that about yourself.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:34.000\nThat's not becoming a bad version of you\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:37.000\nor being bullied or bossed around.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:40.000\nWhat is, what is softening and what is that?\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:42.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:45.000\nEvery, every, every fifth time you have something on your mind,\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nyou don't say it.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:48.000\nIs that what, is that what that is?\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:51.000\nNo, it's, it's, it's knowing the difference between\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nsaying what somebody needs to hear\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.000\nand saying what the first thing that came to your mind was.\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:58.000\nYou can say both things at once.\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.000\nYou can say, you can express yourself without saying a hurtful thing\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nto somebody that you care about.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nI don't, I truly don't.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nI don't think of myself as somebody that says a lot of hurtful things.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nWell, no, but you, you know that you have the capacity\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nto absolutely hurt somebody without meaning it at all.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:16.000\nWe all did, we all have that capacity.\n\n25:16.000 --> 25:19.000\nLike you can say something that you could have said.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nWhat are you, what are you, what are you saying?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nWhat, what, what, how, how does one grow and change?\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nWhat is the mandate there?\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nYou're asking a man, being.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.000\nWe don't know, we don't know how to do this.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nBeing nicer.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nWomen have to come into our lives and we have to,\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nwe have to allow femininity into our lives.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nAnd women go, hey, you know what?\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nThe thing you meant to say, don't say it.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nJust say, hey, they're there.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nLike just be a human being for a second\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nand don't have an egotistical reaction to something\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:49.000\nand need like reinforcement at all fucking times.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:52.000\nLike we think that like,\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:58.000\nmale egos are so fucking fragile and so brittle and so shitty.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:00.000\nAnd we think that women have this power\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:02.000\nand women think that we have this power\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nbut we don't.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nLike you can, you don't have to change any part of yourself\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nto not be a cock.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.000\nLike, you know, like when you are in a bad mood.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nWhen my blood sugar is low, if it's been a long drive\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:18.000\nand I need a fucking sandwich, I become Liza Minnelli.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nI become a fucking, like, I become a cranky weirdo\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nand I will say things that I don't mean.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:26.000\nBut if you grow up, ideally you learn to go like,\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:29.000\noh, this is that feeling I get when Jeff Davis\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:32.000\nis about to become an absolute unsupportable cunt\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nfor no fucking reason.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nAnd what I should do is go, hey, I'm sorry everybody,\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.000\nI'm gonna take a walk.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:40.000\nLike I'm gonna recognize that what I'm about to do\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nis be hurtful.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:44.000\nAnd before I say the hurtful thing\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nthat I know that I can do,\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nlike Indiana Jones flips a fucking whip,\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:52.000\nI will just say something soft instead of hard.\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:55.000\nThis just sounds like this is a bunch of fucking garbage\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nthat a therapist tells you.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:59.000\nLike, this is such a bunch of like business casual\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\ncope with society, like, oh.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:02.000\nNo, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:04.000\nIs that really, is that the way to get through the day?\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:05.000\nLook, Dan.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nMr. Harmon?\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nDan.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:08.000\nUh, no, no.\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:09.000\nMaybe my girlfriend said, well, next time,\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:10.000\ndo you think maybe you should do that,\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:11.000\nbut then take a step back, take a deep breath,\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nand maybe not do that as much?\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:14.000\nYes, you're right.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:16.000\nI guess a perfect person wouldn't have done that.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.000\nWell, all right, that'll be $700.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nWell, okay, here's what I would say to that.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nI would say it's about being around people\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nthat you respect more than yourself.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.000\nDown on everybody, you don't fucking,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:29.000\nyou don't ever like aspire to better behavior.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nIf you treat people, if you always aim down,\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nand whenever you're cranky, vulnerable,\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:38.000\ndefensive, whatever, and you fire down on people,\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:39.000\nyou cannot possibly grow.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nBut if you surround yourself by people\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:46.000\nwhose opinions you covet and crave and want to nurture\n\n27:46.000 --> 27:48.000\nand you want them to think well of you,\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nthen you start saying like, oh, like,\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:53.000\nwhat would I do to make people that I look up to\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nlook up to me?\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:58.000\nAnd it's not about softening\n\n27:58.000 --> 28:01.000\nand rounding off edges of your personality\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nso you can make dumb people like you.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nIt's about becoming more attractive to the people\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nthat you aspire to be, or to be around.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:10.000\nThat's interesting.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:13.000\nKeep burped.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nCouldn't help it.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nYeah, that's an interesting way of looking at it.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nI like that philosophy.\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nYou could keep somebody in your head,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:23.000\ninstead of the guy in the back of the room\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:26.000\nwho's got his arms folded going like,\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:28.000\noh, that guy's not funny, you know,\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.000\nlike kind of like having this phantom heckler in your head,\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nlike playing to an idiot, you know,\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\ntrying to make idiots like you.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nLike, imagining that that guy is, you know,\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nAgent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks,\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nor even if it's just a fictional character,\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nsomebody that you look up to,\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nyou're like, I wouldn't want him to think I was a twat.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nYou know, and then, yeah, I like that.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nThat's good. That's smart.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:52.000\nAll right, we got that covered.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:56.000\nWe're all going to be good people for now.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nBecause nobody ever wants to live in a world\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nwhere we had to change you, one iota.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nWe don't want you to ever have to,\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:06.000\nlike, choke up on the bat and not be full forest,\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:13.000\nawesome, crazy, like, rampant Dan Harmon.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nWe want you to always be firing,\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nlike, from the hip, like, you know,\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nlike Jack Palin's and Shane, like,\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nwe want you to be a good guy, a bad guy,\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nlike, a weirdo, because you're a good writer\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nand we can't, you can't write well\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nif you're thinking about what people think\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nabout what you're going to say.\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nYou need to say whatever you want to say.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nBut I just have to be thinking in my head\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nwhen I'm saying it, this one's for Obama.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nNo.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nNo.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nIf he's listening.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nWhat you have to think is like,\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nit's possible to evolve and still be you.\n\n29:43.000 --> 29:46.000\nIt's possible to be a higher version of you.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:49.000\nYou can elevate yourself above certain behavior\n\n29:49.000 --> 29:51.000\nthat you yourself are not proud of.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nThat you say things that you regret later on.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nAnd we drink and we say things drunken\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nand we use that as an excuse,\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nand that's fine, but you know, or it's not fine.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:02.000\nBut ideally, there'd be a point\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:05.000\nwhen we stop saying things that are asinine\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:09.000\nor adolescent or purile or hurtful.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nAnd I like to think that at 40 years old\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:15.000\nI can't hurt people's feelings anymore accidentally.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.000\nBut guess what?\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nI'm fucking way better at it than I ever was.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:21.000\nLike, I can now just be dismissive of somebody\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nand that's more hurtful.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nSo like, we do have to like grow a bit\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:29.000\nand use our brains, our evolved intellect.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:32.000\nI'm stupider than I was when I was 19.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nI was way more connected and way smarter\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nthan when I was when I was young.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:39.000\nEr, not that 40 years old.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nBut I look at myself now and I'm like,\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\noh, I can be crotchety.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nI can be cross.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nContrary.\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:49.000\nI can be a person that I wouldn't have liked\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nwhen I was 19.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:55.000\nSo like, it's not about me stopping being Jeff Davis.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:59.000\nIt's about me like learning to finesse it a little bit\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nand make it sexier.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nYou know.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nBut you don't like that.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:09.000\nNo, it's very complicated when your relationship\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:12.000\nis with other people.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:15.000\nWhen you gravitate towards this personality type\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:19.000\nthat, you know, a lot of us in LA, I think,\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:22.000\nwe want relationships with strangers.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:28.000\nWe come out here seeking a hug from strangers.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nAnd some of us do stand-ups.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nSome of us write.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nSome of us direct.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nSome of us act.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:38.000\nBut we're kind of, a lot of us pursue some kind of craft.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nLike, oh, I'm James Dean.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:40.000\nI don't care who's watching.\n\n31:40.000 --> 31:44.000\nBut come on, you're not making brick walls.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nAnd even if you were, people use brick walls\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nand you want people to say, what a good brick wall.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:50.000\nYou did a good job.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:55.000\nThe extreme personality that really wants validation,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nyou know, that really drives you.\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nThat's really part of your thing.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nThen you have this, you have a relationship with strangers.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:06.000\nAnd then you have this weird thing that becomes,\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nlike there's this feedback loop.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:11.000\nBut what was my point?\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nMy point was, something you said made me think,\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nlike, you know, I think the most complicated thing\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nabout all of this is that we all give ourselves\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:21.000\nso much more credit than we think we do.\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nLike, everyone comes into every exchange almost,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nlike, as an underdog.\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nEverybody thinks that they're the one\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nthat needs to stick up for themselves.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nWe don't look at you and think of you as an underdog.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nWe think of you as a titan.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nThat's the crazy thing, though.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:38.000\nBecause, like, you know, it's...\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nBoyfriends with their girlfriends don't look at their girlfriend\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nand think, well, like, she's the underdog.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nWe look at them.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nEverybody is holding power over us.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:48.000\nAnd we're all trying to rest power away from each other.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:51.000\nAnd that's why relationships go bad.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.000\nYes, because everybody is sticking up for themselves.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nWe said last week that, you know, we talked,\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nor it was a week or two ago, that we talked about,\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nor it could have been fucking months ago,\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:03.000\nabout, like, when people come to you and are weird,\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nthey want to find out if you think they're smart.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nIf people want to come to me and find out\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nif I think they're cool.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nWhat do you want from other people?\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\nWhen you go...\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nLike, if you shake hands with these folks after the show,\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nwhen we were on tour, like, walking on the street\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nfrom Aaron, from anybody, like,\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nwhat is it that you want from them?\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nWhat are you being worried about?\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nWell, I just...\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nI always just wanted people to tell me\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.000\nthat there was a reason why I was born,\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nthat I was... I don't know, I just want efficacy,\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:35.000\nor not efficacy, like, you know,\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\ncontribution, value.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nTo be loved?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:44.000\nI think the part of my condition is, like,\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:48.000\nthat love, like,\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:51.000\nI think that, like, there's circuits\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:55.000\nthat go through my circuit board that are...\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nThere's parts of the board that are, like,\n\n33:57.000 --> 34:00.000\nhave this carbon scoring on them, on it.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nAnd then, so then there's either through a detour,\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:04.000\nor it...\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nI intellectualize love.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:10.000\nI think of love as a thing that is very conditional,\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:12.000\nas very, like, you know,\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nit's a thing that you don't just get\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nbecause you're someone's son.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nBut when you go on a comment section on the internet,\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nwhat are you looking for?\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nWhat are you hoping you hear?\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nHe's amazing.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:28.000\nHe did a great job. Like, he's really, really good.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nWhat's the worst thing that you...\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:32.000\nWhat's the thing that you're looking...\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:34.000\nAre you aiming at a certain thing that you don't want to hear?\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:37.000\nHe's a fraud. He's overrated.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nHe's pretentious. He doesn't...\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nHe thinks that he's special and he's not.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:46.000\nHe's a completely ordinary, completely lucky person\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.000\nwho just wandered into my attention\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nand he does not have any right to have it.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:54.000\nSo how do you feel right now?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nDo you have the right to have that opinion of yourself?\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:58.000\nDo you feel that you're not too big for your boots\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:00.000\nthat you deserve all this?\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:03.000\nThe boots keep changing size as I keep walking forward\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nand keep ending up in different climates.\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nSo the answer is no. That's an open-ended thing.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nYes. That's what will never change.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nI think if you focus on that, I think that's sickness.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nI think that's the thing. You can't...\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nYou're never going to win that game.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\nAnd you're not going to arrive at a point where...\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nIt's not empirical. You can't measure it.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nYou will only... That's co-dependence.\n\n35:21.000 --> 35:23.000\nLike, you're going like, you have to fill this unfillable hole\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:26.000\nand you can't... You have to actually self-actualize\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nand go, oh, I know what I do and what I don't do.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nI'm comfortable with it.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nMost of all, I do my work and I step back.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nI just do it because I like to do it\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nand I'm done doing it now and I step back\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nand that's what a perfect person does.\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:42.000\nBut the weird irony is that a lot of perfect people don't...\n\n35:42.000 --> 35:45.000\nThey don't tend to get that pin out, you know?\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nIt's an interesting thing though\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:50.000\nthat, you know, we all think of ourselves as underdogs\n\n35:50.000 --> 35:53.000\nand I think we all look at other people.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nLike, I can look around the room right now\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nand you're strangers and you're eye contact.\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nLike, that's another person.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nI don't know what their thing is. They might...\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nThey're thinking, I paid $10 for this.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nThey might... Yeah.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:08.000\nThis is like sitting with my brother.\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:11.000\nWho's just sleeping on my couch\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nand just complaining about his parents.\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nWe all cast ourselves as underdogs,\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:18.000\nbut it's interesting to find out that we freak...\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.000\nLike, Spencer, like...\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nWhat?\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:27.000\nLike, you would be freaked out to find out that you're...\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nThere was a show when Dan was talking about\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nlike, he's a better writer than me.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nLike, you're a genius. You're half his age.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.000\nLike, it's weird to find out that we all look up to each other.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nThat we all look at other human beings and go,\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:40.000\noh, that person, there's a weird sparkle in their eye.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:42.000\nThere's a tilt of their head.\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:44.000\nThey go, I wish I could do that too.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:47.000\nWe all fucking... We all aspire to other people\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:50.000\nand if we could all be, and I think that's that superhero wish,\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:52.000\nthat superpower wish, if we all look around and go,\n\n36:52.000 --> 36:54.000\nI wish I could sit as tall as that guy\n\n36:54.000 --> 36:56.000\nand I wish I could be as sexy as her\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.000\nand I wish I could like... I wish I could...\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nI wish I could do that dumb thing with my face\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nthat that guy does all the time.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nI wish I could... I wish I could...\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nI had the balls to wear that shirt.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:09.000\nWhere are you from? My sympathies.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:16.000\nYou're the shittiest Don Rickles of all time.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\nBut Don Rickles will walk out and he would make fun of every race\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:22.000\nbut think it somehow was uplifting because the idea is that...\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:25.000\nBecause most of the races were actively oppressed\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nand couldn't do anything about it.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nBecause it's all arbitrary.\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:33.000\nAll racism is such a fucking completely arbitrary arrow thrown at nothing\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:37.000\nand all we are is afraid of other people looking at us\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nand everything is a mirror\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nand it's very interesting to look at...\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:44.000\nIf I could give any advice to anybody,\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:46.000\nbut surround yourself with heroes\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:48.000\nand live your life around people that you look up to\n\n37:48.000 --> 37:50.000\nthat are smarter than you.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nIf you're the smartest person in your group of friends\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:54.000\nyou have a bad group of friends.\n\n37:54.000 --> 37:57.000\nYou should be intimidated by your significant other.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nYou should look up to her or him\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:02.000\nand we should all be working with people\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:05.000\nthat are better at the things we want to be good at.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:08.000\nBut it's amazing to find out that you\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:11.000\nwho has the show and has community and has the stuff\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:15.000\nthat really you have an incredibly low self-opinion\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:18.000\nmixed with an incredibly high self-opinion\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nand that's a chicken or the egg kind of thing\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:24.000\nlike is it self-love or self-loathing that begets the other one.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:29.000\nBut it's crazy to find out that we're all really, really concerned\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nthat we're worthless.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:34.000\nYeah, you'd think that would unify us.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:37.000\nYou would think that we would stop...\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:40.000\nThis show is a unification of people who want to find out\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:43.000\nthat it's okay to feel worthless because we're not.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:47.000\nI think that's what a lot of, and I hate to use the word nerd,\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nbut nerd culture, geek culture, intellectual culture\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nis a bunch of people who are like,\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:54.000\nI've been kicked around a lot\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:57.000\nbut I'm pretty sure that I'm doing it just as good as I can\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:00.000\nand we think about it more.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:05.000\nThe unexamined life is a life not worth living,\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:09.000\nwe're people who think about it too much.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nI think Kurt Vonnegut said,\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nwhat if you examine your life and it comes up fucking garbage?\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nYeah, then you win!\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:21.000\nWe're a room full of people who have...\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nthe stakes are high.\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nWe actually care about how the world perceives us.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nI think the people that are the bullies,\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:30.000\nthe people that are the jocks, the people that are the dominant...\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nthe people that are in Congress\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:34.000\ndicking around our country and our Constitution\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:36.000\nand all over the world...\n\n39:36.000 --> 39:40.000\nthere are people who do not consider what they fucking look like.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:44.000\nI think they think that by bullshitting around the room all day long\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:46.000\nthat they're doing it just right.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:51.000\nThis is the thing about the archetype of the old white man in the suit\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nthat controls everything and owns everything.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nI think the thing that makes that archetype a villain\n\n39:56.000 --> 40:01.000\nis the one missing ingredient where that person doesn't do that thing\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nthat doesn't say, I'm doing this by the way\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:07.000\nbecause I'm really concerned that if I didn't do it I would be worthless.\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nIt just seems like such a crime.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:14.000\nTo me, I'm coming from this place on the hungry, hungry hippo arena.\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:19.000\nMy hippo comes from the place of...\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nbecause that game is all about what angle you're coming in on.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nThat was a horrible metaphor.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:27.000\nIt's horrible if you're born after 1982.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:32.000\nMy battle bot is designed around the principle\n\n40:32.000 --> 40:37.000\nthat if you are sincere, if you're transparent\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nthen you're going to have a ton of problems.\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.000\nYou're going to constantly be made fun of.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nPeople are going to be going like, what?\n\n40:43.000 --> 40:44.000\nWhat did you just say?\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:45.000\nYou're not allowed to be specific.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nYou just hurt my feelings.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nYou're punished for being specific.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nYou just said it wrong.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nYou just did this and that.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:52.000\nYou do that, that's fucked up.\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:56.000\nYou're going to have to deal with that, go through that.\n\n40:56.000 --> 41:00.000\nI think maturity for the transparent person is like,\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:01.000\nyou have to deal with it.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:04.000\nYour transparency, if it includes an image of you\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:06.000\nhaving your feelings hurt because you're so transparent\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:08.000\nis not true transparency.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:11.000\nIt's another stained glass window with you as a saint\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nand it's distorting the light that's coming through.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:20.000\nMy goal is transparency, is just going like,\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:23.000\nlook, I don't know if I'm a good person or a bad person\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:25.000\nbut I got to be honest.\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:30.000\nI know for sure that thinking one thing and saying another\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:34.000\nit may seem in the moment like it's a really good idea\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nbut it's a really slippery slope.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:41.000\nYou're cursed with being an intellectual.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nThat's a stupid word.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:44.000\nIt's tough.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:45.000\nIt could be rough.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:48.000\nThe thing is, if you think about things,\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.000\nthings are fucking tough.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:56.000\nThe Odyssey, Homer, the stories about heroes,\n\n41:56.000 --> 41:57.000\nthey didn't think a lot.\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nThey just went out and they fought dragons and they did shit.\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nBut like later on, as life goes on,\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:04.000\nwe become intellectualized and we think about everything too much\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.000\nand we become crippled by it.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\nWhich is why we've created a new character in Harmontown\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:13.000\nthat we're going to introduce right now called Johnny Jackhammer,\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nthe man in the street.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nLet's go and get Johnny.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nJohnny Jackhammer.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:24.000\nLet's open the window and talk down to him.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:28.000\nHey Johnny Jackhammer, what are you doing down there?\n\n42:28.000 --> 42:31.000\nHey, Dan Harmon, what the fuck?\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:36.000\nHey, I'm just Jackhammering the street.\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:41.000\nHey Johnny Jackhammer, why is your theme country music?\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nI don't know, I can't hear much.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nI Jackhammer for a living.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:48.000\nIt's a little distracting that it keeps going on.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:51.000\nYeah, that's true.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:56.000\nThis is Johnny Jackhammer, Obama or Clinton.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:59.000\nHey, they're all a bunch of guys that don't know how to Jackhammer.\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:02.000\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:04.000\nThat's true.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:05.000\nThat's true.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:06.000\nI say, hey, you know what I say?\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:09.000\nTake two of these guys, these congressmen's or whatever.\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nYou give them each a Jackhammer.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:15.000\nWhoever can tear up more street, that's who gets my vote, you know?\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:16.000\nAh, you know what?\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:21.000\nThat's some blue collar wisdom.\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:25.000\nSometimes things aren't as complicated as we burden ourselves with thinking.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:28.000\nJohnny Jackhammer, everybody.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nOh, oh, one more thing.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:34.000\nYou know, we should build a war on the country because fuck everyone that ain't white.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.000\nOh, shit, goddammit, Johnny.\n\n43:36.000 --> 43:38.000\nJohnny, Johnny, no.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:41.000\nGoddammit, he was so close to being our Will Rogers.\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:44.000\nJohnny, Johnny, just get in the car and get in the car.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.000\nI hate black people.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:49.000\nI'm the good Jackhammer of the black people.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nOh, Johnny.\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nOh, Johnny.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nGoddammit.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nI thought we found a hero.\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:59.000\nI thought we found the key to our nation's lock.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nJohnny, just get in the car and go back to the hotel.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:02.000\nYeah, I can't jack up.\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:04.000\nJackhammer in the car.\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:06.000\nNo, Johnny, don't jackhammer in the car.\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:09.000\nCG.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nHoly fuck.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:22.000\nJohnny Jackhammer started jackhammering in the car.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:30.000\nBut he went through the floor of the car and the car flipped up like the Nazi van and raiders.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:40.000\nAnd just flipped and hit a gas station, which as we all know is full of gas, and will explode on impact.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.000\nYou know why?\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:44.000\nBecause Johnny didn't think of himself as an underdog.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:46.000\nHe, yeah, no.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:48.000\nIn his head, he still had one little secret.\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:50.000\nYeah, he put himself above other races.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:52.000\nThat's the biggest crime you can commit.\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:57.000\nI think that's where bigotry comes from, the idea that you can exert your will over other people.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nWhereas I think we all come in low.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:02.000\nWe're punished for coming underneath other people, you know.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:05.000\nWe're not punished for, we're rewarded for.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nRight.\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nMeanwhile, Spencer over there.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:10.000\nI'm over here.\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.000\nMy back hurts, you guys.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:13.000\nIt's fucked up.\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:18.000\nIf anyone's been looking at me like I've had to take it, like this guy's moving around like he's got a shit.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nThat's what I've been doing, my back just hurts.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nWhat's wrong with your back, Spencer?\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:26.000\nI don't know, it's just, I can't, like, it's not comfortable right now.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.000\nI don't know.\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:28.000\nI can lay down.\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:29.000\nLay down?\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:30.000\nNah, that would be engaging.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:31.000\nJust lay down for us, Spencer.\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:36.000\nJust lay down on the floor and do like, David Milch wrote all of Deadwood from the floor.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:37.000\nLike, just facing up.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.000\nIs anybody here a masseuse or a masseur?\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:39.000\nWhat are you right on?\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:40.000\nAnybody here?\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:42.000\nNo, I don't, I'm not acting.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nEveryone's backwards.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:49.000\nWait, wait, we have a bunch of people in the front row who's back hurts.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nBill's back hurts.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nJay's back hurts.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:52.000\nOkay.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:54.000\nAnybody else?\n\n45:54.000 --> 45:55.000\nWho has a bad back here?\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:56.000\nMy back hurts.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:57.000\nYour neck hurts?\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:58.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:01.000\nPodcast listeners, everyone's holding up their hands.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:11.000\nI'm going to get the number for this woman, Destiny, who, she, I think I have her number.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:16.000\nChris McKenna started bringing her in like season two or three on Destiny.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:21.000\nLike when the, when the community writers would do a couple, couple all nighters or something,\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:25.000\nlike he'd pay to bring in this, this masseuse Destiny.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:30.000\nShe'd set up like a little masseuse table in a, in a vacant office and the writers would\n\n46:30.000 --> 46:31.000\ngo in.\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:32.000\nI've never partaken.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:37.000\nI can't, I don't like the idea of someone who's, who's touched multiple people professionally,\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nactually seeing my naked back.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:42.640\nI don't, I don't like, I don't, it's an inferiority thing.\n\n46:42.640 --> 46:44.760\nIt's not like a phobic thing.\n\n46:44.760 --> 46:48.600\nIs that related at all to your, like, you're not a huggy person or a touchy person.\n\n46:48.600 --> 46:49.600\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:49.600 --> 46:52.000\nCause I'm worried I'm going to, I'm making the other person dirty.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:53.000\nFor real?\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:54.000\nYeah.\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:59.400\nI feel like, like, if a, if a girl hugs me, like I'm going like, ugh, I just, I made\n\n46:59.400 --> 47:01.000\na girl stinky.\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:06.000\nWas it like when you're with like a girlfriend, like, like with Erin or something like that?\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:10.760\nI take a lot of showers while I'm courting her and then, and then we, and then we move\n\n47:10.760 --> 47:16.000\nin together and then, then I just get back to work and tapers off a bit.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:22.000\nI have a force field of, of flies around me and I, and I keep thinking like, ah, we'll\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\ndeal with this in a little bit.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nI was just going to get another paycheck.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:29.000\nBut is that, is the not washing healthy?\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:30.000\nNo, no, no, I'm not saying that.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:35.000\nIs it, is it a, is that a way like subconscious or semi-conscious way to repel people?\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nIs that a way of keeping distance?\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:38.000\nYes.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nYes.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:43.000\nI'm just observing it objectively.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:44.000\nYeah, probably.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:45.000\nProbably.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:46.000\nYeah.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.680\nIt's like, and it's like, let's say people, if you let people in physically, like to hug\n\n47:48.680 --> 47:54.160\nyou, to hold you, that goes back to some serious like, childs and stuff, I would imagine.\n\n47:54.160 --> 48:00.280\nBut also like that, that's, that's so, it's not funny, like it's, it's not funny.\n\n48:00.280 --> 48:01.280\nIt's hilarious.\n\n48:01.280 --> 48:02.280\nHey, speak for yourself!\n\n48:02.280 --> 48:03.280\nHey Johnny!\n\n48:03.280 --> 48:08.280\nHey, keep it down up there, I'm trying to jackhammer.\n\n48:08.280 --> 48:12.280\nJohnny, you're going to jail for killing five black people.\n\n48:12.280 --> 48:17.280\nHey, hey, look, you know, we all love each other, right?\n\n48:17.280 --> 48:19.280\nIt's like the great Don Rickles said.\n\n48:19.280 --> 48:22.280\nYou see, Dan's trying to keep me away from this conversation.\n\n48:22.280 --> 48:27.280\nYou're using Johnny jackhammer as a way to keep me from getting away from this market.\n\n48:27.280 --> 48:30.280\nAll I'm saying is I get it, you know, the whole thing, the repressed memories.\n\n48:30.280 --> 48:32.280\nI'm going to get up and hug you, Dan.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:34.280\nAll the jokes in the world.\n\n48:34.280 --> 48:35.280\nAll the jokes.\n\n48:35.280 --> 48:40.280\nAt the end of the day, you're either jacking up the concrete or you're not, hey, you know,\n\n48:40.280 --> 48:42.280\nif you are, you're not.\n\n48:42.280 --> 48:47.280\nJeff's coming in for a hug.\n\n48:47.280 --> 48:49.280\nI'm going to hug you, Dan.\n\n48:49.280 --> 48:53.280\nLook, no, before we do it, you don't like it.\n\n48:53.280 --> 48:54.280\nThis is not comfortable for you.\n\n48:54.280 --> 48:56.280\nYou want to let me know that?\n\n48:56.280 --> 48:58.280\nI'm just saying bodily.\n\n48:58.280 --> 48:59.280\nYou okay?\n\n48:59.280 --> 49:00.280\nYeah, yeah.\n\n49:00.280 --> 49:02.280\nNo, no, I'm fucking getting close.\n\n49:02.280 --> 49:04.280\nThat's not a hug.\n\n49:16.280 --> 49:19.280\nIt's podcast gold.\n\n49:19.280 --> 49:21.280\nI will tell you this though.\n\n49:21.280 --> 49:23.280\nI'm never going to watch this cheek again.\n\n49:23.280 --> 49:29.280\nWhen it's intellectualized, like I went to the communicon last week and the interesting thing is\n\n49:29.280 --> 49:34.280\nthis happens a lot at communicon, at the Harmontownships and stuff.\n\n49:34.280 --> 49:37.280\nSomebody will breach the bubble.\n\n49:37.280 --> 49:43.280\nSomebody will just say, can I have a hug or something?\n\n49:43.280 --> 49:44.280\nThey'll make a request.\n\n49:44.280 --> 49:45.280\nI'll go, one more thing.\n\n49:45.280 --> 49:46.280\nCan I have a hug?\n\n49:46.280 --> 49:47.280\nAnd I'll go, of course you can.\n\n49:47.280 --> 49:49.280\nWho would say no to that?\n\n49:49.280 --> 49:53.280\nAnd it's like, because they made this request, it's like, well, if I make you stinky with my hug,\n\n49:53.280 --> 49:54.280\nyou asked for it.\n\n49:54.280 --> 49:56.280\nYou can't go home and complain.\n\n49:56.280 --> 49:58.280\nGet on your blog and go, like, and then I...\n\n49:58.280 --> 50:01.280\nI asked him for a hug and he made me so gross.\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:03.280\nI woke up gross.\n\n50:03.280 --> 50:07.280\nSo he kind of takes the pressure off and then a solicited hug and then he hug.\n\n50:07.280 --> 50:09.280\nAnd then there's a line of people.\n\n50:09.280 --> 50:13.280\nThen all of a sudden everybody starts going, can I have a hug?\n\n50:13.280 --> 50:15.280\nAnd it's really nice.\n\n50:15.280 --> 50:16.280\nIt's the best.\n\n50:16.280 --> 50:19.280\nIt's a very gooey therapy thing.\n\n50:19.280 --> 50:24.280\nYou can feel people's bodies kind of trembling a little bit because they're like, oh.\n\n50:24.280 --> 50:29.280\nYou know, like, it's nice.\n\n50:29.280 --> 50:37.280\nCould you feel my body trembling then?\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:41.280\nYes, I don't know.\n\n50:41.280 --> 50:42.280\nAll right.\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:44.280\nSo where were we?\n\n50:44.280 --> 50:46.280\nWe were delving into your psychosis.\n\n50:46.280 --> 50:48.280\nAll right.\n\n50:48.280 --> 50:49.280\nPsychosis.\n\n50:49.280 --> 50:51.280\nI heard this theory at all.\n\n50:51.280 --> 50:52.280\nJohnny, get back in the car.\n\n50:52.280 --> 50:54.280\nYour brain's got a different part for every part.\n\n50:54.280 --> 50:56.280\nAll your mom's repressed memories and all.\n\n50:56.280 --> 50:58.280\nHey, look, I got two parts of my brain.\n\n50:58.280 --> 51:02.280\nCoffee break and jackhammering, you know?\n\n51:02.280 --> 51:03.280\nLike, you gotta...\n\n51:03.280 --> 51:08.280\nHey, I punch in against 650 if I don't jackhammer the concrete, you know?\n\n51:08.280 --> 51:10.280\nIt ain't that complicated.\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:11.280\nYeah, life...\n\n51:11.280 --> 51:16.280\nThe BQE needs to be connected to the 110.\n\n51:16.280 --> 51:18.280\nIs that true?\n\n51:18.280 --> 51:21.280\nIt's a big job.\n\n51:21.280 --> 51:25.280\nIt was one of the major engineering feats of the 20th century.\n\n51:25.280 --> 51:28.280\nAnd I'm going to do it all with

there's still concrete out there that ain't jacked.\n\n52:20.280 --> 52:22.280\nThe only thing you're jackhammering, Johnny,\n\n52:22.280 --> 52:26.280\nthe only thing you're jackhammering is your relationships with the people that are closest to you\n\n52:26.280 --> 52:28.280\nand the people that care about you the most.\n\n52:28.280 --> 52:30.280\nIt's all fuckin' good for you, you

52:51.280\nJohnny, I'm dying.\n\n52:51.280 --> 52:53.280\nI have liver cancer.\n\n52:55.280 --> 52:56.280\nAgain?\n\n52:56.280 --> 53:01.280\nI'm sorry about jackhammering your anus with my pinky.\n\n53:01.280 --> 53:03.280\nIt was a long time ago.\n\n53:03.280 --> 53:05.280\nIt was a different time, and I was a different person,\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:09.280\nbut I've realized now what's important to me is to be connected.\n\n53:09.280 --> 53:14.280\nI want to lay some pavement between you and I that is unbroken\n\n53:14.280 --> 53:19.280\nso I can walk over to you like men, like

jackhammer and racial epithets and whatnot.\n\n54:59.280 --> 55:02.280\nThey made me leave the hammer at the terminal.\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:04.280\nJohnny, Johnny.\n\n55:04.280 --> 55:05.280\nYeah,

obstructing his throat.\n\n55:14.280 --> 55:17.280\nOh, it's so much more brittle than pavement.\n\n55:17.280 --> 55:20.280\nIf I only had it, didn't implement.\n\n55:20.280 --> 55:22.280\nDo it, Johnny.\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:24.280\nGo the distance.\n\n55:24.280 --> 55:29.280\nNo!\n\n55:29.280 --> 55:31.280\nJohnny!\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:33.280\nNo, I wasn't dying, Johnny.\n\n55:33.280 --> 55:36.280\nI didn't want you to use the jackhammer again.\n\n55:36.280 --> 55:39.280\nI don't understand.\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:41.280\nI pretended to be dying to prove\n\n55:41.280 --> 55:43.280\nyou didn't need to use the jackhammer again.\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:45.280\nOh.\n\n55:45.280 --> 55:47.280\nWell, I don't have a jackhammer.\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:49.280\nThey let me leave it at the

improviser.\n\n56:14.280 --> 56:18.280\nIntellectual child molester.\n\n56:18.280 --> 56:20.280\nI thought you were going to...\n\n56:20.280 --> 56:22.280\nWhen the father was flatlining,\n\n56:22.280 --> 56:24.280\nyou were going to jackhammer his heart back to life.\n\n56:24.280 --> 56:25.280\nWell, I know.\n\n56:25.280 --> 56:26.280\nAnd then when I did, you said,\n\n56:26.280 --> 56:28.280\nNo, but you just don't do that.\n\n56:28.280 --> 56:30.280\nWell, no, I thought you were fake doing it.\n\n56:30.280 --> 56:31.280\nFake doing it?\n\n56:31.280 --> 56:32.280\nI don't have a...\n\n56:32.280 --> 56:34.280\nI'm miming jack...\n\n56:34.280 --> 56:36.280\nI thought you were fake doing it\n\n56:36.280 --> 56:38.280\nfor our radio play.\n\n56:38.280 --> 56:40.280\nI mean, I just...\n\n56:40.280 --> 56:43.280\nI thought you were fake doing it\n\n56:43.280 --> 56:45.280\nfor our radio play.\n\n56:45.280 --> 56:47.280\nI mean, I just...\n\n56:47.280 --> 56:49.280\nI should have been clearer.\n\n56:49.280 --> 56:51.280\nI was miming a real jackhammer\n\n56:51.280 --> 56:53.280\nand not miming a guy's...\n\n56:53.280 --> 56:55.280\nBecause up until then,\n\n56:55.280 --> 56:57.280\nyou did the pantomime jackhammer.\n\n56:57.280 --> 56:59.280\nYou were doing the pantomime jackhammer.\n\n56:59.280 --> 57:01.280\nWe'll do notes.\n\n57:01.280 --> 57:05.280\nGo to Harmontown.com for Harmontown after hours\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:08.280\nwhere we do notes about our improv.\n\n57:08.280 --> 57:11.280\nAll right, let's crank up\n\n57:11.280 --> 57:13.280\nsome real role-playing, right?\n\n57:13.280 --> 57:15.280\nWith some D&D.\n\n57:15.280 --> 57:17.280\nYeah, get your shit out, man.\n\n57:17.280 --> 57:18.280\nWhat are you doing?\n\n57:18.280 --> 57:20.280\nI didn't think you'd go at 9.02.\n\n57:20.280 --> 57:21.280\nI mean...\n\n57:21.280 --> 57:23.280\nYeah, but like, 8.20.\n\n57:23.280 --> 57:24.280\nYeah, well...\n\n57:24.280 --> 57:26.280\nAnd then never spoke to you again.\n\n57:26.280 --> 57:27.280\nYeah.\n\n57:27.280 --> 57:28.280\nI guess, yeah.\n\n57:28.280 --> 57:30.280\nCamille's not here.\n\n57:30.280 --> 57:32.280\nAaron's not

57:37.280\nYeah.\n\n57:37.280 --> 57:40.280\nHe's drinking at the drawing with my girlfriend right now.\n\n57:41.280 --> 57:42.280\nI'm not joking.\n\n57:42.280 --> 57:44.280\nAll right, well, what about...\n\n57:44.280 --> 57:45.280\nWhat about Beef Steak Bill?\n\n57:45.280 --> 57:47.280\nWe're gonna bring him up and play.\n\n57:47.280 --> 57:49.280\nHave him play Beef Steak Bill.\n\n57:54.280 --> 57:56.280\nLook at these shirts, man.\n\n57:56.280 --> 57:58.280\nBeef Steak Bill's got the...\n\n57:58.280 --> 58:02.280\nYeah, can we discuss your grammar, Bill?\n\n58:02.280 --> 58:04.280\nWhere does one acquire?\n\n58:04.280 --> 58:05.280\nIs that velour?\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:07.280\nIt's flocked.\n\n58:07.280 --> 58:10.280\nIt's kind of a satin thing with a...\n\n58:10.280 --> 58:13.280\nYeah, I got it at some goth shop in Boston\n\n58:13.280 --> 58:15.280\na long time ago before the close.\n\n58:15.280 --> 58:16.280\nBoston?\n\n58:16.280 --> 58:17.280\nOh, wait, no.\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:19.280\nI got this at Vaudeville Trash in New York.\n\n58:19.280 --> 58:20.280\nSorry.\n\n58:23.280 --> 58:24.280\nIt's good.\n\n58:24.280 --> 58:25.280\nDidn't offend me.\n\n58:27.280 --> 58:29.280\nHow do you wash something like that?\n\n58:29.280 --> 58:30.280\nIt's kind of different rules.\n\n58:30.280 --> 58:31.280\nDry cleaner.\n\n58:34.280 --> 58:35.280\nAll right.\n\n58:35.280 --> 58:40.280\nYou know, Jeff, how often do you dry clean your suits there?\n\n58:40.280 --> 58:41.280\nAll the time.\n\n58:41.280 --> 58:44.280\nThat sucks, you know, that kills your suits real fast.\n\n58:44.280 --> 58:46.280\nNo, it keeps them good.\n\n58:46.280 --> 58:49.280\nI mean, you know, dry cleaning involves tons of\n\n58:49.280 --> 58:50.280\ncost to chemicals.\n\n58:50.280 --> 58:52.280\nNo, not my dry cleaner.\n\n58:52.280 --> 58:54.280\nWhat's your dry cleaner?\n\n58:54.280 --> 58:56.280\nMy dry cleaner is a couple of wonderful Korean ladies\n\n58:56.280 --> 58:58.280\nwho take very, very good care of everything I have.\n\n58:58.280 --> 58:59.280\nWhat's the brand?\n\n58:59.280 --> 59:00.280\nWhat?\n\n59:00.280 --> 59:01.280\nWhere are they located?\n\n59:01.280 --> 59:02.280\nI'm not gonna tell everybody.\n\n59:02.280 --> 59:03.280\nWhat are their hours?\n\n59:03.280 --> 59:05.280\nIf I say the hours and the location,\n\n59:05.280 --> 59:07.280\nand everyone that listens to this is gonna go\n\n59:07.280 --> 59:11.280\nand get me, like, I'll be standing in the line\n\n59:11.280 --> 59:12.280\nto get my suits out.\n\n59:12.280 --> 59:15.280\nAnd we can get, like, $50.\n\n59:19.280 --> 59:21.280\nFind out next time.\n\n59:22.280 --> 59:24.280\nDo you guys want your sheets?\n\n59:24.280 --> 59:25.280\nYes, I want my sheets.\n\n59:25.280 --> 59:28.280\nBill, be a lamb and dispense our sheets for us, will you?\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:31.280\nIs the fear that if people knew when you got your dry cleaner\n\n59:31.280 --> 59:32.280\nthat they would show up and get their dry cleaner\n\n59:32.280 --> 59:33.280\ndone at the same time?\n\n59:33.280 --> 59:35.280\nMy dry cleaner is a hidden gem.\n\n59:35.280 --> 59:37.280\nIt's a local secret.\n\n59:37.280 --> 59:39.280\nAnd if I told everybody...\n\n59:39.280 --> 59:41.280\nNo one here fucking dry cleans anything.\n\n59:44.280 --> 59:46.280\nI like the fact that if I walk in there\n\n59:46.280 --> 59:48.280\nand they say, when do you need this?\n\n59:48.280 --> 59:51.280\nAnd I give them a little look and they go,\n\n59:51.280 --> 59:53.280\ncome back at five.\n\n59:53.280 --> 59:55.280\nAnd if I told the whole world that,\n\n59:55.280 --> 59:57.280\nthat might infringe my ability to get my shit\n\n59:57.280 --> 59:58.280\nright when I want it.\n\n59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.280\nI just don't think that they don't use\n\n01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.280\ncost of chemicals.\n\n01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.280\nI think they definitely do.\n\n01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.280\nLook, it's called dry cleaning, which is a misnomer.\n\n01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.280\nThere's certainly liquids involved.\n\n01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.280\nAnd yes, there are chemicals involved, but they make...\n\n01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.280\nPoisons.\n\n01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.280\nSpencer, will you describe a monster in a dungeon\n\n01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.280\ncalled the caustic dry cleaner?\n\n01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.280\nOkay, okay.\n\n01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.280\nSweeping aside hundreds of press suits, you see it.\n\n01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.280\nIn a sink full of bubbling pinks and blues,\n\n01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.280\nspilled plastic bottles,\n\n01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.280\nyou see a rising and falling surface\n\n01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.280\nof caustic boiling, bubbling fluids.\n\n01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.280\nThat's all, I don't know.\n\n01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.280\nDidn't really build anywhere.\n\n01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.280\nI didn't deserve that, thanks guys.\n\n01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.280\nI mean, there's a way...\n\n01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.280\nI've chosen my life and it suits.\n\n01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.280\nI spend a lot of money on dry cleaning.\n\n01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.280\nDo you have a suit brush?\n\n01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.280\nI don't have a suit brush.\n\n01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280\nYou get a suit brush, you brush your suit down\n\n01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.280\nafter you wear it, you press it yourself.\n\n01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.280\nYou don't have to clean that except once every five times.\n\n01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.280\nCan you take a vacation off of my cock for five seconds?\n\n01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.280\nI just admire a good suit, you know,\n\n01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.280\nand I don't want to see him shredded by some poison.\n\n01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.280\nI've had this suit for six years\n\n01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.280\nand it's never shown a dimple.\n\n01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.280\nSo tired.\n\n01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.280\nHow many suits do you have, Spencer?\n\n01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.280\nI have three.\n\n01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.280\nWill you wear a suit next time, Anton?\n\n01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.280\nI mean, if you guys want.\n\n01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280\nYeah, I am.\n\n01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.280\nI wonder if they fit.\n\n01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280\nI don't wear them very often.\n\n01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280\nWhy do you have three suits?\n\n01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.280\nBecause most men have one or two.\n\n01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.280\nYeah, one of them is a real suit.\n\n01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.280\nTwo of them are like,\n\n01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.280\nI want to say Wells Fargo suit, but I mean Goodwill suit,\n\n01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.280\nwhich I don't know, that doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.280\nWells Fargo, they were brought to you on a covered wagon.\n\n01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.280\nYeah, like Goodwill suits and stuff.\n\n01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280\nRight.\n\n01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280\nYeah.\n\n01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.280\nDo you wear these ever?\n\n01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.280\nNo, I mean, you just ask how many I have.\n\n01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.280\nThat's how many.\n\n01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280\nThree.\n\n01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.280\nMy weight fluctuates so much and I'm so old\n\n01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.280\nthat like every time I have to wear a suit for like a wedding.\n\n01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280\nThat's why you get a suit.\n\n01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280\nI open my closet and there's just this,\n\n01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280\nthere's a bunch of dry cleaning bags\n\n01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280\nbecause God knows when.\n\n01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.280\nLike, and there's like, they're always mixed up\n\n01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.280\nand like, I have to do this humiliating thing\n\n01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.280\nwhere I get out each pair of pants.\n\n01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280\nThey're all gray.\n\n01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280\nThey're all charcoal gray.\n\n01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280\nI can't tell the difference between any of them except like,\n\n01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280\noh, this one was from when I was twice as fat as I am now.\n\n01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280\nThis one was from when I was twice as thin as I am now.\n\n01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280\nIt's like terrible.\n\n01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.280\nYeah, but my advice is, it's not good advice,\n\n01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.280\nbut it's my advice is to, for gentlemen,\n\n01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280\nbuy a really expensive suit at your optimum weight\n\n01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.280\nand it will form.\n\n01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280\nOptimum meaning like.\n\n01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.280\nMeaning like you're thinnest, you're best,\n\n01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.280\nyou're fighting weight, you're college weight.\n\n01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.280\nLike get down to a good weight, get a suit,\n\n01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.280\nhave it tailored, make it fit you,\n\n01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.280\nand then it will force you.\n\n01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.280\nYou're like, I want to wear that suit in fucking two weeks\n\n01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.280\nbecause it's Thanksgiving or this or whatever.\n\n01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.280\nAnd you go like, I can't let the suit out five inches.\n\n01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.280\nIf that was going to motivate, I see what you're,\n\n01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.280\nthat's clever, but before,\n\n01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:27.280\nbefore the ability to wear a suit would motivate me to lose weight.\n\n01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.280\nI'm looking like a monster would motivate me.\n\n01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.280\nI feel like nudity is that suit you're talking about.\n\n01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280\nIt should be.\n\n01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.280\nLike I should like see myself brushing my teeth and go,\n\n01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.280\nI don't want that to happen again.\n\n01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.280\nAnd yet McDonald's is delicious.\n\n01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.280\nBut a suit is designed to make men look good\n\n01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.280\nas our dresses for women, as our stockings and things.\n\n01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.280\nLike men have their fetish where guys look good in suits,\n\n01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.280\neven if you're not in perfect shape.\n\n01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280\nThat's what tailors are for.\n\n01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.280\nYou go buy a nice Italian suit if you're a little bit overweight\n\n01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.280\nand you look like fucking Marcello Mastrigani all of a sudden.\n\n01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.280\nAnd the thing is, go to fucking Banana Republic,\n\n01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.280\nbuy a $150 suit.\n\n01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280\nDo they have those? $200? I don't know.\n\n01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.280\nAnd then go spend $30 at a tailor\n\n01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280\nand you have a fucking suit.\n\n01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280\nBut you have to stay at that weight.\n\n01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.280\nOr you have to have 900 suits,\n\n01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.280\ndepending on how many donuts you've eaten that week.\n\n01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.280\nWhereas Bill has just chosen the gay magician look,\n\n01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.280\nwhich I think is fantastic.\n\n01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.280\nIt felt like he just lashed out at you at the end for no reason.\n\n01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.280\nThanks, man.\n\n01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.280\nIf I had more courage, I would be dressed\n\n01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.280\nas a sexy Vegas magician at all times.\n\n01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.280\nI think you look like a very straight magician, Bill.\n\n01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.280\nI thought it was disenfranchised goth kid.\n\n01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.280\nDo you know any magic tricks, Bill?\n\n01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.280\nBill, do you do any magic?\n\n01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.280\nI can make my disself disappear.\n\n01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.280\nYou can make your disself disappear.\n\n01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.280\nYou're a goth kid?\n\n01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.280\nYeah, a little bit.\n\n01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.280\nYeah?\n\n01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280\nYeah, a little bit.\n\n01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.280\nWhat was your band and school?\n\n01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.280\nSisters of Mercy.\n\n01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280\nI can see that.\n\n01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280\nDrummer, right?\n\n01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.280\nOh, that's right. We talked about that.\n\n01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280\nI love it.\n\n01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280\nWe learned more about it.\n\n01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.280\nHe became Beef Steak Bill.\n\n01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280\nYou notice I haven't called you Beef Fungus, Bill?\n\n01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.280\nI appreciate that.\n\n01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280\nYou're a Beef Boy.\n\n01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.280\nI really appreciate that.\n\n01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.280\nI like growth.\n\n01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.280\nI just don't like it on my beef.\n\n01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280\nFunny thing, though.\n\n01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.280\nSo I've been playing this iPad game.\n\n01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.280\nI've been playing this iPad game called Plague Incorporated.\n\n01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:37.280\nYou know, where you do bacteria and then virus and then fungus.\n\n01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.280\nI can't beat the fungus level.\n\n01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.280\nI'm not kidding.\n\n01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.280\nYou're like Brefie with spiders.\n\n01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.280\nI think I'm psychologically blocked on that one somehow.\n\n01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.280\nAll right.\n\n01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.280\nSpeaking of Brefie with spiders, where were we in D&D?\n\n01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.280\nOh, where were you?\n\n01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.280\nI'll tell you that.\n\n01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:00.280\nIt's a really good picture because I was interrupted at work.\n\n01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:08.280\nI know how that is.\n\n01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.280\nSo Bill, where are you born?\n\n01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.280\nWhere are you from, Bill?\n\n01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280\nIndiana.\n\n01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280\nIndiana where?\n\n01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280\nFort Wayne.\n\n01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280\nPortland?\n\n01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280\nFort Wayne.\n\n01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280\nFort Wayne.\n\n01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280\nOr Fort Lane, as we call it.\n\n01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280\nFort Lane.\n\n01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280\nLook what time it is.\n\n01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.280\nIt's northeast from Indian Oak Place.\n\n01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280\n9-11.\n\n01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.280\nBill, we were talking earlier about what we fear other people see in us.\n\n01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.280\nWhat's your fear that people see in you?\n\n01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280\nWhat's your desire?\n\n01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.280\nWhat's the thing you want people to see and respect in you?\n\n01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.280\nIntelligence, yeah.\n\n01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.280\nI think it's probably a commonality in this group, I would say, right?\n\n01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.280\nSpencer, are you?\n\n01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.280\nYeah, like, I mean, being right.\n\n01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.280\nThere's a difference between being perceived as intelligence and just being like someone\n\n01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280\nwho's right about stuff.\n\n01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.280\nLike, I don't want to, like, come off as being correcty or like, I just want, if someone\n\n01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.280\nasked me a question, I want to be the one with the right answer.\n\n01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:06.280\nYeah, because I was going to say, what a weird thing for a bunch of smart people to be worried\n\n01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.280\nabout their intelligence, which so often the case, such as personality type on the Internet\n\n01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:15.280\nis a bunch of people going like, correction point of order, I'd like to spock you on that.\n\n01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.280\nWell, I'd like to over spock you on that.\n\n01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.280\nIt's because there's like 5,000 definitions of intelligence.\n\n01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.280\nSome people want to be, you know, like, I don't want anyone to think that I went to Harvard.\n\n01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280\nQuite the contrary.\n\n01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.280\nI want people to think that I'm an autodidact.\n\n01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.280\nI want people to think that I'm a man of the people, but then I'm smart about it.\n\n01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.280\nYou know, you can split that hair so many different ways.\n\n01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:44.280\nMy biggest fear in the world is pretentiousness.\n\n01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.280\nLike, that is the concept that I'm wrong about myself.\n\n01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:55.280\nThat is my biggest nightmare, is somebody saying, you think you're this, but really you're this.\n\n01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280\nLike, that's the most hurtful thing.\n\n01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.280\nYou think you're 6 feet tall?\n\n01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.280\nYou've been 4 feet tall this whole time, like, mentally or in any way.\n\n01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.280\nLike, you think that, like, you're so fucking off.\n\n01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280\nOh man, you're off.\n\n01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.280\nSo the fear is, what was the worst version of you that people might think that you are?\n\n01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.280\nLike, you think you're, what, what would you like people to think that you are?\n\n01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.280\nWhat version of you?\n\n01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.280\nA humanitarian decent?\n\n01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.280\nAnd then you're afraid that people might think you are...\n\n01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.280\nA disgusting, caustic, selfish monster.\n\n01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.280\nWhich I know that I, that's why I celebrate that, you know.\n\n01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.280\nLike, oh, I'm a disgusting, caustic st-\n\n01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.280\nBut isn't it possible to be both?\n\n01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.280\nUh, I hope so.\n\n01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280\nRight.\n\n01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.280\nI mean, isn't there some, like, you can recognize that it's possible to be both of those things.\n\n01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.280\nLike, you're on a good day, you're this, on a bad day, you're that, but it doesn't take one,\n\n01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.280\none's not taken away from the other, right?\n\n01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280\nRight.\n\n01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.280\nWell, I would think at the same time you could be both things.\n\n01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:01.280\nLike, Han Solo has no love for the Empire, but he is also not going to be duped in by any kind of cause, necessarily.\n\n01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.280\nHe doesn't want to, he doesn't want to be tricked into giving his life for some bullshit,\n\n01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.280\nbut he's, he cares about people.\n\n01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.280\nYou want people to think you're a humanitarian?\n\n01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.280\nWell, I guess, I guess I'm just grabbing at that word, like, like, what word would you grab?\n\n01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.280\nLike, I want people to understand that I'm, like, first and foremost, I'm a big fan of our species.\n\n01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.280\nYou want to be a contributor?\n\n01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.280\nYeah.\n\n01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:34.280\nBut also that I'm, like, kind of an optimist, that I think we can do better, that I'm a champion of all of us,\n\n01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.280\nthat I'm not, like, that archetype of the troll under the bridge who's just, like, who would slit your throat\n\n01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.280\nif he could get away with it just because he doesn't feel as loved.\n\n01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.280\nYou know, like, I don't want to be that, contribute to that cycle.\n\n01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:54.280\nI want to be known as a person that said, we can do better.\n\n01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280\nBelieve in us.\n\n01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280\nI think we can do it.\n\n01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280\nYeah.\n\n01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:03.280\nAnd, and, and you can, you can be that person.\n\n01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.280\nAnd also when you're in a, when you get cornered, you can be a pessimist.\n\n01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.280\nYou can, you can be, like, I think curmudgeons and cynics are people that are the most optimist of people in the world.\n\n01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280\nLike, curmudgeon re-\n\n01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.280\nBecause you look around and you go, what the fuck are we doing?\n\n01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280\nWe're being idiots.\n\n01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.280\nCurmudgeons are people whose, whose hope was abused, whose hope was disappointed.\n\n01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280\nAnd so you can be both of those things.\n\n01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.280\nYou, you, you can be a pessimistic optimist.\n\n01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.280\nYou can, you can do both of those, right?\n\n01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.280\nBill, what's, what's the version of intelligence that you want people to perceive in you?\n\n01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280\nCoxmanship.\n\n01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.280\nI'll just go with that.\n\n01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.280\nThat's kind of a different, can you?\n\n01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280\nI don't know.\n\n01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.280\nI mean, that was, that was saying there's a hundred ways to be intelligent or to be, like, versions of intelligence.\n\n01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280\nIs there a certain way?\n\n01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:56.280\nWhat do you want it to say on the bottom of the statue that's dedicated to you as a, as a, as a thinker?\n\n01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280\nSo when you joined her.\n\n01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.280\nBut he used his brain to...\n\n01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.280\nWit would be great.\n\n01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:09.280\nIf I, if I felt like I had an incisive wit, I would be very happy.\n\n01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280\nThat's a ballsy answer.\n\n01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.280\nYeah, it's very ballsy.\n\n01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.280\nBecause that's, that's potentially embarrassing to say.\n\n01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.280\nI wish I was witty.\n\n01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.280\nI think it's better this way.\n\n01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.280\nMy fears that people don't think I know the subjunctive.\n\n01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280\nNo, that's good.\n\n01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.280\nI mean, that's, that's, that's very sincere and honest.\n\n01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.280\nTo just go like...\n\n01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.280\nI would, I would, I hope that people think I have a, I have a wit.\n\n01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280\nAnybody else out there?\n\n01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.280\nThey have a brand of intelligence or a certain kind of genre that they wish people perceived in them?\n\n01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.280\nI know, I know that's like, no one's going to raise their hand with that.\n\n01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.280\nSo when people start shouting off like eight different things and then one person, when you listen to a recording, one person went, child murder.\n\n01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.280\nTotally pretentious.\n\n01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280\nYou want people to think you're totally pretentious?\n\n01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.280\nI like reading classics.\n\n01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.280\nOh, so you want to be perceived as, as fancy?\n\n01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.280\nIs that where you die to her?\n\n01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.280\nYeah, I like Virgil and Ovid and built in.\n\n01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280\nYeah, you're pretentious.\n\n01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280\nI love that.\n\n01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280\nThere's a hand back there too.\n\n01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280\nYes?\n\n01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280\nIt seems Dan actually.\n\n01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280\nWhich is what?\n\n01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:17.280\nJust being for the betterment of, I don't know, humanity as a whole and being seen as someone who's, or, who doesn't ever want to contribute to anyone having bad...\n\n01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.280\nHere, come up and say this because you're too far from the mic.\n\n01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.280\nI'll bring the mic to you then.\n\n01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.280\nDid this just come across to you?\n\n01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.280\nI don't want to listen to your vacancy.\n\n01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280\nNow I'm really going to forget exactly what...\n\n01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.280\nYeah, but it's a hard thing to utter.\n\n01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:41.280\nI'm sorry, yeah.\n\n01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.280\nIt was just too quiet.\n\n01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:51.280\nNo, I mean, mainly it's just that I never want to contribute to...\n\n01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:58.280\nSounds so cheesy, but anyone ever having a bad day or thinking less of humanity because of me?\n\n01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.280\nYeah, I don't want to be the reason why anybody ever is going like, shit.\n\n01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.280\nNow that's all fucked, which is so ironic because I'm so off on the reason, but...\n\n01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.280\nSo then I have to think, well, that person's a bad person.\n\n01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280\nI don't want to be...\n\n01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:21.280\nI so much fear, like somebody saying, god damn it, this room would be so much better if that person would leave.\n\n01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.280\nI won't allow that to happen.\n\n01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.280\nI will not be the unwelcome guest.\n\n01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.280\nTo the point where I would cut my own face, I would jump out of a skylight,\n\n01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.280\nI would blow up the fucking building before I went to it.\n\n01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.280\nThat might cause people a bad day.\n\n01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.280\nIt's possible to want that and then do that very same thing, right?\n\n01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.280\nYou can want to not do that and then that's why...\n\n01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280\nAnd then do it a lot.\n\n01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.280\nYeah, because you're like, let's get one thing straight.\n\n01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280\nI'm not the fucking reason you're going to have a bad time.\n\n01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.280\nIf you want your money back, I'll give you your money back, fuck you.\n\n01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.280\nI want to make you feel good about yourself, you fucking cock-sucking piece of shit.\n\n01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.280\nAnd I didn't ask you to come here and I don't fucking...\n\n01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280\nI meant humanity, not you.\n\n01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.280\nYeah, that's a big...\n\n01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280\nThat's my thing.\n\n01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280\nThank you, Haley, everybody. Thank you.\n\n01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280\nNow I want it to be the reason why...\n\n01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280\nThat's a big thing.\n\n01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.280\nWhen somebody implies and somebody goes like, you...\n\n01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280\nThat's the...\n\n01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.280\nSomebody goes, you hurt me.\n\n01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.280\nYou hurt me because you were talking.\n\n01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280\nYou hurt me because you said that thing.\n\n01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:32.280\nLike, I just like fucking hulk, see an enemy, like weird toxins fill my blood and prepare me for battle.\n\n01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:42.280\nIronically, because if that's true, if I said something that made you suffer, we have to figure this out.\n\n01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:49.280\nIf I have to pound your face into the earth and change the axis of the planet, I will prove that you are wrong.\n\n01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:57.280\nI did not say something to ruin your day or that your day needed to be ruined and that it actually helped you or anything.\n\n01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.280\nAnything but...\n\n01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.280\nThat's kind of what happened last episode, wasn't it?\n\n01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.280\nThat's what's been happening for 40 years.\n\n01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.280\nThat's what I was trying to explain in the heat of that moment.\n\n01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.280\nI was like, look, this is my thing. This is why I make stuff.\n\n01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280\nWe got one more?\n\n01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:20.280\nI think actually kind of what Dan is trying to describe is what I would call emotional intelligence.\n\n01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.280\nRight.\n\n01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:30.280\nYeah, there's actually a book about that by a guy named Daniel Goldman, but there's a lot of psychoanalysis involved.\n\n01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.280\nI would call it emotional intelligence, for sure.\n\n01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.280\nThank you for projecting to the point where you probably don't have to.\n\n01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:45.280\nAnd you know what, it might be a fear of this thing. I've been mistaken for diagnosing myself with Asperger's and I'm sorry that that ever happened.\n\n01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.280\nI would not do that.\n\n01:15:47.280 --> 01:16:04.280\nBut the idea of empathy, from talking to people on the spectrum, what I find is that the thing that unites those people is the feeling of frustration.\n\n01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.280\nBecause they find themselves in situations where they are the cause of everyone's despair.\n\n01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.280\nAnd they find out all too late that they have not participated in some misperceived social custom.\n\n01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.280\nThey have their underwear around their ankles at the urinal in kindergarten.\n\n01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.280\nThey have a booger on their finger on the playground.\n\n01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.280\nThey're saying words backwards.\n\n01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.280\nThey're not doing something right that they didn't even know.\n\n01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:37.280\nThey weren't even picking up on having to do right. And what they would do pick up on is a circle of people around them with their fingers in their face saying you don't belong here.\n\n01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.280\nYou have to get off the playground. Get out of here.\n\n01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:56.280\nAnd that phobia, that's the thing that would result in somebody auto-correcting in their adult life for making sure that everyone understands that I'm here to help.\n\n01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.280\nI'm here to make sure everybody feels better about themselves.\n\n01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.280\nI'm not trying to hurt you when I talk.\n\n01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.280\nDan, in your storytelling, you've probably said this before, but say it again.\n\n01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.280\nIn your storytelling, what would be the goal that you could help people with?\n\n01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280\nWhat's the point of stories?\n\n01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:25.280\nWhat's the point of watching people walk through the stories and be punished for their humanity, get through it, become heroes because of it?\n\n01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.280\nWhat's the gift?\n\n01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:35.280\nWell, everybody realizing that life is what it is. It's just the most basic thing in the world.\n\n01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.280\nWhen you wake up in the morning, there seems to be so much wrong.\n\n01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:54.280\nAnd stories are the things that we tell each other to let us know that all these things that you feel about how fucked up everything is.\n\n01:17:54.280 --> 01:18:00.280\nThat is how it is, so that it resonates.\n\n01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:08.280\nProviding language for the things that are bouncing around in your head, that's what art is.\n\n01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:22.280\nIf you look at a painting in the Louvre and you start to burst into tears, it's because somebody puts something on a canvas that you thought could only ever exist in your brain, or a brain.\n\n01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.280\nAnd you suddenly burst into tears because you've been connected with.\n\n01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:34.280\nFor me, story is the Remo Williams tapping on the wrist of...\n\n01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.280\nIt's such a deep cut.\n\n01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:48.280\nI'm tapping in the rhythm of life and death with you so that you understand that when you woke up this morning and you felt bipolar,\n\n01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.280\nyou felt like, why am I in a good mood but I'm in a bad mood? Why if I was in a good mood? Why did I listen to a sad song?\n\n01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.280\nWhy is my mom's death the thing that's fucking up my job right now?\n\n01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:06.280\nWhy do I hate the people I love? Why do I love the people I hate? Why am I depressed? Why can't I get anything done?\n\n01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.280\nWhy am I different? Why am I scared?\n\n01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:19.280\nEveryone's walking around in their pizza hut uniforms and they're up and down the sidewalk and they all seem to have their shit together.\n\n01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.280\nAnd I turn on the TV and everyone's having certain counters and trying on high-heeled shoes and everyone seems to know what's going on.\n\n01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.280\nRoss and Rachel know what's going on and all the traffic lights...\n\n01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.280\nEvery once in a while you drive by and a couple cars hit each other and there's broken glass everywhere,\n\n01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.280\nwhich you're not supposed to look and everyone that does look is a bad person and you keep going.\n\n01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:41.280\nThis conveyor belt, this concrete jungle, it puts a pressure on you and you feel like because you have this turmoil in your brain,\n\n01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:47.280\nyou're like, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to snap. I'm the only one walking around with this secret that we're all fucked up,\n\n01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:58.280\nthat everything is going to hell and stories, like, you know, let you know, no, Ulysses had that happen to him.\n\n01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:08.280\nHe felt that way. He went to this place and it's a way of articulating that inarticulable fact that just when things feel their worst,\n\n01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.280\nthat is actually the thing that is giving you the most strength and all that kind of crap.\n\n01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:20.280\nFor me, like, community stories are always about people versus the system and it's always about reminding you that no matter how fucked up you feel,\n\n01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.280\nyou're supposed to be the way you are.\n\n01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:31.280\nYou're not supposed to actually grow and change. You're supposed to actually, before we ever get to that point,\n\n01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:38.280\nfirst and foremost, the most subversive, most heroic act you can do is just be proud of yourself the way you got out of bed that morning.\n\n01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:45.280\nAnd people go around the circle of the stories like experimenting with the idea that maybe they can improve themselves\n\n01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.280\nfor the sake of improving their life or the system or something.\n\n01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.280\nLike we said before, they get improved by the people around them that they look up to.\n\n01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.280\nThey come back around to the conclusion that they should have just come clean and been honest about the fact that they felt like a piece of shit.\n\n01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:02.280\nThat's what stories are, to answer your question.\n\n01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.280\nFor God's sake, let's play some D&D for a pity's sake, shall we?\n\n01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.280\nAlright.\n\n01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:19.280\nLast time our heroes were fighting with Brefi, the mechanical monstrosity,\n\n01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.280\nwho was new and improved with powerful enhancements.\n\n01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:30.280\nBrefi shot lasers and lightning and also tiny robo spiders, but Quark quickly leapt into action,\n\n01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.280\ngnar-walling the spider creature with a dagger strapped to his face.\n\n01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:41.280\nSharpie used his father's cape to teleport onto the beast's back and blasted it with electricity.\n\n01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.280\nBrefi hit Christopher with a chain which stuck in his stomach.\n\n01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.280\nMulraine fired arrow after arrow at the spider monster with a decent success rate.\n\n01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:57.280\nQuark changed tactics and slashed at the beast with his mighty greatsword while Sharpie began looking through his backpack.\n\n01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.280\nHe retrieved Dorota Frost and sprayed ice at the lava below, forming a cool crust.\n\n01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:08.280\nThen the wizard turned his rod on the spider, blasting it in the face with razor sharp ice fragments.\n\n01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.280\nThat finished the job and sent Brefi crashing down onto the lava crust below.\n\n01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:19.280\nQuark, overtaken by victory lust, lowered himself down by rope onto Brefi, but slipped and fell.\n\n01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.280\nIf not for Sharpie's quick thinking and the button staff, Quark wouldn't have lived to rape another day.\n\n01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.280\nAdmiral Darkstar was sure to be close, but just how close?\n\n01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.280\nI don't know. I don't know.\n\n01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.280\nThank you Spencer.\n\n01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.280\nSo you guys are up in this web of chains after just killing this guy.\n\n01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280\nThere's lava beneath you.\n\n01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.280\nI said we climb up and see if there's some sort of door where Brefi came through.\n\n01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:00.280\nOne thing to note is that there are four statues with eyes that recess when you press the button.\n\n01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.280\nYeah, those are consumed by lava at this point.\n\n01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.280\nIt's been steadily rising this whole time.\n\n01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.280\nYou guys are now just in the chains and there's only lava below.\n\n01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.280\nYeah, Bill.\n\n01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.280\nOh, that shit you noticed?\n\n01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.280\nThat's in lava now.\n\n01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.280\nGet in the moment.\n\n01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.280\nI climb up the chains and start looking for outlets above us.\n\n01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:32.280\nI'm feeling there's a sort of metal hatch door, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of handle or knob on it.\n\n01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.280\nIt looks like it's made out of several triangular sections.\n\n01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.280\nChristopher, get up there and check it out.\n\n01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.280\nI'm checking it out.\n\n01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:49.280\nChecking it out. You see what looks like a small hole on the left side of one of these door panels.\n\n01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.280\nThere's a hole.\n\n01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.280\nI fuck it.\n\n01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.280\nI knew he was going to do that.\n\n01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.280\nNo, don't do that.\n\n01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.280\nDid we find anything lately?\n\n01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.280\nRods, stabs, fingers.\n\n01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.280\nWe have a crafting kit that we could borrow from Mulraine.\n\n01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.280\nYeah, but don't you think this is one of those things where there's like a...\n\n01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.280\nI'm sorry, I'm immersed. I'm not medigaming.\n\n01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.280\nWe could jam an arrow in there.\n\n01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.280\nIs there something that we have that would fit that certain size hole?\n\n01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.280\nYeah, I mean we play this game once a week and we're always drunk. I'm just wondering if it feels like a...\n\n01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280\nDescribe the size of the hole by the door.\n\n01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.280\nIt's smaller than a human's littlest finger.\n\n01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.280\nI don't know how that compares to a half-length one.\n\n01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.280\nI'm going to grab an arrow and jam it up in there.\n\n01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:38.280\nAll right. You jam it in there real hard, but the arrow is like harder.\n\n01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:46.280\nI mean it's wider than the hole, so you stab it in there and it kind of breaks off the stone bits of the stone arrow.\n\n01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.280\nThis is a stone arrow in this instance, in case anyone's wondering.\n\n01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.280\nOne of those iron-tipped arrows that would break off in this instance.\n\n01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.280\nJust some continuity, you know.\n\n01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:02.280\nThese triangular things, are they clean triangles or are they like shard of power kind of shape?\n\n01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.280\nThey're like clean triangles.\n\n01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:10.280\nThey're like teeth of a thing that's all of its teeth come together.\n\n01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.280\nNothing exists like that in nature.\n\n01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.280\nYou haven't met my ex-wife.\n\n01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:28.280\nAnyway, so Christopher is jamming this arrow in and you jam it in and you feel like a thing that it hits as you stick it in.\n\n01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.280\nIt felt like it hit like a little metal something.\n\n01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.280\nNow what?\n\n01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.280\nIt hit a metal something in the hole.\n\n01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.280\nIt hit a metal something in the hole.\n\n01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280\nDeep stuff.\n\n01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.280\nAnd it broke off, so is it stuck in there?\n\n01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.280\nIt broke off, it's just that the tip side of the arrow is broken off.\n\n01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.280\nIt's still attached.\n\n01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.280\nAlright, well, I'm going to try to...\n\n01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:57.280\nAlright, I'll turn it.\n\n01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280\nTurning it with all your strength.\n\n01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.280\nYou muster up, not very much of all your strength, I guess.\n\n01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.280\nYou try and turn it and it just doesn't budge.\n\n01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.280\nIt's like a rotary phone.\n\n01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280\nWhat were you going to do?\n\n01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280\nYou're the barbarian.\n\n01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280\nYou have the strength?\n\n01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.280\nYeah, you try and turn it.\n\n01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.280\nI grab onto the arrow shaft and I turn it for all I'm worth.\n\n01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:29.280\nYou turn it for all your worth and it snaps off, but not before activating some sort of mechanism that grinds deep within this assembly of triangles.\n\n01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:36.280\nThey sort of grind and rumble as they open apart and create a hole in the ceiling.\n\n01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.280\nYay!\n\n01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.280\nAs long as nothing's coming out of the hole.\n\n01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.280\nYeah, nothing's coming out of the hole.\n\n01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280\nLet's get through this hole, man.\n\n01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.280\nYeah, I clamber up through the hole.\n\n01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.280\nYou scramble up, clamber.\n\n01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.280\nI'm using scramble, otherwise I'd just be copying you.\n\n01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.280\nCan I trundle?\n\n01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.280\nYou can trundle or you could sashay.\n\n01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.280\nI'll clamber, I don't care about copying anyway.\n\n01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280\nAlright, I'll mosey.\n\n01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.280\nIs anyone else going to move?\n\n01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.280\nI canter wall.\n\n01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.280\nBut then I move actually, soon I think.\n\n01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.280\nYou all move in various specific ways and find yourself in a new room.\n\n01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.280\nThis room is strangely dark as if light were magically dampened.\n\n01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:36.280\nHowever, the magically dampened light does not extend to dim crimson flames that seem to be held up in the midair.\n\n01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.280\nLike they're floating or some shit.\n\n01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.280\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.280\nIt's not crazy, it's just magic.\n\n01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:50.280\nThe floor is littered with the mangled corpses of several black-robed humanoids and also black buckets for whatever reason.\n\n01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:58.280\nYou can see entrails and blood smeared across the floor and in the center of the carnage, carnage is a mound of ashes.\n\n01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:06.280\nAcross the room you can see an archway and in the archway is a stairwell.\n\n01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.280\nHow high in the air are these flames floating?\n\n01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.280\nI like about seven feet tall.\n\n01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.280\nYou can probably grab one.\n\n01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.280\nI use my goggles with my nude seeing.\n\n01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.280\nYou use your goggles with my nude seeing.\n\n01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.280\nWhat do you look at with them?\n\n01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.280\nThe room.\n\n01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.280\nEverything.\n\n01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.280\nYou look around at everything and you look at these corpses.\n\n01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.280\nThey look like they've been ripped apart somehow.\n\n01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:38.280\nSome of them have bite marks on them but none of them look like sliced or like stabbed or anything.\n\n01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.280\nMore torn.\n\n01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.280\nNot pleasant.\n\n01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.280\nAlso the buckets, they're full of blood.\n\n01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.280\nSeems a bit...\n\n01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.280\nMuch.\n\n01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.280\nDo I detect any traps?\n\n01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.280\nSearching around for traps, you see no traps.\n\n01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:00.280\nMaybe we should go look at that archway.\n\n01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.280\nOn the far side of the room where the stairwell I was mentioning earlier was,\n\n01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:13.280\nyou hear footsteps and then you see that gnoll guy, Yerch, that you've seen before in random circumstances in various places.\n\n01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.280\nYerch!\n\n01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.280\nHe walks into view and is like, what are you, what?\n\n01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.280\nYerch!\n\n01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.280\nWeren't you guys ahead of me?\n\n01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.280\nWell, we got to chain in a lava room with some chains.\n\n01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280\nYeah.\n\n01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.280\nWhere were you?\n\n01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:38.280\nI was taking care of these guys and then I was scouting up ahead.\n\n01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.280\nAre you the reason they're all mangled?\n\n01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.280\nI mean, yeah.\n\n01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.280\nJesus, Yerch.\n\n01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:46.280\nI mean, what? You guys kill stuff, right?\n\n01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.280\nYeah, but we don't make a big show of it.\n\n01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280\nWell, well I do.\n\n01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.280\nWhy the buckets, man?\n\n01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.280\nWell, yeah, the buckets weren't mine.\n\n01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.280\nThose were there.\n\n01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.280\nThe buckets of blood were there?\n\n01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280\nYeah.\n\n01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.280\nYerch, what are you hiding from us?\n\n01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.280\nGod, every time we run into him he seems like this.\n\n01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.280\nPerception check.\n\n01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.280\nOkay.\n\n01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.280\nWhat are you looking for with your goggles?\n\n01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.280\nA sense motive on him.\n\n01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280\nOkay, a sense motive.\n\n01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.280\nThat makes more sense.\n\n01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:19.280\nHe looks like he's hiding something from you guys.\n\n01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.280\nYerch, I take my sword out, my great sword, and I hold it at his neck and I go,\n\n01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.280\nYerch, tell us the truth or I'll cut you deep.\n\n01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.280\nI don't know what you guys are talking about, man.\n\n01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280\nI'll make you leak, Jack.\n\n01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.280\nI told you I killed all these dudes.\n\n01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.280\nI'll please you real slow.\n\n01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.280\nYou ain't Yerch, is you?\n\n01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.280\nI is Yerch.\n\n01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.280\nProve it.\n\n01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.280\nTell me something only Yerch and I would know.\n\n01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:45.280\nI was tracking

know.\n\n01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.280\nWait, what's Harmontown?\n\n01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280\nHuh?\n\n01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280\nWhat's Harmontown?\n\n01:30:53.280 -->

01:31:14.280\nHe's like, what's going on?\n\n01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.280\nI thought you guys kill bad guys all the time.\n\n01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:19.280\nWe're in a goddamn carnival of broken souls.\n\n01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.280\nThere's people running around everywhere that look like other people.\n\n01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.280\nWe ran into a guy that didn't believe that we were good guys.\n\n01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:28.280\nAnd, you know, he went mad.\n\n01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.280\nI'm just like, you seem like you're up to something.\n\n01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.280\nOh,

you.\n\n01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.280\nI don't want to get meta about it, but we sensed it.\n\n01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.280\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.280\nWe sensed you were up to something.\n\n01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.280\nI mean, yeah.\n\n01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.280\nWhat are you up to?\n\n01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.280\nI'm just, I killed all these guys.\n\n01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.280\nI was looking up there.\n\n01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.280\nI mean, I...\n\n01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.280\nWhat are you going to do next then?\n\n01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.280\nYeah, where are you going now?\n\n01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.280\nWhat were you looking at?\n\n01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.280\nI was just looking at the floor above.\n\n01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.280\nThere's some scary shit up there.\n\n01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280\nIt's dark magic.\n\n01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280\nThe floor above?\n\n01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.280\nYeah.\n\n01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.280\nAnd that's why you seem like you're up to something?\n\n01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.280\nThat's where Darkstar is hiding.\n\n01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.280\nHe's got all this dark magic.\n\n01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280\nI don't know how to decipher it.\n\n01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.280\nHe needs some sort of crazy old books.\n\n01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.280\nCrazy old books?\n\n01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.280\nYeah.\n\n01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.280\nWhere, where would we find these books?\n\n01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.280\nWho knows, man?\n\n01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.280\nI have books of divinity.\n\n01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280\nWhat?\n\n01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.280\nSomething might, divine might.\n\n01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.280\nBooks, books, books of divine might.\n\n01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.280\nI think that's what that says.\n\n01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280\nI don't know what that is.\n\n01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280\nThat's not the right book.\n\n01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280\nThere's lots of books.\n\n01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.280\nI mean, they can't all be the applicable one.\n\n01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.280\nI look around for books in the room.\n\n01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.280\nThere's no books, just bloody torn corpses.\n\n01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.280\nYou know, if we could see up there better...\n\n01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.280\nI can't detect thoughts on Yerch.\n\n01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:50.280\nHe's like, man, I need to get that book off that wizard guy.\n\n01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.280\nThe blood book.\n\n01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:54.280\nYour book?\n\n01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.280\nSharpie, look in your inventory for a book right now.\n\n01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.280\nI have one.\n\n01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.280\nI've had it for a while.\n\n01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.280\nHe wants it.\n\n01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:07.280\nI, I, I, while, while, while you're looking for your book, I walk around and I kind of,\n\n01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280\nlike, I kind of just...\n\n01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.280\nCan I detect more thoughts than that?\n\n01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.280\nIt's like, man, this guy just audibly cast Detect Thoughts on me,\n\n01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.280\nand now I feel like a real asshole.\n\n01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280\nI didn't audibly...\n\n01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.280\nI mean, are you saying that there's an audible component to it?\n\n01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:27.280\nYeah, almost all spells, like, they have some sort of show.\n\n01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.280\nSo I was like, detect them, thotumum?\n\n01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.280\nYeah, pretty good.\n\n01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280\nIt's fucking

take out my flaming sword and I raise it above my head.\n\n01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.280\nHe's like, whoa, whoa, we don't gonna do that.\n\n01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.280\nAnd I say, Sharpie, take out the book and, and, like, show him it.\n\n01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.280\nNo, what book?\n\n01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280\nThe Joy of Cooking.\n\n01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.280\nThe Joy of Cooking.\n\n01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280\nWhat book?\n\n01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280\nHuh?\n\n01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.280\nWhat book?\n\n01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280\nNo book.\n\n01:34:03.280 -->

01:34:10.280\nYerch, you haven't had buttermilk biscuits.\n\n01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.280\nUntil you've had Sharpie's buttermilk biscuits.\n\n01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.280\nI don't eat buttermilk biscuits.\n\n01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.280\nYeah, because you're fucking Admiral Darkstar, aren't you?\n\n01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.280\nNo.\n\n01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.280\nI detect magic on Yerch.\n\n01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.280\nHe's, he's full of dark magics.\n\n01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:27.280\nI take my flaming sword and I strike it straight down.\n\n01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.280\nI write about...\n\n01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:32.280\nIt might be Yerch, but he's, he's, you know, he's conjugated.\n\n01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.280\nConjugated?\n\n01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.280\nI'm a barbarian.\n\n01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.280\nIt could be our friend Yerch, but, like, you know...\n\n01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280\nLook.\n\n01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.280\nCompromised.\n\n01:34:40.280

a mischaracterization.\n\n01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.280\nSpencer the heart wants what it wants.\n\n01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.280\nOkay.\n\n01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.280\nI have the flaming sword poised above his head in a very threatening manner.\n\n01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.280\nOkay.\n\n01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.280\nGod damn it.\n\n01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.280\nBrefi.\n\n01:35:00.280 -->

01:35:04.280\nBrefi.\n\n01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280\nNo, Brefi.\n\n01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280\nIs there a way to release Yerch from a spell?\n\n01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.280\nI don't have anything like that.\n\n01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.280\nDo you have to spell magic?\n\n01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280\nI don't.\n\n01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.280\nI fucking don't.\n\n01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.280\nI have deep slumber.\n\n01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280\nHey, man.\n\n01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280\nOkay.\n\n01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.280\nLet me be honest with you guys.\n\n01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.280\nOh, Barry the lead.\n\n01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.280\nI just, I was telling you guys about the dark magic.\n\n01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.280\nThis is blood magic stuff.\n\n01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:31.280\nIt's crazy.\n\n01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.280\nI was trying to learn about it.\n\n01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280\nYerch.\n\n01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.280\nSo you've immersed yourself in this blood and it's made you part of the dark magic?\n\n01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280\nNo.\n\n01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.280\nWhat?\n\n01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280\nNo.\n\n01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.280\nYou were learning about the dark magic?\n\n01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.280\nI mean, I know a bit about all sorts of stuff.\n\n01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.280\nIs that why these buckets of blood are here?\n\n01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:50.280\nSo you're covering yourself on this blood to learn this?\n\n01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.280\nWell, I mean, again, I didn't gather these buckets of blood.\n\n01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.280\nI mean, look at these things on the floor.\n\n01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:00.280\nThere's nobody gathers buckets of blood, but at some point in your life they get offered to you.\n\n01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.280\nAnd when they do, you need to come to your friends.\n\n01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.280\nYou shouldn't have talked to us first.\n\n01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.280\nThis is gateway magic.\n\n01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.280\nI learned about watching Yerch.\n\n01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.280\nI don't know how to respond to that.\n\n01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.280\nThat's because you're high on darkness.\n\n01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.280\nThat's not true, man.\n\n01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.280\nWhat did you do with this blood, this blood magic, Yerch?\n\n01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.280\nI'm not doing anything with nothing.\n\n01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.280\nYou're steeped in it, brother.\n\n01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.280\nNo, that ain't me.\n\n01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.280\nGuys, if we get this blood on us, are we going to turn into him?\n\n01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.280\nNo, I pick up a bucket of blood and I splash it on Yerch.\n\n01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.280\nI go, is this what you want?\n\n01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.280\nYou want to be bloody?\n\n01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.280\nWhat signals was I giving off that indicated that was what I wanted?\n\n01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.280\nYou're covered in darkness.\n\n01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280\nYou love blood magic.\n\n01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280\nYou want my book?\n\n01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280\nYou want blood magic?\n\n01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280\nYou want to be covered in blood?\n\n01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280\nBlood is sticky.\n\n01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.280\nIt's gross.\n\n01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.280\nIt's crusty.\n\n01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.280\nSharpie, give him the book.\n\n01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.280\nYou used to be a regular gnoll.\n\n01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.280\nYou used to be soaked and pissed.\n\n01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280\nYou were a good guy.\n\n01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.280\nAnd now you've soaked me in blood.\n\n01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280\nYeah, so?\n\n01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.280\nDoes it feel good?\n\n01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.280\nSharpie, Sharpie, slap him across the face.\n\n01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.280\nGet this monkey off your back.\n\n01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280\nHe's like, eh.\n\n01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.280\nI have a question, Yerch.\n\n01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.280\nYerch, what would you do with the book if you had it?\n\n01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.280\nI'd learn about the thing and try and stop the evil plot.\n\n01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280\nGive him the book?\n\n01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280\nWhat?\n\n01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.280\nI got the sword above his head.\n\n01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.280\nShow him the book.\n\n01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.280\nSee what happens.\n\n01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.280\nNo!\n\n01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.280\nIf he turns blacker, we'll kill him.\n\n01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.280\nWait.\n\n01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.280\nOh, no, that sounded racist.\n\n01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.280\nWow.\n\n01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.280\nIs that the title of the episode?\n\n01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.280\nIf it turns blacker, we'll kill him.\n\n01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280\nNo.\n\n01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280\nNo, no.\n\n01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.280\nI'm not going to give him the blood magic book.\n\n01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.280\nHe was dishonest about it in the first place.\n\n01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.280\nThat means that he's...\n\n01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280\nCome on.\n\n01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.280\nYerch, we need to...\n\n01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280\nWhat do you roll?\n\n01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.280\nOh, who knows, ma'am?\n\n01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.280\nI can't conceal my emotions.\n\n01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.280\nYeah, nothing, nothing.\n\n01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280\nGod damn it.\n\n01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.280\nHe rolled a perception thingy or whatever.\n\n01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.280\nA will thingy.\n\n01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.280\nWe have to secure Yerch.\n\n01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280\nHuh?\n\n01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.280\nWe have to secure Yerch.\n\n01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.280\nI grab him from behind.\n\n01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.280\nI get him in a full Nelson.\n\n01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.280\nAll right.\n\n01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.280\nWell, as you're trying to do that, he finishes muttering under his breath, which you didn't\n\n01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.280\nhear because you were too busy talking and not perceiving things correctly.\n\n01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.280\nOh, man.\n\n01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.280\nBut, yeah, as you're grabbing him, he goes, hold it.\n\n01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.280\nAnd then you grab him.\n\n01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.280\nAnd as you grab him, you feel the blood, the slick blood on his body turn hard.\n\n01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.280\nAnd it's all hard, like hard stuff.\n\n01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.280\nAnd you got... you got a hole in on him.\n\n01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.280\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\n01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.280\nBecause he's all bloody in the shit.\n\n01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.280\nHe's turned hard?\n\n01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.280\nLike an exoskeleton?\n\n01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.280\nYeah, you're hugging a hard man.\n\n01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280\nLike an exoskeleton of some sort?\n\n01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.280\nLike, like an exoskeleton, yes.\n\n01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:09.280\nThis is what happens when you hug people.\n\n01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.280\nThe stink gets on them.\n\n01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.280\nI, uh, I release him and take out my greatsword.\n\n01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.280\nAll right.\n\n01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.160\nHe goes, rechts, he bursts out of that.\n\n01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:25.520\nAnd he kinda like, his blood is all hard\n\n01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.360\nand dripping over his face.\n\n01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.800\nAnd he's like, now you made me all fucked up\n\n01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.520\nand I'm fucked up now.\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.040\nYou're just a complicated motherfucker.\n\n01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.840\nYou guys were all aggressive on me.\n\n01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.400\nI just wanted to learn about blood.\n\n01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.000\nNow you're gonna learn about blood the hard way, though.\n\n01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.040\nThat's not what happened.\n\n01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.540\nYeah, we're gonna learn about your blood.\n\n01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.760\nYeah, I'm gonna write a thesis on it.\n\n01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.960\nMy blood magic.\n\n01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.800\nYerch, Yerch.\n\n01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.440\nI hope this includes a blackboard.\n\n01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.320\nIt doesn't.\n\n01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.160\nYerch.\n\n01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.000\nYerch.\n\n01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:53.840\nYou gotta be too easy.\n\n01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.480\nYerch, right now I'm looking at a gnoll\n\n01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.200\nwho's about to get killed and fucked.\n\n01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.280\nI'm looking at a halfling who's about\n\n01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.920\nto be full of blood missiles.\n\n01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:01.760\nI'm a gnome.\n\n01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.600\nBlood missiles.\n\n01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.840\nThat's a good point.\n\n01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.680\nYes.\n\n01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.920\nAll this blood's in my eyes.\n\n01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.760\nOkay.\n\n01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.560\nI'm invisible.\n\n01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.200\nSo he kind of flicks some of his bloody arm at you\n\n01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.280\nand they kind of turn into these little blood darts\n\n01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.360\nand they're shooting at your body.\n\n01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.720\nBlood darts.\n\n01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.440\nYeah, but they all miss.\n\n01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.400\nFlaming sword attack.\n\n01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.960\nDo it.\n\n01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.120\nOh wait, that's me.\n\n01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.160\nWe were just playing a game\n\n01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.400\nwhere you guys rolled your own attack rolls,\n\n01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.160\nso that's on me.\n\n01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:35.000\nYou strike him directly in the stomach.\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:35.840\nDealing.\n\n01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.680\nWhat's your damage?\n\n01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.880\nSorry, it is?\n\n01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.720\n11.\n\n01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.560\nThat's someone else's illness.\n\n01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.640\nIt's an 11 attack.\n\n01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.680\nNow your damage.\n\n01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.520\nMy damage is starting.\n\n01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.040\nThat's like 1D something.\n\n01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.240\nIt's 1D 10 plus 1D 6 plus 4.\n\n01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.880\nSorry everybody, just some housekeeping.\n\n01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.960\nDealing 11 damage.\n\n01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.800\nPoor, poor Yerch.\n\n01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.120\nWhy, wait.\n\n01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.720\nNo, I know, it's just a shame.\n\n01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.960\nIt's like Robert Downey Jr. in less than zero.\n\n01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.960\nBut you see, as the blood flows from his open wound,\n\n01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.840\nit kind of pulls back and hardens over the wound,\n\n01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.880\nclosing it off immediately and scabbing it over.\n\n01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.840\nOh damn.\n\n01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.480\nPoisonous sneak attack.\n\n01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.320\nWhat's up?\n\n01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.480\nPoisonous sneak attack.\n\n01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.960\nI like the sound of that.\n\n01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.640\nGoing around to his flank in a flanking maneuver,\n\n01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.840\nyou try to attack him right in the flank\n\n01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.680\nwith a sneak attack.\n\n01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.920\nBut unfortunately, you miss.\n\n01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.800\nI'm invisible and I miss.\n\n01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.960\nWhen did you go invisible?\n\n01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.560\nI said I'm invisible.\n\n01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.920\nSecond, he went all blood.\n\n01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.880\nWhoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.240\nFirst of all, I didn't hear that.\n\n01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.120\nSecond of all, when Tyler was playing Christopher,\n\n01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.000\nhe used your second invisible.\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.400\nOkay, I wasn't invisible.\n\n01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.680\nI just thought I was invisible.\n\n01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.880\nFair play.\n\n01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.360\nEither way, miss.\n\n01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.520\nSorry, man.\n\n01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.560\nCan I ask you about a spell on mine?\n\n01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.400\nYeah.\n\n01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.120\nIt's called Mirror Image.\n\n01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:00.960\nYeah.\n\n01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:05.960\nNow, I'm gonna, is that, do I just make another me?\n\n01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.360\nYou make multiple copies of yourself\n\n01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:09.640\nthat are like illusions.\n\n01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.320\nYeah, he doesn't know who to hit.\n\n01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.480\nI'm gonna do that.\n\n01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.320\nNice.\n\n01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.720\nI'm gonna go, hey, Mr. Blood Missile.\n\n01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.840\nWho will you hit with your blood missiles?\n\n01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.680\nIs it me?\n\n01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.440\nOr me.\n\n01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.200\nI put my arm around one of them and go,\n\n01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.360\nor this one.\n\n01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.720\nAnd one of them has a mustache.\n\n01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.000\nYou summoned six, six mirror images.\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.920\nOh, what a peculiar circumstance.\n\n01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.680\nYou find yourself in, I am Dieter.\n\n01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.680\nWell, I don't think it's the one with the mustache.\n\n01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.800\nThat's clearly fake.\n\n01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.320\nOh, it would be weird if I just put on a mustache\n\n01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.400\nand then cast a spell so that I was the one with the mustache.\n\n01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.360\nAnd then I laugh and each ha comes from a different guy.\n\n01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.680\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.520\nHa.\n\n01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.520\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\n\n01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.000\nSo Yerch dives on to the ground\n\n01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.560\nand he grabs one of these buckets\n\n01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.560\nand he does like a weird roll\n\n01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.960\nand he throws a bucket on Quarks\n\n01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.560\nand now Quarks covered in blood.\n\n01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.400\nWhat?\n\n01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.360\nYeah.\n\n01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.240\nThat's not good, you guys.\n\n01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:23.040\nI mean, maybe it is.\n\n01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:23.880\nIt is?\n\n01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.720\nI don't know.\n\n01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:25.720\nI mean, I do.\n\n01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.720\nIt doesn't seem good.\n\n01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.400\nYou're covered in blood.\n\n01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.960\nI start wiping it off me.\n\n01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:34.640\nOkay, with what?\n\n01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.960\nMy cloak of resistance.\n\n01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.240\nOkay, that, yeah.\n\n01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.160\nYou start wiping blood off you.\n\n01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.560\nThis takes a while.\n\n01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.400\nOkay.\n\n01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.640\nYou get maybe a third of the way done.\n\n01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.280\nThat's all.\n\n01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:50.760\nRibbon dagger.\n\n01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:51.800\nOkay.\n\n01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.800\nYou attack them with your ribbon dagger?\n\n01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.640\nYeah.\n\n01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.480\nJust making sure.\n\n01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.000\nThat's a critical hit.\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:58.840\nOh!\n\n01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.840\nYou strike them directly between the blood.\n\n01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.840\nDealing seven damage.\n\n01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:12.680\nThat's incredible.\n\n01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.200\nYeah, you know, ribbon dagger does X4 damage,\n\n01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.440\nbut still just seven damage in this case.\n\n01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440\nSeven damage.\n\n01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.080\nHe's like, ah, my eye.\n\n01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.160\nIt was between those bloods.\n\n01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.760\nI'm still wiping blood off, right?\n\n01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.600\nI hope so.\n\n01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.560\nPutting it in a Sharpies turn.\n\n01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.280\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha.\n\n01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.760\nYou appear to be surrounded by a forest of foes.\n\n01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.120\nWhich one is reducing you?\n\n01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.640\nWho knows?\n\n01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.720\nReduce person.\n\n01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.920\nTiny, tiny blood-soaked gnoll.\n\n01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.560\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.360\nYou cast reduced person on him,\n\n01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.840\nand he slowly dwindles down to the size of a gnome.\n\n01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.840\nHe's like, no, that's fucked up.\n\n01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:08.320\nIt's not fucked up.\n\n01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.280\nWe're proud people, right?\n\n01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:12.160\nYou know, that's fine.\n\n01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.600\nNot the size of the barbarian.\n\n01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:16.080\nIt's the motion of a sword.\n\n01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:22.280\nHe goes, ah, but it's, I'm magicking right now.\n\n01:45:22.280 -->

01:45:29.800\nat like a snake serpent,\n\n01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.200\nand starts to whip at you guys,\n\n01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.800\nand try and drag you down like ropes or something.\n\n01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.000\nAnd you guys, you guys, you guys.\n\n01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.960\nQuark leaps out of the way,\n\n01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.160\nbut the other two of you guys get entangled\n\n01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.640\nby these bloody ropes,\n\n01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.120\nand you're kind of bound and tied up.\n\n01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.960\nUncanny Dodge doesn't help?\n\n01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:52.360\nUncanny Dodge doesn't help.\n\n01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:56.280\nNot in this case. What about being like eight people?\n\n01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.200\nThat doesn't, because it gets everything,\n\n01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.600\nso it actually grabs at all your illusions\n\n01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.840\nat the same time and dispells them.\n\n01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:03.680\nWhat?\n\n01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.520\nYeah.\n\n01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.840\nOh,

I'm going down.\n\n01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.680\nI'm putting it at a quark stern right now.\n\n01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.320\nI use my mighty sword,\n\n01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.360\nand I try to cleave off the tentacles\n\n01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.880\nthat are holding these guys down.\n\n01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.240\nOh, I like the sound of that.\n\n01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.080\nThat happens.\n\n01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.760\nYou cleave quickly through the tentacles.\n\n01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.440\nThey're bloody ropes, whatever.\n\n01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.680\nWrapping these two gentlemen,\n\n01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.000\nfreeing them from their bonds.\n\n01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.840\nIt works?\n\n01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.680\nYeah.\n\n01:46:36.680 -->

a heavy heart.\n\n01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.280\nI dry hump him a little bit.\n\n01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:54.240\nI thought you were going to say a last per year inch.\n\n01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:57.480\nA last per year inch.\n\n01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.280\nI take some of your just blood and I go like, why?\n\n01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.640\nWhy?\n\n01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.760\nAnd then I rub it on my face and I go, oh, look, I'm on the guy.\n\n01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.760\nI go, what the fuck?\n\n01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.800\nAnd I look at my friends.\n\n01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:13.040\nAnd I go, I'm just kidding.\n\n01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.240\nI would never.\n\n01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.920\nBlood magic's the worst.\n\n01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.000\nJust say no.\n\n01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.400\nI search Yerch's body.\n\n01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.960\nHe has just a rusty dagger and a bunch of poop.\n\n01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.960\nHe was keeping it?\n\n01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:32.520\nThat's why he smelled so bad, I guess.\n\n01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:41.680\nI was about to give Yerch a rusty dagger.\n\n01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.000\nThat's where I poop on my dick and then fuck him.\n\n01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000\nHe didn't have to.\n\n01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:53.360\nI don't want to play D&D anymore.\n\n01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:57.800\nI take some more buckets of blood and I just pour it all over him.\n\n01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.720\nOK.\n\n01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:02.480\nI kick his body into the lava.\n\n01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:09.160\nYou hear a screech coming from that doorway that he came through as you kick that into\n\n01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.880\nthe lava.\n\n01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.280\nJust a screech.\n\n01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:17.440\nI walk up to the, is it a stairway?\n\n01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.560\nIt's like an archway that leads to a staircase.\n\n01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.480\nI walk up and go, who are you?\n\n01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.160\nYou can see two pairs of glowing eyes in the darkness.\n\n01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.400\nThey're like, you killed Yerch, you will have our vengeance or something.\n\n01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.480\nAnd then they disappear in a poof of smoke.\n\n01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:41.200\nAll right, let's all pool each syllable we heard and we'll piece it together.\n\n01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.640\nI heard you killed all the Jews.\n\n01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.320\nYou killed Yerch.\n\n01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:53.280\nYou will die in a pool of vengeance?\n\n01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:55.520\nDefinitely not the most eloquent of us.\n\n01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:03.320\nI yell, come again, but they've already vanished in that smoke I mentioned.\n\n01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:07.920\nOh, Admiral Darkstar, if that's you.\n\n01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920\nIt wasn't.\n\n01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.920\nOh.\n\n01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:13.360\nThen never mind.\n\n01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:16.360\nI yell at the ceiling, nonetheless.\n\n01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:18.360\nMore like Admiral Fartstar.\n\n01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.360\nNothing?\n\n01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.360\nNo.\n\n01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.360\nI mean, sure.\n\n01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360\nAdmiral Fartstar.\n\n01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.080\nI thought that might get to him.\n\n01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.280\nLet's chase him up to the archway.\n\n01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.280\nLet's go, guys.\n\n01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.280\nLet's run.\n\n01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.280\nWe run.\n\n01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.280\nWe run up the archway.\n\n01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:36.320\nYou run up the archway and you burst through the door at the top of the, no, okay.\n\n01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.720\nSo running through the archway, there's a spiral staircase.\n\n01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.040\nSo I'm assuming you're also charging up that?\n\n01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.040\nYes.\n\n01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.040\nOkay.\n\n01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.200\nCharging up, you burst through the door at the top and what you see inside is a pillar\n\n01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:51.200\nof black crystal on the top of which is Admiral Darkstar.\n\n01:53:51.200 --> 01:54:11.320\nThank you for coming to a sleepy, introspective Harmontown featuring Johnny Jack Emmer and\n\n01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.320\nBeef Steak Bill.\n\n01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:17.200\nAnd thank you, Hayley, for coming up and everybody else.\n\n01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.400\nOne more time for Spencer Crinton.\n\n01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:27.400\nI'm Jeff Davis, a Comptroller, thank you for putting up with a very sleepy me.\n\n01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.400\nOne more time for your sleepy but wonderful Mayor, Dan Harmon.\n\n01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.400\nGo home and go to sleep.\n\n01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.400\nWe'll see you next week.\n\n01:54:36.400 -->
