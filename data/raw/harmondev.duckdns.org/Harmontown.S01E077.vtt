00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm going to start off on a sad note, but for a good reason.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
Lou Reed, baby.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Rest in peace, Lou Reed.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Let's just groove on him for a moment.

00:27.000 --> 00:38.000
That she wants to know, she wants to know why she's given half her life to people she hates now.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello, Harvintown.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Yes, it seems a melancholy note to begin the comedy show, but fuck it, Lou Reed passed away this morning.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
And let's dedicate this one to him, shall we?

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
And as sad as this song seems, but she's not afraid.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
It's fucking good stuff.

01:03.000 --> 01:13.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harvintown, the king of sadness, Dan Harvint.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Thank you.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
It's a special sleepy sad Harvintown, and it's not Lou Reed's fault, really, for dying.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Well, is it?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
It might be.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
No, I was going to be sleepy and sad no matter what.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
My girlfriend's out of town, and I don't know if I've ever been this apart from her this long.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I can't remember.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It's been like four days?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
That's the longest?

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, we kind of just started spending every day together when we started hanging out.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
When is she back?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Tuesday or something.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
It's gonna be what?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Nirana a week.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
She left a basket of gifts next to the front door, one for each day that she's gone, that I can open.

02:03.000 --> 02:12.000
Which leads me to item number one in my segment tonight called Things Dan Harvint's Not Allowed to Complaint About,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
which item number one is my girlfriend loves me too much.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I can't keep up.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
How am I supposed to match something like that?

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm reading that off of one of the gifts that she got me the first night, which is my new gold eye Harmon,

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
which is this kind of hinged clasped kind of affair.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
But I guess item number two that I'm not allowed to complain about is this thing.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
It sucks.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I mean, it's functionally.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I mean, it's gorgeous.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Certainly, aesthetically, it looks like exactly what you wanted.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Yeah, it's got a slender.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It's all love, no function.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
It's got a sticker on the front that says eye Harmon with my silhouette on it.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
It's held together with the pen so that when you pull the pen out, it springs open.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
But it's one of those slippery, shitty, twisty pens that you have to twist to get the ink nub out of.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
And also, the paper, it's like that paper that every three centimeters,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
there's a random spot that won't take the ink, you know what I'm talking about?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
It's a piece of shit.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, for me, the deal breaker is the quality of the paper.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
You want good paper that takes ink well.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I mean, yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
So she loves me a lot.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Have you written any notes down in that one?

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, I wrote, Girlfriend Loves Me Too Much as the number one thing,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
but I kept having to start over because the paper sucks.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I had other stuff on there that I now can't remember.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It's going to be a bad show because of this thing.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
What else has she gotten you so far?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
She got me some throwing knives.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
When I was younger, I used to throw knives in my backyard.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
And so she got me some throwing knives and she put a target on the fence

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
that separates my place from my neighbor's place.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
It's this really low fence.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Even if you hit the fence, you're still fucking up your own fence

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
and probably your neighbor's fence.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Or killing a child.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, nine times out of ten.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
If you've ever played darts before, yeah, it's about 20% of the darts

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
go over the top of the board.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
What were the circumstances that you came home one morning or day

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
and Jay Johnson and I were at your old apartment

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
and we had taken actual kitchen knives.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
And you were just throwing them on a door in my apartment.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
At a wall.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
At a wall.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And we had destroyed a wall in your place.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
I think the circumstances were booze and probably other drugs.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, probably certainly drugs.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I think I went to work and came back and you guys were still doing it.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
We had taken like a bucket out and drawn a circle

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
and then like a plate and drawn a smaller circle.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
And we had numbered them and we were like betting a dollar a throw.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And then I came home.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I got up, went to work, but I didn't get up.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I stayed up all night with you guys, went to work, came home.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
And when I came home, when I opened my apartment's front door,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
confetti fell.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Because one of the many dumb drunk things you guys did,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
it was set like a confetti trap.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And you were just, I came into this two red puffy,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
we did adults like laughing and crying

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
because confetti had fallen on my head.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
But it was like, anyone watching objectively would have been like,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
this is not worth celebrating.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
That confetti is alcoholism.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
This is a movie of the week.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
All right, so yeah, it's a sleepy, sad, harm at town.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
It looks like the attendees agree, I think.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
We're not packed to the rafters here.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
You know, part of what I blame for it is the Halloween people,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
whoever schedules Halloween.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Putting it on a Thursday afternoon?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It's the worst possible day.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
There's no weekend leading up to it.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Nobody knows what to do.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And no one's going to dress up really joyfully on the day after Halloween.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Some women are just dressing like a cat for two weeks in a row.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
They don't know what to do.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
They're just like, I have a tail and I just encase.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
A lot of people are doing nothing.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
I was going to dress up as Erin in honor of her version of dressing up as me.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, she looked like Robert Smith in the cure.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
But you didn't want to dress as Spencer when I suggested let's all dress as Spencer

06:50.000 --> 06:58.000
because that wouldn't involve makeup and women's clothes.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
You keep pushing for second year of David Bowie in a row.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I wasn't pushing for that.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I was saying I was going to go for what's easy

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
and you shouldn't dress up like your friends.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Guy likes to dress as women.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That's all I know.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Why women?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
David Bowie in Labyrinth is kind of a woman, but he's still a guy.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
He's the Goblin King.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You were Snow White one year.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I was.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
But that was because my girlfriend at the time had a Snow White costume

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
from her oversized roommate.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I didn't know I was cornering you about this.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I thought this was...

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I'll dress as women.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I have multiple wigs at home.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
All right, let's bring up Spencer bright and early.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Right now.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
Let's keep this sleepy train rolling.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Hey.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Hello.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
How's it going, you guys?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Are you nice and sleepy, Spencer?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm pretty nice and sleepy.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Everybody got their headache on?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Everybody got a sleepy headache?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I woke up at 6 a.m. in Fairhaven, Washington, and flew in only moments ago.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
I woke up, took a two-hour drive to Seattle, flew, went straight to our D&D game with you guys.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
We had our little...

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It was just Spencer, Dan, and Rob Schrab and I.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
That was a pretty sleepy D&D game, too.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Rob Schrab was supine through most of it.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
He was actually laying down on his back.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Virmouth Facts is your turn. We'd wake up and he would cast some sort of spell.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
We killed lots of baddies, though.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
All right, let's keep the sleepy train rolling.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Let's get some of these sleepy people's problems.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Who's depressed tonight?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And I'm not asking who's got a problem.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
You can just say, if you're depressed, if you're feeling like at the bottom of your bio-rhythmic curve,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
nobody, everybody's walking on sunshine.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Well, no, I don't want people stepping into the role.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I'll pretend to be depressed.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
That's nice. No, that's good.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Let's look at that as a beautiful aurora borealis.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
How are you real quick, just like to set the barometer?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Are you up, down, depressed?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm definitely down.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Because Aaron's gone or because what?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Aaron's gone.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't know why.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I had kind of a headache all day.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
You know what?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I've been playing this video game that she got from me.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
That was her second gift to me, or Saturday's gift, was this Ellen Page, Willem Dafoe video game,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
where you're just like, it's one of those video games.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I don't expect you to understand this.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I know who Willem Dafoe is. That's it.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I know, but there's this kind of video game.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
I'm assuming it's the exact same company that made that Deep Rain or whatever it is, Hard Rain.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Heavy Rain, thank you.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
Deep Rain, Heavy Rain, Thick Rain, Wet Rain.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
I played the whole game through this one, this Ellen Page, Willem Dafoe one.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
It's really weird.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
On paper, it shouldn't be fun at all because it really is just much more like you're watching a movie

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
and they just kind of invite you to move along with your joystick.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
You can tell from observing what's happening that it probably doesn't matter what you do, basically,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
because you can't die that I know of.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Is it a shooter? Is it a thriller?

10:28.000 --> 10:39.000
It's kind of a sci-fi, Japanese, kind of chick flick.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I don't know how to describe the genre of the adventure you're on.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
So you're just a protagonist in a film?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
And it's a sort of spiritual, dramatic thriller about supernatural powers and stuff.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
You just got to go through this 25-hour movie.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Had you asked for this video game?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
No, no, she just got it for me.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
It was nice because I really wasn't in the mood to play Grand Theft Auto.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
I love Grand Theft Auto.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
It's working great, but I don't know what it is.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I wouldn't have played it otherwise, but having a new thing that I knew would probably take two days.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
I just put it in and played it in my monogram PJs that she also got me.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
And she also got me dark chocolate peanut butter cup I missed her so much.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
But I was Ellen Page all weekend.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Maybe that's why I'm depressed.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
I was just Ellen Page with this spiritual entity following me that I could use to open drawers and find clues.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
So I'm just feeling a little depressed.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Can you choose to be Willem de Faul?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
No, you cannot.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
And you wouldn't want to be. He's weird.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
He does not translate well to video game.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Ellen Page works very well, whatever goop they put on your face,

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
whatever ping-pong balls they taped to your head to capture your movement and stuff.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
She made a good protagonist for a video game, Willem de Faul.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
All of the bad things about Willem de Faul come through in a video game.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
And all of the humanity is left behind.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
If Gina Davis were eating a plate of Willem de Faul that came through a telepod,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
she would go, it's synthetic.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
Willem de Faul is 90% skull.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
There's a lot of skull to Willem de Faul.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
He's craggy.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
When he and William Sadler were separated through the screen door of actors,

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Sadler got a lot of the humanity.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
And De Faul only got so much that's stripped away again by this game, so anyways.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
So headache?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
Headache.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Ellen Page video game.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I've been Ellen Page all weekend.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Missing Aaron.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Missing Aaron.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So throwing darts.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
There was last week too, the lady came up and that was weird, right?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I loved it.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I didn't listen to it.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I was afraid to listen to it because I'm just so tired.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
There's a lethargy to this too, like I'm just so tired of being a fucking bad person.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
So tired.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
I don't think you were a bad person.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Emotionally tired?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
It's like you feel like your emotions are doing stuff.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Is Lisa here right now by the way?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
No.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
No.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
She got into a personal submarine and went to Tokyo.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
I think one of the writers told me that somebody wrote an email saying she's resigned from the

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
fandom or something.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh wow.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Look, I have no fucking horse in this race.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Either does she, man.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
She came up here and was like, she had this sort of, I mean, you have a Christ complex,

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
but your Christ complex met hers.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
And she was like, I just wish people would stop asking me what I thought about this stuff,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
but that's what the whole thing was for sale.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
She hated you, but loves community and hated being on stage, but clearly needed to be,

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
I don't know.

13:51.000 --> 13:57.000
I think the biggest, the most unanticipated kind of blowback from that was that what should

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
have occurred to me, what sometimes happens at Harmontown is that in our haste to have

14:03.000 --> 14:09.000
a dialogue, we forget that only a kind of diehard Harmontown person knows that coming

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
up on stage is not a bad thing.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
It's not like coming up to a witness stand.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's not like you're under arrest for something.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
And I was a little thrown by the fact that she did not come up smiling.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
I expected, when I say is so and so here, I expect that to be the equivalent of tickling

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
them.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
And I said is so and so here, and she was like, well, I don't know.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And it was like, oh, shit, we fucked up.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
And how do you do it?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Red wire or blue wire?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And it didn't matter.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Because I am not skilled at that.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Does that mean she's never heard of Harmontown?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
She only loves community and never heard this show?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
I don't know.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I don't know.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
The first thing that I noticed was that she came up and it was contentious.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Like she came up in a very cross looking kind of posture.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It's a shame.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's a bummer.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
Did that, what was the fallout for you from that?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
There hasn't been.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I kind of like, I've taken the opportunity.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
I was like, you know what, I got so many people I've talked to.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm still on Twitter because Twitter seems pretty safe.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
It's just sort of like this trickling stream of garbage.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
You can't really mix it up or write an essay about how someone should be crucified or

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
something on Twitter.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
It doesn't work.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
So I've been trying to wean myself off of, and this is such a sad thing to me.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I grew up on the internet.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
If somebody is writing the world's lowest stakes biopic, you've got to circle the irony

15:37.000 --> 15:45.000
here that from the age of 13, I was learning to interact with people on computers and always

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
wanted to write television and ended up out in LA writing television in an era when this

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
internet thing that I had grown up on was actually starting to impact television and ended up

15:56.000 --> 16:02.000
with this weird crossroads where I had the first TV show that was sort of so loved by

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
a previously unmeasured demographic that it actually was able to stay on the air, but

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
at the same time was sort of like, it's just such an odd, weird, swirling thing.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.000
It was like my accessibility became part of a product.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
I don't know where I started buying into that stock or that press.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I don't know what was fantasy, what was reality.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
I just always knew, I still know one thing, which is that I would rather die than not

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
be able to talk about how I feel, and especially not in the medium that I understand where I

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
can truly express myself, which is the typed word.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
And so that's always going to be a deal breaker for me, but the tragic irony of this whole

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
thing is coming around to finally like, I'm back on the page now of all this.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
I just got to get these suitcases in my hand standing outside the internet going like,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
what happened?

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm just going to go do what rich people do.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
I'm just going to shuffle around my house and my slippers and maybe I'll buy a boat.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
And I'll just be like Instagramming me in a jet ski because I'm like, this is the life.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
This is what life is, but that was never what life was for me.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Life was like, life was sitting in forums and talking.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
But jet skis were built so that you could not take a selfie.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Right.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
That and Carpool Diem, we came up with that.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Carpool Diem.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Carpool Diem.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Did anyone ever come up with Carpool Diem?

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
Dan and I drove here today and we were ashamed that nobody has come up with Carpool Diem.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Someone might have.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
We don't know.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
So all of that, why do we bring Spencer up so early again?

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Because he's a laugh a minute.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Sure.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Why are you throwing it to me?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
No.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I mean, what is?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Okay.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
So I'm going to throw Carpool Diem.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Carpool Diem?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Carpool Diem.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I'm thinking you're too literal, man.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Carpool Diem.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
Today's Carpool Diem because I got two people in my vehicle.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Is that how you use it?

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Or are you like, hey man, Carpool Diem because that's wrong.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Carpool Diem.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
What the?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Carpool.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
How about this?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Carpool Two Diem.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
No.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
See, don't appease him.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
His thirst for logic just made a horrible slogan.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I'm not suggesting anything.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Spock didn't work in advertising.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Sometimes you just go like, just do it, says Nike.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Spock would be like, just do what, Captain?

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
And it'd be a fair question unless you were branding something.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
All right.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
That's not my arena, you guys.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm confident in admitting that.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
But what do people that don't get on the internet do?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Golf hobbies?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Golf.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
We should start golfing again.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Falconry.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
That'll make this show great.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
People can show up and listen to our golf stories.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Dan, I would suggest to you to start picking up Falconry.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
I prefer joinery, you know, wood joining.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Wood joining?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
You know, you create joints in wood and then join them together.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
What's your favorite method of joining wood together?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Oh, definitely the dovetail.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Really?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
No.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
No.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Because I had you pick for a Mortis and Tennant man.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
You know, that was the thing I was trying to go for, but my brain couldn't think of.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
When I worked at my book job, I actually read through a shit ton of joinery books.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
And I knew about the Mortis and Tennant joint, but I couldn't think of it now because I've

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
been doing all this other stuff at jobs.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Mortis and Tennant, he was like arch enemies with Henry David Thoreau, right?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
No, there were these two brothers.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
One was tall and one was short.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
The short one had a club.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
Tennant was the guy that haunted Ebony's or Scrooge.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So they call it joinery?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
They don't just call it carpentry?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I have no idea.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
I think, yeah, joinery is like when you're not using like nails and shit.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
You're just, you're using slots and the way you stick the wood together.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
The art of non-adhesive wood joining.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
I think they use glue.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
Are you saying, Dan, you're in the market for a hobby that's not typing words to strangers

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
that you never will meet and hate you for no reason?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
No, no, no, no, no.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
He's looking for something to do at this time, but that's what a hobby is essentially, right?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
No, no.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
You know what it is?

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
It's a healthy thing because what I somehow came, what started doing was like sucking energy

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
off of the internet, which I don't think, you know, it's a medium.

20:44.000 --> 20:51.000
Like you should, I, if I'm true to my lip service, like I should be getting pleasure

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
from putting shit out, like expressing myself.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
But then I have to somehow become a person that actually doesn't look at the response,

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
you know, doesn't like pay attention, like never clicks the little A in the circle on

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
the Twitter client, which it just seems weird because sometimes people are saying like,

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
Hey, you, you, you, you helped me or can I ask you a question?

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
But, but you just kind of want to be able to go like and just like kind of exhale without

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
inhaling, without taking back.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
And what I'm wondering is, so what do I substitute?

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Cause I was like sucking energy off of things.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
Like, like, like what do you do in normal life when you want to get energy?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
You can't get on the internet and suck your little thumb.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Ask, ask people here what they do.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I don't think, I think that they're pretty much like me.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't know, but let's guys raise in his hand.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
You go to bars alone and talk to strangers.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Uh, bars alone and talk to strangers.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
He says, all right, that sounds good.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
But certainly what I was doing from 91 to 2009 for community started up.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
But when you were, when you, like you said last week was last week.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
Uh, you said that, uh, writing is, uh, gross people asking for hugs.

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
Like, like it's you saying, like you're putting that stuff out there for the response.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It's, it's, it's not you putting things out.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
It's you receiving something back from them.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
So you, you have a relationship with the internet that I don't have.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
I wouldn't have because I like, I couldn't do it.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Like you, you want the response.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
You can hear a thousand, uh, bits of praise and hear one bad thing.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
And you'll obsess about that because you're looking for that information.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
You're, you're trying to triangulate who you are based on strangers input.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Yeah.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
So I just want to know, like, what's the worst thing that somebody could say about you?

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Because I want to move in that direction because I,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
well, last week it was saying, don't talk.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Right.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Which is like saying, yeah.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Tie your shoe.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Do anything different.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Stop doing what you're doing.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Like you, you have a huge like energetic reaction to anybody saying,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
change your behavior.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Like in the, uh, in the, in the, uh, what was the city,

23:03.000 --> 23:08.000
the Pittsburgh show of the Harmon tour when like Erin came out and she'd been affected by something.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
And she said, uh, like that hurt my feelings.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And you said, I'm sorry that you were hurt.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
And she was like, uh, well, are you, are you sorry that I'm hurt?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Are you sorry about what you said?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And like it was all about behavior modification.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
Like you don't, you don't, you don't want to be asked to change anything,

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
which is nobody wants to ask to be changed anything.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
We don't want to have to change, but we all must.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
We all do have to adapt if we want to grow.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
But anytime anybody asks you,

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
what if I want to grow into a person that never has to change?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
What if I want to become like Godzilla?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You have to change the most.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I have to change into Godzilla.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
You actually have to change DNA.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I do that by not caring what people think, right?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So I cut myself off from everybody, like Godzilla,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
and I slowly mutate into a giant lizard that breathes fire.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Well, the fear for you is that if, if, if you had to change anything,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
you'd be sacrificing your identity.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
You lose who you, you are, who you were.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
But, but, but the only thing that I am is a person that doesn't want to be told what to do.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Well, that's not true.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
You're the guy that likes to do a million things.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
One of the things about you is that you hate being told to change,

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
but changes is adaptation and evolution.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
It doesn't mean changing identity or changing essence.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
You're never going to change your essential qualities,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
but you could like, you know, you could change,

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
you could learn to soften this about yourself

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
or enhance that about yourself.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
That's not becoming a bad version of you

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
or being bullied or bossed around.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
What is, what is softening and what is that?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
What does that mean?

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Every, every, every fifth time you have something on your mind,

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
you don't say it.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Is that what, is that what that is?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
No, it's, it's, it's knowing the difference between

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
saying what somebody needs to hear

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
and saying what the first thing that came to your mind was.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
You can say both things at once.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
You can say, you can express yourself without saying a hurtful thing

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
to somebody that you care about.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I don't, I truly don't.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
I don't think of myself as somebody that says a lot of hurtful things.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Well, no, but you, you know that you have the capacity

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
to absolutely hurt somebody without meaning it at all.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
We all did, we all have that capacity.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Like you can say something that you could have said.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
What are you, what are you, what are you saying?

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
What, what, what, how, how does one grow and change?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
What is the mandate there?

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
You're asking a man, being.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
We don't know, we don't know how to do this.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Being nicer.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Women have to come into our lives and we have to,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
we have to allow femininity into our lives.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
And women go, hey, you know what?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
The thing you meant to say, don't say it.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Just say, hey, they're there.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Like just be a human being for a second

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
and don't have an egotistical reaction to something

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
and need like reinforcement at all fucking times.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Like we think that like,

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
male egos are so fucking fragile and so brittle and so shitty.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
And we think that women have this power

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
and women think that we have this power

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
but we don't.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Like you can, you don't have to change any part of yourself

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
to not be a cock.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Like, you know, like when you are in a bad mood.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
When my blood sugar is low, if it's been a long drive

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
and I need a fucking sandwich, I become Liza Minnelli.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
I become a fucking, like, I become a cranky weirdo

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
and I will say things that I don't mean.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
But if you grow up, ideally you learn to go like,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
oh, this is that feeling I get when Jeff Davis

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
is about to become an absolute unsupportable cunt

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
for no fucking reason.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
And what I should do is go, hey, I'm sorry everybody,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm gonna take a walk.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Like I'm gonna recognize that what I'm about to do

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
is be hurtful.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
And before I say the hurtful thing

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
that I know that I can do,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
like Indiana Jones flips a fucking whip,

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
I will just say something soft instead of hard.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
This just sounds like this is a bunch of fucking garbage

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
that a therapist tells you.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Like, this is such a bunch of like business casual

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
cope with society, like, oh.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Is that really, is that the way to get through the day?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Look, Dan.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Mr. Harmon?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Dan.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Uh, no, no.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Maybe my girlfriend said, well, next time,

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
do you think maybe you should do that,

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
but then take a step back, take a deep breath,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
and maybe not do that as much?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Yes, you're right.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I guess a perfect person wouldn't have done that.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Well, all right, that'll be $700.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Well, okay, here's what I would say to that.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I would say it's about being around people

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
that you respect more than yourself.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Down on everybody, you don't fucking,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
you don't ever like aspire to better behavior.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
If you treat people, if you always aim down,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
and whenever you're cranky, vulnerable,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
defensive, whatever, and you fire down on people,

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
you cannot possibly grow.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
But if you surround yourself by people

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
whose opinions you covet and crave and want to nurture

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
and you want them to think well of you,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
then you start saying like, oh, like,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
what would I do to make people that I look up to

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
look up to me?

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
And it's not about softening

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
and rounding off edges of your personality

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
so you can make dumb people like you.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
It's about becoming more attractive to the people

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
that you aspire to be, or to be around.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
That's interesting.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Keep burped.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Couldn't help it.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Yeah, that's an interesting way of looking at it.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I like that philosophy.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
You could keep somebody in your head,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
instead of the guy in the back of the room

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
who's got his arms folded going like,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
oh, that guy's not funny, you know,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
like kind of like having this phantom heckler in your head,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
like playing to an idiot, you know,

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
trying to make idiots like you.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Like, imagining that that guy is, you know,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Agent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
or even if it's just a fictional character,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
somebody that you look up to,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
you're like, I wouldn't want him to think I was a twat.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
You know, and then, yeah, I like that.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
That's good. That's smart.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
All right, we got that covered.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
We're all going to be good people for now.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Because nobody ever wants to live in a world

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
where we had to change you, one iota.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
We don't want you to ever have to,

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
like, choke up on the bat and not be full forest,

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
awesome, crazy, like, rampant Dan Harmon.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
We want you to always be firing,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
like, from the hip, like, you know,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
like Jack Palin's and Shane, like,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
we want you to be a good guy, a bad guy,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
like, a weirdo, because you're a good writer

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
and we can't, you can't write well

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
if you're thinking about what people think

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
about what you're going to say.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
You need to say whatever you want to say.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But I just have to be thinking in my head

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
when I'm saying it, this one's for Obama.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
No.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
No.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
If he's listening.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
What you have to think is like,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
it's possible to evolve and still be you.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
It's possible to be a higher version of you.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
You can elevate yourself above certain behavior

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
that you yourself are not proud of.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
That you say things that you regret later on.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
And we drink and we say things drunken

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
and we use that as an excuse,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
and that's fine, but you know, or it's not fine.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
But ideally, there'd be a point

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
when we stop saying things that are asinine

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
or adolescent or purile or hurtful.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And I like to think that at 40 years old

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
I can't hurt people's feelings anymore accidentally.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
But guess what?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm fucking way better at it than I ever was.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
Like, I can now just be dismissive of somebody

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and that's more hurtful.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So like, we do have to like grow a bit

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
and use our brains, our evolved intellect.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
I'm stupider than I was when I was 19.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I was way more connected and way smarter

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
than when I was when I was young.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Er, not that 40 years old.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
But I look at myself now and I'm like,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
oh, I can be crotchety.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I can be cross.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Contrary.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
I can be a person that I wouldn't have liked

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
when I was 19.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
So like, it's not about me stopping being Jeff Davis.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
It's about me like learning to finesse it a little bit

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and make it sexier.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
You know.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
But you don't like that.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
No, it's very complicated when your relationship

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
is with other people.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
When you gravitate towards this personality type

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
that, you know, a lot of us in LA, I think,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
we want relationships with strangers.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.000
We come out here seeking a hug from strangers.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And some of us do stand-ups.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Some of us write.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Some of us direct.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Some of us act.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
But we're kind of, a lot of us pursue some kind of craft.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Like, oh, I'm James Dean.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
I don't care who's watching.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
But come on, you're not making brick walls.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
And even if you were, people use brick walls

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
and you want people to say, what a good brick wall.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
You did a good job.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
The extreme personality that really wants validation,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
you know, that really drives you.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
That's really part of your thing.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Then you have this, you have a relationship with strangers.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
And then you have this weird thing that becomes,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
like there's this feedback loop.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
But what was my point?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
My point was, something you said made me think,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
like, you know, I think the most complicated thing

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
about all of this is that we all give ourselves

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
so much more credit than we think we do.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Like, everyone comes into every exchange almost,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
like, as an underdog.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Everybody thinks that they're the one

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
that needs to stick up for themselves.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
We don't look at you and think of you as an underdog.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
We think of you as a titan.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
That's the crazy thing, though.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
Because, like, you know, it's...

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Boyfriends with their girlfriends don't look at their girlfriend

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and think, well, like, she's the underdog.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
We look at them.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Everybody is holding power over us.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
And we're all trying to rest power away from each other.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
And that's why relationships go bad.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
Yes, because everybody is sticking up for themselves.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
We said last week that, you know, we talked,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
or it was a week or two ago, that we talked about,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
or it could have been fucking months ago,

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
about, like, when people come to you and are weird,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
they want to find out if you think they're smart.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
If people want to come to me and find out

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
if I think they're cool.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
What do you want from other people?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
When you go...

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Like, if you shake hands with these folks after the show,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
when we were on tour, like, walking on the street

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
from Aaron, from anybody, like,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
what is it that you want from them?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
What are you being worried about?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Well, I just...

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I always just wanted people to tell me

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
that there was a reason why I was born,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
that I was... I don't know, I just want efficacy,

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
or not efficacy, like, you know,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
contribution, value.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
To be loved?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I mean, I don't know.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I think the part of my condition is, like,

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
that love, like,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
I think that, like, there's circuits

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
that go through my circuit board that are...

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
There's parts of the board that are, like,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
have this carbon scoring on them, on it.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
And then, so then there's either through a detour,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
or it...

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
I intellectualize love.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
I think of love as a thing that is very conditional,

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
as very, like, you know,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
it's a thing that you don't just get

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
because you're someone's son.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
But when you go on a comment section on the internet,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
what are you looking for?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
What are you hoping you hear?

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
He's amazing.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
He did a great job. Like, he's really, really good.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
What's the worst thing that you...

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
What's the thing that you're looking...

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Are you aiming at a certain thing that you don't want to hear?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
He's a fraud. He's overrated.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
He's pretentious. He doesn't...

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
He thinks that he's special and he's not.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
He's a completely ordinary, completely lucky person

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
who just wandered into my attention

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
and he does not have any right to have it.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
So how do you feel right now?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Do you have the right to have that opinion of yourself?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Do you feel that you're not too big for your boots

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
that you deserve all this?

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
The boots keep changing size as I keep walking forward

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
and keep ending up in different climates.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
So the answer is no. That's an open-ended thing.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Yes. That's what will never change.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
I think if you focus on that, I think that's sickness.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
I think that's the thing. You can't...

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You're never going to win that game.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And you're not going to arrive at a point where...

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
It's not empirical. You can't measure it.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
You will only... That's co-dependence.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Like, you're going like, you have to fill this unfillable hole

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
and you can't... You have to actually self-actualize

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
and go, oh, I know what I do and what I don't do.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I'm comfortable with it.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Most of all, I do my work and I step back.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I just do it because I like to do it

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
and I'm done doing it now and I step back

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
and that's what a perfect person does.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
But the weird irony is that a lot of perfect people don't...

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
They don't tend to get that pin out, you know?

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
It's an interesting thing though

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
that, you know, we all think of ourselves as underdogs

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
and I think we all look at other people.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Like, I can look around the room right now

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
and you're strangers and you're eye contact.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Like, that's another person.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
I don't know what their thing is. They might...

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
They're thinking, I paid $10 for this.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
They might... Yeah.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
This is like sitting with my brother.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
Who's just sleeping on my couch

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and just complaining about his parents.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
We all cast ourselves as underdogs,

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
but it's interesting to find out that we freak...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Like, Spencer, like...

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
What?

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
Like, you would be freaked out to find out that you're...

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
There was a show when Dan was talking about

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
like, he's a better writer than me.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Like, you're a genius. You're half his age.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Like, it's weird to find out that we all look up to each other.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
That we all look at other human beings and go,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
oh, that person, there's a weird sparkle in their eye.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
There's a tilt of their head.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
They go, I wish I could do that too.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
We all fucking... We all aspire to other people

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
and if we could all be, and I think that's that superhero wish,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
that superpower wish, if we all look around and go,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I wish I could sit as tall as that guy

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
and I wish I could be as sexy as her

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
and I wish I could like... I wish I could...

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I wish I could do that dumb thing with my face

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
that that guy does all the time.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I wish I could... I wish I could...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I had the balls to wear that shirt.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
Where are you from? My sympathies.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
You're the shittiest Don Rickles of all time.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
But Don Rickles will walk out and he would make fun of every race

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
but think it somehow was uplifting because the idea is that...

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Because most of the races were actively oppressed

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
and couldn't do anything about it.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Because it's all arbitrary.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
All racism is such a fucking completely arbitrary arrow thrown at nothing

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
and all we are is afraid of other people looking at us

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
and everything is a mirror

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
and it's very interesting to look at...

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
If I could give any advice to anybody,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
but surround yourself with heroes

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and live your life around people that you look up to

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
that are smarter than you.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
If you're the smartest person in your group of friends

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
you have a bad group of friends.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
You should be intimidated by your significant other.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
You should look up to her or him

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
and we should all be working with people

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
that are better at the things we want to be good at.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
But it's amazing to find out that you

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
who has the show and has community and has the stuff

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
that really you have an incredibly low self-opinion

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
mixed with an incredibly high self-opinion

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
and that's a chicken or the egg kind of thing

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
like is it self-love or self-loathing that begets the other one.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
But it's crazy to find out that we're all really, really concerned

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
that we're worthless.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Yeah, you'd think that would unify us.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
You would think that we would stop...

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
This show is a unification of people who want to find out

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
that it's okay to feel worthless because we're not.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
I think that's what a lot of, and I hate to use the word nerd,

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
but nerd culture, geek culture, intellectual culture

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
is a bunch of people who are like,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I've been kicked around a lot

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
but I'm pretty sure that I'm doing it just as good as I can

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
and we think about it more.

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
The unexamined life is a life not worth living,

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
we're people who think about it too much.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
I think Kurt Vonnegut said,

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
what if you examine your life and it comes up fucking garbage?

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Yeah, then you win!

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
We're a room full of people who have...

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
the stakes are high.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
We actually care about how the world perceives us.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I think the people that are the bullies,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
the people that are the jocks, the people that are the dominant...

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
the people that are in Congress

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
dicking around our country and our Constitution

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
and all over the world...

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
there are people who do not consider what they fucking look like.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
I think they think that by bullshitting around the room all day long

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
that they're doing it just right.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
This is the thing about the archetype of the old white man in the suit

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
that controls everything and owns everything.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
I think the thing that makes that archetype a villain

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
is the one missing ingredient where that person doesn't do that thing

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
that doesn't say, I'm doing this by the way

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
because I'm really concerned that if I didn't do it I would be worthless.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
It just seems like such a crime.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
To me, I'm coming from this place on the hungry, hungry hippo arena.

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
My hippo comes from the place of...

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
because that game is all about what angle you're coming in on.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
That was a horrible metaphor.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
It's horrible if you're born after 1982.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
My battle bot is designed around the principle

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
that if you are sincere, if you're transparent

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
then you're going to have a ton of problems.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
You're going to constantly be made fun of.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
People are going to be going like, what?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
What did you just say?

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
You're not allowed to be specific.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
You just hurt my feelings.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
You're punished for being specific.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
You just said it wrong.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
You just did this and that.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
You do that, that's fucked up.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
You're going to have to deal with that, go through that.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
I think maturity for the transparent person is like,

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
you have to deal with it.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Your transparency, if it includes an image of you

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
having your feelings hurt because you're so transparent

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
is not true transparency.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
It's another stained glass window with you as a saint

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
and it's distorting the light that's coming through.

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
My goal is transparency, is just going like,

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
look, I don't know if I'm a good person or a bad person

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
but I got to be honest.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
I know for sure that thinking one thing and saying another

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
it may seem in the moment like it's a really good idea

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
but it's a really slippery slope.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
You're cursed with being an intellectual.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
That's a stupid word.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
It's tough.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
It could be rough.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
The thing is, if you think about things,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
things are fucking tough.

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
The Odyssey, Homer, the stories about heroes,

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
they didn't think a lot.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
They just went out and they fought dragons and they did shit.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
But like later on, as life goes on,

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
we become intellectualized and we think about everything too much

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
and we become crippled by it.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Which is why we've created a new character in Harmontown

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
that we're going to introduce right now called Johnny Jackhammer,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
the man in the street.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Let's go and get Johnny.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Johnny Jackhammer.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Let's open the window and talk down to him.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
Hey Johnny Jackhammer, what are you doing down there?

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
Hey, Dan Harmon, what the fuck?

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
Hey, I'm just Jackhammering the street.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
Hey Johnny Jackhammer, why is your theme country music?

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I don't know, I can't hear much.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I Jackhammer for a living.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
It's a little distracting that it keeps going on.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Yeah, that's true.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
This is Johnny Jackhammer, Obama or Clinton.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
Hey, they're all a bunch of guys that don't know how to Jackhammer.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
That's all I'm saying.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
That's true.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
That's true.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
I say, hey, you know what I say?

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Take two of these guys, these congressmen's or whatever.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
You give them each a Jackhammer.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
Whoever can tear up more street, that's who gets my vote, you know?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Ah, you know what?

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
That's some blue collar wisdom.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Sometimes things aren't as complicated as we burden ourselves with thinking.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
Johnny Jackhammer, everybody.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Oh, oh, one more thing.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
You know, we should build a war on the country because fuck everyone that ain't white.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Oh, shit, goddammit, Johnny.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Johnny, Johnny, no.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
Goddammit, he was so close to being our Will Rogers.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Johnny, Johnny, just get in the car and get in the car.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I hate black people.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm the good Jackhammer of the black people.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Oh, Johnny.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Oh, Johnny.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Goddammit.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
I thought we found a hero.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I thought we found the key to our nation's lock.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Johnny, just get in the car and go back to the hotel.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Yeah, I can't jack up.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Jackhammer in the car.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
No, Johnny, don't jackhammer in the car.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
CG.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Holy fuck.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Johnny Jackhammer started jackhammering in the car.

44:22.000 --> 44:30.000
But he went through the floor of the car and the car flipped up like the Nazi van and raiders.

44:30.000 --> 44:40.000
And just flipped and hit a gas station, which as we all know is full of gas, and will explode on impact.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
You know why?

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Because Johnny didn't think of himself as an underdog.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
He, yeah, no.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
In his head, he still had one little secret.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, he put himself above other races.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That's the biggest crime you can commit.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
I think that's where bigotry comes from, the idea that you can exert your will over other people.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Whereas I think we all come in low.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
We're punished for coming underneath other people, you know.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
We're not punished for, we're rewarded for.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Right.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Meanwhile, Spencer over there.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I'm over here.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
My back hurts, you guys.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
It's fucked up.

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
If anyone's been looking at me like I've had to take it, like this guy's moving around like he's got a shit.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
That's what I've been doing, my back just hurts.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
What's wrong with your back, Spencer?

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
I don't know, it's just, I can't, like, it's not comfortable right now.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
I don't know.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
I can lay down.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Lay down?

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Nah, that would be engaging.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Just lay down for us, Spencer.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Just lay down on the floor and do like, David Milch wrote all of Deadwood from the floor.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Like, just facing up.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Is anybody here a masseuse or a masseur?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
What are you right on?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Anybody here?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
No, I don't, I'm not acting.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Everyone's backwards.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
Wait, wait, we have a bunch of people in the front row who's back hurts.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Bill's back hurts.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Jay's back hurts.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Okay.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
What the fuck?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Anybody else?

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Who has a bad back here?

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
My back hurts.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Your neck hurts?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Jesus Christ.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Podcast listeners, everyone's holding up their hands.

46:01.000 --> 46:11.000
I'm going to get the number for this woman, Destiny, who, she, I think I have her number.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
Chris McKenna started bringing her in like season two or three on Destiny.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
Like when the, when the community writers would do a couple, couple all nighters or something,

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
like he'd pay to bring in this, this masseuse Destiny.

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
She'd set up like a little masseuse table in a, in a vacant office and the writers would

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
go in.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
I've never partaken.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
I can't, I don't like the idea of someone who's, who's touched multiple people professionally,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
actually seeing my naked back.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.640
I don't, I don't like, I don't, it's an inferiority thing.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.760
It's not like a phobic thing.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.600
Is that related at all to your, like, you're not a huggy person or a touchy person.

46:48.600 --> 46:49.600
Yeah, yeah.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.000
Cause I'm worried I'm going to, I'm making the other person dirty.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
For real?

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Yeah.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.400
I feel like, like, if a, if a girl hugs me, like I'm going like, ugh, I just, I made

46:59.400 --> 47:01.000
a girl stinky.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
Was it like when you're with like a girlfriend, like, like with Erin or something like that?

47:06.000 --> 47:10.760
I take a lot of showers while I'm courting her and then, and then we, and then we move

47:10.760 --> 47:16.000
in together and then, then I just get back to work and tapers off a bit.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
I have a force field of, of flies around me and I, and I keep thinking like, ah, we'll

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
deal with this in a little bit.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
I was just going to get another paycheck.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
But is that, is the not washing healthy?

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
No, no, no, I'm not saying that.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
Is it, is it a, is that a way like subconscious or semi-conscious way to repel people?

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Is that a way of keeping distance?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Yes.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Yes.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
I'm just observing it objectively.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Yeah, probably.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Probably.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Yeah.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.680
It's like, and it's like, let's say people, if you let people in physically, like to hug

47:48.680 --> 47:54.160
you, to hold you, that goes back to some serious like, childs and stuff, I would imagine.

47:54.160 --> 48:00.280
But also like that, that's, that's so, it's not funny, like it's, it's not funny.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.280
It's hilarious.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
Hey, speak for yourself!

48:02.280 --> 48:03.280
Hey Johnny!

48:03.280 --> 48:08.280
Hey, keep it down up there, I'm trying to jackhammer.

48:08.280 --> 48:12.280
Johnny, you're going to jail for killing five black people.

48:12.280 --> 48:17.280
Hey, hey, look, you know, we all love each other, right?

48:17.280 --> 48:19.280
It's like the great Don Rickles said.

48:19.280 --> 48:22.280
You see, Dan's trying to keep me away from this conversation.

48:22.280 --> 48:27.280
You're using Johnny jackhammer as a way to keep me from getting away from this market.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.280
All I'm saying is I get it, you know, the whole thing, the repressed memories.

48:30.280 --> 48:32.280
I'm going to get up and hug you, Dan.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.280
All the jokes in the world.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.280
All the jokes.

48:35.280 --> 48:40.280
At the end of the day, you're either jacking up the concrete or you're not, hey, you know,

48:40.280 --> 48:42.280
if you are, you're not.

48:42.280 --> 48:47.280
Jeff's coming in for a hug.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.280
I'm going to hug you, Dan.

48:49.280 --> 48:53.280
Look, no, before we do it, you don't like it.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.280
This is not comfortable for you.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.280
You want to let me know that?

48:56.280 --> 48:58.280
I'm just saying bodily.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
You okay?

48:59.280 --> 49:00.280
Yeah, yeah.

49:00.280 --> 49:02.280
No, no, I'm fucking getting close.

49:02.280 --> 49:04.280
That's not a hug.

49:16.280 --> 49:19.280
It's podcast gold.

49:19.280 --> 49:21.280
I will tell you this though.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.280
I'm never going to watch this cheek again.

49:23.280 --> 49:29.280
When it's intellectualized, like I went to the communicon last week and the interesting thing is

49:29.280 --> 49:34.280
this happens a lot at communicon, at the Harmontownships and stuff.

49:34.280 --> 49:37.280
Somebody will breach the bubble.

49:37.280 --> 49:43.280
Somebody will just say, can I have a hug or something?

49:43.280 --> 49:44.280
They'll make a request.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.280
I'll go, one more thing.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.280
Can I have a hug?

49:46.280 --> 49:47.280
And I'll go, of course you can.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.280
Who would say no to that?

49:49.280 --> 49:53.280
And it's like, because they made this request, it's like, well, if I make you stinky with my hug,

49:53.280 --> 49:54.280
you asked for it.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.280
You can't go home and complain.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.280
Get on your blog and go, like, and then I...

49:58.280 --> 50:01.280
I asked him for a hug and he made me so gross.

50:01.280 --> 50:03.280
I woke up gross.

50:03.280 --> 50:07.280
So he kind of takes the pressure off and then a solicited hug and then he hug.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.280
And then there's a line of people.

50:09.280 --> 50:13.280
Then all of a sudden everybody starts going, can I have a hug?

50:13.280 --> 50:15.280
And it's really nice.

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
It's the best.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.280
It's a very gooey therapy thing.

50:19.280 --> 50:24.280
You can feel people's bodies kind of trembling a little bit because they're like, oh.

50:24.280 --> 50:29.280
You know, like, it's nice.

50:29.280 --> 50:37.280
Could you feel my body trembling then?

50:37.280 --> 50:41.280
Yes, I don't know.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.280
All right.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.280
So where were we?

50:44.280 --> 50:46.280
We were delving into your psychosis.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.280
All right.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.280
Psychosis.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.280
I heard this theory at all.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.280
Johnny, get back in the car.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.280
Your brain's got a different part for every part.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.280
All your mom's repressed memories and all.

50:56.280 --> 50:58.280
Hey, look, I got two parts of my brain.

50:58.280 --> 51:02.280
Coffee break and jackhammering, you know?

51:02.280 --> 51:03.280
Like, you gotta...

51:03.280 --> 51:08.280
Hey, I punch in against 650 if I don't jackhammer the concrete, you know?

51:08.280 --> 51:10.280
It ain't that complicated.

51:10.280 --> 51:11.280
Yeah, life...

51:11.280 --> 51:16.280
The BQE needs to be connected to the 110.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.280
Is that true?

51:18.280 --> 51:21.280
It's a big job.

51:21.280 --> 51:25.280
It was one of the major engineering feats of the 20th century.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.280
And I'm going to do it all with a jackhammer.

51:28.280 --> 51:34.280
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, it's your father.

51:34.280 --> 51:37.280
You can't jackhammer your way through life.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.280
I told you not to talk to me.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.280
Don't call me.

51:40.280 --> 51:45.280
Look, I'm sorry about what happened between us when we were, you know, years ago, back at home.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.280
Hey, yeah, we got a saying about sorry's at the jackhammer building, okay?

51:49.280 --> 51:52.280
It doesn't jack any concrete.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.280
It's just a word, okay?

51:54.280 --> 51:55.280
I got my friends...

51:55.280 --> 51:56.280
Johnny.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.280
...Vitucci and Tumor...

51:57.280 --> 51:59.280
Johnny.

51:59.280 --> 52:01.280
Johnny.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.280
What, Dad?

52:02.280 --> 52:04.280
I called your foreman a month ago.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.280
Aw, fuckin' A.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.280
I found out you've been fired for two years.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.280
Fuck you, man.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.280
Hey, fuck you, Dad.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.280
You haven't been jackhammering anything.

52:12.280 --> 52:14.280
You can't fire me for jackhammering, Dad.

52:14.280 --> 52:17.280
You can just stop payin' me, but I still got the hammer.

52:17.280 --> 52:20.280
And there's still concrete out there that ain't jacked.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.280
The only thing you're jackhammering, Johnny,

52:22.280 --> 52:26.280
the only thing you're jackhammering is your relationships with the people that are closest to you

52:26.280 --> 52:28.280
and the people that care about you the most.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.280
It's all fuckin' good for you, you know,

52:30.280 --> 52:32.280
because all of a sudden you're a new person

52:32.280 --> 52:36.280
because you realize you shouldn't have put your pinky up my asshole when you were bathing me.

52:36.280 --> 52:40.280
Look, I have my jackhammer, you have yours.

52:40.280 --> 52:48.280
Yeah, and all I got between you and me is a mile of cracked pavement.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.280
Johnny, I'm dying.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.280
I have liver cancer.

52:55.280 --> 52:56.280
Again?

52:56.280 --> 53:01.280
I'm sorry about jackhammering your anus with my pinky.

53:01.280 --> 53:03.280
It was a long time ago.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.280
It was a different time, and I was a different person,

53:05.280 --> 53:09.280
but I've realized now what's important to me is to be connected.

53:09.280 --> 53:14.280
I want to lay some pavement between you and I that is unbroken

53:14.280 --> 53:19.280
so I can walk over to you like men, like adult men, and shake hands.

53:19.280 --> 53:24.280
Dissolve to JFK Airport.

53:24.280 --> 53:28.280
I'd like a one-way ticket to Syracuse, please.

53:28.280 --> 53:31.280
Uh, sorry for all the pennies.

53:31.280 --> 53:38.280
I'm going to see my dad.

53:38.280 --> 53:41.280
Sir, we don't take pennies at JFK Airport.

53:41.280 --> 53:43.280
Well, today you're gonna have to.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
Why is that?

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
My dad's dying, okay?

53:45.280 --> 53:48.280
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I didn't realize the stakes were that high.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.280
Uh, this is your captain.

53:55.280 --> 53:58.280
Thank you for flying through to the Atlantic.

53:58.280 --> 54:03.280
If you're flying from New York to Syracuse,

54:03.280 --> 54:09.280
you may be on the wrong airline.

54:09.280 --> 54:14.280
Certainly on the most expensive choice you could have made.

54:14.280 --> 54:19.280
Uh, your movies are Lawless with Matthew McConaughey,

54:19.280 --> 54:23.280
uh, the Steve Jobs movie.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.280
Cut to the hospital.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.280
Goddamn, that Steve Jobs movie was pretty good.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.280
Dad.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.280
Dad, it's me, Johnny.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.280
Johnny's on you.

54:38.280 --> 54:41.280
I just said, yeah.

54:44.280 --> 54:47.280
I don't hear no jackhammer.

54:47.280 --> 54:52.280
No, no, no.

54:52.280 --> 54:55.280
Normally when I hear my son come, there's all this noise

54:55.280 --> 54:59.280
of jackhammer and racial epithets and whatnot.

54:59.280 --> 55:02.280
They made me leave the hammer at the terminal.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.280
Johnny, Johnny.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.280
Yeah, dad.

55:05.280 --> 55:06.280
Johnny.

55:06.280 --> 55:07.280
Yeah.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.280
Dad.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.280
Hey, nurse.

55:11.280 --> 55:14.280
There's something obstructing his throat.

55:14.280 --> 55:17.280
Oh, it's so much more brittle than pavement.

55:17.280 --> 55:20.280
If I only had it, didn't implement.

55:20.280 --> 55:22.280
Do it, Johnny.

55:22.280 --> 55:24.280
Go the distance.

55:24.280 --> 55:29.280
No!

55:29.280 --> 55:31.280
Johnny!

55:31.280 --> 55:33.280
No, I wasn't dying, Johnny.

55:33.280 --> 55:36.280
I didn't want you to use the jackhammer again.

55:36.280 --> 55:39.280
I don't understand.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.280
I pretended to be dying to prove

55:41.280 --> 55:43.280
you didn't need to use the jackhammer again.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.280
Oh.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.280
Well, I don't have a jackhammer.

55:47.280 --> 55:49.280
They let me leave it at the airport.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.280
Dad, dad, dad.

55:51.280 --> 55:55.280
His last moments on earth were confusing me.

55:55.280 --> 55:58.280
Oh.

55:58.280 --> 56:03.280
Oh.

56:03.280 --> 56:07.280
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today to later rest.

56:07.280 --> 56:11.280
Reginald jackhammer.

56:11.280 --> 56:14.280
Brilliant improviser.

56:14.280 --> 56:18.280
Intellectual child molester.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.280
I thought you were going to...

56:20.280 --> 56:22.280
When the father was flatlining,

56:22.280 --> 56:24.280
you were going to jackhammer his heart back to life.

56:24.280 --> 56:25.280
Well, I know.

56:25.280 --> 56:26.280
And then when I did, you said,

56:26.280 --> 56:28.280
No, but you just don't do that.

56:28.280 --> 56:30.280
Well, no, I thought you were fake doing it.

56:30.280 --> 56:31.280
Fake doing it?

56:31.280 --> 56:32.280
I don't have a...

56:32.280 --> 56:34.280
I'm miming jack...

56:34.280 --> 56:36.280
I thought you were fake doing it

56:36.280 --> 56:38.280
for our radio play.

56:38.280 --> 56:40.280
I mean, I just...

56:40.280 --> 56:43.280
I thought you were fake doing it

56:43.280 --> 56:45.280
for our radio play.

56:45.280 --> 56:47.280
I mean, I just...

56:47.280 --> 56:49.280
I should have been clearer.

56:49.280 --> 56:51.280
I was miming a real jackhammer

56:51.280 --> 56:53.280
and not miming a guy's...

56:53.280 --> 56:55.280
Because up until then,

56:55.280 --> 56:57.280
you did the pantomime jackhammer.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.280
You were doing the pantomime jackhammer.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.280
We'll do notes.

57:01.280 --> 57:05.280
Go to Harmontown.com for Harmontown after hours

57:05.280 --> 57:08.280
where we do notes about our improv.

57:08.280 --> 57:11.280
All right, let's crank up

57:11.280 --> 57:13.280
some real role-playing, right?

57:13.280 --> 57:15.280
With some D&D.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.280
Yeah, get your shit out, man.

57:17.280 --> 57:18.280
What are you doing?

57:18.280 --> 57:20.280
I didn't think you'd go at 9.02.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.280
I mean...

57:21.280 --> 57:23.280
Yeah, but like, 8.20.

57:23.280 --> 57:24.280
Yeah, well...

57:24.280 --> 57:26.280
And then never spoke to you again.

57:26.280 --> 57:27.280
Yeah.

57:27.280 --> 57:28.280
I guess, yeah.

57:28.280 --> 57:30.280
Camille's not here.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.280
Aaron's not here.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.280
Schrab's not here.

57:33.280 --> 57:34.280
Even Tyler's not here.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.280
Yeah.

57:35.280 --> 57:36.280
Even Tyler.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.280
Yeah.

57:37.280 --> 57:40.280
He's drinking at the drawing with my girlfriend right now.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.280
I'm not joking.

57:42.280 --> 57:44.280
All right, well, what about...

57:44.280 --> 57:45.280
What about Beef Steak Bill?

57:45.280 --> 57:47.280
We're gonna bring him up and play.

57:47.280 --> 57:49.280
Have him play Beef Steak Bill.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.280
Look at these shirts, man.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.280
Beef Steak Bill's got the...

57:58.280 --> 58:02.280
Yeah, can we discuss your grammar, Bill?

58:02.280 --> 58:04.280
Where does one acquire?

58:04.280 --> 58:05.280
Is that velour?

58:05.280 --> 58:07.280
It's flocked.

58:07.280 --> 58:10.280
It's kind of a satin thing with a...

58:10.280 --> 58:13.280
Yeah, I got it at some goth shop in Boston

58:13.280 --> 58:15.280
a long time ago before the close.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
Boston?

58:16.280 --> 58:17.280
Oh, wait, no.

58:17.280 --> 58:19.280
I got this at Vaudeville Trash in New York.

58:19.280 --> 58:20.280
Sorry.

58:23.280 --> 58:24.280
It's good.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.280
Didn't offend me.

58:27.280 --> 58:29.280
How do you wash something like that?

58:29.280 --> 58:30.280
It's kind of different rules.

58:30.280 --> 58:31.280
Dry cleaner.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.280
All right.

58:35.280 --> 58:40.280
You know, Jeff, how often do you dry clean your suits there?

58:40.280 --> 58:41.280
All the time.

58:41.280 --> 58:44.280
That sucks, you know, that kills your suits real fast.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.280
No, it keeps them good.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.280
I mean, you know, dry cleaning involves tons of

58:49.280 --> 58:50.280
cost to chemicals.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.280
No, not my dry cleaner.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.280
What's your dry cleaner?

58:54.280 --> 58:56.280
My dry cleaner is a couple of wonderful Korean ladies

58:56.280 --> 58:58.280
who take very, very good care of everything I have.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.280
What's the brand?

58:59.280 --> 59:00.280
What?

59:00.280 --> 59:01.280
Where are they located?

59:01.280 --> 59:02.280
I'm not gonna tell everybody.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.280
What are their hours?

59:03.280 --> 59:05.280
If I say the hours and the location,

59:05.280 --> 59:07.280
and everyone that listens to this is gonna go

59:07.280 --> 59:11.280
and get me, like, I'll be standing in the line

59:11.280 --> 59:12.280
to get my suits out.

59:12.280 --> 59:15.280
And we can get, like, $50.

59:19.280 --> 59:21.280
Find out next time.

59:22.280 --> 59:24.280
Do you guys want your sheets?

59:24.280 --> 59:25.280
Yes, I want my sheets.

59:25.280 --> 59:28.280
Bill, be a lamb and dispense our sheets for us, will you?

59:28.280 --> 59:31.280
Is the fear that if people knew when you got your dry cleaner

59:31.280 --> 59:32.280
that they would show up and get their dry cleaner

59:32.280 --> 59:33.280
done at the same time?

59:33.280 --> 59:35.280
My dry cleaner is a hidden gem.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.280
It's a local secret.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.280
And if I told everybody...

59:39.280 --> 59:41.280
No one here fucking dry cleans anything.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.280
I like the fact that if I walk in there

59:46.280 --> 59:48.280
and they say, when do you need this?

59:48.280 --> 59:51.280
And I give them a little look and they go,

59:51.280 --> 59:53.280
come back at five.

59:53.280 --> 59:55.280
And if I told the whole world that,

59:55.280 --> 59:57.280
that might infringe my ability to get my shit

59:57.280 --> 59:58.280
right when I want it.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.280
I just don't think that they don't use

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.280
cost of chemicals.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.280
I think they definitely do.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.280
Look, it's called dry cleaning, which is a misnomer.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.280
There's certainly liquids involved.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.280
And yes, there are chemicals involved, but they make...

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.280
Poisons.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.280
Spencer, will you describe a monster in a dungeon

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.280
called the caustic dry cleaner?

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.280
Okay, okay.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.280
Sweeping aside hundreds of press suits, you see it.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.280
In a sink full of bubbling pinks and blues,

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.280
spilled plastic bottles,

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.280
you see a rising and falling surface

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.280
of caustic boiling, bubbling fluids.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.280
That's all, I don't know.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.280
Didn't really build anywhere.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.280
I didn't deserve that, thanks guys.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.280
I mean, there's a way...

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.280
I've chosen my life and it suits.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.280
I spend a lot of money on dry cleaning.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.280
Do you have a suit brush?

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.280
I don't have a suit brush.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280
You get a suit brush, you brush your suit down

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.280
after you wear it, you press it yourself.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.280
You don't have to clean that except once every five times.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.280
Can you take a vacation off of my cock for five seconds?

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.280
I just admire a good suit, you know,

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.280
and I don't want to see him shredded by some poison.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.280
I've had this suit for six years

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.280
and it's never shown a dimple.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.280
I don't know.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.280
So tired.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.280
How many suits do you have, Spencer?

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.280
I have three.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.280
Will you wear a suit next time, Anton?

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.280
I mean, if you guys want.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.280
Yeah, I am.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.280
I wonder if they fit.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.280
I don't wear them very often.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280
Why do you have three suits?

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.280
Because most men have one or two.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.280
Yeah, one of them is a real suit.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.280
Two of them are like,

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.280
I want to say Wells Fargo suit, but I mean Goodwill suit,

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.280
which I don't know, that doesn't make any sense.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.280
Wells Fargo, they were brought to you on a covered wagon.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.280
Yeah, like Goodwill suits and stuff.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280
Right.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280
Yeah.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.280
Do you wear these ever?

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.280
No, I mean, you just ask how many I have.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.280
That's how many.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280
Three.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.280
My weight fluctuates so much and I'm so old

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.280
that like every time I have to wear a suit for like a wedding.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280
That's why you get a suit.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280
I open my closet and there's just this,

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.280
there's a bunch of dry cleaning bags

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280
because God knows when.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.280
Like, and there's like, they're always mixed up

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.280
and like, I have to do this humiliating thing

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.280
where I get out each pair of pants.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280
They're all gray.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280
They're all charcoal gray.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280
I can't tell the difference between any of them except like,

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280
oh, this one was from when I was twice as fat as I am now.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280
This one was from when I was twice as thin as I am now.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280
It's like terrible.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.280
Yeah, but my advice is, it's not good advice,

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.280
but it's my advice is to, for gentlemen,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280
buy a really expensive suit at your optimum weight

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.280
and it will form.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280
Optimum meaning like.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.280
Meaning like you're thinnest, you're best,

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.280
you're fighting weight, you're college weight.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.280
Like get down to a good weight, get a suit,

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.280
have it tailored, make it fit you,

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.280
and then it will force you.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.280
You're like, I want to wear that suit in fucking two weeks

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.280
because it's Thanksgiving or this or whatever.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.280
And you go like, I can't let the suit out five inches.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.280
If that was going to motivate, I see what you're,

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.280
that's clever, but before,

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:27.280
before the ability to wear a suit would motivate me to lose weight.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.280
I'm looking like a monster would motivate me.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.280
I feel like nudity is that suit you're talking about.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.280
It should be.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.280
Like I should like see myself brushing my teeth and go,

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.280
I don't want that to happen again.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.280
And yet McDonald's is delicious.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.280
But a suit is designed to make men look good

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.280
as our dresses for women, as our stockings and things.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.280
Like men have their fetish where guys look good in suits,

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.280
even if you're not in perfect shape.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280
That's what tailors are for.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.280
You go buy a nice Italian suit if you're a little bit overweight

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.280
and you look like fucking Marcello Mastrigani all of a sudden.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.280
And the thing is, go to fucking Banana Republic,

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.280
buy a $150 suit.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280
Do they have those? $200? I don't know.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.280
And then go spend $30 at a tailor

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.280
and you have a fucking suit.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.280
But you have to stay at that weight.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.280
Or you have to have 900 suits,

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.280
depending on how many donuts you've eaten that week.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280
I don't know.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.280
Whereas Bill has just chosen the gay magician look,

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.280
which I think is fantastic.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.280
It felt like he just lashed out at you at the end for no reason.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.280
Thanks, man.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.280
If I had more courage, I would be dressed

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.280
as a sexy Vegas magician at all times.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.280
I think you look like a very straight magician, Bill.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.280
I thought it was disenfranchised goth kid.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.280
Do you know any magic tricks, Bill?

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.280
Bill, do you do any magic?

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.280
I can make my disself disappear.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.280
You can make your disself disappear.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.280
You're a goth kid?

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.280
Yeah, a little bit.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.280
Yeah?

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280
Yeah, a little bit.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.280
What was your band and school?

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.280
Sisters of Mercy.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280
Oh, yeah.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280
I can see that.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.280
Drummer, right?

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.280
Oh, that's right. We talked about that.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280
I love it.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280
We learned more about it.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.280
He became Beef Steak Bill.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280
You notice I haven't called you Beef Fungus, Bill?

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.280
I appreciate that.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.280
You're a Beef Boy.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.280
I really appreciate that.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.280
I like growth.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.280
I just don't like it on my beef.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280
Funny thing, though.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.280
So I've been playing this iPad game.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.280
I've been playing this iPad game called Plague Incorporated.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:37.280
You know, where you do bacteria and then virus and then fungus.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.280
I can't beat the fungus level.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.280
I'm not kidding.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.280
You're like Brefie with spiders.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.280
I think I'm psychologically blocked on that one somehow.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.280
All right.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.280
Speaking of Brefie with spiders, where were we in D&D?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.280
Oh, where were you?

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.280
I'll tell you that.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:00.280
It's a really good picture because I was interrupted at work.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:08.280
I know how that is.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.280
So Bill, where are you born?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.280
Where are you from, Bill?

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280
Indiana.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280
Indiana where?

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280
Fort Wayne.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280
Portland?

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280
Fort Wayne.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280
Fort Wayne.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280
Or Fort Lane, as we call it.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280
Fort Lane.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280
Look what time it is.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.280
It's northeast from Indian Oak Place.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280
9-11.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.280
Bill, we were talking earlier about what we fear other people see in us.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.280
What's your fear that people see in you?

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280
What's your desire?

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.280
What's the thing you want people to see and respect in you?

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.280
Intelligence, yeah.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.280
I think it's probably a commonality in this group, I would say, right?

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.280
Spencer, are you?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.280
Yeah, like, I mean, being right.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.280
There's a difference between being perceived as intelligence and just being like someone

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280
who's right about stuff.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Like, I don't want to, like, come off as being correcty or like, I just want, if someone

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.280
asked me a question, I want to be the one with the right answer.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:06.280
Yeah, because I was going to say, what a weird thing for a bunch of smart people to be worried

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.280
about their intelligence, which so often the case, such as personality type on the Internet

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:15.280
is a bunch of people going like, correction point of order, I'd like to spock you on that.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.280
Well, I'd like to over spock you on that.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.280
It's because there's like 5,000 definitions of intelligence.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.280
Some people want to be, you know, like, I don't want anyone to think that I went to Harvard.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280
Quite the contrary.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.280
I want people to think that I'm an autodidact.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.280
I want people to think that I'm a man of the people, but then I'm smart about it.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.280
You know, you can split that hair so many different ways.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:44.280
My biggest fear in the world is pretentiousness.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.280
Like, that is the concept that I'm wrong about myself.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:55.280
That is my biggest nightmare, is somebody saying, you think you're this, but really you're this.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.280
Like, that's the most hurtful thing.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.280
You think you're 6 feet tall?

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.280
You've been 4 feet tall this whole time, like, mentally or in any way.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.280
Like, you think that, like, you're so fucking off.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280
Oh man, you're off.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.280
So the fear is, what was the worst version of you that people might think that you are?

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.280
Like, you think you're, what, what would you like people to think that you are?

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.280
What version of you?

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.280
A humanitarian decent?

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.280
And then you're afraid that people might think you are...

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.280
A disgusting, caustic, selfish monster.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:32.280
Which I know that I, that's why I celebrate that, you know.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.280
Like, oh, I'm a disgusting, caustic st-

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.280
But isn't it possible to be both?

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.280
Uh, I hope so.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.280
Right.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.280
I mean, isn't there some, like, you can recognize that it's possible to be both of those things.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.280
Like, you're on a good day, you're this, on a bad day, you're that, but it doesn't take one,

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.280
one's not taken away from the other, right?

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280
Right.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.280
Well, I would think at the same time you could be both things.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:01.280
Like, Han Solo has no love for the Empire, but he is also not going to be duped in by any kind of cause, necessarily.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.280
He doesn't want to, he doesn't want to be tricked into giving his life for some bullshit,

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.280
but he's, he cares about people.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.280
You want people to think you're a humanitarian?

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.280
Well, I guess, I guess I'm just grabbing at that word, like, like, what word would you grab?

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280
I don't know.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.280
Like, I want people to understand that I'm, like, first and foremost, I'm a big fan of our species.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.280
You want to be a contributor?

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.280
Yeah.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:34.280
But also that I'm, like, kind of an optimist, that I think we can do better, that I'm a champion of all of us,

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:40.280
that I'm not, like, that archetype of the troll under the bridge who's just, like, who would slit your throat

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.280
if he could get away with it just because he doesn't feel as loved.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.280
You know, like, I don't want to be that, contribute to that cycle.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:54.280
I want to be known as a person that said, we can do better.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280
Believe in us.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280
I think we can do it.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280
Yeah.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:03.280
And, and, and you can, you can be that person.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:07.280
And also when you're in a, when you get cornered, you can be a pessimist.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:13.280
You can, you can be, like, I think curmudgeons and cynics are people that are the most optimist of people in the world.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280
Like, curmudgeon re-

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.280
Because you look around and you go, what the fuck are we doing?

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.280
We're being idiots.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.280
Curmudgeons are people whose, whose hope was abused, whose hope was disappointed.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.280
And so you can be both of those things.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.280
You, you, you can be a pessimistic optimist.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.280
You can, you can do both of those, right?

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.280
Bill, what's, what's the version of intelligence that you want people to perceive in you?

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280
Coxmanship.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.280
I'll just go with that.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.280
That's kind of a different, can you?

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280
I don't know.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.280
I mean, that was, that was saying there's a hundred ways to be intelligent or to be, like, versions of intelligence.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280
Is there a certain way?

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:56.280
What do you want it to say on the bottom of the statue that's dedicated to you as a, as a, as a thinker?

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280
So when you joined her.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.280
But he used his brain to...

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.280
Wit would be great.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:09.280
If I, if I felt like I had an incisive wit, I would be very happy.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280
That's a ballsy answer.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.280
Yeah, it's very ballsy.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.280
Because that's, that's potentially embarrassing to say.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.280
I wish I was witty.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.280
I think it's better this way.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.280
My fears that people don't think I know the subjunctive.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280
No, that's good.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.280
I mean, that's, that's, that's very sincere and honest.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.280
To just go like...

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.280
I would, I would, I hope that people think I have a, I have a wit.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280
Anybody else out there?

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.280
They have a brand of intelligence or a certain kind of genre that they wish people perceived in them?

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.280
I know, I know that's like, no one's going to raise their hand with that.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.280
So when people start shouting off like eight different things and then one person, when you listen to a recording, one person went, child murder.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.280
Totally pretentious.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280
You want people to think you're totally pretentious?

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.280
I like reading classics.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.280
Oh, so you want to be perceived as, as fancy?

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.280
Is that where you die to her?

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.280
Yeah, I like Virgil and Ovid and built in.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280
Yeah, you're pretentious.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280
I love that.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280
There's a hand back there too.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280
Yes?

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280
It seems Dan actually.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280
Which is what?

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:17.280
Just being for the betterment of, I don't know, humanity as a whole and being seen as someone who's, or, who doesn't ever want to contribute to anyone having bad...

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.280
Here, come up and say this because you're too far from the mic.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.280
I'll bring the mic to you then.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.280
Did this just come across to you?

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.280
I don't want to listen to your vacancy.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.280
No, no, no.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.280
Now I'm really going to forget exactly what...

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.280
Yeah, but it's a hard thing to utter.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:41.280
I'm sorry, yeah.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.280
It was just too quiet.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:51.280
No, I mean, mainly it's just that I never want to contribute to...

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:58.280
Sounds so cheesy, but anyone ever having a bad day or thinking less of humanity because of me?

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.280
Yeah, I don't want to be the reason why anybody ever is going like, shit.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.280
Now that's all fucked, which is so ironic because I'm so off on the reason, but...

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.280
So then I have to think, well, that person's a bad person.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280
I don't want to be...

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:21.280
I so much fear, like somebody saying, god damn it, this room would be so much better if that person would leave.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.280
I won't allow that to happen.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.280
I will not be the unwelcome guest.

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.280
To the point where I would cut my own face, I would jump out of a skylight,

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.280
I would blow up the fucking building before I went to it.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.280
That might cause people a bad day.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.280
It's possible to want that and then do that very same thing, right?

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.280
You can want to not do that and then that's why...

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280
And then do it a lot.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.280
Yeah, because you're like, let's get one thing straight.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280
I'm not the fucking reason you're going to have a bad time.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.280
If you want your money back, I'll give you your money back, fuck you.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:58.280
I want to make you feel good about yourself, you fucking cock-sucking piece of shit.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.280
And I didn't ask you to come here and I don't fucking...

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280
I meant humanity, not you.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.280
Yeah, that's a big...

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280
That's my thing.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Thank you, Haley, everybody. Thank you.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280
Now I want it to be the reason why...

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
That's a big thing.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.280
When somebody implies and somebody goes like, you...

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280
That's the...

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.280
Somebody goes, you hurt me.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.280
You hurt me because you were talking.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280
You hurt me because you said that thing.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:32.280
Like, I just like fucking hulk, see an enemy, like weird toxins fill my blood and prepare me for battle.

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:42.280
Ironically, because if that's true, if I said something that made you suffer, we have to figure this out.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:49.280
If I have to pound your face into the earth and change the axis of the planet, I will prove that you are wrong.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:57.280
I did not say something to ruin your day or that your day needed to be ruined and that it actually helped you or anything.

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.280
Anything but...

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.280
That's kind of what happened last episode, wasn't it?

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.280
That's what's been happening for 40 years.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.280
That's what I was trying to explain in the heat of that moment.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.280
I was like, look, this is my thing. This is why I make stuff.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280
We got one more?

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:20.280
I think actually kind of what Dan is trying to describe is what I would call emotional intelligence.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.280
Right.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:30.280
Yeah, there's actually a book about that by a guy named Daniel Goldman, but there's a lot of psychoanalysis involved.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.280
I would call it emotional intelligence, for sure.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.280
Thank you for projecting to the point where you probably don't have to.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:45.280
And you know what, it might be a fear of this thing. I've been mistaken for diagnosing myself with Asperger's and I'm sorry that that ever happened.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.280
I would not do that.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:16:04.280
But the idea of empathy, from talking to people on the spectrum, what I find is that the thing that unites those people is the feeling of frustration.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.280
Because they find themselves in situations where they are the cause of everyone's despair.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:15.280
And they find out all too late that they have not participated in some misperceived social custom.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.280
They have their underwear around their ankles at the urinal in kindergarten.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.280
They have a booger on their finger on the playground.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.280
They're saying words backwards.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.280
They're not doing something right that they didn't even know.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:37.280
They weren't even picking up on having to do right. And what they would do pick up on is a circle of people around them with their fingers in their face saying you don't belong here.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.280
You have to get off the playground. Get out of here.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:56.280
And that phobia, that's the thing that would result in somebody auto-correcting in their adult life for making sure that everyone understands that I'm here to help.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.280
I'm here to make sure everybody feels better about themselves.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.280
I'm not trying to hurt you when I talk.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:10.280
Dan, in your storytelling, you've probably said this before, but say it again.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.280
In your storytelling, what would be the goal that you could help people with?

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280
What's the point of stories?

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:25.280
What's the point of watching people walk through the stories and be punished for their humanity, get through it, become heroes because of it?

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.280
What's the gift?

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:35.280
Well, everybody realizing that life is what it is. It's just the most basic thing in the world.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.280
When you wake up in the morning, there seems to be so much wrong.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:54.280
And stories are the things that we tell each other to let us know that all these things that you feel about how fucked up everything is.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:18:00.280
That is how it is, so that it resonates.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:08.280
Providing language for the things that are bouncing around in your head, that's what art is.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:22.280
If you look at a painting in the Louvre and you start to burst into tears, it's because somebody puts something on a canvas that you thought could only ever exist in your brain, or a brain.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.280
And you suddenly burst into tears because you've been connected with.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:34.280
For me, story is the Remo Williams tapping on the wrist of...

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.280
It's such a deep cut.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:48.280
I'm tapping in the rhythm of life and death with you so that you understand that when you woke up this morning and you felt bipolar,

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.280
you felt like, why am I in a good mood but I'm in a bad mood? Why if I was in a good mood? Why did I listen to a sad song?

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.280
Why is my mom's death the thing that's fucking up my job right now?

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:06.280
Why do I hate the people I love? Why do I love the people I hate? Why am I depressed? Why can't I get anything done?

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:10.280
Why am I different? Why am I scared?

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:19.280
Everyone's walking around in their pizza hut uniforms and they're up and down the sidewalk and they all seem to have their shit together.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.280
And I turn on the TV and everyone's having certain counters and trying on high-heeled shoes and everyone seems to know what's going on.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.280
Ross and Rachel know what's going on and all the traffic lights...

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.280
Every once in a while you drive by and a couple cars hit each other and there's broken glass everywhere,

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.280
which you're not supposed to look and everyone that does look is a bad person and you keep going.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:41.280
This conveyor belt, this concrete jungle, it puts a pressure on you and you feel like because you have this turmoil in your brain,

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:47.280
you're like, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to snap. I'm the only one walking around with this secret that we're all fucked up,

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:58.280
that everything is going to hell and stories, like, you know, let you know, no, Ulysses had that happen to him.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:08.280
He felt that way. He went to this place and it's a way of articulating that inarticulable fact that just when things feel their worst,

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.280
that is actually the thing that is giving you the most strength and all that kind of crap.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:20.280
For me, like, community stories are always about people versus the system and it's always about reminding you that no matter how fucked up you feel,

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.280
you're supposed to be the way you are.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:31.280
You're not supposed to actually grow and change. You're supposed to actually, before we ever get to that point,

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:38.280
first and foremost, the most subversive, most heroic act you can do is just be proud of yourself the way you got out of bed that morning.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:45.280
And people go around the circle of the stories like experimenting with the idea that maybe they can improve themselves

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.280
for the sake of improving their life or the system or something.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.280
Like we said before, they get improved by the people around them that they look up to.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.280
They come back around to the conclusion that they should have just come clean and been honest about the fact that they felt like a piece of shit.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:02.280
That's what stories are, to answer your question.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.280
For God's sake, let's play some D&D for a pity's sake, shall we?

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.280
Alright.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:19.280
Last time our heroes were fighting with Brefi, the mechanical monstrosity,

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.280
who was new and improved with powerful enhancements.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:30.280
Brefi shot lasers and lightning and also tiny robo spiders, but Quark quickly leapt into action,

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.280
gnar-walling the spider creature with a dagger strapped to his face.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:41.280
Sharpie used his father's cape to teleport onto the beast's back and blasted it with electricity.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:45.280
Brefi hit Christopher with a chain which stuck in his stomach.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.280
Mulraine fired arrow after arrow at the spider monster with a decent success rate.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:57.280
Quark changed tactics and slashed at the beast with his mighty greatsword while Sharpie began looking through his backpack.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.280
He retrieved Dorota Frost and sprayed ice at the lava below, forming a cool crust.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:08.280
Then the wizard turned his rod on the spider, blasting it in the face with razor sharp ice fragments.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.280
That finished the job and sent Brefi crashing down onto the lava crust below.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:19.280
Quark, overtaken by victory lust, lowered himself down by rope onto Brefi, but slipped and fell.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.280
If not for Sharpie's quick thinking and the button staff, Quark wouldn't have lived to rape another day.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.280
Admiral Darkstar was sure to be close, but just how close?

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.280
I don't know. I don't know.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.280
Thank you Spencer.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.280
So you guys are up in this web of chains after just killing this guy.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280
There's lava beneath you.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.280
I said we climb up and see if there's some sort of door where Brefi came through.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:23:00.280
One thing to note is that there are four statues with eyes that recess when you press the button.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.280
Yeah, those are consumed by lava at this point.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.280
It's been steadily rising this whole time.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.280
You guys are now just in the chains and there's only lava below.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.280
Yeah, Bill.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:17.280
Oh, that shit you noticed?

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.280
That's in lava now.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.280
Get in the moment.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.280
I climb up the chains and start looking for outlets above us.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:32.280
I'm feeling there's a sort of metal hatch door, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of handle or knob on it.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.280
It looks like it's made out of several triangular sections.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.280
Christopher, get up there and check it out.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.280
I'm checking it out.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:49.280
Checking it out. You see what looks like a small hole on the left side of one of these door panels.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.280
There's a hole.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.280
I fuck it.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.280
I knew he was going to do that.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.280
No, don't do that.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.280
Did we find anything lately?

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.280
Rods, stabs, fingers.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.280
We have a crafting kit that we could borrow from Mulraine.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.280
Yeah, but don't you think this is one of those things where there's like a...

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:11.280
I'm sorry, I'm immersed. I'm not medigaming.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.280
We could jam an arrow in there.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.280
Is there something that we have that would fit that certain size hole?

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.280
Yeah, I mean we play this game once a week and we're always drunk. I'm just wondering if it feels like a...

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280
Describe the size of the hole by the door.

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:25.280
It's smaller than a human's littlest finger.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.280
I don't know how that compares to a half-length one.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.280
I'm going to grab an arrow and jam it up in there.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:38.280
All right. You jam it in there real hard, but the arrow is like harder.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:46.280
I mean it's wider than the hole, so you stab it in there and it kind of breaks off the stone bits of the stone arrow.

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.280
This is a stone arrow in this instance, in case anyone's wondering.

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.280
One of those iron-tipped arrows that would break off in this instance.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.280
Just some continuity, you know.

01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:02.280
These triangular things, are they clean triangles or are they like shard of power kind of shape?

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.280
They're like clean triangles.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:10.280
They're like teeth of a thing that's all of its teeth come together.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.280
Nothing exists like that in nature.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.280
You haven't met my ex-wife.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:28.280
Anyway, so Christopher is jamming this arrow in and you jam it in and you feel like a thing that it hits as you stick it in.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.280
It felt like it hit like a little metal something.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.280
Now what?

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.280
It hit a metal something in the hole.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.280
It hit a metal something in the hole.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280
Deep stuff.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.280
And it broke off, so is it stuck in there?

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.280
It broke off, it's just that the tip side of the arrow is broken off.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.280
It's still attached.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.280
Alright, well, I'm going to try to...

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:57.280
Alright, I'll turn it.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280
Turning it with all your strength.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.280
You muster up, not very much of all your strength, I guess.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:07.280
You try and turn it and it just doesn't budge.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.280
It's like a rotary phone.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.280
What were you going to do?

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280
You're the barbarian.

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.280
You have the strength?

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.280
Yeah, you try and turn it.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.280
I grab onto the arrow shaft and I turn it for all I'm worth.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:29.280
You turn it for all your worth and it snaps off, but not before activating some sort of mechanism that grinds deep within this assembly of triangles.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:36.280
They sort of grind and rumble as they open apart and create a hole in the ceiling.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.280
Yay!

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.280
As long as nothing's coming out of the hole.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:45.280
Yeah, nothing's coming out of the hole.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280
Let's get through this hole, man.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.280
Yeah, I clamber up through the hole.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.280
You scramble up, clamber.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.280
I'm using scramble, otherwise I'd just be copying you.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.280
Can I trundle?

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.280
You can trundle or you could sashay.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.280
I'll clamber, I don't care about copying anyway.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.280
Alright, I'll mosey.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.280
Is anyone else going to move?

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.280
I canter wall.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.280
But then I move actually, soon I think.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.280
You all move in various specific ways and find yourself in a new room.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.280
This room is strangely dark as if light were magically dampened.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:36.280
However, the magically dampened light does not extend to dim crimson flames that seem to be held up in the midair.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.280
Like they're floating or some shit.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.280
It's crazy.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.280
It's not crazy, it's just magic.

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:50.280
The floor is littered with the mangled corpses of several black-robed humanoids and also black buckets for whatever reason.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:58.280
You can see entrails and blood smeared across the floor and in the center of the carnage, carnage is a mound of ashes.

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:06.280
Across the room you can see an archway and in the archway is a stairwell.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.280
How high in the air are these flames floating?

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.280
I like about seven feet tall.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.280
You can probably grab one.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.280
I use my goggles with my nude seeing.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.280
You use your goggles with my nude seeing.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.280
What do you look at with them?

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:24.280
The room.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.280
Everything.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.280
You look around at everything and you look at these corpses.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.280
They look like they've been ripped apart somehow.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:38.280
Some of them have bite marks on them but none of them look like sliced or like stabbed or anything.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.280
More torn.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.280
Not pleasant.

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:47.280
Also the buckets, they're full of blood.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.280
Seems a bit...

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.280
Much.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.280
Do I detect any traps?

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.280
Searching around for traps, you see no traps.

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:00.280
Maybe we should go look at that archway.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.280
On the far side of the room where the stairwell I was mentioning earlier was,

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:13.280
you hear footsteps and then you see that gnoll guy, Yerch, that you've seen before in random circumstances in various places.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.280
Yerch!

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.280
He walks into view and is like, what are you, what?

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.280
Yerch!

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:26.280
Weren't you guys ahead of me?

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:31.280
Well, we got to chain in a lava room with some chains.

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280
Yeah.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.280
Where were you?

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:38.280
I was taking care of these guys and then I was scouting up ahead.

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.280
Are you the reason they're all mangled?

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.280
I mean, yeah.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.280
Jesus, Yerch.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:46.280
I mean, what? You guys kill stuff, right?

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.280
Yeah, but we don't make a big show of it.

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.280
Well, well I do.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.280
Why the buckets, man?

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.280
Well, yeah, the buckets weren't mine.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.280
Those were there.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.280
The buckets of blood were there?

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280
Yeah.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.280
Yerch, what are you hiding from us?

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.280
God, every time we run into him he seems like this.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.280
Perception check.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.280
Okay.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.280
What are you looking for with your goggles?

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.280
A sense motive on him.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280
Okay, a sense motive.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.280
That makes more sense.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:19.280
He looks like he's hiding something from you guys.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:23.280
Yerch, I take my sword out, my great sword, and I hold it at his neck and I go,

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.280
Yerch, tell us the truth or I'll cut you deep.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.280
I don't know what you guys are talking about, man.

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280
I'll make you leak, Jack.

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.280
I told you I killed all these dudes.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.280
I'll please you real slow.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.280
You ain't Yerch, is you?

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.280
I is Yerch.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.280
Prove it.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.280
Tell me something only Yerch and I would know.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:45.280
I was tracking you guys ever since you were looking for your father back at the hills.

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.280
Every Harmontown fan knows that.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.280
I know Yerch would know.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.280
Wait, what's Harmontown?

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280
Huh?

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280
What's Harmontown?

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280
Meadow.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280
A venture.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.280
Is this Yerch?

01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:02.280
Squaw.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.280
We'll fix that in post.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.280
My voice cracked.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:12.280
It gives you a look that says, I mean, yeah, looks like Yerch.

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:14.280
He's like, what's going on?

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.280
I thought you guys kill bad guys all the time.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:19.280
We're in a goddamn carnival of broken souls.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.280
There's people running around everywhere that look like other people.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:25.280
We ran into a guy that didn't believe that we were good guys.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:28.280
And, you know, he went mad.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.280
I'm just like, you seem like you're up to something.

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.280
Oh, no.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.280
You seem like you're up to something.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.280
I'm not, I'm not.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.280
We sensed motive on you.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.280
I don't want to get meta about it, but we sensed it.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.280
What does that mean?

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.280
We sensed you were up to something.

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.280
I mean, yeah.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.280
What are you up to?

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.280
I'm just, I killed all these guys.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.280
I was looking up there.

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.280
I mean, I...

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.280
What are you going to do next then?

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.280
Yeah, where are you going now?

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.280
What were you looking at?

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.280
I was just looking at the floor above.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.280
There's some scary shit up there.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280
It's dark magic.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280
The floor above?

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.280
Yeah.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.280
And that's why you seem like you're up to something?

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.280
That's where Darkstar is hiding.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.280
He's got all this dark magic.

01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280
I don't know how to decipher it.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.280
He needs some sort of crazy old books.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.280
Crazy old books?

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.280
Yeah.

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.280
Where, where would we find these books?

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.280
Who knows, man?

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.280
I have books of divinity.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280
What?

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:25.280
Something might, divine might.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.280
Books, books, books of divine might.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.280
I think that's what that says.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280
I don't know what that is.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280
That's not the right book.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280
There's lots of books.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.280
I mean, they can't all be the applicable one.

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.280
I look around for books in the room.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.280
There's no books, just bloody torn corpses.

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.280
You know, if we could see up there better...

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.280
I can't detect thoughts on Yerch.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:50.280
He's like, man, I need to get that book off that wizard guy.

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.280
The blood book.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:54.280
Your book?

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.280
Sharpie, look in your inventory for a book right now.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.280
I have one.

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.280
I've had it for a while.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.280
He wants it.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:07.280
I, I, I, while, while, while you're looking for your book, I walk around and I kind of,

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.280
like, I kind of just...

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.280
Can I detect more thoughts than that?

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.280
It's like, man, this guy just audibly cast Detect Thoughts on me,

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.280
and now I feel like a real asshole.

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280
I didn't audibly...

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.280
I mean, are you saying that there's an audible component to it?

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:27.280
Yeah, almost all spells, like, they have some sort of show.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.280
So I was like, detect them, thotumum?

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.280
Yeah, pretty good.

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280
It's fucking Darkstar.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.280
Get him.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.280
Is it Darkstar?

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.280
Well, if it ain't Yerch,

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.280
I take out my flaming sword and I raise it above my head.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.280
He's like, whoa, whoa, we don't gonna do that.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.280
And I say, Sharpie, take out the book and, and, like, show him it.

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.280
No, what book?

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.280
The Joy of Cooking.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.280
The Joy of Cooking.

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280
What book?

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:01.280
Huh?

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:02.280
What book?

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280
No book.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280
He has a cookbook.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280
What identity?

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.280
He makes buttermilk biscuits like you fucking...

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.280
Yerch, you haven't had buttermilk biscuits.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.280
Until you've had Sharpie's buttermilk biscuits.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.280
I don't eat buttermilk biscuits.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.280
Yeah, because you're fucking Admiral Darkstar, aren't you?

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.280
No.

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.280
I detect magic on Yerch.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.280
He's, he's full of dark magics.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:27.280
I take my flaming sword and I strike it straight down.

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.280
I write about...

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:32.280
It might be Yerch, but he's, he's, you know, he's conjugated.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.280
Conjugated?

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.280
I'm a barbarian.

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.280
It could be our friend Yerch, but, like, you know...

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280
Look.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.280
Compromised.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280
Brefi turned into a spider.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280
I had to fucking kill him.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280
Twice.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.280
Had to is a bit of a mischaracterization.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.280
Spencer the heart wants what it wants.

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.280
Okay.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:57.280
I have the flaming sword poised above his head in a very threatening manner.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.280
Okay.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.280
God damn it.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.280
Brefi.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.280
I don't have anything.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.280
Is there a way to release him from a spell?

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:03.280
Is there a way to...

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:04.280
Brefi.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280
No, Brefi.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.280
Is there a way to release Yerch from a spell?

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.280
I don't have anything like that.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.280
Do you have to spell magic?

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.280
I don't.

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.280
I fucking don't.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.280
I have deep slumber.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.280
Hey, man.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.280
Okay.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.280
Let me be honest with you guys.

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.280
Oh, Barry the lead.

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.280
I just, I was telling you guys about the dark magic.

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.280
This is blood magic stuff.

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:31.280
It's crazy.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.280
I was trying to learn about it.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.280
Yerch.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:38.280
So you've immersed yourself in this blood and it's made you part of the dark magic?

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.280
No.

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:40.280
What?

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.280
No.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.280
You were learning about the dark magic?

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.280
I mean, I know a bit about all sorts of stuff.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.280
Is that why these buckets of blood are here?

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:50.280
So you're covering yourself on this blood to learn this?

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.280
Well, I mean, again, I didn't gather these buckets of blood.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.280
I mean, look at these things on the floor.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:00.280
There's nobody gathers buckets of blood, but at some point in your life they get offered to you.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.280
And when they do, you need to come to your friends.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.280
You shouldn't have talked to us first.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.280
This is gateway magic.

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.280
I learned about watching Yerch.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.280
I don't know how to respond to that.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.280
That's because you're high on darkness.

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.280
That's not true, man.

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.280
What did you do with this blood, this blood magic, Yerch?

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.280
I'm not doing anything with nothing.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.280
You're steeped in it, brother.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.280
No, that ain't me.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.280
Guys, if we get this blood on us, are we going to turn into him?

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.280
No, I pick up a bucket of blood and I splash it on Yerch.

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.280
I go, is this what you want?

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.280
You want to be bloody?

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.280
What signals was I giving off that indicated that was what I wanted?

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.280
You're covered in darkness.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.280
You love blood magic.

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.280
You want my book?

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280
You want blood magic?

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280
You want to be covered in blood?

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280
Blood is sticky.

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.280
It's gross.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.280
It's crusty.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.280
Sharpie, give him the book.

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.280
You used to be a regular gnoll.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.280
You used to be soaked and pissed.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280
You were a good guy.

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.280
And now you've soaked me in blood.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280
Yeah, so?

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.280
Does it feel good?

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.280
Sharpie, Sharpie, slap him across the face.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.280
Get this monkey off your back.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280
He's like, eh.

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.280
I have a question, Yerch.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.280
Yerch, what would you do with the book if you had it?

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.280
I'd learn about the thing and try and stop the evil plot.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280
Give him the book?

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:29.280
What?

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.280
I got the sword above his head.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.280
Show him the book.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.280
See what happens.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.280
No!

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.280
If he turns blacker, we'll kill him.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.280
Wait.

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:42.280
Oh, no, that sounded racist.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.280
Wow.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.280
Is that the title of the episode?

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.280
If it turns blacker, we'll kill him.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280
No.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
No, no.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.280
I'm not going to give him the blood magic book.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.280
He was dishonest about it in the first place.

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.280
That means that he's...

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280
Come on.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.280
Yerch, we need to...

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.280
What do you roll?

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.280
Oh, who knows, ma'am?

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.280
I can't conceal my emotions.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.280
Yeah, nothing, nothing.

01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280
God damn it.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.280
He rolled a perception thingy or whatever.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.280
A will thingy.

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.280
We have to secure Yerch.

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280
Huh?

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.280
We have to secure Yerch.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.280
I grab him from behind.

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.280
I get him in a full Nelson.

01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.280
All right.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.280
Well, as you're trying to do that, he finishes muttering under his breath, which you didn't

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.280
hear because you were too busy talking and not perceiving things correctly.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.280
Oh, man.

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.280
But, yeah, as you're grabbing him, he goes, hold it.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.280
And then you grab him.

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.280
And as you grab him, you feel the blood, the slick blood on his body turn hard.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:51.280
And it's all hard, like hard stuff.

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:55.280
And you got... you got a hole in on him.

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.280
But it doesn't matter.

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.280
Because he's all bloody in the shit.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:00.280
He's turned hard?

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.280
Like an exoskeleton?

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.280
Yeah, you're hugging a hard man.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.280
Like an exoskeleton of some sort?

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.280
Like, like an exoskeleton, yes.

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:09.280
This is what happens when you hug people.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.280
The stink gets on them.

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:17.280
I, uh, I release him and take out my greatsword.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.280
All right.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:22.160
He goes, rechts, he bursts out of that.

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:25.520
And he kinda like, his blood is all hard

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.360
and dripping over his face.

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.800
And he's like, now you made me all fucked up

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.520
and I'm fucked up now.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.040
You're just a complicated motherfucker.

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.840
You guys were all aggressive on me.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.400
I just wanted to learn about blood.

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.000
Now you're gonna learn about blood the hard way, though.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.040
That's not what happened.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.540
Yeah, we're gonna learn about your blood.

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:46.760
Yeah, I'm gonna write a thesis on it.

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.960
My blood magic.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.800
Yerch, Yerch.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.440
I hope this includes a blackboard.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.320
It doesn't.

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.160
Yerch.

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.000
Yerch.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:53.840
You gotta be too easy.

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:55.480
Yerch, right now I'm looking at a gnoll

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.200
who's about to get killed and fucked.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.280
I'm looking at a halfling who's about

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.920
to be full of blood missiles.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:01.760
I'm a gnome.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.600
Blood missiles.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.840
That's a good point.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.680
Yes.

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:05.920
All this blood's in my eyes.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.760
Okay.

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.560
I'm invisible.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.200
So he kind of flicks some of his bloody arm at you

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.280
and they kind of turn into these little blood darts

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.360
and they're shooting at your body.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.720
Blood darts.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.440
Yeah, but they all miss.

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.400
Flaming sword attack.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.960
Do it.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.120
Oh wait, that's me.

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.160
We were just playing a game

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.400
where you guys rolled your own attack rolls,

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.160
so that's on me.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:35.000
You strike him directly in the stomach.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:35.840
Dealing.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:36.680
What's your damage?

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.880
Sorry, it is?

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.720
11.

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.560
That's someone else's illness.

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.640
It's an 11 attack.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:43.680
Now your damage.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.520
My damage is starting.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.040
That's like 1D something.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.240
It's 1D 10 plus 1D 6 plus 4.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.880
Sorry everybody, just some housekeeping.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.960
Dealing 11 damage.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:56.800
Poor, poor Yerch.

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.120
Why, wait.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.720
No, I know, it's just a shame.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.960
It's like Robert Downey Jr. in less than zero.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:06.960
But you see, as the blood flows from his open wound,

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.840
it kind of pulls back and hardens over the wound,

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.880
closing it off immediately and scabbing it over.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.840
Oh damn.

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:18.480
Poisonous sneak attack.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.320
What's up?

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:20.480
Poisonous sneak attack.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.960
I like the sound of that.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.640
Going around to his flank in a flanking maneuver,

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:28.840
you try to attack him right in the flank

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.680
with a sneak attack.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.920
But unfortunately, you miss.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.800
I'm invisible and I miss.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.960
When did you go invisible?

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.560
I said I'm invisible.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:38.920
Second, he went all blood.

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.240
First of all, I didn't hear that.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.120
Second of all, when Tyler was playing Christopher,

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.000
he used your second invisible.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.400
Okay, I wasn't invisible.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:48.680
I just thought I was invisible.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.880
Fair play.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.360
Either way, miss.

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.520
Sorry, man.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.560
Can I ask you about a spell on mine?

01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.400
Yeah.

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.120
It's called Mirror Image.

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:00.960
Yeah.

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:05.960
Now, I'm gonna, is that, do I just make another me?

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.360
You make multiple copies of yourself

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:09.640
that are like illusions.

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:11.320
Yeah, he doesn't know who to hit.

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.480
I'm gonna do that.

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.320
Nice.

01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.720
I'm gonna go, hey, Mr. Blood Missile.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.840
Who will you hit with your blood missiles?

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:23.680
Is it me?

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.440
Or me.

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.200
I put my arm around one of them and go,

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.360
or this one.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.720
And one of them has a mustache.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.000
You summoned six, six mirror images.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.920
Oh, what a peculiar circumstance.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.680
You find yourself in, I am Dieter.

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.680
Well, I don't think it's the one with the mustache.

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.800
That's clearly fake.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.320
Oh, it would be weird if I just put on a mustache

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.400
and then cast a spell so that I was the one with the mustache.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:03.360
And then I laugh and each ha comes from a different guy.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.520
Ha.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.000
So Yerch dives on to the ground

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.560
and he grabs one of these buckets

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.560
and he does like a weird roll

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.960
and he throws a bucket on Quarks

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.560
and now Quarks covered in blood.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.400
What?

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:20.360
Yeah.

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.240
That's not good, you guys.

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:23.040
I mean, maybe it is.

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:23.880
It is?

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.720
I don't know.

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:25.720
I mean, I do.

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.720
It doesn't seem good.

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.400
You're covered in blood.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.960
I start wiping it off me.

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:34.640
Okay, with what?

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.960
My cloak of resistance.

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.240
Okay, that, yeah.

01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:40.160
You start wiping blood off you.

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.560
This takes a while.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:42.400
Okay.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.640
You get maybe a third of the way done.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:47.280
That's all.

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:50.760
Ribbon dagger.

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:51.800
Okay.

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:53.800
You attack them with your ribbon dagger?

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.640
Yeah.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.480
Just making sure.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.000
That's a critical hit.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:58.840
Oh!

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.840
You strike them directly between the blood.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.840
Dealing seven damage.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:12.680
That's incredible.

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.200
Yeah, you know, ribbon dagger does X4 damage,

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.440
but still just seven damage in this case.

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440
Seven damage.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.080
He's like, ah, my eye.

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:25.160
It was between those bloods.

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.760
I'm still wiping blood off, right?

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.600
I hope so.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.560
Putting it in a Sharpies turn.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:35.280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.760
You appear to be surrounded by a forest of foes.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.120
Which one is reducing you?

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.640
Who knows?

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.720
Reduce person.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:51.920
Tiny, tiny blood-soaked gnoll.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.560
Okay, yeah.

01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:57.360
You cast reduced person on him,

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.840
and he slowly dwindles down to the size of a gnome.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:05.840
He's like, no, that's fucked up.

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:08.320
It's not fucked up.

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.280
We're proud people, right?

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:12.160
You know, that's fine.

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.600
Not the size of the barbarian.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:16.080
It's the motion of a sword.

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:22.280
He goes, ah, but it's, I'm magicking right now.

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:23.280
Blast.

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.400
And then he casts his arms about,

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:28.320
and all the blood on the ground starts to come up

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.800
at like a snake serpent,

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.200
and starts to whip at you guys,

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.800
and try and drag you down like ropes or something.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.000
And you guys, you guys, you guys.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.960
Quark leaps out of the way,

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.160
but the other two of you guys get entangled

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.640
by these bloody ropes,

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:48.120
and you're kind of bound and tied up.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.960
Uncanny Dodge doesn't help?

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:52.360
Uncanny Dodge doesn't help.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:56.280
Not in this case. What about being like eight people?

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.200
That doesn't, because it gets everything,

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.600
so it actually grabs at all your illusions

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.840
at the same time and dispells them.

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:03.680
What?

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:04.520
Yeah.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.840
Oh, oh, oh.

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.240
I'll ribbon dagger again as I'm going down then.

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.080
What's up?

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.280
I'll ribbon dagger again as I'm going down.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.680
I'm putting it at a quark stern right now.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.320
I use my mighty sword,

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.360
and I try to cleave off the tentacles

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.880
that are holding these guys down.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:23.240
Oh, I like the sound of that.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.080
That happens.

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.760
You cleave quickly through the tentacles.

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.440
They're bloody ropes, whatever.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.680
Wrapping these two gentlemen,

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.000
freeing them from their bonds.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.840
It works?

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.680
Yeah.

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.520
Yeah.

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.340
Woo!

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.160
Yeah.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.000
Thanks, man.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.800
Am I, is all the blood off me?

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.640
Yeah.

01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:47.680
No, you stopped wiping.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:49.520
Okay, well, I go back to wiping.

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.360
Okay.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.640
Just, just, just.

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.480
Just cleave it.

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.320
And wipe it.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.160
And wipe it.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.560
I'm going to be a gravestone.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.080
Just says he was meticulous.

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.500
And fastidious.

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:05.920
Am I able to backstab from where I'm at?

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.440
You can move to backstab.

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.280
Sure.

01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.120
I'll do that.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:09.960
Okay.

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.080
You move to backstab.

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.520
You get another critical hit.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.600
Jesus Christ.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.400
Let's see how much damage you do.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.720
You got some damage this time.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:20.360
Yeah.

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:21.960
That one's a lot more.

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.640
Yeah, that's 20 damage that time.

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:24.640
Yeah!

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.140
Yeah!

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:29.280
Smiling faces.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.200
Now who's the lady in red?

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.840
You stab him directly in his small back,

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:39.480
and he takes that much damage that I mentioned.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:45.440
Don't forget the back is small because I made it that way.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:47.240
It's your turn again.

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:47.740
Me?

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:48.680
Yeah.

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:49.680
First I go.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:56.080
Can I get a spell called Cast Consistent Dialect on Sharpie?

01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.400
First, I start off my turn by going, but which of us?

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.160
Oh, and then I remember that.

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.320
Oh, sorry.

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.240
It's back to just me again.

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:12.160
I would like to ask you a quick question about the sun

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:12.760
rot again.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.000
I can't remember what that did.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.560
It's like a flashlight.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.120
God damn it.

01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:19.840
I asked that last week.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.800
And what does Sack do?

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:25.120
All right.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.640
We're going to use the old rot of frost.

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.120
All right.

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.760
Do you want to shoot a cone of cold or like icy shards?

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.040
There's different modes on this, baby.

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.040
Icy shards.

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:41.760
Oh, no.

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:44.840
All right.

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.000
I saw that.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.400
Yeah, you did.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:49.600
I still need to critical fail.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:52.400
I'm pulling the trigger on your icy shards.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:55.760
While you let off a witty pun, you realize you're holding it

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.280
backwards.

01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:01.960
I rolled a one.

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:06.040
And you blast off a volley of icy shards into your face,

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:09.160
dealing 10 damage.

01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.000
I used to meet me.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.160
Ow, ow.

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:15.040
Am I dead?

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.480
Let me see.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.080
How much damage?

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:19.440
You're keeping track of my hit points.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.040
Yeah, so right now you've already taken eight damage.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.240
So now you've taken 10 more.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.800
What's your health total?

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.640
35.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:30.320
All right, you're fine.

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.280
You're making this up.

01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:34.520
Yeah.

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.320
I spent an hour today really sneak to Harmontowns

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.560
and doing the math.

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:39.080
Oh, really?

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.000
Yeah.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.360
Was I at full health?

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:43.440
Well, you know, the Dr. Pepper made you full health.

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.440
Oh, yeah.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.160
He only got hit for about eight damage.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.640
Oh, yeah.

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.160
Yeah.

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:52.120
Is it my turn?

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.840
No, it was your turn.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:57.160
He's like, I'm all wounded and shit.

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.680
I'm going to make a break for it.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:02.320
And he runs towards the hole in the floor.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.400
At half speed.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:06.440
Yeah, at injured speed.

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.400
In tiny speed.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.000
At tiny person speed.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.560
Injured tiny half person bloody speed.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.520
Farsword power attack.

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.640
Unleashing a farsword attack from your blade,

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:22.560
it critically hits and slices him in half.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.560
Yeah.

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.960
Whoa.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.680
He's like, you sons of bitches.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.000
You don't know why it gets like farther away.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.120
He just stays still.

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.560
But then he dies.

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.720
You shove him into the lava.

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:39.720
He dies.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:40.720
Oh, you're a bitch.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.960
I walk up and I walk up over his body and I look down at him.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.640
And I was a heavy heart.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.280
I dry hump him a little bit.

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:54.240
I thought you were going to say a last per year inch.

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:57.480
A last per year inch.

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.280
I take some of your just blood and I go like, why?

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.640
Why?

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.760
And then I rub it on my face and I go, oh, look, I'm on the guy.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.760
I go, what the fuck?

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.800
And I look at my friends.

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:13.040
And I go, I'm just kidding.

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.240
I would never.

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.920
Blood magic's the worst.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.000
Just say no.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.400
I search Yerch's body.

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.960
He has just a rusty dagger and a bunch of poop.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.960
He was keeping it?

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:32.520
That's why he smelled so bad, I guess.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:41.680
I was about to give Yerch a rusty dagger.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.000
That's where I poop on my dick and then fuck him.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
He didn't have to.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:53.360
I don't want to play D&D anymore.

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:57.800
I take some more buckets of blood and I just pour it all over him.

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.720
OK.

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:02.480
I kick his body into the lava.

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:09.160
You hear a screech coming from that doorway that he came through as you kick that into

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.880
the lava.

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.280
Just a screech.

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:17.440
I walk up to the, is it a stairway?

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.560
It's like an archway that leads to a staircase.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.480
I walk up and go, who are you?

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.160
You can see two pairs of glowing eyes in the darkness.

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.400
They're like, you killed Yerch, you will have our vengeance or something.

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:33.480
And then they disappear in a poof of smoke.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:41.200
All right, let's all pool each syllable we heard and we'll piece it together.

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.640
I heard you killed all the Jews.

01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.320
You killed Yerch.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:53.280
You will die in a pool of vengeance?

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:55.520
Definitely not the most eloquent of us.

01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:03.320
I yell, come again, but they've already vanished in that smoke I mentioned.

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:07.920
Oh, Admiral Darkstar, if that's you.

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920
It wasn't.

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.920
Oh.

01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:13.360
Then never mind.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:16.360
I yell at the ceiling, nonetheless.

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:18.360
More like Admiral Fartstar.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.360
Nothing?

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.360
No.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.360
I mean, sure.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.360
Admiral Fartstar.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.080
I thought that might get to him.

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.280
Let's chase him up to the archway.

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.280
Let's go, guys.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.280
Let's run.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.280
We run.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.280
We run up the archway.

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:36.320
You run up the archway and you burst through the door at the top of the, no, okay.

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.720
So running through the archway, there's a spiral staircase.

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.040
So I'm assuming you're also charging up that?

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.040
Yes.

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.040
Okay.

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:46.200
Charging up, you burst through the door at the top and what you see inside is a pillar

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:51.200
of black crystal on the top of which is Admiral Darkstar.

01:53:51.200 --> 01:54:11.320
Thank you for coming to a sleepy, introspective Harmontown featuring Johnny Jack Emmer and

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.320
Beef Steak Bill.

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:17.200
And thank you, Hayley, for coming up and everybody else.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.400
One more time for Spencer Crinton.

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:27.400
I'm Jeff Davis, a Comptroller, thank you for putting up with a very sleepy me.

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.400
One more time for your sleepy but wonderful Mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.400
Go home and go to sleep.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.400
We'll see you next week.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:53.000
Quiet in the link!
