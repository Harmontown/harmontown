WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
That was a bigger ice cube than I intended here, hang on.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
You can murder somebody with that.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Welcome one and all.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
Harmontown is still briefly in session.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Let's welcome the Game Master, the master of games, the master of one and all,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
the star of Harmon Quest, Mr. Spencer Crittenden, everybody.

00:55.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Spencer, what's going to happen when we don't have underwear ads to do together anymore?

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
I don't know, we'll have to sell something else. Maybe we can become traveling salesmen.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Like vacuum cleaners and encyclopedias and what else?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, like a death of a salesman.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Alright.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
I'm Willie Lohman.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
The death of two salesmen.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Yeah.

01:25.000 --> 01:35.000
Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Hip hop. You don't stop.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Rap and rap and that's all you got.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Hipity, hipity, hipity hop.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yo.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Hipity hop.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
My name is Mr. Rap.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yo.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
I like to go into a trap because I'm self-destructive.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I have a question for you, Mr. Rap.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Yes.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Why do they call you Mr. Rap?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Because I like to go into traps.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And that rhymes.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm actually not very good at rapping.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm more passionate about trapping myself.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm self-destructive.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I love to be trapped.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Everybody trap me.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
What's your favorite kind of trap to be trapped in?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Like a snare or a...

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
A bohemian spike pit.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
A deceptively peaceful name for one of the most brutal traps devised by the human mind.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Tell me how it works.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Well, it's a trapezoidal hole, so you can't get out.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
If you get trapped, you scream and shout.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
You fall into the pit and the spikes go through.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
What you gonna do?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What you gonna do?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
My name is Mr. Rap.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm here to say I fell into one of those today.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
And it really made me happy.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
All the way, by the way, also gay.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I don't know if that just...

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Mr. Rap, I think that...

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Obviously you know a lot about traps,

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
but I think you're kind of varying the lead that you're...

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You're pretty a good rapper, too.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Nah.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, come on, Mr. Rap.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Nah, come on.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I think you're using traps as a camouflage.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
For your actual love of freestyle rapping.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Well, I flow into the mic and I do much better.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I fucked your mama so hard, I made her a sweater.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Outta cum.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It was woven.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm fate-hoven.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Mr. Rap, can I...

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm sorry, what? Excuse me for a second.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
You made a sweater out of cum?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Yes.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Because the ropey knots were very ropey.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Kissing cooking.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
All right, all right.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
All right, let's give it up for Mr. Rap.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Not...

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Not only a rapper, but a big trap enthusiast

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and also a cum weaver.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
He loves to be trapped in.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
He loves throwing his ropey knots.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, cream weaver.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I believe I can make you a sweater.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Imagine the discipline it would take to cum a sweater.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Or the patience of the person that was getting the sweater

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
weaved upon them.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
How long do you think it would take to cum a sweater?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Weeks, I don't know.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
All right, I only have one thing.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It just has special plugs.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
So, look, I don't understand electronics or capitalism

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
enough to know why this is done to consumers.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
But, like, I just...

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I know that my voice won't be loud enough

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
and nothing will happen.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I just... I want an air of frustration

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
that specifically has to do with the electronic appliances

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
that, for some reason, in a world of appliances

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
that seem satisfied with a 12-volt adapter

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
or, you know, a 9-volt or whatever,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
you've got all the different sizes,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
but you can buy them all at an electronics store

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
if you lose them.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And then there's these things, these proprietary plugs,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
like these computer things that they have.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You look at them, there's like a power brick

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
and then there's those fucking things.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Realized dongles, Dan.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And it's just like, you lose...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I wrote an Amazon review today.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Everybody was like, I love this thing.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
This is a great USB hub.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
It's, like, pretty pricey, but it runs like a dream.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And I was like, four stars.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
If you lose the plug, you're fucked.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Like, I'm sorry, four stars.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
What is the plug looking like?

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
I don't know. It's a DC 20 volt 9 amp fucking starfish.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, like a little circle one?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
You can't, you type that on the internet

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
and your sticks albums come up.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Like, it's not...

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
There's no way to replace it,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
so I just have this aluminum brick.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
All right, let's bring out our guest.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Wait, before we do,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
does anybody have a pen that they don't care much about?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
It's my pen, it's fucked.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Oh, shit, a pen.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
He's got a pen, just chuck it on stage,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
like I threw the ice out.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Fuck!

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
He just gets buried in pens.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
That was a good throw.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
That one hit me in the face, so I'm keeping that one.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
A good throw.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Thank you.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I'm pretty excited about our pal

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
that's about to come out.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Kimbo Slice?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Let's bring out Kimbo...

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Slice.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Is he the McCartney of the Kids in the Hall of the Lennon?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
No, I would say he's the George Harrison.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Ooh.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's ask him, let's welcome Dave Foley, everybody.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Dave Foley!

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Dave Foley!

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Dave Foley!

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Dave Foley!

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Oh, hello.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Dave Foley.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I believe I'm the Billy Preston.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Wait, is that the guy from the...

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
No, wait, who's the guy that got left behind?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, that was Pete Best.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
There was Pete Best, then there was Stuart Sutcliffe,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
who his brain exploded.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, no one talks about him.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, I know, and that was a pretty exciting story,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
having your brain explode.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
He was really talented, too, right?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
No, he was terrible, he was a terrible bass player.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Damn, I was close.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Yeah, he was a shit bass player.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
You had a 50-50 chance, Spencer.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
You had a 50-50 chance on that one.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I was right on the edge of that 50-50.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, that's where you live, right on the edge.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
He played with his back to the audience,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
much like Sid Viciouswood years later.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And Miles Davis.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
And Miles Davis, but they had just because he was an asshole, though.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Guy, because he hated his crowd.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah, I once saw Miles Davis playing in the round

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
on a stage that rotated,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
and he spent the entire night going...

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Fuck!

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
So he was in hell then, right?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
That's the worst thing you could do.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
There was one little tunnel where the people came out of,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
and that was the only place he could look at.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
And he had a spot like a ballet dancer.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Remember when we were in Las Vegas and we took mushrooms,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
and they kind of didn't take,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
but everybody ended up in one hotel room,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
and all of a sudden the mushrooms started to kick in

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
while Rob Schrab was describing the Neil Diamond concert

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
he had gone to with a couple of the other people.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
The rest of us had all split up and had failure of a mushroom trip,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
but then it was just Schrab describing the Neil Diamond concert

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
because there was this malfunctioning platform

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
that Neil Diamond was like,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
everybody put it together for the brass section or whatever,

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
and there were like these platforms that weren't working.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And Schrab just for hours kept doing his impression of Neil Diamond

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
going like, they're coming to, what the fuck?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
It was really funny.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
We were just all laughing, like eight-year-olds for four hours.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I think the first time I met you, Dave,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
because now you and I have been on the road quite a bit.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
For about a year.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Doing hilarious live.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And the first time I met you,

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
was that your old house with the crazy precipitous Machu Picchu staircase?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Yes, yes.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And then all the lights went out and there was no way to get out

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
without breaking your ass on the way out.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Yes, that was our last party in that house,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
up in the Hollywood Hills where we had some,

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
we had a party once that blocked traffic all the way from

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Lookout Mountain all the way down to Sunset.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Okay, I remember, we have met several times,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
but I bet not there, but I was at one of those parties

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
at your house in the 90s.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, in the late 90s.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
There were a lot of parties at my house that I wasn't even at.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And yeah, there would be huge parties.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Rob Cohen and I used to throw our birthday party.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Canadian Rob Cohen.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
But the party you were at was our last party.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, and the power went out, there was a huge blackout.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
The whole, all of Laurel Canyon was blacked out.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
And we had no furniture because we were moving out of the house.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
There was nothing to do or see.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
There was lots of booze.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And the pool was heated.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I didn't get that far.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
And then we all kind of just like hold hands and walk down the hill together

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and get the fuck out of that.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Here's how old we are.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
I remember being in your backyard when I tested my first cell phone

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
with Rob Schrab.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
We were in LA for a while before we got our first cell phones

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and we got them at the same time so they were one number apart.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Which made us the biggest dorks.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
And I remember, what's the guy's name?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
This is before they even invented flip phones.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Technology just flipped open the phone, didn't exist yet.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
No, these were clam shells.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I remember distinctly because we were testing them at this party

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
and we were like in a backyard.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
And Dave Rath, I remember specifically.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
The manager was like, this is a guy at that time

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
that you don't want to look like an idiot in front of, I guess.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
His reputation precedes him as whatever.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
You're like, oh god, there's that guy.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I've already heard of him and he doesn't know who I am.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And then we're like in the backyard and Schrab and I just don't even know

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
if these phones work so we called each other.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
And then I just remember the mortifying realization

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
that everyone was looking at us.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
And we were clearly just like these new kids in LA

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
who didn't know what cell phones were

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
and we're testing them in the backyard like walkie-talkies.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And how dorky that felt.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Have you ever considered, Dave, what beetle you would be in the kids in the hall?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Which beetle?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I thought we settled that earlier.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Let's let you weigh in.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Have you been compared to, like you are the Lenin or the McCartney

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
or the Harrison?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
No, I don't know because we have an extra one.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, because it's finally you.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
So I don't know, maybe McCartney.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
I think you're like a McCartney.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Yeah, because you're cute.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
And I was, yeah, and I'm nicer than McCullough.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
So McCullough is the Lenin for sure, yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
What's great about going on the road with Dave is we travel around

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
and now you've been sober for some good long time.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Almost five years now, yeah.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
And we'll be like in Atlanta, like Georgia,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
oh yeah, I went to jail there.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
I passed out over there.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
It's fun to go on the day fully.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I used to do bad things to her.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
How many times have you been told, because there was a lot of drag work?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I don't know what the right term for it is.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Like you, in the kids in the hall, like you guys, there were no women in the tree.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
We called it lady time.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Lady time?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
How many times were you told how sexy you were as a viable woman?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Or was that just me and my mom?

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Discussing how hot you were in a wig.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
I would say it was probably on average every time.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Because it was like all the other guys, it was like, oh, everyone's funny.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Everyone's a lady.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
That's funny.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
But then it was like, oof.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah, I heard it, yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
I know.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Well, Kevin in particular used to develop, like fall in love with some

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
of the women characters I would play.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
And it was like really get under everything because he would just stare a lot.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
And like our crew, like we had like old CBC crew, which you know, like government

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
employees.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
And first they all hated us, but then they sort of grew to like, but I'd get

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
like this, these old crew guys coming up to me going, Dave, you're going to be

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
that redhead tonight.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Oh!

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, no, not today.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh, fuck.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
All right, all right.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Is there a technique?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Is there something you tap into or when you would play a woman?

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
A lifetime of low-testosterone came in handy.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Do you know that you were on Jeopardy!

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Last night?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I heard that.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Yeah, I didn't see it, but Kevin McDonnell texted me.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
I was watching it with Laura last night and they said, there was a category of

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Canadian television.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
I'm like, there's no way there's not going to be a kids in the hall like answer

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
on that one.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
But I think the only said you and Kevin, maybe one brother?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I saw the screen capture.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Was it just you two?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, it said the Canadian comedy troupe, including Dave Foley and Kevin McDonnell.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, so Bruce is fucking fucked off right now, right?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh, yeah.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, he's got one fewer TVs in his house.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
That's what happens, huh?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That's terrifying.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I always imagined now because I have a pool for the first time, so now I'm always

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
characterizing everything.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I was like, well, look, this isn't going to, I just want to keep that pool filled.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
And I like to imagine like if I eat it on a Rick and Morty script, like a couple

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
of gallons comes out of the pool.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
It's just like, I'll be down there and like two feet of water, like typing.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
I remember the first time I saw your face on television when I was still in Milwaukee,

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
it was the monologue, a good attitude towards menstruation.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
That was the...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Please give them time to applaud.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Please.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
That was literally the first time.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I had no idea what the show was.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Back then you flipped through channels, so it was like just boom, there was your adorable

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
apple face, your pure, handsome...

15:42.000 --> 15:51.000
I'd hit it if it was a woman face and hit it like sexually, you know what I'm saying?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Yeah.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Yes.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
Let's make that perfectly clear.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
He means hitting it in a fun, sexual way.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
He means strike up a conversation and work his way up to consensual sex with it.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
But that was a great monologue.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Did you write that?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I did, yeah.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
And it still holds up, I think.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Well, I haven't gone back and watched it, but comedy does not age well.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And then like the monologue is about how you have a good attitude towards menstruation.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
And it's like, I would believe that if you read it today, it wouldn't be like, oh, that

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
didn't age well.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
No, I think it's...

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, it stands up, I think.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Do you remember?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Do it.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
I don't remember all.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Hi, my name is Dave Foley and I have...

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
A good attitude towards menstruation.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
That's right, I'm the guy.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
The guy with a good attitude towards menstruation.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
Oh, I know a lot of men are made uncomfortable by this monthly miracle, but not me.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
No, I embrace it.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
I embrace it the way some men embrace the weekend.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I look forward to it the way a child...

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I anticipate it the way a child anticipates Christmas.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
I can't remember any more of it.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Wow.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah, I don't remember.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
But I remember the phrase, celebrate her fecundity, isn't there?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Fecundity, yes.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Oh, yes.

17:13.000 --> 17:22.000
Fecundity and pampering, and I'd mop her brown, admire her fecundity.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
People don't call each other fecund anymore.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
No, well, so few of us are.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I'm occasionally fecund.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, how would you know?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Have you ever put it through the test?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
I guess not.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
No, well, there you go.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Me, my sperm is so motile, I could be getting someone pregnant right now.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Yeah?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
You have airborne sperm.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
My sperm?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Just my sperm sneak out.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Yeah.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
In the middle of the night.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Yeah, you're like the West Nile virus of date rape.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I don't know what it was.

17:54.000 --> 18:02.000
Why is it do you think when you...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I don't know how it got rapey, I don't...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I think I'm just saying that it was...

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
I think my sperm go out and they talk a good game.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Yeah.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
You have charming airborne sperm.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
They're Canadian sperm.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
They're not going to sell each other out to get to the egg.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
No, no.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
They're wingman.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
They're like those chipmunks.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
After you.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
No, after you.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
And also in Canada, your sperm has to be on the air...

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
What's the percentage of sperm airtime on...

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Well, you have...

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
All of your sperm have to be 20% Canadian.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And they have to speak French.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
And English, yes.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
You have to come in French.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
So most unwanted children are Dave Foley's and Colin Makris.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Everybody.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That's nice.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Somebody laughed because it was too close to home.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Are you a Toronto guy?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I am.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Is that everybody?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Was everybody from Toronto and the kids?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Most of us.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Well, also you did more than kids in the hall.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I know I'm like, was everybody...

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Is Lorne Michaels from Toronto too?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
He is.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
He was from Toronto.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.000
You were talking about the origin story of you guys with Lorne and the brain candy.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.560
I love that movie.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
You're alone.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.560
Yeah.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.360
But what was the deal?

19:31.360 --> 19:34.000
Why did that kind of didn't get released?

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
Well, it got released, but it was supposed to be released on something like a thousand

19:39.000 --> 19:45.200
screens, but the troupe, and at this point I had quit the troupe, but so they were still

19:45.200 --> 19:53.480
making the movie, and they fought very hard for a character named Cancer Boy, which is

19:53.480 --> 19:57.840
funny because it's a character that I originally wrote into our TV show.

19:57.840 --> 20:03.240
So they fought to keep Cancer Boy, and Paramount really wanted Cancer Boy out, and then I guess

20:03.240 --> 20:09.680
Bruce got on the phone and badgered somebody at Paramount, and they finally said, all right,

20:09.680 --> 20:12.680
you can have Cancer Boy, and they called up Lorne and said, hey, we won.

20:12.680 --> 20:17.320
We got Cancer Boy, and Lorne went, oh, that's wonderful.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.120
And so as a result of keeping Cancer Boy in, they cut it from something like a thousand

20:21.120 --> 20:26.400
screens to 400 screens, and they cut all of the television advertising.

20:26.400 --> 20:31.120
So and you know, that's not important to a film release.

20:31.120 --> 20:38.840
Because, yeah, you want to reach the people that are at the rodeo with Cancer Boy.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.120
Just put something on the side of a steer.

20:41.120 --> 20:47.720
So can I talk about the origin story of Dave coming on to Who's Live Anyway?

20:47.720 --> 20:48.720
Sure.

20:48.720 --> 20:54.000
Ryan, we were in Chicago, Ryan got ill and couldn't do the shows, and we were fucked

20:54.000 --> 21:02.080
because we had like a bunch of gigs to do, and our agent at APA, Josh, called you up

21:02.080 --> 21:03.080
like what, at midnight?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.320
It was 11 o'clock at night, yeah.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.320
Yeah, LA time.

21:06.320 --> 21:11.200
Yeah, it was one or two Chicago time, and they're like, okay, we have Dave Foley flying

21:11.200 --> 21:13.760
in tomorrow and to save this.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.520
And Dave Foley came in, you hadn't done improv in-

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
30 years.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
30 years.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
Yeah.

21:19.520 --> 21:25.480
And I think the very first scene that we did, you and I were on the ground, scissoring each

21:25.480 --> 21:26.480
other.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.480
Uh-huh.

21:27.480 --> 21:36.800
It was like, this guy is perfect, you're up for anything, and you do the most abstract

21:36.800 --> 21:44.880
characters, like I love you doing our version of crap improv, because you do like kind of

21:44.880 --> 21:52.560
abstruse right field characters, like very weird, it's fucking great.

21:52.560 --> 21:55.880
But you and I were laying on the ground and just absolutely scissor-fucking each other.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.880
I can't remember why.

21:56.880 --> 21:57.880
Huh?

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
I can't remember why.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.880
No.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.880
Don't ask why.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
It's fantastic.

22:01.880 --> 22:02.880
Yeah.

22:02.880 --> 22:14.160
Why don't you guys do some improv from this like, I don't know if you're aware of this,

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
what we've been doing here.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
Oh, shit.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.160
Have you been reading from a script?

22:20.160 --> 22:22.160
Oh, yeah.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.160
Who here is from out of town?

22:23.160 --> 22:24.160
Who's from out of town?

22:24.160 --> 22:25.160
Raise your hand.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
Oh, shit.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.160
All of you?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.160
Jesus Christ.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.160
Yeah.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.160
All right.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.160
You met him right here.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.160
What's your name?

22:32.160 --> 22:33.160
Nadia.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.160
Nadia.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.160
Are you Russian or?

22:35.160 --> 22:36.160
I'm from London.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.160
London?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.160
Yeah.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.160
Why do you have a Russian name?

22:39.160 --> 22:40.160
It's herbian.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.160
Oh.

22:41.160 --> 22:48.160
Oh, shit.

22:48.160 --> 22:54.160
Give Dan a position that people only do in Serbia, like a physical position, like a pose.

22:54.160 --> 22:58.160
That would be a very Serbian pose.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.160
That sounds good.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.160
Dan, get water from the well.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.160
You're going to get water?

23:02.160 --> 23:03.160
Dan?

23:03.160 --> 23:04.160
Yeah.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.160
Out of your state, Dan.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.160
Take your mic.

23:06.160 --> 23:10.160
Dan, you're going to be going to get water from the well.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.160
Is anybody here from Croatia?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.160
Any other Balkans here?

23:16.160 --> 23:17.160
Yeah.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.160
Do you have any Balkans?

23:18.160 --> 23:20.160
Who's here from South America?

23:20.160 --> 23:22.160
We'll get to Rwanda later.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
Rwanda.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.160
Who's here from South America?

23:25.160 --> 23:27.160
Central America.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.160
America.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.160
There we go.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.160
You are here.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
Give.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.160
That's our spot.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.160
What's your name?

23:33.160 --> 23:34.160
Zen.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.160
Zen?

23:35.160 --> 23:38.160
Yeah, I know what Zen means.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.160
Like Buddhism.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.160
She had to explain Zen.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.160
Well, she's just telling you, because you might have thought her name.

23:43.160 --> 23:47.160
She might have thought it was Zen, or she's...

23:47.160 --> 23:53.160
What's your real name that people can't pronounce?

23:53.160 --> 23:54.160
No.

23:54.160 --> 23:59.160
No.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.160
Stop fighting, everyone.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.160
Zen.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.160
You're not very Zen.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.160
Zen.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.160
Give Dave Foley a Zen posture or pose?

24:08.160 --> 24:09.160
Okay, cool.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.160
Let's do this.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.160
No, no.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.160
Just say it.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.160
Oh, you're going to come and do it for us?

24:14.160 --> 24:15.160
All right.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.160
That's fine, too.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.160
All right, Zen.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.160
Oh, wow.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.160
Welcome Zen to the stage, everybody.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.160
Show Dave Foley what he's going to do.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.160
All improv should be like this.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.160
Give him a...

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Hi, Dave Foley.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
I'm Zen.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.160
Hi, Zen.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.160
Can I get a name?

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
Zen with an M?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
Oh, yes!

24:31.160 --> 24:32.160
Zen.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.160
I'm just going to do this now.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.160
All right.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.160
You got that?

24:37.160 --> 24:38.160
All right.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.160
Let's give it up for Zen, everybody.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.160
Zen, thank you.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.160
Let's give it up for Zen.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.160
Zen.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
Go away.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.160
All right.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.160
So, here we are.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.160
So, Dave has this pose.

24:51.160 --> 24:57.480
Dan is getting water from the well, and now we are going to take you to a scene that encapsulates

24:57.480 --> 25:00.160
these physical positions.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.160
Pretty sure it's your fault.

25:03.160 --> 25:08.160
So, I should have been thinking of something funny this whole time.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.160
No!

25:09.160 --> 25:10.160
No!

25:10.160 --> 25:11.160
No!

25:11.160 --> 25:12.160
That's scripting.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.160
That's a rookie mistake, Dan.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.160
All right.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.160
All right.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.160
Okay.

25:16.160 --> 25:26.160
So, if I do one cartwheel, you'll give me that human head.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.160
Right?

25:27.160 --> 25:28.160
Freeze!

25:28.160 --> 25:29.160
Freeze!

25:29.160 --> 25:35.160
Are you both frozen?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.160
He tapped him!

25:37.160 --> 25:38.160
You did!

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
Okay.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.160
I might have tapped him.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.160
Maybe you're just, it was an encouraging tap.

25:43.160 --> 25:55.160
Ladies and gentlemen, for one night and one night only, Canadian Elvis Presley.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.160
Oh, shit.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.160
Hey, everybody.

25:59.160 --> 26:05.160
I just want to say I'm sorry.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.160
We did improv.

26:06.160 --> 26:11.160
You see, it's like riding a bicycle, David.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.160
It's like riding a bicycle.

26:13.160 --> 26:25.160
Although it doesn't get you anywhere.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.160
But it's fun, right?

26:26.160 --> 26:27.160
Yeah.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.160
Oh, yeah.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.160
Yeah, it was fun.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.160
It was weird because when they called, as I said, it was like 11 o'clock at night.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.160
And I remember, I was tired.

26:34.160 --> 26:38.160
So, my only thought was, well, I got to drive my daughter to something tomorrow.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.160
So, if I can get someone to drive her, I'll be there.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.160
That was what I called.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.160
And you were on a plane like at 6 a.m.

26:45.160 --> 26:49.160
Yeah, I had to be on a flight at 6 a.m. to get there in time for the show.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.160
You saved our bacon.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.160
Our Canadian bacon.

26:51.160 --> 27:00.160
I was probably when I got on the plane and I went, oh, I don't improvise.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.160
Yeah.

27:01.160 --> 27:04.160
Well, that brought back some bad flashbacks for me.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.160
Were you ever in an improv group?

27:06.160 --> 27:09.160
Yeah, when I was a little tight, yeah.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.160
That's how Dan and I met.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.160
We did comedy sports.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.160
Oh, you were in comedy sports?

27:14.160 --> 27:15.160
I was in LA comedy sports.

27:15.160 --> 27:19.160
And he and Rob were Milwaukee comedy sports.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.160
I was getting like 94, I think.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.160
So, yeah, kids know we were all theater sports up in Canada.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
All right.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.160
Same thing.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.160
Yeah.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.160
Yeah.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.160
Keith Johnstone.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.160
Keith Johnstone.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.160
Yeah, exactly.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
Yeah, that lit up all the wrong parts of my brain.

27:33.160 --> 27:41.160
I was, that thing of playing to the, you know, trying to get the laugh.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.160
And I was never good at it.

27:44.160 --> 27:48.160
And it always made me feel sad.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.160
What do you mean you weren't good at playing for the laugh?

27:50.160 --> 27:53.160
I saw you be funny and go for the laugh all the time.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.160
Well, I think it's like those freeze games and like kind of, I don't know.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.160
You're more of a long form guy, Dan.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.160
Yeah.

27:59.160 --> 28:05.160
Can I get a, can I get a Dutch playwright?

28:05.160 --> 28:06.160
Just run on stage.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.160
We're going to do an eight hour Herald.

28:08.160 --> 28:09.160
Yes.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.160
I heard, I heard Ibsen.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.160
I heard Ibsen.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.160
Can we, let's get a title of an Ibsen play.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.160
The Dollhouse.

28:17.160 --> 28:29.160
Can I have some better lighting, please?

28:29.160 --> 28:30.160
Perfect.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.160
Thank you.

28:33.160 --> 28:46.160
We now take you to act two of The Dollhouse by Henry Gibson.

28:46.160 --> 28:59.160
What have I done?

28:59.160 --> 29:10.160
We now take you to act three of Ibsen's The Dollhouse.

29:10.160 --> 29:14.160
Which wire?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.160
Are you sure?

29:17.160 --> 29:21.160
How could you not be sure?

29:21.160 --> 29:24.160
Hold on to your butts.

29:24.160 --> 29:35.160
Dollhouse.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.160
You see improv's not, it doesn't change over time.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.160
Improv is still improv.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.160
Yeah.

29:40.160 --> 29:44.160
I think that was Enemy of the People.

29:44.160 --> 29:48.160
You ever see that movie, Executive Decision?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.160
Nope.

29:49.160 --> 29:54.160
It was pretty bad, but they did one fun thing, which is that Stephen Segal was in it, and

29:54.160 --> 30:00.160
he was on all the posters, and it was like, Stephen Segal, Kurt Russell, and Oliver Platt

30:00.160 --> 30:03.160
are Executive Decision.

30:03.160 --> 30:08.160
How can they all be, how can they all three be Executive Decision?

30:08.160 --> 30:11.160
It was the name of their improv group.

30:11.160 --> 30:15.160
But in like the first eight minutes of the movie, Stephen Segal just without warning

30:15.160 --> 30:18.160
just gets sucked out of the airplane.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.160
And that's part of that.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.160
It's like, oh, they had their whole mission planned, and he was like the alpha, and then

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
he just dies right away.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.160
It was kind of a fun thing.

30:25.160 --> 30:29.160
Was that in the script, or they just thought, fuck, we hate this guy.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.160
I think that was the first week of shooting rewrite.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.160
Yeah, it could have evolved out of working with Segal.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.160
I don't know.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.160
He's supposed to be the worst person, right?

30:39.160 --> 30:42.160
I heard he actually hurts people in those action scenes.

30:42.160 --> 30:47.160
Like he's like, I can't act, so I'm just really going to break your arm.

30:47.160 --> 30:52.160
He will punch and actually make contact with the stunt guy, which you're not supposed to do.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.160
No, and it's arguably easy not to do.

30:55.160 --> 31:01.160
And if you're a martial artist, you really should be even better at not hitting people.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.160
It's arguably your job not to hit people.

31:04.160 --> 31:08.160
And if you complain, you're allowed to not be on the movie anymore.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.160
But also, I think there's a great story, and I forget who it was, but the stunt coordinator

31:12.160 --> 31:14.160
completely busted his ass.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.160
Like, just counterpunched him and just knocked him out.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.160
Fuck you, Segal.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.160
Also, at some point, he just started wearing shower curtains.

31:24.160 --> 31:28.160
He got so fat that he just wore, like, not even Mumus.

31:28.160 --> 31:32.160
Mumus is too polite a word for what Stephen Segal started wearing.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.160
Mumus are too fitted.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.160
Okay, there's been a change of plans.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.160
We're going to go down there.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.160
We're going to be ghosts.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.160
Only ghosts.

31:44.160 --> 31:49.160
There was this movie where I put a clip of it on my Instagram.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.160
If you scroll back, you'll see it.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.160
But it's like, it's just a wig.

31:53.160 --> 31:59.160
Clearly, it was like he got 300 pounds and he painted a Dracula widow's peak on his head.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.160
And he kept doing, like, even shittier and shittier movies.

32:02.160 --> 32:07.160
And he kept, like, if you watch those latter-day movies, he's, like,

32:07.160 --> 32:10.160
clearly like, I'm not going to re-memorize the script.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.160
I'll just talk.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.160
I'm Stephen Segal.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.160
What am I doing in this scene?

32:15.160 --> 32:17.160
Telling my sidekick that we're on a mission.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.160
Okay, we're on a mission.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
It's going to be good.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.160
We now take you to act two.

32:22.160 --> 32:27.160
Stephen Segal has portrayed by Dan Harmon.

32:27.160 --> 32:31.160
Whatever it's called.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.160
Damien.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.160
We got a mission.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.160
Okay.

32:38.160 --> 32:41.160
There's nothing to get excited about.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.160
We're going to go fight some bad guys.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.160
Okay.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.160
It's just a big deal.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.160
I'm all over the plot.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.160
I'm just here for comic relief.

32:51.160 --> 32:54.160
Mmm.

32:54.160 --> 32:57.160
Get in the boat.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.160
Get in the boat.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.160
Get in the boat.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.160
And we're on the bayou.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.160
On the bayou.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.160
It's just a mission on the bayou.

33:08.160 --> 33:12.160
Where are we rowing to?

33:12.160 --> 33:15.160
Cage.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.160
It's where Cajuns are from.

33:17.160 --> 33:22.160
Cajuns.

33:22.160 --> 33:30.160
How long have you been in demolitions?

33:30.160 --> 33:34.160
Well, it's kind of a family thing.

33:34.160 --> 33:37.160
My grandfather was in demolitions.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.160
And my father, when I came of age.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
Hold on.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.160
Okay.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.160
I'm going to make a three-point turn.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.160
It's on alligator.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.160
All right.

33:47.160 --> 33:51.160
I'm going to beat the shit out of him.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.160
Hey, alligator.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.160
You like picking on tough guys?

33:56.160 --> 33:58.160
I mean, are you a tough guy?

33:58.160 --> 34:00.160
You like picking on non-tough guys?

34:00.160 --> 34:02.160
Well, you can't talk?

34:02.160 --> 34:04.160
What are you, some kind of reptile?

34:04.160 --> 34:10.160
Come here.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.160
I lost my oars.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
Yeah.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.160
It's supposed to be connected to the boat.

34:16.160 --> 34:22.160
And the alligator is a protected species, you know.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.160
It's not from where I'm standing.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.160
Chop it.

34:26.160 --> 34:30.160
Chop it.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.160
Chop it.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.160
Chop it.

34:34.160 --> 34:36.160
The watch is really tossing the boat around.

34:36.160 --> 34:38.160
Damn it.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.160
You!

34:39.160 --> 34:40.160
What?

34:40.160 --> 34:41.160
Down there in the boat.

34:41.160 --> 34:44.160
It's Kurt Russell.

34:44.160 --> 34:50.160
I just want my truck back.

34:50.160 --> 34:52.160
This is a boat.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
Yeah.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
Yeah.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.160
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

34:56.160 --> 34:59.160
There goes the chopper.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.160
You see, improv is not hard.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.160
It's not a hard...

35:02.160 --> 35:04.160
It's not a difficult art form.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.160
No.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.160
It's all you...

35:08.160 --> 35:10.160
Yeah.

35:10.160 --> 35:15.160
It's like painting if all painting was Jackson Pollock.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.160
No.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.160
It doesn't have to make any sense.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.160
Who day for you, you're self excluded.

35:24.160 --> 35:29.160
Who do you think was the most naturally funny kid from the kids in the home?

35:29.160 --> 35:30.160
Naturally.

35:30.160 --> 35:34.160
It's like born funny made you laugh the most.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.160
Kevin McDonald.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.160
Yeah, Kevin.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.160
Open the door!

35:38.160 --> 35:41.160
Open the door!

35:41.160 --> 35:46.160
Who is the least funny?

35:46.160 --> 35:49.160
Who didn't have a funny bone in their whole body?

35:49.160 --> 35:52.160
That's varied over the years.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.160
I'm kidding, of course.

35:55.160 --> 36:01.160
I had a good time drinking with McKinney.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.160
I had met Scott.

36:04.160 --> 36:09.160
Collecting my kids in the hall encounters like a Voltron.

36:09.160 --> 36:12.160
I've actually never met Bruce.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.160
No.

36:13.160 --> 36:16.160
Either of I.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.160
But I finally met McKinney fairly recently.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.160
Recently?

36:20.160 --> 36:25.160
We were posing a fun horror movie together and we hung out at Tribeca.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.160
He was a real fun guy to hang out with.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.160
That's good.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.160
Did you guys ever, and you can say no comment and let's move on,

36:34.160 --> 36:45.160
but I'm curious, did you guys ever have actual, were there incidents that were dramatic,

36:45.160 --> 36:49.160
falling outs or anything, or was it more kind of like...

36:49.160 --> 36:55.160
We had a falling out that lasted 35 years.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.160
We always fought.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.160
Was it passive aggressive or was it...

36:59.160 --> 37:00.160
No, it was a lot of yelling.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
It was Scott.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.160
There was a lot of breaking furniture.

37:04.160 --> 37:09.160
It was vicious right from the very start of it.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.160
Who was your first ally?

37:10.160 --> 37:11.160
Was it you and Kevin?

37:11.160 --> 37:12.160
Yeah.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.160
Kevin and I were in a group with a guy named Lucie Casemiri.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.160
The three of us never fought.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.160
We were always very nice to each other.

37:18.160 --> 37:26.160
Then we joined up with Mark and Bruce and some other guys, Frank van Kieken, Gary Campbell.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.160
Yeah, I think that's it, those guys.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
They were horrible.

37:30.160 --> 37:34.160
They were just the worst human beings I'd ever met.

37:34.160 --> 37:39.160
Because you were used to being with people that you trusted and liked and there was no fighting.

37:39.160 --> 37:43.160
And then you found out that it could be political and crap all the time.

37:43.160 --> 37:47.160
Yeah, because we would be supportive of them and they asked each other and they would give notes like,

37:47.160 --> 37:53.160
oh, my problem with that sketch is that you're a piece of shit as a human being.

37:53.160 --> 37:57.160
And that was kind of the level of debate.

37:57.160 --> 38:09.160
I remember our improv troupe, The Dead Ale Wives, we would do things like there was one,

38:09.160 --> 38:14.160
we would have notes sessions after the show, which I was like, oh man, can we not?

38:14.160 --> 38:16.160
It was just like, what are we going to do?

38:16.160 --> 38:20.160
Tell each other I wish you were different on stage.

38:20.160 --> 38:25.160
We weren't professional enough to take notes and get better.

38:25.160 --> 38:31.160
We were just guys that were trained in short form that wanted to say fucking go longer.

38:31.160 --> 38:34.160
It was just the notes thing.

38:34.160 --> 38:37.160
It was mean.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.160
Who was the main note giver?

38:39.160 --> 38:43.160
Because there's not only one person that wants to be the person that wants to settle some hatch up.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.160
It totally varied.

38:44.160 --> 38:51.160
And there would be in the few short years where we were all together, there were sort of rotating alliances,

38:51.160 --> 39:00.160
like somebody's got a beef with someone else and they're kind of expressing that through giving them more notes after the show.

39:00.160 --> 39:06.160
It's coming out on stage that this person thinks that that person's not funny,

39:06.160 --> 39:11.160
or this person thinks that that person is selfish and mean on stage or whatever,

39:11.160 --> 39:14.160
and it's getting expressed in different ways.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.160
It's like trying to hold a family together.

39:16.160 --> 39:23.160
Because you're together in this supposedly high stakes thing.

39:23.160 --> 39:31.160
I'm imagining and trying to imagine your situation because we were in Milwaukee and had no chance of being,

39:31.160 --> 39:37.160
but the stakes were that high for us that they were, that was our thing and that was our family and that was our life.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.160
So I can't imagine.

39:38.160 --> 39:44.160
You got to say that Bruce and Mark moved from Calgary to Toronto to make it,

39:44.160 --> 39:51.160
which shows how dumb they are.

39:51.160 --> 39:56.160
And we did, I think it was, we used to fight, even before we had, when we were just doing our club shows,

39:56.160 --> 39:59.160
we used to fight so much that there'd be like rumors going all around town,

39:59.160 --> 40:01.160
oh, there won't be a show this week.

40:01.160 --> 40:05.160
No, there's no way they could get on stage together after the things they said to each other.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.160
Was that from very early on?

40:07.160 --> 40:10.160
Like from the get go, you guys were already at each other's threshold.

40:10.160 --> 40:14.160
But for us, it was like we would fight like dogs all the way up until the show time.

40:14.160 --> 40:17.160
And then once we got on stage, we loved each other again.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.160
And we would have a great time doing the show.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.160
Because the show is the show and that's why you were there.

40:22.160 --> 40:26.160
Yeah, and then after the show, by the end of the show, we'd usually be drunk.

40:26.160 --> 40:31.160
And we'd just hang out all night and have a great time.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.160
So it was the lead up that was the problem?

40:34.160 --> 40:35.160
Yeah, we're great.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.160
Once we're performing, everyone's great.

40:36.160 --> 40:40.160
And actually, everyone gives great notes. Once we've decided what we're doing,

40:40.160 --> 40:42.160
everyone's really good.

40:42.160 --> 40:45.160
But it's the deciding what we're going to do is when we fight.

40:45.160 --> 40:49.160
People have ownership of bits and stuff.

40:49.160 --> 40:53.160
Like I think we should do the chicken drive-thru.

40:53.160 --> 40:57.160
And then someone's like, I hate that sketch, but they don't want to say I hate that sketch.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.160
So they say maybe we've done chicken drive-thru too many times and then it just erupts.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.160
No, kids know how we just say I hate that sketch.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.160
That was our version of diplomacy.

41:05.160 --> 41:10.160
Who claimed that we never did that sketch?

41:10.160 --> 41:11.160
That would be his way.

41:11.160 --> 41:18.160
And Mark had a gift that if it was four to one against Mark, Mark would consider that a draw.

41:18.160 --> 41:26.160
That's very Canadian to me.

41:26.160 --> 41:32.160
Canadians get off too easy with the whole, it stops at just the politeness thing.

41:32.160 --> 41:37.160
It's like the politeness comes with extreme capacity for argumentation.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.160
Like argumentiveness.

41:39.160 --> 41:44.160
It seems like general statements are inherently problematic.

41:44.160 --> 41:49.160
The politeness belies a lot of withholding.

41:49.160 --> 41:52.160
You're suppressing a lot of shit.

41:52.160 --> 41:58.160
It's easy to say I'm sorry, but you really hate everything that's going on.

41:58.160 --> 42:02.160
Again, because we never suppressed anything.

42:02.160 --> 42:08.160
That would have been sweet, a little repression, and it would have been nice.

42:08.160 --> 42:12.160
I remember when I first started doing stuff with people that weren't the kids in the hall,

42:12.160 --> 42:17.160
I was really startled at how fragile everyone was.

42:17.160 --> 42:24.160
Why the fuck is everyone crying?

42:24.160 --> 42:28.160
That's interesting, in general, what was your family like?

42:28.160 --> 42:32.160
Was it functional, dysfunctional?

42:32.160 --> 42:38.160
All of our families were horribly dysfunctional.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.160
Most of us had alcoholic dads.

42:41.160 --> 42:45.160
Most of us came from broken homes that wouldn't quite break.

42:45.160 --> 42:51.160
Parents that would just sort of perforated homes were just dangling.

42:51.160 --> 42:55.160
All of us had alcoholic dads except for McKinney.

42:55.160 --> 43:01.160
His dad was a diplomat, which I guess is worse.

43:01.160 --> 43:12.160
At some point in your life, did therapy or how do you approach your self-care?

43:12.160 --> 43:17.160
I did therapy when I was trying to find a way to end my first marriage.

43:17.160 --> 43:21.160
It worked.

43:21.160 --> 43:26.160
I started out in couples therapy, and then I sort of hung in there for a while.

43:26.160 --> 43:30.160
I did that too, even though my couples therapist was like,

43:30.160 --> 43:34.160
she helped the couple that I was in get married,

43:34.160 --> 43:37.160
and then we got divorced in like eight months,

43:37.160 --> 43:41.160
but I kept going to her, and every once in a while I'll bring it up.

43:41.160 --> 43:47.160
You know, of course, you kind of a failure as a...

43:47.160 --> 43:49.160
You had one job, but...

43:49.160 --> 43:55.160
I went to the schedule therapy, and partway through the therapy,

43:55.160 --> 43:58.160
my wife took off back to Canada with my kids,

43:58.160 --> 44:02.160
and then I just kept going there for a while

44:02.160 --> 44:05.160
because she kept telling me I was nicer than her.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.160
And then eventually she said, you know, you don't have to go anymore.

44:07.160 --> 44:10.160
And then when I got married again, and then my second wife and I were having problems,

44:10.160 --> 44:15.160
I went to the same couples therapist, and we split up.

44:15.160 --> 44:18.160
So it's not very good as a couple.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.160
But the current wife you're happy with, and everything's going...

44:20.160 --> 44:22.160
Well, I'm back together with my second wife.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.160
Oh, right, now things are groovy again, yeah.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.160
Yeah, my second wife is my third wife.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.160
Wow.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.160
After a 10-year gap.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.160
Yeah, that would be a fun, like, Latter-day Matt Damon movie.

44:35.160 --> 44:39.160
Second third wife.

44:39.160 --> 44:41.160
She's...

44:41.160 --> 44:43.160
Yeah, who'll be the wife?

44:43.160 --> 44:45.160
The...

44:45.160 --> 44:48.160
Born to Lose.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.160
Like, Born Identity? I don't know.

44:51.160 --> 44:54.160
Oh, I thought you were trying to make up an actress's name.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.160
Yeah, Born to Lose.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.160
Born to Lose.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.160
Is this roller derby?

45:00.160 --> 45:02.160
Here comes Born to Lose.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.160
Schindiggers taking it in the...

45:04.160 --> 45:08.160
Cratchzilla's got it up on the wall.

45:08.160 --> 45:13.160
What is it?

45:13.160 --> 45:18.160
I just read an article about when to know when to stop going to therapy.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.160
When you're done.

45:20.160 --> 45:24.160
I felt weird opening the article, but then I felt immediately great

45:24.160 --> 45:28.160
because the article and the professionals cited within it

45:28.160 --> 45:31.160
all immediately indicated,

45:31.160 --> 45:35.160
this is going to make you feel weird having this conversation with yourself

45:35.160 --> 45:40.160
or with your... And here's why and here's whatever.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.160
I mean, what's your relationship been with therapy?

45:43.160 --> 45:47.160
It was really literally one day,

45:47.160 --> 45:50.160
we were in the middle of a session, and the therapist said,

45:50.160 --> 45:54.160
you know, you don't have to keep coming.

45:54.160 --> 45:59.160
And I said, oh, well, I didn't want to offend you.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.160
That was her saying that you're good to go?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.160
Yeah, you don't need to be here.

46:04.160 --> 46:06.160
And did you stop?

46:06.160 --> 46:08.160
Yeah, that was the last session.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.160
That's great.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.160
So she's like, yeah, you nailed it.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.160
It's a little sad because I mean, but if you're a therapist,

46:13.160 --> 46:16.160
breathe your salt, you do understand going into the job,

46:16.160 --> 46:18.160
which is something I wouldn't have known.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.160
I'm a little more cynical than that.

46:20.160 --> 46:22.160
I would think that they're just like, they never even confront this idea.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.160
But they're actually like, if they want to be a good therapist,

46:25.160 --> 46:29.160
they're thinking, my job is to make it so this person never has to come see me again.

46:29.160 --> 46:33.160
And it's kind of like a prostitute

46:33.160 --> 46:36.160
in that it's an intimate thing, you know, having this guy.

46:36.160 --> 46:39.160
And also, I found you're not supposed to kiss them on the mouth.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.160
Right.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.160
And they're called mental health workers now.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.160
Yeah, yeah.

46:45.160 --> 46:49.160
Also, a prostitute psychologist can blow your mind.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.160
Yeah.

46:51.160 --> 46:58.160
Yeah, that was a nice grown, grown, grown applause.

46:58.160 --> 47:03.160
Yeah.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.160
Oh, I've got more.

47:05.160 --> 47:08.160
That was problem atop laws.

47:08.160 --> 47:15.160
They were like, hey.

47:15.160 --> 47:18.160
San Fonzi.

47:18.160 --> 47:22.160
Hey.

47:22.160 --> 47:27.160
Yeah, I think the signs are if you

47:27.160 --> 47:32.160
if you have internalized everything so you kind of just hear your therapist's voice in your head a lot

47:32.160 --> 47:35.160
in situations where you're like, oh, this is what she would say about this.

47:35.160 --> 47:39.160
And if you're when you're going into your sessions, you're kind of like starting to make shit up.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.160
Like, like reasons to be there.

47:41.160 --> 47:44.160
Spencer, have you ever gone to therapist?

47:44.160 --> 47:45.160
Oh, yeah.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.160
I love it.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.160
How's that going?

47:47.160 --> 47:51.160
I wish my therapist would be like, you know, you don't have to keep coming.

47:51.160 --> 47:55.160
Spencer's seeing Jeremy Piven as a therapist.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.160
Oh, it's great.

47:56.160 --> 48:01.160
He just wants him to get a haircut and stop playing Gunges and Dragons.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.160
Do you currently go Spencer?

48:03.160 --> 48:04.160
Oh, yeah.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.160
I'm going to go tomorrow.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.160
Oh boy.

48:06.160 --> 48:08.160
What's going on with that?

48:08.160 --> 48:11.160
Tell us something really intimate about your therapy.

48:11.160 --> 48:18.160
I was talking about how the most interesting probably the most valuable thing my therapist

48:18.160 --> 48:20.160
ever said happened at last session.

48:20.160 --> 48:25.160
He's like, you know, you seem to be alone a lot and I was like, thank you.

48:25.160 --> 48:31.600
I'm trying to tell people and it was like there's probably the first time I got what

48:31.600 --> 48:36.160
felt like a genuine valuable insight from him because most of what he's most of the

48:36.160 --> 48:37.160
time I go therapy.

48:37.160 --> 48:41.160
I'm like blah, blah, blah, and he's like, you know, and I'm like, yeah, no, I know

48:41.160 --> 48:44.160
that, and then I'm like blah, blah, blah, blah, and he's like, you know, and I'm like,

48:44.160 --> 48:45.160
that's a stupid observation.

48:45.160 --> 48:49.520
But like this is the first time I was like, hey, that's the kind of thing a therapist

48:49.520 --> 48:54.160
would say when you give them money to talk about shit that you're alone a lot.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.160
Well, just yeah.

48:55.160 --> 48:56.160
I don't know.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.160
Was there a follow-up to that?

48:57.160 --> 48:58.160
No.

48:58.160 --> 48:59.160
I was like, come on.

48:59.160 --> 49:00.160
What the fuck?

49:00.160 --> 49:01.160
That's all.

49:01.160 --> 49:02.560
I've been here so many times.

49:02.560 --> 49:05.240
That's like the one grain of rice you give me.

49:05.240 --> 49:08.080
This is literally, he's as therapeutic as a bully.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.880
He's saying all the same things a bully says.

49:09.880 --> 49:10.880
He's telling you to cut your hair.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.880
No bully has told me I'm alone a lot.

49:12.880 --> 49:13.880
Yeah.

49:13.880 --> 49:14.880
I'd love to hear that.

49:14.880 --> 49:15.880
You don't have any friends.

49:15.880 --> 49:16.880
Cut your hair.

49:16.880 --> 49:17.880
No one says that.

49:17.880 --> 49:18.880
I'd love to hear that.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.880
He only knows you when he's with you.

49:19.880 --> 49:23.320
So you're never alone when you're with like he only knows you not being alone.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.320
You go into that asshole.

49:24.320 --> 49:29.800
Jordan Peterson for their yeah, I've been clean in my room in your room.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Stand up straight.

49:30.800 --> 49:31.800
You know what?

49:31.800 --> 49:32.800
Lobsters do.

49:32.800 --> 49:33.800
Huh?

49:33.800 --> 49:34.800
You know what?

49:34.800 --> 49:35.800
Lobsters do.

49:35.800 --> 49:36.800
What do they do when their friends are in a bucket?

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
They have diamond dominance hierarchies.

49:38.800 --> 49:39.800
Oh, wait.

49:39.800 --> 49:40.800
It was right.

49:40.800 --> 49:41.800
Lobsters have friends.

49:41.800 --> 49:44.320
Lobsters have friends in a bucket.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.320
Yep.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.520
Like you mean like a lobster pot.

49:46.520 --> 49:47.520
They're trapped.

49:47.520 --> 49:51.000
They're going to get no lobster bucket in a not a trap.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.520
It's not a pot.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.520
Is that his plate?

49:53.520 --> 49:54.520
Oh's cave.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.520
Yeah.

49:55.520 --> 50:01.560
Well JP JP has a lot of dominance hierarchy stuff as well as like it's all just a bucket

50:01.560 --> 50:03.400
like who cares which lobster is more red.

50:03.400 --> 50:07.120
He's like all all beings have sexism.

50:07.120 --> 50:08.120
Look at lobsters.

50:08.120 --> 50:09.120
Okay.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.120
Perfect example.

50:10.120 --> 50:16.040
And apparently he will claim that the dominance hierarchies are a good thing because the best

50:16.040 --> 50:18.720
always rise to the top in lobsters.

50:18.720 --> 50:19.720
Yeah.

50:19.720 --> 50:23.420
They won't be lucky if you know this.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.880
But Donald Trump's the president.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.380
Yeah yeah.

50:26.380 --> 50:27.380
Yeah.

50:27.380 --> 50:33.500
Jordan you might wanna go back to Canada and shut up.

50:33.500 --> 50:34.500
Yeah.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.420
It's good stuff.

50:35.420 --> 50:42.700
JP JP would you die for me as I know that so Zazos that calm I just listen to Jesus

50:42.700 --> 50:46.620
Christ superstar while I was cleaning my video lab.

50:46.620 --> 50:49.240
I met not nearly Ted Healy Ted Nealy.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.900
Oh, Ted Neely, I was like, he met Ted Healy.

50:50.900 --> 50:53.580
I meant, you know, why would I bring that up?

50:53.580 --> 50:54.420
How old are you?

50:54.420 --> 50:55.440
Yeah.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.780
What's your video?

50:56.780 --> 50:57.620
Who's Ted Neely?

50:57.620 --> 50:58.900
He was Jesus.

50:58.900 --> 51:00.820
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

51:00.820 --> 51:02.020
He was Jesus.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.660
Jesus Christ.

51:04.660 --> 51:06.020
Stop seeing your therapist.

51:06.020 --> 51:06.860
No.

51:06.860 --> 51:08.260
My video lab is.

51:08.260 --> 51:10.380
Yeah, you should get a better video lab.

51:10.380 --> 51:11.980
Yeah, no, I know.

51:11.980 --> 51:16.740
I bought eight GoPros for Sony handcams

51:16.740 --> 51:18.820
and a video switcher.

51:18.820 --> 51:23.860
Two cockle shells and a partition or pear tree.

51:23.860 --> 51:27.020
And I'm figuring out how to do a live broadcast.

51:27.020 --> 51:32.540
And I live broadcast my workouts on Instagram.

51:32.540 --> 51:33.700
And I was pointing.

51:33.700 --> 51:36.940
With eight GoPros, you can do that bullet time effect.

51:36.940 --> 51:40.260
Yeah, 60 frames per second, baby.

51:40.260 --> 51:43.180
But yeah, I've been learning.

51:43.180 --> 51:47.500
Could you mount the other thing inside the pool, like we talked about?

51:47.500 --> 51:49.540
I got my waterproof housing.

51:49.540 --> 51:53.100
Is this like a Chuck Berry story?

51:53.100 --> 51:53.980
Yeah.

51:53.980 --> 51:56.700
It's more like a Denny Thomas story.

51:56.700 --> 51:58.580
Yeah, I got waterproof cameras so that people

51:58.580 --> 52:00.660
can watch me practice my flip turns.

52:00.660 --> 52:03.580
It's a little hobby.

52:03.580 --> 52:04.540
I'm enjoying it.

52:04.540 --> 52:08.020
Do you think that the filming of your workouts

52:08.020 --> 52:09.580
helps you get in better shape?

52:09.580 --> 52:11.620
Is that a motivating factor for you?

52:11.620 --> 52:12.380
Yeah.

52:12.380 --> 52:13.540
I think it's kind of a double-edged sword

52:13.540 --> 52:16.420
because that's something I can both get consumed with

52:16.420 --> 52:19.380
and I could also get bored with it possibly.

52:19.380 --> 52:21.180
But it's sort of like the alternative

52:21.180 --> 52:25.940
is I'm not going to just keep working out just because, like,

52:25.940 --> 52:31.500
oh, it's like, I don't know, I'm playing a semi-self-aware game

52:31.500 --> 52:34.820
with how my brain works by turning my workouts into a thing that

52:34.820 --> 52:37.260
has like a nerdy quotient to it.

52:37.260 --> 52:41.580
But it's kind of a loaded non-gun or an unloaded actual gun

52:41.580 --> 52:45.660
of or a double-edged gun sword that

52:45.660 --> 52:49.940
shoots little hilt bullets that themselves have no edge

52:49.940 --> 52:57.180
but are explosive in that, like, yeah, historically,

52:57.180 --> 52:59.660
I will challenge myself with things that I'm bad at

52:59.660 --> 53:03.100
and then I'll learn the fuck out of them

53:03.100 --> 53:05.860
for the dopamine spike of conquering this thing

53:05.860 --> 53:08.620
and then I'll just get aggressively bored

53:08.620 --> 53:10.020
and just walk away.

53:10.020 --> 53:13.740
I just opened up, like, Logic Pro today.

53:13.740 --> 53:16.140
And I was like, I had forgotten every single thing

53:16.140 --> 53:18.540
that I learned about how to make a little song.

53:18.540 --> 53:21.500
Like, I don't know, I don't remember all the hot keys.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.860
It's like, why did I spend all that time learning?

53:23.860 --> 53:25.780
Have you got the dive?

53:25.780 --> 53:28.140
Good yet, because you were doing the floppy legs thing.

53:28.140 --> 53:30.300
Have you got the dive ripped, like, are you?

53:30.300 --> 53:32.580
I like to think I'm keeping my legs a little straighter.

53:32.580 --> 53:34.180
I had some floppy legs on my dives.

53:34.180 --> 53:35.420
Oh, I guess so, yeah.

53:35.420 --> 53:37.860
You know what I started doing, Dave?

53:37.860 --> 53:40.060
Is I took off my nose clip.

53:40.060 --> 53:42.700
Oh, that's a big workout.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.020
And on the flips, that's a big voice.

53:44.020 --> 53:44.860
Then do you get water up?

53:44.860 --> 53:45.700
Do you have to breathe out?

53:45.700 --> 53:46.540
I can't do the flips yet.

53:46.540 --> 53:49.300
That's like wasabi in the nose when I flip.

53:49.300 --> 53:51.220
Because you've got to breathe out, I guess, or something?

53:51.220 --> 53:54.020
Yeah, you've got to get to the end, like, so, yeah.

53:54.020 --> 53:56.580
Yeah, you exhale when you're going upside down.

53:56.580 --> 53:57.420
Oh, really?

53:57.420 --> 53:59.420
Yeah.

53:59.420 --> 54:01.340
I should try that.

54:01.340 --> 54:04.860
There's no air in my lungs, brother.

54:04.860 --> 54:06.620
I've just swam a whole pool length.

54:06.620 --> 54:10.060
I'm like, coach also wants you to work on those floppy legs.

54:13.940 --> 54:19.220
Anywho, were you ever in a comedy troupe, Spencer?

54:19.220 --> 54:19.860
Oh, yeah.

54:19.860 --> 54:22.660
I was on this podcast called Harmontown.

54:25.780 --> 54:27.260
Oh, I guess they've heard of it.

54:27.260 --> 54:30.420
I heard it died after 17 years.

54:30.420 --> 54:31.700
Yeah.

54:31.700 --> 54:34.500
A lot of fighting, a lot of notes.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.900
Yeah, what people don't know is after every Harmontown,

54:36.900 --> 54:39.420
we go back into the green room and really fucking

54:39.420 --> 54:44.820
get into it, about the minutiae of every joke

54:44.820 --> 54:48.300
is under a microscope.

54:48.300 --> 54:49.460
It's all punch up, though.

54:49.460 --> 54:50.100
It's good.

54:50.100 --> 54:51.300
Right.

54:51.300 --> 54:53.340
Makes it better.

54:53.340 --> 54:55.140
Yeah, like, look how good the show is.

54:55.140 --> 54:57.780
How many shows do we have left?

54:57.780 --> 55:00.220
What's the shot clock on right now?

55:00.220 --> 55:02.140
What's today?

55:02.140 --> 55:03.180
Seven?

55:03.180 --> 55:04.340
It's Monday.

55:04.340 --> 55:06.380
We've got maybe eight shows left.

55:06.380 --> 55:09.540
All right, I can only do eight of them.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.220
Hell, yeah.

55:13.820 --> 55:15.300
That's all I've made record.

55:15.300 --> 55:17.100
Did you ever play in D&D, Dave?

55:17.100 --> 55:19.940
I've never played D&D.

55:19.940 --> 55:23.060
You want to try and be a little like a guest character

55:23.060 --> 55:24.620
and a little role-playing?

55:24.620 --> 55:33.220
Sure, because, you know, because D&D and video games

55:33.220 --> 55:36.940
both kind of broke when I was a kid,

55:36.940 --> 55:39.140
just after I started having sex.

55:39.140 --> 55:40.700
Right.

55:40.700 --> 55:41.260
That's a bad timing.

55:41.260 --> 55:43.740
And there was just no turning back from there.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.860
Do you think there was a correlation there that you

55:46.860 --> 55:50.420
created D&D and video games by fucking people?

55:50.420 --> 55:51.780
Other people would say, hey, have you

55:51.780 --> 55:52.660
heard about this D&D?

55:52.660 --> 55:55.380
I said, I'd love to hear about it, but I'm fucking right now.

55:57.940 --> 55:59.060
Well, what about some video games?

55:59.060 --> 55:59.980
Same deal.

55:59.980 --> 56:03.180
I got some fucking to do when I'm done.

56:03.180 --> 56:04.300
Maybe we can talk about it.

56:04.300 --> 56:05.660
So what year are we talking?

56:05.660 --> 56:06.660
Early 80s?

56:06.660 --> 56:08.980
This is late 70s, I guess, early 70s.

56:08.980 --> 56:12.740
Well, I guess, no, I lasted my virginity in 1980, I guess.

56:12.740 --> 56:15.180
So you were hitting that early hip-hop pussy.

56:15.180 --> 56:16.300
Yeah.

56:16.300 --> 56:17.020
Oh, yeah.

56:17.020 --> 56:21.900
That Sugar Hill gang rapping about peas and carrots.

56:21.900 --> 56:22.820
Yeah, look at me.

56:22.820 --> 56:25.820
He was fucking to Melly Mel.

56:25.820 --> 56:26.820
Yeah.

56:26.820 --> 56:29.860
See, nobody laughs because that's too fucking deep a track.

56:29.860 --> 56:34.660
Yeah, I was fucking to Pink Floyd's The Wall, which

56:34.660 --> 56:38.300
is really quite a, if you can stay erect during anything

56:38.300 --> 56:40.100
by Roger Waters.

56:40.100 --> 56:43.940
If your lover can stay in a relationship

56:43.940 --> 56:46.380
with a guy who's playing Pink Floyd because that's all

56:46.380 --> 56:48.580
his songs are about his mommy letting him down

56:48.580 --> 56:50.420
after his daddy died, did they?

56:50.420 --> 56:50.920
Yeah.

56:50.920 --> 56:53.140
Has anybody achieved orgasm during Pink Floyd,

56:53.140 --> 56:53.900
or is that in person?

56:53.900 --> 56:55.180
Only Roger Waters.

56:55.180 --> 56:57.300
Only Roger Waters.

56:57.300 --> 56:58.660
Today, talk about this little asterisk

56:58.660 --> 57:00.660
because I had written this down as a note,

57:00.660 --> 57:03.060
but I'm usually blackout drunk by the middle of the show.

57:03.060 --> 57:04.860
But did I mention the thing?

57:04.860 --> 57:08.300
I was like, did you think Pink Floyd had a manager?

57:08.300 --> 57:10.900
And so many Pink Floyd songs have a cigar,

57:10.900 --> 57:12.740
but it's just a theme in Pink Floyd songs

57:12.740 --> 57:15.140
where they go meta and talk about how shitty the record

57:15.140 --> 57:16.980
business is and show biz and all this stuff.

57:16.980 --> 57:20.060
Do you think they had a really nice manager who's like, guys.

57:20.060 --> 57:20.560
Yeah.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.060
Yeah.

57:22.060 --> 57:24.060
Yeah.

57:24.060 --> 57:26.700
I thought we got along, and they're like, no, it's a character.

57:26.700 --> 57:27.380
It's a thing.

57:27.380 --> 57:33.500
Well, you're perpetuating a stereotype about my vocation.

57:33.500 --> 57:37.020
Are you not happy with the hotel?

57:37.020 --> 57:39.220
Do you think that I'm only interested in money?

57:39.220 --> 57:41.020
I care about you.

57:41.020 --> 57:43.740
I like that the job pays.

57:43.740 --> 57:45.300
I'm pretty transparent about it.

57:45.300 --> 57:47.180
I hear this latest single, and I'm like,

57:47.180 --> 57:51.220
is that an impression of me?

57:51.220 --> 57:52.740
You wanted to do a concert in Pompeii.

57:52.740 --> 57:55.140
I said, OK.

57:55.140 --> 57:59.220
I finished my pudding.

57:59.220 --> 58:01.540
Why am I one of these characters coming out

58:01.540 --> 58:04.300
and putting your soul on trial with your mom

58:04.300 --> 58:06.060
and your English professor?

58:06.060 --> 58:06.780
That's crazy.

58:06.780 --> 58:07.620
Come on.

58:07.620 --> 58:09.980
I never shot you up with heroin.

58:09.980 --> 58:12.420
Turned you into a Nazi with shaved eyebrows?

58:12.420 --> 58:15.220
I didn't do that.

58:15.220 --> 58:15.980
I went.

58:15.980 --> 58:17.860
Well, just Pink Floyd references.

58:17.860 --> 58:23.420
I don't know a whole lot of Pink Floyd.

58:23.420 --> 58:25.900
I'm pretty proud that by 1981, I realized

58:25.900 --> 58:28.500
that the wall was shit.

58:28.500 --> 58:29.540
I think that was pretty fast.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.460
I think that was pretty fast off the mark.

58:31.460 --> 58:33.220
I would never go that far.

58:33.220 --> 58:37.260
I'm afraid we'll never reach that apotheosis.

58:37.260 --> 58:38.980
I'm 46, and I'll make it.

58:38.980 --> 58:41.740
Oh, it's a terrible album.

58:41.740 --> 58:43.820
Well, if you take out all the Roger Watersongs,

58:43.820 --> 58:46.060
it's not bad.

58:46.060 --> 58:47.180
Come on.

58:47.180 --> 58:48.020
Wow.

58:48.020 --> 58:51.260
Canadian Shots, Fires, Townia.

58:51.260 --> 58:52.500
I love it.

58:52.500 --> 58:59.100
I never, I won't bother to like, because I

58:59.100 --> 59:01.940
feel like my taste in music is so unqualified and bad

59:01.940 --> 59:08.100
that I'm afraid of the glasshouse of ever saying.

59:08.100 --> 59:10.540
I'll be like, this Katy Perry song is fine.

59:10.540 --> 59:14.580
I'm afraid if I step on the slightest footstool of snobbery,

59:14.580 --> 59:17.940
I'll immediately do a triple flip and break my neck,

59:17.940 --> 59:19.780
because people will be like, what do you listen to?

59:19.780 --> 59:22.260
And I'll be like, eh, don't look at those underwear.

59:22.260 --> 59:24.180
Like, I don't know.

59:24.180 --> 59:26.180
Brian Posein came up to me and said, hey,

59:26.180 --> 59:28.820
I heard you have a bit where you can talk anybody out

59:28.820 --> 59:31.700
of their love of Rush.

59:31.700 --> 59:33.340
And he goes, I fucking love Rush.

59:33.340 --> 59:36.700
You go, I can't talk Brian Posein out of Loving Rush.

59:36.700 --> 59:39.020
I could talk anybody else out of Loving Rush,

59:39.020 --> 59:41.980
because Brian Posein loves his Rush, but wow.

59:41.980 --> 59:43.860
I'll set you up with Alex Lifeson sometime.

59:43.860 --> 59:44.860
With who?

59:44.860 --> 59:46.140
The guitar player from Rush.

59:46.140 --> 59:47.300
Oh, really?

59:47.300 --> 59:50.660
See, I hate you for even knowing that.

59:50.660 --> 59:52.780
I remember being in the car with you and Jack Black,

59:52.780 --> 59:54.420
and then some Led Zeppelin came up.

59:54.420 --> 59:56.140
And you're like, Led Zeppelin sucks.

59:56.140 --> 59:57.740
And you talk for like two minutes.

59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.300
And then Jack Black was like, nah.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.980
And it was so unmistakable.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.820
You're just like, all right, well, that's fine.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820
You know, that's all.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.380
Yeah, but like, because it's like an open.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.300
I have no leg to stand on.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.340
Like, I have no credentials, because I know and like sticks

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.460
more than the Pink Floyd.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.260
And they're a worst band.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.580
Yeah, they are a worst band, no matter what the other band

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.580
you're talking about is.

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.080
It is.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.620
Well, if sticks and Pink Floyd are bad, then what's good?

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.340
Right.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.380
Katy Perry?

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.540
I got to go see sticks with people.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540
I saw sticks live.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.020
Yeah, are they Canadian?

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.300
No.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:41.940
No, no.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.180
I saw them on the Crystal Ball tour.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.060
Where are sticks from?

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:45.940
America.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.900
They're yours.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.780
I got invited by Diva Zappa to go see them at the Greek.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:58.380
And they opened for Yes, who I truly hate.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.460
They're the worst of Prague.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.940
I would rather suck Geddy Lee's balls

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:06.780
than go to a Yes concert.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.900
And we were backstage, and I asked Tommy, what's his name?

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.460
Tommy Shaw, who took over from the other guy that

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.700
used to be the lead singer.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.700
And I go, Yes is on, like you don't want to go watch him?

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.780
And he goes, no, I've seen him.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.060
Yeah, fuck yes.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.660
Yeah.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.420
I don't have an intent to think of a band that I like hate.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.220
What's that song?

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.220
Like, nope, nope, nope.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.180
No, no, that's sticks.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.340
What's the fucking word?

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.380
Roundabout.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.620
OK, Roundabout is a Yes song.

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.860
I don't really feel that way about like, like, like, like.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.460
I was running a game.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.660
Like, there's bands and singers that I recognize are good,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.220
because again, I have no confidence in my own taste.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.020
But I hate them the way I hate Apocalypse Now and stuff

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.820
like that, where I like, I resent the idea

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.300
that I'm not allowed to, to not be in love with them.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.020
Like Elvis Costello, I have, I don't, I don't, I don't.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.780
Hold on.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.140
I don't hate Elvis Costello, but I,

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.180
I hate the phenomenon of not being allowed

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180
to hate Elvis Costello.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.300
I like a couple of Elvis Costello songs.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.940
I know, Dave, you love Elvis Costello.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.660
But here's where the Elvis Costello,

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:14.180
I heard quote saying that called Led Zeppelin,

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.660
I believe he called them egregious charlatans.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.060
Wow.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:18.580
Yeah.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.100
I just, he, he pushes through his nose too much.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100
It's so nasal.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:28.100
Like, I, like, like, it's so fucking nasal.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:28.500
I can't.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.380
Well, I guess goodbye Bob Dylan too.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.700
I fucking, I fucking hate Bob Dylan.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.260
Bob Dylan is a fucking fraud and a fucking plagiarist

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.380
to fuck Bob Dylan.

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:37.900
Yeah.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.820
Damn it.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.900
I mean, who, give me sticks any day.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.940
Yeah.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.820
Sticks, first concert I ever bought a joint at was at Sticks.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.500
Uh-huh.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.900
I, first time I ever bought drugs at a concert was at Sticks

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.900
when I was like 16.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.300
Good for you, good for you.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:54.660
Yeah.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.740
What kind of drugs was it?

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.140
I bought weed.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.260
I bought some, I bought some rolled joints.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:02:59.980
Classic.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.540
From a dude behind me.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.020
Said, hey dude, you got some extra joints you can sell.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.300
Was that dude a robot?

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.580
And did you say Domo Arigato to him?

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.340
Sticks doesn't sing that in concert anymore

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.220
because they're ashamed of that song.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.340
They actually don't, they don't do fucking Roboto.

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.140
Fuck Sticks.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.820
What's Japanese for, no thank you.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.660
No Domo Arigato.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.260
No Mo Arigato.

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.420
No Mo.

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.820
No.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.580
That's good.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.500
Yeah, see here's the thing, like I don't, like the Dao De Jing

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.020
says when you, if some things become beautiful,

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.780
other things become ugly, like when you're talking about music,

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.820
like if some, if there's such a thing as a shitty band,

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.700
you know this music sucks, then like, I like Phil Collins,

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.900
but I recognize probably along with Phil Collins that like,

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:47.860
you know, 85% of his stuff is like Styrofoam

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.540
and who knows about the last 15%, but like that he's prolific.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.340
He just like, he, and he wouldn't be able to be

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.900
if he listened to these thoughts that you're giving voice to

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.940
when you talk about music.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.460
I was just saying, we drove by Ellis Island,

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:04.780
we must have talked about in the show,

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.220
but Dan sang Susu Studio and took his shirt off

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:13.060
during the song, security came in,

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.260
then Las Vegas PD came in, and we had to,

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.220
Yeah, it was a whole thing.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.980
Dan had to change his clothes like,

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.580
like Sylvester Stallone and Victory,

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.460
where he had to sneak him out of the fucking arena and-

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.620
Which aren't you allowed to do?

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.700
Take your shirt off or sing Susu Studio?

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.940
The shirt off, which I was so surprised by

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.140
until I really thought about it.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.660
Because you're being goaded on by the woman that ran the bar,

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.860
like the bartender, she was like, like hyping you up kind of, right?

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.260
Did she work there? There was an older woman,

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.780
she had a cigarette dangling from her mouth.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.900
There were two racist women,

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:53.260
there was a mother and daughter team who were virulently racist,

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.300
who were talking shit about this very handsome black guy

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.900
who was wearing a nice suit,

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.460
and they were saying awful, awful racist stuff,

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.260
but clearly the mother wanted to fuck the black guy.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.380
And then some college kids came in and sat on the front table,

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.620
and it was me, you, Nick Vanne, Sam Simon of Simpsons fame,

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.420
Schrab was there, a couple of the people,

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.780
and then Dan got up and started singing Susu Studio.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.180
And he was being kind of peppered on by, I think,

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.580
either the bartender or the karaoke...

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.860
It was a fairly empty place,

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.220
and then there was like one kind of senior woman

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.580
who had this kind of charisma to her,

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.660
because she was like into it,

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.420
and so she came up to the foot of the stage

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.260
and was like kind of dancing to me doing Susu Studio,

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.860
and she was encouraging me, and I was playing to her,

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.260
and then she said, like, take it off or something like that.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.700
So Dan started kind of sexually slowly, like...

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.660
So being a long-form improviser.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.180
Yeah.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.460
Started taking his shirt off, and now the crowd has gone...

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.300
Lock, yeah.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.580
The crowd has gone potty, now it's fucking hype.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.020
Then the security guard comes in, and he goes,

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.620
Hey, you can't...

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.780
Yeah, well, I was taking my pants off as well.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.100
Yeah, well, there.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.980
Dan got completely shirtless,

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.980
and now the eight college kids, the two racist ladies,

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.420
the black guy, everybody was freaking out,

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.900
and it was really good.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.660
And then two security guards come in wearing yellow shirts,

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.020
and they had like mace...

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.020
I feel like, and the hand was over the mace.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.020
On a taser?

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.820
Yeah, they came out, not weapons drawn,

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.140
but weapons at the ready.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.500
And here was my mistake,

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.340
and I know I've told the story of this podcast before,

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.820
but you might as well finish it.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.500
Here was my mistake, Dave Foley.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.500
All right.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.420
The security came in, and as soon as they said,

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.460
like, you can't do that, you can't take our clothes off in here.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.980
And I was like, as soon as they said that,

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.420
I was mortified, I was like, oh, okay,

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.020
I didn't, I started putting my clothes back on.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.740
And then I misguided, like,

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.940
I thought I would do a bit that...

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.580
In this mistaken world where I live in,

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.180
where everyone shares my entire vocabulary of references,

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.580
I thought I would do an impression of Bono

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.340
in the YouTube video,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:05.020
where they're getting shut down by the police on the rooftop.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.620
And I thought the security guards would have a laugh,

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.980
and everyone would laugh, because I was like,

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.820
it looks like they're trying to shut us down.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.540
But no one got the reference.

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.820
They thought I was being completely sincere.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.060
But that was the tipping point that everything was.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.540
They were like, let them dance!

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.820
Just let them dance!

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:30.620
And in this Christmas tree of bad decision-making,

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.700
the security guards take that to heart

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.660
and start engaging with the hecklers,

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.940
and going like, hey, I don't tell you how to do your job,

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.060
and then the people are like, what job, you fucking pig?

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.580
But the woman, the elderly racist woman

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.820
that was trying to fuck the black guy,

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.580
even though she kept dropping horrible epithets

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.220
at him whenever he walked away,

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.780
she spit on one of the security guards.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.460
And that's when things went fucking hell.

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:58.900
That's it, and they start clearing out the entire fucking bar.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.900
Six LVPD, like proper policemen,

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.860
came barging in and out.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.740
These people have guns.

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.820
While all this is happening, I'm on the karaoke stage,

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.980
which is ironically now in the background.

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:22.740
And an incredibly, impressively strategic Rob Schrab

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.980
in this shining moment.

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:27.260
I just feel this hand grab my wrist,

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.060
and he just goes like, come on.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.340
And he just pulled me over to the giant booth,

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.140
and they took Schrab's hat and jacket and put it on me.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.860
Changing clothes, like if you've ever seen the movie

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:44.140
Victory with Michael Cain and Sylvester Stallone in Pele,

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.900
they changed clothes.

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.540
And Rob put his beanie on, we have to get you out of here,

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.340
but you can't be wearing the same clothes

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340
that you were wearing.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.620
And Sam Simon was there.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:57.220
And now that the college kids, the woman

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.380
spit on a police, on a security officer,

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.220
then the police came.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.300
Now the kids were like, hey, let them sing.

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.180
And they came to your rescue.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.980
These, like, fratty kind of sorority.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.740
Everybody was, yeah, it was a class war.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.180
And so now we're hiding in the background.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.780
And now there's a melee.

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.020
Like, shit went wild.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.620
And we've sneaked out the back.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.300
And now we walk out, and there's loads of cop cars outside.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.900
And we're slithering down the side of the building at Ellis Island.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.780
People were being cuffed on hoods,

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.420
because they cleared the bar out.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.100
Everyone's like, look at that, just have a fucking good time.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.420
Why is that against the law?

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.260
Everyone had completely forgotten.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.580
And the woman that spit on the cop

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.380
was like, you can't kick me out of here.

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.980
Like, oh, no, no, the daughter goes, you can't throw her out.

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.020
She's my mother.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.020
And he goes, you're out of here, too.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.980
And then the fucking fratty's got in there,

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.220
and the sorority has got in there.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.900
And then it was fucking chaos.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.660
And we used that distraction to get out of there.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.220
And the black guy in the suit's like,

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.500
I thought I was already paying the price for this relationship.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.700
So we're leaving Ellis Island, which is a terrible,

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.500
terrible casino.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.860
But they have karaoke every night.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.900
And they'll be like, there's like an Asian Elvis

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.300
and a black Elvis and a fat Elvis and a wheelchair.

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.180
But they don't even know Elvis songs.

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.860
They just know how to dress up like Elvis.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.180
They don't even know Elvis was a guy.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.860
They just think that that's how you dress when

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.860
you're successful in Las Vegas.

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:19.620
So we're leaving.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.060
And Sam Simon, our dearly departed friend who,

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.980
you know, like, awesomely made Simpsons a thing.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:26.900
We're leaving.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.020
And there's police everywhere.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.820
And the college kids are being thrown over the hood

01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.140
and being cuffed.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.580
Like, we're staying here at the best Western or whatever

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.540
the fucking shit hotel is there.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.340
And they're like, no, you're going to jail.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.940
And Sam Simon goes, yeah, but what about the guy

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.740
that took his shirt off during Phil Collins?

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.980
Shouldn't we be looking for him?

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.540
And we had to walk like a half a mile

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.140
to go to the fucking like some other hotel that used

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.180
to be the maximum now is like the Western suites.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.500
We had to walk a mile to go get a cab

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.980
because we couldn't get one there.

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.540
And it was, yeah, it's good karaoke.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.540
Yeah.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.420
Yeah.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.460
That's probably the third time in eight years.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.100
Like, we told the story here on the show.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.900
Into the record.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.620
But like, you know, I always wondered

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.060
how the Vegas riots started.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:26.100
But of all songs to start some inflammatory awful shit,

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.140
Sue Sudio is the most anodyne like fucking nonsense.

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.900
But the reason why that all kicked off

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.340
is because you were nailing it.

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.260
You were so good at it that people were encouraging you

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.260
to be nude.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:46.980
Well, one person said take it off.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.180
It was so good.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.260
When I was like 35, whatever I was,

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.420
it was funnier to me in my underwear.

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.260
It was funnier.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.900
Now I think it's like a little creepy problem.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.460
I took my clothes off at the Traverse City Comedy Festival.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:03.660
And nothing happened.

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.700
There was no incident?

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.500
No, it was fine.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.020
No, people just had a good time.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.100
Fully, full naked?

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:10.660
Oh, yeah.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.420
Yeah, cock out.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:11.920
Yeah.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.700
So did you cover it?

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.020
Did you like, cup your hands over it?

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:20.660
No, no, no.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.020
That was the whole point.

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.620
There was someone in the audience who just

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.260
had to take it off, and everyone started cheering.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.340
And I went, all right, fuck it.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.420
I was still drinking in those days.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.300
What's it like down there?

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.020
What's the deal?

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.580
Be honest in your objective appraisal.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.620
Be graphic and honest about your genitals.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:47.100
Because I've heard that your penis is shaped exactly

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:52.500
like an ampersand.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.980
I'm trying to think the best way.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:05.460
I'm fluctuating between adorable and beneficent.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.100
That's the sweet spot.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:07.860
Yeah.

01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.780
My penis looks like a third nipple

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.060
perched on top of two pendulous tumors.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.100
Because Dan has enormous balls.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:24.660
You have conspicuous balls.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.100
Or they may look enormous because, as Ryan Ridley has said,

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.860
it's like a bus park next to the UPCON Center.

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.380
I'm not saying even by contrast.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.700
I'm saying you have a small dick,

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.460
but your balls are needlessly large.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.380
There's no.

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:42.860
I know.

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.140
It's like, what's the deal?

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.300
What are you going to do with them?

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.180
Exactly.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.020
We discussed with Heather Anne Campbell.

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.380
I've never dropped what I would call a load.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.940
I'll emit a desperate, dime-sized.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.820
But your balls are like the size of like if you bifurcated

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.300
a cantaloupe and made two balls out of it.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.260
It looks like a cantaloupe, but with a cleft.

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.980
You have giant, giant, giant testicle.

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.780
Yeah.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:26.260
Picture Garfield the cat, his eyes,

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.020
and then a little dick in between them.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.580
Like Garfield's nose, but on top.

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.580
If Garfield's nose was on top of his eyes.

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.860
Or if Garfield's just upside down.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:40.180
Just picture two big balls and a little dick.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.700
You could probably do that.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.940
You would think, though, that you would have dropped

01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.060
larger loads without it.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.140
Yeah, you know, you'd think I would cum like buckets

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.700
and be like, that's how you make up for it.

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.460
Ugh, my auto from the Simpsons.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.620
Whose response would that be?

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.220
His dick was little, but oh, so much cum.

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.780
Well, ostensibly.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.580
So much.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.900
I guess God, whatever maniac is behind all these decisions,

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.340
it's just like, well, I want to find out.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.700
How do you know you're going to play with these attributes?

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.140
Ladies love a good drenching.

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:20.340
From a little dick troll.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.260
There's certainly a market for tiny dick and too much cum.

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.740
I have a penis that usually gets this response.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.940
Oh, so much better than I was expecting.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.540
I thought I was going to have to be polite,

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.020
because you don't expect much from me.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.700
Because you're beneficent.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.220
Yeah.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.180
Yeah, you're like a pope.

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.420
Yeah, that's the thing.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.980
I'm so not sexy in general that it's a pleasure to press.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:50.220
I have been telling women, like if they've heard my rhetoric

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:56.900
leading to their maiden foolishity, but doir.

01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.060
There's no foreplay like returitions.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.820
They'll be like, oh, I was actually

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.140
anticipating like a micro penis situation,

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.300
like clinically, like small.

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.780
And shout out to my micro penis listeners.

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:16.580
Like, you know, I find it, you know, like, I don't, I mean,

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:22.540
look, I don't like dick size being bandied about as a metric.

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.100
How about this?

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.580
Everyone here with a micro penis stand up.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.860
Get a round of applause.

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.700
You're good people, micro penises.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.740
Only women stood up.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.580
Yeah, because, yeah, all right.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:45.380
Finally, my giant clitoris can be contextualized in a,

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.860
well, we've gone too far, haven't we?

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:49.340
Have we?

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.020
It's that time in the show.

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.100
The thing is now, like, now that we're

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.220
ticking down to the dying days of Harmontown.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:57.700
Yeah.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.020
We're going to have some weird stuff.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.340
Let's not leave anything, any stone unturned.

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.580
This is like the death rattle?

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.900
Yeah, it is.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:11.140
I'm glad you came here for the death rattle, Dave Foley.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.340
Basically, that's my career.

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.420
Dave Foley, can I, one of my favorite things about you,

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.460
because Dave Foley loves coffee.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.260
And are you currently drinking coffee?

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:19.740
I was.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.980
This was full of coffee when I came out here.

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.820
This is the only time I've seen you without coffee.

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.460
Yeah, this is why I ran out.

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.340
And I didn't plan ahead.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.580
What was the thing when you were on news radio

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.940
and you got the inquirer?

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.580
My only time in the National Inquirer.

01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.380
What was the headline?

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:42.620
It said, Dave Foley admits to drinking 50 cups of coffee a day,

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.700
which I wouldn't consider a huge admission.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.460
But it was true.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.420
My favorite is that also Dave has trouble sleeping.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.820
Yeah, I know.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.980
And Greg Proops in the road is like,

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.220
you know that if you drink less coffee, you're like,

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.540
hey, if I wanted to have this shit,

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.580
I could get this to home.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.020
But is there a correlation?

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.860
Were you already insomniac before you drank coffee?

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.380
I've been an insomniac since I was about, like, four years old.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.460
To pre-coffee you were insomniac.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.660
Yeah, I was a worried four-year-old.

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.460
What was your main worry at four years old?

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.260
Global warming.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.100
I had a good time.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:18.860
I was really ahead of you.

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:21.580
Do you have nightmares when you do sleep?

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.620
Insomnia, I feel like people misunderstand it.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.900
Because to me, it sounds like a superpower.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.300
I hate falling asleep.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.700
I'm like, god damn it, I was just getting into this.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.860
I have trouble sleeping at night.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.140
I can sleep in the day easily.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.940
I love sleeping in the day.

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:35.940
I said trouble sleeping at night.

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.060
Yeah, on the van or the tour bus, you can sack right out.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.460
Yeah, I'm good at napping.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.500
You're a good napper.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.060
But at night, I sort of stay up and just.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.260
If you get some Rachel Maddow and some headphones,

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.060
you're good to go.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.060
Yes.

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.740
That's my MSNBC and a cup of coffee.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.100
The day full is ready to go.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.500
Because it's comforting, because I know that I can fall asleep

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.540
during one show, and then the next show

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:57.780
will say the exact same thing.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.580
Right.

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.660
So I don't have to worry about missing anything.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.580
Like, if Chris Hage is taken, then I'll wake up to Maddow's.

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:05.740
Wait, is that the shouting guy?

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.540
Who's the shouting guy?

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.980
Oh, that's Chris Matthews.

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.580
Yeah, he's a little crazy.

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.220
Yeah, I can.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.180
He's just yelling.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.100
Is 50 cups an exaggeration?

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.700
Nope.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.180
But is that now not true, or are you still 50?

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:22.100
Now, I probably, like today, I've probably had 10 espressos.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.180
That seems mathematically.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.540
50 cups seems mathematically impossible.

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.060
But I guess probably none of you get up and you start doing this.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.860
I would have a 10-cup pot of coffee at home before going to work.

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:33.860
So that's 10 right there.

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.740
And then through the day.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.780
The proplety is, I forget their names, because they don't.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.180
It's Jody Mann.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.500
And she would, they kept two thermoses of coffee

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.140
on their prop wagon so that I would stop going to get coffee.

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.020
And they were just pointing, they're the ones who told me.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.700
They said, you've had 50 cups today.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.020
So that's how I found out.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.500
Is that post-drinking, or was it?

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.900
During drinking, yeah.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.140
You mean, was it like after night of drinking?

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.540
Some people get sober, and then their coffee's there for them.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.860
Oh, no, I didn't get sober until like five years ago, Christmas.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.220
So coffee was always a thing, and that was just like a fight.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.780
I knew this would be coffee up until like 10 o'clock.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.220
And then Jody would start bringing me whiskey.

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:20.060
Oh, yeah.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.140
They had, when I did this show with John Larroquette,

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.460
they had a little in the prop fridge.

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.220
There was a secret pitcher, and they

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.660
would go, we're going to tell a couple people about this.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.780
And they had a cocktail of the week.

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.980
And so they'd be like, Cosmopolitan's in a pitcher,

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.940
and they would just give you a little styrofoam cup,

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.940
and that was your secret cocktail.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.660
But that was the same people.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.980
But you just said one day, fuck it.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.380
And you didn't go through programs.

01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.660
You just said, I quit.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.700
Yeah, yeah, just stopped.

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:48.980
Just cold turkeyed it.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.140
Yep.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:55.100
I had the advantage of massive brain trauma.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.860
Oh, that's right.

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.940
You broke your fucking.

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.300
I broke my brain.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:20:59.820
What happened?

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.700
You fell on the ground?

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.980
I fell down at the must downtown, which

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.540
was around the corner from where I lived.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.740
And you were found like just like you were just laying?

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:09.500
I passed out, fell on the patio, and cracked my head.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:14.140
And I hit the patio so hard that my brain gave me a black eye

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.260
from inside my skull.

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:15.760
Wow.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:25.400
Oh, and then I woke up in the ICU with my ex-wife

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.040
and my daughter standing there.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.320
And we were going to go to New York after Christmas.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.880
And it was one of these guys who went, hey, I think

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.840
I'm going to quit drinking.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840
And was there?

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.800
Yeah, it was like, OK, there's rock bottom,

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:45.240
and there's like, is there a positive kind of like when

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.880
you're struggling to overcome it,

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.240
is there like a kind of what's the question I'm trying to ask?

01:21:52.240 --> 01:22:00.080
Like a realization you had that kind of makes you strong

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.200
as opposed to just going, oh, this is fucked up.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.760
And I think I'll quit drinking.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.960
But at the time, I thought, oh, I might not really do it.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.960
Because I thought this might be hard.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:17.400
But the brain injury seemed to actually

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.520
cure me of alcohol.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.680
You might have been one of these privileged people that

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.320
fell down while drunk and injured the part of their brain

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.000
that loves drinking.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.280
Yeah, and that's what happened.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.000
And also like my depression went away, too.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:31.520
What?

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.000
Yeah, I've been dealing with depression most of my life.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.120
You're like alfalfa from the Arging.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.680
A lot of people become serial killers.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.800
Well, yeah, or they suddenly can speak French.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.160
People have had head injuries, and then

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.480
they can play the piano.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.880
Sometimes they turn invisible.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.600
I mean, that's killing in X Island, but.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.720
Yeah, oh, I would have been cool.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.240
Oh, man.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.600
You've got to hit just the right spot.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.400
It's not worth trying.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.800
I'm going to try it again.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.840
It's the part of your brain that makes you invisible,

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.560
or keeps you from being invisible,

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.240
it's nestled right within the part that

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.800
keeps your heart going.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.320
Sometimes I think I'd like to just hit it again

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.880
with a brick or something just so I could start drinking again.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.600
Just have a man who hadn't, and then like, yeah.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.160
Well, because now you know if you get too drunk

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.200
and get this failsafe.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:15.700
Yeah.

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.200
Yeah.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:18.700
Yeah.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.120
I think there was something that my therapist told me

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.640
about drinking that, to me, was if I ever

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.000
should choose to stop, like this would

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.240
be in the forefront of my brain, which is that when you're 12,

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.520
which is when I'm going to make a guess,

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.640
the guys like you and me maybe had our first experiences

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.640
with this liquor, and it's like, oh my god,

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.240
there's this amazing experience, and then your friends

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.680
are like, yeah, that was kind of fun, but now my head hurts,

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.240
and you're like, I'm Peter Pan.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:59.120
And when you're 15, 17, 19, 25, your neurology

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:04.680
keeps growing tree roots around this thing.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.480
And it very, well, at a certain point,

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.000
it can not only start to lose its actual benefits,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.680
its medicinal benefits, but it actually, I mean,

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.920
it can lose them entirely.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.080
It can become just a plain old poison,

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.320
and yet the tree roots of your brain

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.440
have kind of like organized themselves

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.480
in a relationship around the space occupied by this thing,

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.120
which stops giving you the same kind of, you know,

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.040
after a while, it's like, well, I'm 46.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.080
When I get shit-faced drunk, I am no longer

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.320
the hilarious person I was, perhaps.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.680
I might get more depressed.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.280
I might get more blackout.

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.120
I might lose my memory more.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.000
It might become, it's a different thing.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.640
And I think that part of it, when somebody

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.040
talks about quitting drinking, like for me,

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.280
the part of my brain that resists it is like, yeah,

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.640
but drinking's always, you know, like, I don't

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.520
want to make that big change.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.320
But I think that's why it's interesting,

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.360
I thought, for my therapist to point out, like, yeah,

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.160
but the change has already happened.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.640
Like, you're already quitting drinking.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.520
You already quit that relationship

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.520
with that wonderful potion that made you happy.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.880
That relationship is long since over,

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.840
and you're dancing with the coffin of this ex-girlfriend

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.960
that left you a long time ago.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.920
She didn't put it that way.

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.800
I'm very articulate because I'm drunk.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.640
I was going to say your therapist is really poetic.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.120
Dancing with the coffin of your ex-girlfriend.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.040
She probably said, you know, it's like Stewie when

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.000
he did the thing and then my eyes glazed over.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
The thing was, I think when you're drunk,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.240
it becomes a big part of how you define yourself, too.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.840
Like, when you're a drinker, like, for me,

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.880
it was, you know, being a drinker and being a hard drinker

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.560
was a big part of how I, like, how I, you know,

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.440
what I envisioned myself to be.

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.920
And along the way, and I'll say this,

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.000
not to enable anybody listening or anything,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.120
but it's like, but to acknowledge

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.880
part of the reason why we can get stuck in our ways

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.360
is because, whether it's smoking, video games, drinking,

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.840
or anything, what happens is it brings out

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.000
behaviors and attitudes in the people around you.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.440
So it's not only defining you.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.520
It's defining how you relate to other people.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.440
Well, that's like, because there was one other time

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.680
I woke up in a hospital after drinking,

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.080
but that time I didn't quit drinking.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.240
In fact, I woke up and I had an IV in my arm,

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.200
and I sort of took that out and said, where the hell am I?

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.440
And was walking out and the doctor,

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.960
as I was walking out, just said, you know,

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.440
you really have to quit drinking.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.600
And I just announced, first, everyone else

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.440
has to get a lot more interesting.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.440
Yeah, yeah, I mean, that sounds very familiar to me.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.240
But apparently that happened because now

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.200
you don't drink anymore.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.480
Yeah, I always said, I drink to make you,

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.360
all of you, smarter, something hilarious like that.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.200
I was like, yeah, but it's like, there's

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.360
the self-deluded part of that, but then there's also

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.200
the kind of like, as a former smoker of cigarettes,

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.040
it's too easy to just say, oh, I was doing this terrible thing

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.960
by smoking, and then I stopped, and it was a zero-sum game.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.120
It's like, while I was a smoker, there

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.160
were many positive things to say about it,

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.440
and they were all socially-based, because the kinds of people

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.480
who would get on your ass about how you were a smoker,

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.280
that was a red flag for the kind of relationship

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.000
that I didn't want to engage in.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.080
I don't think I was denying myself

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.240
the friendship of people that would have made my life better.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.840
Well, every friendship and relationship I had started drunk.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.640
Every woman I was ever with, it started out drinking.

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.240
And every friendship, I think, started out drinking

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.800
after the age of about 14.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.560
And so it was very beneficial for a long, long time.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.240
What's the world's oldest medicine?

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.120
I mean, it really was a medicine.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.160
And it made me, and I was like, I don't like,

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.840
there's like weed always makes me feel like I'm ugly and stupid.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.520
And then you haven't paid taxes, so you're

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.360
going to have a heart attack.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.840
And drinking always made me feel like I was beautiful and smart.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.760
Always felt very beautiful.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.440
It made your penis beneficent.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.120
Yes.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.200
Beatific.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.320
Beatific.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.560
I love the beatitudes of your balls.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.480
Yes.

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.320
Yeah.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.200
Yeah.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.400
Yeah, and there's a sweet lofty zone in there.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.480
And I think you're always kind of chasing that spot.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.360
And it continues to shrink and become less and less reliable.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.440
And it's like, oh, this euphoria, this medicinal quality.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.800
And as of late, what I've noticed

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.200
is that it's becoming more and more calculatably predictable

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:05.000
that I'll use superfluous adverbs.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.920
Calculatably predictable.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.640
Just say, oh, like a normal person

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.640
if you don't know what you're going to say next.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.640
Excuse me.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:19.440
But that my mood will just take a crash,

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.720
which it feels like something I can observe because of therapy.

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:26.040
Because my therapist, among the many things

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.120
that I like about her, she never forced that hand.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.640
I think she probably senses in me

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:39.200
that this is a tough beast to get around

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.440
and that she would just join many skulls on Golgotha

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.840
if she were to try to engage me about my drinking.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.640
And so she makes sure I know that she's not here to make me quit.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.320
And that way, for that reason, because I can trust her,

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.240
I've had more conversations about drinking in my relationship

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.040
with her than I've ever had in my life

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.120
with a qualified professional who knows all about it.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:08.040
And I forgot the rest of what I was going to say.

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.280
Spencer, you don't drink really.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.200
But didn't you also quit weed?

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.200
Or are you just kind of like ratchet that back?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.200
I'm back, baby.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.680
No, I don't really buy weed or anything,

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.520
but I'll smoke it with other people or whatever.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.320
You don't have to.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.320
Tom Jones doesn't buy panties.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.880
And he's wearing them everywhere.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.960
Were you ever weedy, like Dave?

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.960
I would only smoke weed when I was blind drunk.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.200
And yeah, because otherwise, it would just

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.280
make me really paranoid.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.120
Does it bother you when we're on the road together

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.400
because the rest of the cast of Whose Life

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.440
we're always drinking, doesn't matter to you?

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.040
No, I actually prefer, I don't like being around sober people.

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:54.960
They're horrible.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:58.320
Also, Dave on the road carries around a little speaker,

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.240
and there's always jazz music wherever he goes.

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:01.760
That's cool.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.720
He just carries around, like after the show,

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.680
we're taking pictures of people or signing stuff or whatever.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.560
And Dave just has this awesome affinity of just like,

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.520
it's not like you foisted on people.

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.280
There's just always a beautiful soundtrack happening.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.880
And then when you're not there, it's a bummer

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.400
because we live in abject silence.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.160
One of you could get a speaker.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.760
No, we're too drunk.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.400
Reggie Watts was at the Harmon Quest premiere.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:34.760
He gave me a free sample of the beta test of his cartridge

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.560
that he's developing.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.040
Reggie Watts is trying to develop a weed cartridge.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.680
It's great time for weed babies.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.880
Just as they're about to be banned.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.080
Yeah, I guess that's how it did.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.960
You read the New York Times thing about the bust in Wisconsin?

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.720
The two guys?

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.400
No, no.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.360
I guess they were doing like.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.000
Yeah, I didn't understand this whole vaping thing.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.960
It was like this running gag happening.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.520
Because Cody was a fucking, what are those things called?

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.960
Jules.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.440
She was a jewelhound.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.720
And I'm so glad she got scared off of it,

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.760
whether it was valid or not, because I just

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.320
hated that she was like sucking down nicotine

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.080
because I was a smoker until I was 32.

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.520
And anyways, hey, me, get off my lawn.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:14.520
Good night.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:20.840
But I guess what it is, is that because POTS not

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.520
legalized everywhere and then vape cartridges,

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.000
so they kind of open the window.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.400
So it's like, yeah, and it's like making gin in a bathtub.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:35.440
There's just a lot of invitation for people

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:42.120
like homebrew weed juice, oil, and it's

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.080
like you put anything in there that you think

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.160
gets the job done.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.080
And apparently, something that some people are putting in.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.400
Apparently, vitamin E oil they were using.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.840
Yeah, and is that what makes it long to turn into?

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.360
It was linked, but who knows?

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.080
It seems, though, as Dan was saying,

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.840
it was just more tainted, specific tainted stuff.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.800
That was gray market stuff.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.760
But vitamin E is used in legal stuff.

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.480
I don't know.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.360
But I mean, there's been no studies

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.280
about how safe or unsafe vaping is.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.840
Like, I don't think we've ever done it.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.520
We're in really good one.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.880
I apply vitamin E oil to my lungs topically.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.000
And that's been fine.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:20.520
But it's weird.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.800
They're banning flavored tobacco cartridges, which I'm

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.300
certain.

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:25.800
That's good.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.840
I'm fairly certain they're not linked to any of the anything.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.720
It's like a single case I don't think

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.960
is linked to actual flavored tobacco.

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.080
No, no, that's just linked to we don't

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.880
want our children to die of cancer.

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.560
Sure.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.720
Does it give you cancer?

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.400
Does vapor?

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.760
No, no, the tobacco products that

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.520
are like candy floss flavored, that they're not

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.120
marketing to children, mind you.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.320
Right, but does the vaping itself,

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.880
does that actually lead to cancer?

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.000
Or is it just a fear that they're talking to them on?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.200
They don't really know.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:55.880
They don't know.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.760
They say there's some heavy metals.

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.200
There are some heavy metals in vaping.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:00.700
Right.

01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.200
That's the thing.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.160
There's metal pieces in when you get heated up.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.600
Some of the molecules fly off the surface of the metal.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.800
And that's definitely great.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:16.880
Because I use the CBD vape pens because I'm old, sure.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.360
And I don't want my bones to hurt.

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.200
But I love those.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.880
Those are great for arthritis.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.120
I did a little puff off of a DMT pen, and I like it.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.200
And you saw the dwarves that build time.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:35.440
So I'm pretty sure I hung out with a palm tree

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.720
for about 15 minutes.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.720
Wait, are you serious?

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.720
You did DMT?

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.560
Out of a pen, like a vape pen.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.040
I thought DMT was sort of a free base.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.040
The idea of it coming out of a pen is kind of like a.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.560
I think it's not as strong.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.800
I've never done DMT properly.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.560
But I did it out of a pen.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.120
And there was like a Joshua tree.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.040
And I was like, hey, Betty.

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.840
I was grooved chickens for a while.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.920
And then it was over.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.760
Jeff was grooved chickens.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.960
It only lasts like 15 minutes, right?

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.960
Joe Rogan's a big DMT guy.

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:04.460
Who?

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:04.960
Joe Rogan.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:05.720
Take it enough.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:11.520
He's like an expert on DMT and other psychedelics.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.600
I'm too old to try transformative stuff.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.560
Like, I'm not going to.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.960
Like, I maybe think maybe I would do ayahuasca before I'm 50.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.760
I'd like to do that.

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.260
Yeah.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.840
Like, let's do it on the final Harmontown.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.480
Yeah.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.480
Well, yeah.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.480
I'm in.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:31.520
We can say fully Spencer, Dan, me, Curtis Armstrong,

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.760
and we fucking and we just just to ayahuasca.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.840
All right, because I like that ayahuasca at least

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.120
is kind of like transparent about it.

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.040
They're like, this is probably going to be awful.

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:40.520
Yeah.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.320
You're going to puke in a bucket while you're

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.920
like, don't you barf for a while?

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.160
Don't you have to like go puke for a lot of drugs

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.200
that are poisonous, but but ayahuasca is a poison

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.280
that's drug in us.

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.720
Is anybody here done ayahuasca proper two or three?

01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:58.800
Did you go out of town?

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.080
Or did you like Costa Rica?

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:07.920
Or that's because you wanted to be with the legit shaman.

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.560
Yeah, I didn't.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.480
I did it in Bushwick next to a guy.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.320
Yeah.

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.880
You're going to talk dangerous.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:25.120
Were you at a house or like a party or what did you do?

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.320
Oh, you're kidding.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.960
You had a friend that could fly in a shaman into into Brooklyn.

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.320
But that's the shittiest part of ayahuasca is the shaman.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.640
Bullshit spirituality.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640
No, but he's the guy that tells you where to barf

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.680
and where not to barf and things like that, right?

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.560
Yeah.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.680
I want to do it.

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.680
But I don't want to do this like the touristy thing

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.800
where you have to go be in a waterfall at Machu Picchu

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.400
or whatever the fuck.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.840
I'd rather go to Brooklyn and do it.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.480
Brooklyn, you know, but with a shaman,

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.800
I will do it like however the people tell me to do it.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.680
Because I do not want to go off the rails.

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680
It's probably illegal and stupid to say

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.120
that we're going to do the finale of harm and temper.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:02.600
Probably.

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.800
We're all going to be in ayahuasca.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.240
Well, it takes six hours.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.200
You take six hours.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:06.640
Well, DMT.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.320
Holy shit.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:11.560
But the effective drug in ayahuasca is DMT.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.000
Is it?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:12.720
Oh, really?

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.640
Yeah.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.480
I did that in a pool.

01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.800
That just comes in a pen.

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.800
Yeah, and you don't even have to get a shaman.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.920
Pocket shaman.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:23.720
I love you.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.800
My husband's boss is coming over for dinner.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.200
I haven't made the casserole.

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:32.840
Hello.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.960
I'm pocket shaman.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.840
I can't trip.

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.080
That'll be six hours.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:37.800
Yes, you can.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.680
Just one hit.

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.120
I'm a pen.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.320
Whoa, dwarves build time.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.160
I'm back.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.120
Now make that casserole.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.120
But aware of the fact that casserole doesn't matter.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.480
Thank you, pocket shaman.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.800
God, I wish it were 10 o'clock so we

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.240
could end the show on that joke.

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.320
Chemical release by DMT may be the chemical release

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.600
in your brain when you die.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.480
Member FDIC.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.200
I just did a little bit of it.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.560
I didn't get super duper high, but there was a tree,

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.360
and we had a thing.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.640
And it was kind of a romantic moment with a tree.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.320
I'm going up to the Storm Area 51 thing.

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:23.880
Oh, yeah.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.760
So that would be a good time to do DMT.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.160
That's this Friday.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.520
Didn't Keanu Reeves say he was going to fucking make it?

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.600
I don't know.

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.000
Apparently he tweeted and said, I'll see you there.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:35.960
So like what?

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.520
I think we should do a test run on a normal military base

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.520
first, just to make sure this is a good idea.

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.840
Before we go to the one that made the whole event.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.240
I think Area 51 is probably, I think

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.320
we have a fence outside of a fence,

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.120
and you have to get through that fence first.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.120
They have sensors for the miles and miles of desert

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.000
surrounding them before you get to the fence.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.560
You don't get to the fence before I like a jeep show.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.440
Let's say it was 7,000 people.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.880
Well, the one I'm going to is just

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.240
like they're calling it the base camp,

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.760
and they're not near the base, and they're not

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:10.600
going to storm the base.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.400
Now you got to split up.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.280
You got to have a bunch of UFO people.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.160
You got to split up.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.080
You got to do it from all sorts of different angles.

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:17.920
Right.

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.600
You should go storm base boardin' when you're in Canada.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.440
Base boardin'?

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.840
Yeah, it's a military base.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.840
I'm going to do Fort Wayne, was the one that's way up there.

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.680
Is that Fort Wayne?

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.520
Fort Wayne, I don't know.

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.640
No, what's the one that's way up in the fucking Yukon

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.480
and shit?

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.320
It's Fort.

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.160
I don't know.

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.000
I'm Canadian.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.840
I don't go north.

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.760
I can't believe you Canucks still have an army

01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.880
after we kicked your ass in 1812.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.120
I believe we won.

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.480
Oh, shit.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.120
Some of the telegrams still haven't made it through.

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.600
Did you guys burn down our White House?

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.760
You know, the reason that happened,

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.440
that was an insurance scam.

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.240
We wanted to build a new one.

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.760
And you paid for it.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.400
The war of 1812 was completely because

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.400
we had hit the tipping point of how aggression moved

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.760
just faster than communication.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.840
Like it was just sort of like people would write a letter

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.720
going like, wait, no, we didn't know what.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.000
They were going to liberate Canada.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.960
The Americans were going to liberate Canada from the

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.960
British and then they came up and they went,

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.000
these people don't want to be liberated.

01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.960
We're always so shocked about that.

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:34.600
Andrew Jackson was fighting the Battle of New Orleans

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.000
and all that shit.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.920
That war was over and he was still kicking dick

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.680
around there and they're like,

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:43.520
hey, the boat has a letter that says it's over.

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.560
And yeah.

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.560
It's a war that only Canadians care about.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.520
No Americans care about the war of 1812.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.120
You know what's amazing now is that fucking Tim Hortons

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.000
has, they never had a burger.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.080
Now they have a burger, but it's fucking beyond burger.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.480
So they now have only vegan burgers there.

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.160
They've never had a fucking burger before.

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.000
Don't fucking.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:02.840
I heard that.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.480
You can now get a fucking, oh.

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.440
They have veggie beyond sausage.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.800
You can get a fucking sausage McMuffin.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:11.640
You can't get that in the States.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.960
She was appraising your Segway infrastructure

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:16.880
and I was like, you can't leap

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.520
from whatever we were talking about to burgers.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.920
The show's fucking to over, Dan.

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.360
I don't give a shit anymore.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.080
I'm going to do ayahuasca, not on the show.

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.000
And then I'm not even gonna, this is my last show.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:32.840
I quit.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.640
Again, we got to Jeff off the chain.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.840
What are we gonna do, Dan and Spencer,

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.360
after the Harmontown is done?

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.880
Are we just gonna fuck off another night?

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.720
Or are we just gonna?

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.560
I would like the two of you

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.000
to continue to do commercials.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.960
Yeah, I have to say, and this is no disrespect, Dan.

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.360
My favorite part of Harmontown

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.240
is going and doing the ad with Spencer.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.080
Mine too.

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.360
No sleep till Brooklyn then?

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.280
Oh yeah, that's a goodie.

01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.760
That was incredible.

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.840
We got to give it up for Church and Brandon

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:05.520
who make all the ads fucking delicious, yeah.

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:06.360
Oh yeah.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.880
It's Church's good advice and Brandon's ability

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.680
to make us sound like we know what we're doing.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.960
It's fucking great.

01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.280
I love it.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.120
We go in there, we just goof off for five minutes

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.760
and we sell underwear.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.400
Do you think you'll still all be friends?

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.320
Or more to the point, have you guys become friends?

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.720
Yeah, I think so.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.560
I think so.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.560
The friendship with me, though, it's kind of a mixed bag.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.240
Get used to it.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.560
But I got a pool now.

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.560
Yeah, I got one of those.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.400
Then you live right by me, so.

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.200
Yeah, I come over, but your pool's full of cameras.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.080
I think I can swim in your pool.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.840
It's fucking creepy.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.160
Yeah, I pull them out.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.000
Also, there's small cameras, but they film loads of...

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.480
That's a callback to my...

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.240
A rolling, like, is he trying to end the show?

01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.640
I'll help him, I'll help him.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:06.600
So have you got the underwater shit all rigged up?

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.240
Like, so you can do your guys?

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:11.040
I just have two, yeah, I have two underwater cameras

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:14.000
that I've made little rigs that it takes about.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.880
I get up in the morning, I put them in the pool.

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.920
I think the drunkest I've been in the last year

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.760
was at your pool,

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.920
we were just day drinking in a pool

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.480
in the heat of the valley sun,

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.960
and then you just fucking wrecked.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.600
And then we went to Barone's and we had, like, red wine,

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:35.680
but yeah, that was bad.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.360
Yeah, it can get nasty.

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.200
Yeah.

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:40.880
I kind of miss it, yeah.

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:43.200
Your house is very large.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.200
How much of the house have you actually used?

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.720
Because there's parts of that house

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.320
that's never gonna be occupied.

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.320
I just used the Room 232.

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.600
I don't know, I tried to riff the...

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.440
What's the shiny name?

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.600
Your house is enormous.

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.120
How many of your bathrooms haven't you pooped in?

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.440
I have not pooped into the guest bedroom bathroom.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.480
That's polite.

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.160
Let's see, poop.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.160
What about that exterior one?

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.160
I pooped in there while the decorators were there,

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.240
and that's how I found out I will never poop in there again,

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:21.080
because the door to that one is like glass.

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.360
Yeah, you could see right in it.

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.840
Yeah, it's like, I'm a standing wiper, I'll just say it.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.080
Mm-hmm, oh yeah.

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.040
And before you fucking freak out,

01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.000
that's 40% of the public, so fuck off.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.120
Is there another way?

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:36.720
How do you arrive at that number?

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.000
40% of the public?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.200
By researching it after I found out

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.360
that not everyone is a standing wiper

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.400
in, like, season three of Community.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.800
You're not a stand-away portfolio, are you?

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.600
How do you wipe while still sitting?

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.760
You lean forward.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.680
You're a stand-away per?

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.520
Yeah.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.360
You're a stand-away per?

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.440
I got work to do.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.280
Yeah.

01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.120
Yeah.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:57.940
What?

01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.480
Thank you.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.320
Yeah.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.160
It's the work.

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.000
God damn, yeah.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.680
Is the work explaining why you stand up and wipe your butt?

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.200
We're just getting it done, getting it in there.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.360
I mean, it's already, like.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.920
Get the right angle on it.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:14.920
Like, how, when am I supposed to stop wiping anyway?

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.760
There's a roll of toilet paper,

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.560
there's a toilet that will clog

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.240
if you fill it with the toilet paper,

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.920
and there's an ass that has plenty of shit

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.760
for the roll of toilet paper.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.680
So I'm like, yes, I'm standing.

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.920
Why does standing help that process?

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.680
Because sitting and doing all that,

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.920
that's just a confident person who's like,

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.160
well, my ass has a certain amount of poop in it,

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.760
and I'm gonna just reach back and do these things.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.600
I don't know, I just wasn't.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.360
What kind of a princess sits there like this, ooh.

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:43.360
Yeah.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.720
Oh, that ought to do it.

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.880
Yes.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.920
I have to look at every wipe and be like,

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.320
okay, so that's like, I compare it to a swatch

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.160
from Home Depot.

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.320
Like, six more wipes to go.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.800
I'm only at like an acorn, like.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.920
Three flushes.

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.800
Okay, I'm gonna make an executive

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.560
comptroller decision right now.

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.960
Harmontown lasts another year

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.160
until we get to the fucking bottom of this.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.600
Ooh, the fans are loving it.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.960
Like, you stand up and just, no.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.360
No, you don't stand up and reach between your legs.

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:17.440
Is that what you just mimed?

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.960
Wait, you stand up, is it front to back or back to front?

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.560
Front to back for fuck's sake.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.120
That's how you avoid an objection.

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.200
For us that stand, it's down to up,

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.360
because we're standing.

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.920
Yeah.

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.720
No, you don't reach between your legs

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.760
and pull shit towards your fucking vagina.

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.760
That's how you get in the fact.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.800
Why not just sit and kind of gently

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.600
lean over to the side and do that?

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:47.280
Because, well, I'm gonna, I'm not gonna pretend

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.160
I made this Ben Franklin like decision.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.120
I'm like, oh, a wise man always stands up.

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.360
I obviously like, I don't think our mommies,

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.720
when you're a little kid, you wipe standing up pretty much.

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.680
It doesn't matter, of course.

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.080
Otherwise you fall in.

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.680
I just think your parents are like helping you

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.520
wipe your ass like in the beginning.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.120
And then like, I was never helped.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.680
Either later, I never, I learned on the mean streets

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.000
of Tustin, California.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.800
Yeah.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.640
Tustin.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.640
I just, I'm assuming socialization.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.000
I mean, I really don't think it was like,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.160
I truly made it to the age of like 37

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.640
before I found out that not everyone stands up

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.640
when they wipe their ass.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:33.200
And that in fact, a vast majority of people do not.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.040
Well, I think it's weird.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:37.360
I don't know, I wouldn't know how to do it.

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.520
I then tried to do it at once and I was like,

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:42.480
well, that's just out.

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.800
That's a complete, I mean, it's like,

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.920
this is a thing that you've done every day.

01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.080
It's like switching to left handed.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.080
I'm comfortable standing.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:50.160
I'm comfortable with standing.

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.160
It gets the job done.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.160
And like you said, we got work to do.

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.160
It's not like you're ever going to have to watch.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.520
Cliff Hanger!

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:00.360
Oh boy.

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:01.880
Let's give it up.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.120
Dave Foley, everybody.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.080
We're going to watch him take a poop Canadian style.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.080
Oh, Spencer Crittenden.

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.560
Woo!

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.520
He's giving up for Nolan, Cher, Zach,

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:20.080
everybody here at the Harmon County,

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:21.560
and the County Downs.

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:24.280
I have a counselor, Jeff Davis, Spencer.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:28.000
Your mayor, Dan Harmon, thank you so much.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.200
There's only so many left, let's make them count, shall we?

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.120
And let's all wipe our butts

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:34.680
however we find ourselves happier.

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:41.680
It's quite fast to take this.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:45.680
Zach, you got beat?

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.680
Did you get any of that?

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.680
It's a good show.
