08:04.000\nThere was one little tunnel where the people came out of,\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:06.000\nand that was the only place he could look at.\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:09.000\nAnd he had a spot like a ballet dancer.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:18.000\nRemember when we were in Las Vegas and we took mushrooms,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nand they kind of didn't take,\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nbut everybody ended up in one hotel room,\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nand all of a sudden the mushrooms started to kick in\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:30.000\nwhile Rob Schrab was describing the Neil Diamond concert\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nhe had gone to with a couple of the other people.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:36.000\nThe rest of us had all split up and had failure of a mushroom trip,\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:39.000\nbut then it was just Schrab describing the Neil Diamond concert\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:42.000\nbecause there was this malfunctioning platform\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:44.000\nthat Neil Diamond was like,\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:48.000\neverybody put it together for the brass section or whatever,\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:52.000\nand there were like these platforms that weren't working.\n\n08:52.000 --> 08:55.000\nAnd Schrab just for hours kept doing his impression of Neil Diamond\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:58.000\ngoing like, they're coming to, what the fuck?\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:01.000\nIt was really funny.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:06.000\nWe were just all laughing, like eight-year-olds for four hours.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.000\nI think the first time I met you, Dave,\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nbecause now you and I have been on the road quite a bit.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nFor about a year.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.000\nDoing hilarious live.\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnd the first time I met you,\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:26.000\nwas that your old house with the crazy precipitous Machu Picchu staircase?\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:28.000\nYes, yes.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nAnd then all the lights went out and there was no way to get out\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:32.000\nwithout breaking your ass on the way out.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:34.000\nYes, that was our last party in that house,\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:37.000\nup in the Hollywood Hills where we had some,\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:41.000\nwe had a party once that blocked traffic all the way from\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nLookout Mountain all the way down to Sunset.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:48.000\nOkay, I remember, we have met several times,\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\nbut I bet not there, but I was at one of those parties\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nat your house in the 90s.\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nYeah, in the late 90s.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:58.000\nThere were a lot of parties at my house that I wasn't even at.\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:01.000\nAnd yeah, there would be huge parties.\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.000\nRob Cohen and I used to throw our birthday party.\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:06.000\nCanadian Rob Cohen.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\nBut the party you were at was our last party.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.000\nYeah, and the power went out, there was a huge blackout.\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:13.000\nThe whole, all of Laurel Canyon was blacked out.\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:16.000\nAnd we had no furniture because we were moving out of the house.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\nThere was nothing to do or see.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:20.000\nThere was lots of booze.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:22.000\nAnd the pool was heated.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:24.000\nI didn't get that far.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:27.000\nAnd then we all kind of just like hold hands and walk down the hill together\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nand get the fuck out of that.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nHere's how old we are.\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:36.000\nI remember being in your backyard when I tested my first cell phone\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nwith Rob Schrab.\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:42.000\nWe were in LA for a while before we got our first cell phones\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nand we got them at the same time so they were one number apart.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:49.000\nWhich made us the biggest dorks.\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd I remember, what's the guy's name?\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:56.000\nThis is before they even invented flip phones.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nTechnology just flipped open the phone, didn't exist yet.\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nNo, these were clam shells.\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nI remember distinctly because we were testing them at this party\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nand we were like in a backyard.\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nAnd Dave Rath, I remember specifically.\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:17.000\nThe manager was like, this is a guy at that time\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:20.000\nthat you don't want to look like an idiot in front of, I guess.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nHis reputation precedes him as whatever.\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nYou're like, oh god, there's that guy.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nI've already heard of him and he doesn't know who I am.\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:30.000\nAnd then we're like in the backyard and Schrab and I just don't even know\n\n11:30.000 --> 11:33.000\nif these phones work so we called each other.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:38.000\nAnd then I just remember the mortifying realization\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:40.000\nthat everyone was looking at us.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:43.000\nAnd we were clearly just like these new kids in LA\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nwho didn't know what cell phones were\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:48.000\nand we're testing them in the backyard like walkie-talkies.\n\n11:48.000 --> 11:50.000\nAnd how dorky that felt.\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:55.000\nHave you ever considered, Dave, what beetle you would be in the kids in the hall?\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:58.000\nWhich beetle?\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:00.000\nI thought we settled that earlier.\n\n12:00.000 --> 12:02.000\nLet's let you weigh in.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:07.000\nHave you been compared to, like you are the Lenin or the McCartney\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:09.000\nor the Harrison?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nNo, I don't know because we have an extra one.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:13.000\nYeah, because it's finally you.\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:16.000\nSo I don't know, maybe McCartney.\n\n12:16.000 --> 12:18.000\nI think you're like a McCartney.\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:19.000\nYeah, because you're cute.\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:23.000\nAnd I was, yeah, and I'm nicer than McCullough.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:26.000\nSo McCullough is the Lenin for sure, yeah.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:31.000\nWhat's great about going on the road with Dave is we travel around\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:34.000\nand now you've been sober for some good long time.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:35.000\nAlmost five years now, yeah.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:38.000\nAnd we'll be like in Atlanta, like Georgia,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:40.000\noh yeah, I went to jail there.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:43.000\nI passed out over there.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nIt's fun to go on the day fully.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:48.000\nI used to do bad things to her.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:52.000\nHow many times have you been told, because there was a lot of drag work?\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.000\nI don't know what the right term for it is.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:57.000\nLike you, in the kids in the hall, like you guys, there were no women in the tree.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nWe called it lady time.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:00.000\nLady time?\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:01.000\nYeah.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:07.000\nHow many times were you told how sexy you were as a viable woman?\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:10.000\nOr was that just me and my mom?\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:13.000\nDiscussing how hot you were in a wig.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.000\nI would say it was probably on average every time.\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:21.000\nBecause it was like all the other guys, it was like, oh, everyone's funny.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nEveryone's a lady.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nThat's funny.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nBut then it was like, oof.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nYeah, I heard it, yeah.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:27.000\nI know.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:31.000\nWell, Kevin in particular used to develop, like fall in love with some\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nof the women characters I would play.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.000\nAnd it was like really get under everything because he would just stare a lot.\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:42.000\nAnd like our crew, like we had like old CBC crew, which you know, like government\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nemployees.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:47.000\nAnd first they all hated us, but then they sort of grew to like, but I'd get\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:50.000\nlike this, these old crew guys coming up to me going, Dave, you're going to be\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nthat redhead tonight.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nOh!\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:54.000\nOh, no, not today.\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:55.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nIs there a technique?\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:05.000\nIs there something you tap into or when you would play a woman?\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:10.000\nA lifetime of low-testosterone came in handy.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:12.000\nDo you know that you were on Jeopardy!\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.000\nLast night?\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:14.000\nI heard that.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:16.000\nYeah, I didn't see it, but Kevin McDonnell texted me.\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:20.000\nI was watching it with Laura last night and they said, there was a category of\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:21.000\nCanadian television.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:26.000\nI'm like, there's no way there's not going to be a kids in the hall like answer\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:27.000\non that one.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:31.000\nBut I think the only said you and Kevin, maybe one brother?\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:32.000\nI saw the screen capture.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nYeah.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nWas it just you two?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nYeah, it said the Canadian comedy troupe, including Dave Foley and Kevin McDonnell.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nYeah, so Bruce is fucking fucked off right now, right?\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:42.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:48.000\nYeah, he's got one fewer TVs in his house.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.000\nThat's what happens, huh?\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nThat's terrifying.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:56.000\nI always imagined now because I have a pool for the first time, so now I'm always\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\ncharacterizing everything.\n\n14:57.000 --> 15:00.000\nI was like, well, look, this isn't going to, I just want to keep that pool filled.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nAnd I like to imagine like if I eat it on a Rick and Morty script, like a couple\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nof gallons comes out of the pool.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:12.000\nIt's just like, I'll be down there and like two feet of water, like typing.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:17.000\nI remember the first time I saw your face on television when I was still in Milwaukee,\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:22.000\nit was the monologue, a good attitude towards menstruation.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.000\nThat was the...\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nPlease give them time to applaud.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:27.000\nPlease.\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:32.000\nThat was literally the first time.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:34.000\nI had no idea what the show was.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:39.000\nBack then you flipped through channels, so it was like just boom, there was your adorable\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.000\napple face, your pure, handsome...\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:51.000\nI'd hit it if it was a woman face and hit it like sexually, you know what I'm saying?\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:52.000\nYeah.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:53.000\nYes.\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:59.000\nLet's make that perfectly clear.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.000\nHe means hitting it in a fun, sexual way.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:06.000\nHe means strike up a conversation and work his way up to consensual sex with it.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:09.000\nBut that was a great monologue.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:10.000\nDid you write that?\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nI did, yeah.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd it still holds up, I think.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:16.000\nWell, I haven't gone back and watched it, but comedy does not age well.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nAnd then like the monologue is about how you have a good attitude towards menstruation.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:24.000\nAnd it's like, I would believe that if you read it today, it wouldn't be like, oh, that\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:25.000\ndidn't age well.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nNo, I think it's...\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\nYeah, it stands up, I think.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\nDo you remember?\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nDo it.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.000\nI don't remember all.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:38.000\nHi, my name is Dave Foley and I have...\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.000\nA good attitude towards menstruation.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:41.000\nThat's right, I'm the guy.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nThe guy with a good attitude towards menstruation.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:48.000\nOh, I know a lot of men are made uncomfortable by this monthly miracle, but not me.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:49.000\nNo, I embrace it.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nI embrace it the way some men embrace the weekend.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nI look forward to it the way a child...\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nI anticipate it the way a child anticipates Christmas.\n\n16:56.000 --> 17:03.000\nI can't remember any more of it.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:04.000\nWow.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:06.000\nYeah, I don't remember.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:11.000\nBut I remember the phrase, celebrate her fecundity, isn't there?\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nFecundity, yes.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:13.000\nOh, yes.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:22.000\nFecundity and pampering, and I'd mop her brown, admire her fecundity.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:24.000\nPeople don't call each other fecund anymore.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:28.000\nNo, well, so few of us are.\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.000\nI'm occasionally fecund.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nYeah, how would you know?\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nHave you ever put it through the test?\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.000\nI guess not.\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nNo, well, there you go.\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:41.000\nMe, my sperm is so motile, I could be getting someone pregnant right now.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:42.000\nYeah?\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:43.000\nYou have airborne sperm.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:44.000\nMy sperm?\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:45.000\nJust my sperm sneak out.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:46.000\nYeah.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nYeah.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.000\nIn the middle of the night.\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:52.000\nYeah, you're like the West Nile virus of date rape.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nI don't know what it was.\n\n17:54.000 --> 18:02.000\nWhy is it do you think when you...\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:04.000\nI don't know how it got rapey, I don't...\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:06.000\nI think I'm just saying that it was...\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:10.000\nI think my sperm go out and they talk a good game.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:11.000\nOkay.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nYeah.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nYou have charming airborne sperm.\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:18.000\nYeah.\n\n18:18.000 --> 18:19.000\nThey're Canadian sperm.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nThey're not going to sell each other out to get to the egg.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:22.000\nNo, no.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:23.000\nThey're wingman.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:24.000\nThey're like those chipmunks.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nAfter you.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:26.000\nNo, after you.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:32.000\nAnd also in Canada, your sperm has to be on the air...\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:36.000\nWhat's the percentage of sperm airtime on...\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:37.000\nWell, you have...\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:40.000\nAll of your sperm have to be 20% Canadian.\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nAnd they have to speak French.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:43.000\nAnd English, yes.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:44.000\nYou have to come in French.\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:45.000\nYeah.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:50.000\nSo most unwanted children are Dave Foley's and Colin Makris.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:51.000\nYeah.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nEverybody.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:53.000\nYeah.\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:54.000\nThat's nice.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:58.000\nSomebody laughed because it was too close to home.\n\n18:58.000 --> 18:59.000\nAre you a Toronto guy?\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:00.000\nI am.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:01.000\nYeah.\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:02.000\nIs that everybody?\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:04.000\nWas everybody from Toronto and the kids?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nMost of us.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nWell, also you did more than kids in the hall.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nI know I'm like, was everybody...\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:11.000\nIs Lorne Michaels from Toronto too?\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.000\nHe is.\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:13.000\nYeah.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nHe was from Toronto.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nYeah.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:24.000\nYou were talking about the origin story of you guys with Lorne and the brain candy.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:25.560\nI love that movie.\n\n19:25.560 --> 19:26.560\nYou're alone.\n\n19:26.560 --> 19:27.560\nYeah.\n\n19:27.560 --> 19:31.360\nBut what was the deal?\n\n19:31.360 --> 19:34.000\nWhy did that kind of didn't get released?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:39.000\nWell, it got released, but it was supposed to be released on something like a thousand\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:45.200\nscreens, but the troupe, and at this point I had quit the troupe, but so they were still\n\n19:45.200 --> 19:53.480\nmaking the movie, and they fought very hard for a character named Cancer Boy, which is\n\n19:53.480 --> 19:57.840\nfunny because it's a character that I originally wrote into our TV show.\n\n19:57.840 --> 20:03.240\nSo they fought to keep Cancer Boy, and Paramount really wanted Cancer Boy out, and then I guess\n\n20:03.240 --> 20:09.680\nBruce got on the phone and badgered somebody at Paramount, and they finally said, all right,\n\n20:09.680 --> 20:12.680\nyou can have Cancer Boy, and they called up Lorne and said, hey, we won.\n\n20:12.680 --> 20:17.320\nWe got Cancer Boy, and Lorne went, oh, that's wonderful.\n\n20:17.320 --> 20:21.120\nAnd so as a result of keeping Cancer Boy in, they cut it from something like a thousand\n\n20:21.120 --> 20:26.400\nscreens to 400 screens, and they cut all of the television advertising.\n\n20:26.400 --> 20:31.120\nSo and you know, that's not important to a film release.\n\n20:31.120 --> 20:38.840\nBecause, yeah, you want to reach the people that are at the rodeo with Cancer Boy.\n\n20:38.840 --> 20:41.120\nJust put something on the side of a steer.\n\n20:41.120 --> 20:47.720\nSo can I talk about the origin story of Dave coming on to Who's Live Anyway?\n\n20:47.720 --> 20:48.720\nSure.\n\n20:48.720 --> 20:54.000\nRyan, we were in Chicago, Ryan got ill and couldn't do the shows, and we were fucked\n\n20:54.000 --> 21:02.080\nbecause we had like a bunch of gigs to do, and our agent at APA, Josh, called you up\n\n21:02.080 --> 21:03.080\nlike what, at midnight?\n\n21:03.080 --> 21:05.320\nIt was 11 o'clock at night, yeah.\n\n21:05.320 --> 21:06.320\nYeah, LA time.\n\n21:06.320 --> 21:11.200\nYeah, it was one or two Chicago time, and they're like, okay, we have Dave Foley flying\n\n21:11.200 --> 21:13.760\nin tomorrow and to save this.\n\n21:13.760 --> 21:16.520\nAnd Dave Foley came in, you hadn't done improv in-\n\n21:16.520 --> 21:17.520\n30 years.\n\n21:17.520 --> 21:18.520\n30 years.\n\n21:18.520 --> 21:19.520\nYeah.\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:25.480\nAnd I think the very first scene that we did, you and I were on the ground, scissoring each\n\n21:25.480 --> 21:26.480\nother.\n\n21:26.480 --> 21:27.480\nUh-huh.\n\n21:27.480 --> 21:36.800\nIt was like, this guy is perfect, you're up for anything, and you do the most abstract\n\n21:36.800 --> 21:44.880\ncharacters, like I love you doing our version of crap improv, because you do like kind of\n\n21:44.880 --> 21:52.560\nabstruse right field characters, like very weird, it's fucking great.\n\n21:52.560 --> 21:55.880\nBut you and I were laying on the ground and just absolutely scissor-fucking each other.\n\n21:55.880 --> 21:56.880\nI can't remember why.\n\n21:56.880 --> 21:57.880\nHuh?\n\n21:57.880 --> 21:58.880\nI can't remember why.\n\n21:58.880 --> 21:59.880\nNo.\n\n21:59.880 --> 22:00.880\nDon't ask why.\n\n22:00.880 --> 22:01.880\nIt's fantastic.\n\n22:01.880 --> 22:02.880\nYeah.\n\n22:02.880 --> 22:14.160\nWhy don't you guys do some improv from this like, I don't know if you're aware of this,\n\n22:14.160 --> 22:15.160\nwhat we've been doing here.\n\n22:15.160 --> 22:16.160\nOh, shit.\n\n22:16.160 --> 22:20.160\nHave you been reading from a script?\n\n22:20.160 --> 22:22.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n22:22.160 --> 22:23.160\nWho here is from out of town?\n\n22:23.160 --> 22:24.160\nWho's from out of town?\n\n22:24.160 --> 22:25.160\nRaise your hand.\n\n22:25.160 --> 22:26.160\nOh, shit.\n\n22:26.160 --> 22:27.160\nAll of you?\n\n22:27.160 --> 22:28.160\nJesus Christ.\n\n22:28.160 --> 22:29.160\nYeah.\n\n22:29.160 --> 22:30.160\nAll right.\n\n22:30.160 --> 22:31.160\nYou met him right here.\n\n22:31.160 --> 22:32.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n22:32.160 --> 22:33.160\nNadia.\n\n22:33.160 --> 22:34.160\nNadia.\n\n22:34.160 --> 22:35.160\nAre you Russian or?\n\n22:35.160 --> 22:36.160\nI'm from London.\n\n22:36.160 --> 22:37.160\nLondon?\n\n22:37.160 --> 22:38.160\nYeah.\n\n22:38.160 --> 22:39.160\nWhy do you have a Russian name?\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:40.160\nIt's herbian.\n\n22:40.160 --> 22:41.160\nOh.\n\n22:41.160 --> 22:48.160\nOh, shit.\n\n22:48.160 --> 22:54.160\nGive Dan a position that people only do in Serbia, like a physical position, like a pose.\n\n22:54.160 --> 22:58.160\nThat would be a very Serbian pose.\n\n22:58.160 --> 22:59.160\nThat sounds good.\n\n22:59.160 --> 23:01.160\nDan, get water from the well.\n\n23:01.160 --> 23:02.160\nYou're going to get water?\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:03.160\nDan?\n\n23:03.160 --> 23:04.160\nYeah.\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:05.160\nOut of your state, Dan.\n\n23:05.160 --> 23:06.160\nTake your mic.\n\n23:06.160 --> 23:10.160\nDan, you're going to be going to get water from the well.\n\n23:10.160 --> 23:15.160\nIs anybody here from Croatia?\n\n23:15.160 --> 23:16.160\nAny other Balkans here?\n\n23:16.160 --> 23:17.160\nYeah.\n\n23:17.160 --> 23:18.160\nDo you have any Balkans?\n\n23:18.160 --> 23:20.160\nWho's here from South America?\n\n23:20.160 --> 23:22.160\nWe'll get to Rwanda later.\n\n23:22.160 --> 23:23.160\nRwanda.\n\n23:23.160 --> 23:25.160\nWho's here from South America?\n\n23:25.160 --> 23:27.160\nCentral America.\n\n23:27.160 --> 23:28.160\nAmerica.\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:29.160\nThere we go.\n\n23:29.160 --> 23:30.160\nYou are here.\n\n23:30.160 --> 23:31.160\nGive.\n\n23:31.160 --> 23:32.160\nThat's our spot.\n\n23:32.160 --> 23:33.160\nWhat's your name?\n\n23:33.160 --> 23:34.160\nZen.\n\n23:34.160 --> 23:35.160\nZen?\n\n23:35.160 --> 23:38.160\nYeah, I know what Zen means.\n\n23:38.160 --> 23:40.160\nLike Buddhism.\n\n23:40.160 --> 23:41.160\nShe had to explain Zen.\n\n23:41.160 --> 23:43.160\nWell, she's just telling you, because you might have thought her name.\n\n23:43.160 --> 23:47.160\nShe might have thought it was Zen, or she's...\n\n23:47.160 --> 23:53.160\nWhat's your real name that people can't pronounce?\n\n23:53.160 --> 23:54.160\nNo.\n\n23:54.160 --> 23:59.160\nNo.\n\n23:59.160 --> 24:01.160\nStop fighting, everyone.\n\n24:01.160 --> 24:02.160\nZen.\n\n24:02.160 --> 24:03.160\nYou're not very Zen.\n\n24:03.160 --> 24:04.160\nZen.\n\n24:04.160 --> 24:08.160\nGive Dave Foley a Zen posture or pose?\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:09.160\nOkay, cool.\n\n24:09.160 --> 24:10.160\nLet's do this.\n\n24:10.160 --> 24:11.160\nNo, no.\n\n24:11.160 --> 24:12.160\nJust say it.\n\n24:12.160 --> 24:14.160\nOh, you're going to come and do it for us?\n\n24:14.160 --> 24:15.160\nAll right.\n\n24:15.160 --> 24:16.160\nThat's fine, too.\n\n24:16.160 --> 24:17.160\nAll right, Zen.\n\n24:17.160 --> 24:18.160\nOh, wow.\n\n24:18.160 --> 24:20.160\nWelcome Zen to the stage, everybody.\n\n24:20.160 --> 24:22.160\nShow Dave Foley what he's going to do.\n\n24:22.160 --> 24:24.160\nAll improv should be like this.\n\n24:24.160 --> 24:25.160\nGive him a...\n\n24:25.160 --> 24:26.160\nHi, Dave Foley.\n\n24:26.160 --> 24:27.160\nI'm Zen.\n\n24:27.160 --> 24:28.160\nHi, Zen.\n\n24:28.160 --> 24:29.160\nCan I get a name?\n\n24:29.160 --> 24:30.160\nZen with an M?\n\n24:30.160 --> 24:31.160\nOh, yes!\n\n24:31.160 --> 24:32.160\nZen.\n\n24:32.160 --> 24:35.160\nI'm just going to do this now.\n\n24:35.160 --> 24:36.160\nAll right.\n\n24:36.160 --> 24:37.160\nYou got that?\n\n24:37.160 --> 24:38.160\nAll right.\n\n24:38.160 --> 24:40.160\nLet's give it up for Zen, everybody.\n\n24:40.160 --> 24:41.160\nZen, thank you.\n\n24:41.160 --> 24:44.160\nLet's give it up for Zen.\n\n24:44.160 --> 24:45.160\nZen.\n\n24:45.160 --> 24:46.160\nGo away.\n\n24:46.160 --> 24:47.160\nAll right.\n\n24:47.160 --> 24:48.160\nSo, here we are.\n\n24:48.160 --> 24:51.160\nSo, Dave has this pose.\n\n24:51.160 --> 24:57.480\nDan is getting water from the well, and now we are going to take you to a scene that encapsulates\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:00.160\nthese physical positions.\n\n25:00.160 --> 25:03.160\nPretty sure it's your fault.\n\n25:03.160 --> 25:08.160\nSo, I should have been thinking of something funny this whole time.\n\n25:08.160 --> 25:09.160\nNo!\n\n25:09.160 --> 25:10.160\nNo!\n\n25:10.160 --> 25:11.160\nNo!\n\n25:11.160 --> 25:12.160\nThat's scripting.\n\n25:12.160 --> 25:13.160\nThat's a rookie mistake, Dan.\n\n25:13.160 --> 25:14.160\nAll right.\n\n25:14.160 --> 25:15.160\nAll right.\n\n25:15.160 --> 25:16.160\nOkay.\n\n25:16.160 --> 25:26.160\nSo, if I do one cartwheel, you'll give me that human head.\n\n25:26.160 --> 25:27.160\nRight?\n\n25:27.160 --> 25:28.160\nFreeze!\n\n25:28.160 --> 25:29.160\nFreeze!\n\n25:29.160 --> 25:35.160\nAre you both frozen?\n\n25:35.160 --> 25:37.160\nHe tapped him!\n\n25:37.160 --> 25:38.160\nYou did!\n\n25:38.160 --> 25:39.160\nOkay.\n\n25:39.160 --> 25:41.160\nI might have tapped him.\n\n25:41.160 --> 25:43.160\nMaybe you're just, it was an encouraging tap.\n\n25:43.160 --> 25:55.160\nLadies and gentlemen, for one night and one night only, Canadian Elvis Presley.\n\n25:55.160 --> 25:57.160\nOh, shit.\n\n25:57.160 --> 25:59.160\nHey, everybody.\n\n25:59.160 --> 26:05.160\nI just want to say I'm sorry.\n\n26:05.160 --> 26:06.160\nWe did improv.\n\n26:06.160 --> 26:11.160\nYou see, it's like riding a bicycle, David.\n\n26:11.160 --> 26:13.160\nIt's like riding a bicycle.\n\n26:13.160 --> 26:25.160\nAlthough it doesn't get you anywhere.\n\n26:25.160 --> 26:26.160\nBut it's fun, right?\n\n26:26.160 --> 26:27.160\nYeah.\n\n26:27.160 --> 26:28.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n26:28.160 --> 26:29.160\nYeah, it was fun.\n\n26:29.160 --> 26:31.160\nIt was weird because when they called, as I said, it was like 11 o'clock at night.\n\n26:31.160 --> 26:34.160\nAnd I remember, I was tired.\n\n26:34.160 --> 26:38.160\nSo, my only thought was, well, I got to drive my daughter to something tomorrow.\n\n26:38.160 --> 26:41.160\nSo, if I can get someone to drive her, I'll be there.\n\n26:41.160 --> 26:43.160\nThat was what I called.\n\n26:43.160 --> 26:45.160\nAnd you were on a plane like at 6 a.m.\n\n26:45.160 --> 26:49.160\nYeah, I had to be on a flight at 6 a.m. to get there in time for the show.\n\n26:49.160 --> 26:50.160\nYou saved our bacon.\n\n26:50.160 --> 26:51.160\nOur Canadian bacon.\n\n26:51.160 --> 27:00.160\nI was probably when I got on the plane and I went, oh, I don't improvise.\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:01.160\nYeah.\n\n27:01.160 --> 27:04.160\nWell, that brought back some bad flashbacks for me.\n\n27:04.160 --> 27:06.160\nWere you ever in an improv group?\n\n27:06.160 --> 27:09.160\nYeah, when I was a little tight, yeah.\n\n27:09.160 --> 27:11.160\nThat's how Dan and I met.\n\n27:11.160 --> 27:12.160\nWe did comedy sports.\n\n27:12.160 --> 27:14.160\nOh, you were in comedy sports?\n\n27:14.160 --> 27:15.160\nI was in LA comedy sports.\n\n27:15.160 --> 27:19.160\nAnd he and Rob were Milwaukee comedy sports.\n\n27:19.160 --> 27:21.160\nI was getting like 94, I think.\n\n27:21.160 --> 27:24.160\nSo, yeah, kids know we were all theater sports up in Canada.\n\n27:24.160 --> 27:25.160\nAll right.\n\n27:25.160 --> 27:26.160\nSame thing.\n\n27:26.160 --> 27:27.160\nYeah.\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:28.160\nYeah.\n\n27:28.160 --> 27:29.160\nKeith Johnstone.\n\n27:29.160 --> 27:30.160\nKeith Johnstone.\n\n27:30.160 --> 27:31.160\nYeah, exactly.\n\n27:31.160 --> 27:33.160\nYeah, that lit up all the wrong parts of my brain.\n\n27:33.160 --> 27:41.160\nI was, that thing of playing to the, you know, trying to get the laugh.\n\n27:41.160 --> 27:44.160\nAnd I was never good at it.\n\n27:44.160 --> 27:48.160\nAnd it always made me feel sad.\n\n27:48.160 --> 27:50.160\nWhat do you mean you weren't good at playing for the laugh?\n\n27:50.160 --> 27:53.160\nI saw you be funny and go for the laugh all the time.\n\n27:53.160 --> 27:56.160\nWell, I think it's like those freeze games and like kind of, I don't know.\n\n27:56.160 --> 27:58.160\nYou're more of a long form guy, Dan.\n\n27:58.160 --> 27:59.160\nYeah.\n\n27:59.160 --> 28:05.160\nCan I get a, can I get a Dutch playwright?\n\n28:05.160 --> 28:06.160\nJust run on stage.\n\n28:06.160 --> 28:08.160\nWe're going to do an eight hour Herald.\n\n28:08.160 --> 28:09.160\nYes.\n\n28:09.160 --> 28:11.160\nI heard, I heard Ibsen.\n\n28:11.160 --> 28:12.160\nI heard Ibsen.\n\n28:12.160 --> 28:15.160\nCan we, let's get a title of an Ibsen play.\n\n28:15.160 --> 28:17.160\nThe Dollhouse.\n\n28:17.160 --> 28:29.160\nCan I have some better lighting, please?\n\n28:29.160 --> 28:30.160\nPerfect.\n\n28:30.160 --> 28:33.160\nThank you.\n\n28:33.160 --> 28:46.160\nWe now take you to act two of The Dollhouse by Henry Gibson.\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:59.160\nWhat have I done?\n\n28:59.160 --> 29:10.160\nWe now take you to act three of Ibsen's The Dollhouse.\n\n29:10.160 --> 29:14.160\nWhich wire?\n\n29:14.160 --> 29:17.160\nAre you sure?\n\n29:17.160 --> 29:21.160\nHow could you not be sure?\n\n29:21.160 --> 29:24.160\nHold on to your butts.\n\n29:24.160 --> 29:35.160\nDollhouse.\n\n29:35.160 --> 29:38.160\nYou see improv's not, it doesn't change over time.\n\n29:38.160 --> 29:39.160\nImprov is still improv.\n\n29:39.160 --> 29:40.160\nYeah.\n\n29:40.160 --> 29:44.160\nI think that was Enemy of the People.\n\n29:44.160 --> 29:48.160\nYou ever see that movie, Executive Decision?\n\n29:48.160 --> 29:49.160\nNope.\n\n29:49.160 --> 29:54.160\nIt was pretty bad, but they did one fun thing, which is that Stephen Segal was in it, and\n\n29:54.160 --> 30:00.160\nhe was on all the posters, and it was like, Stephen Segal, Kurt Russell, and Oliver Platt\n\n30:00.160 --> 30:03.160\nare Executive Decision.\n\n30:03.160 --> 30:08.160\nHow can they all be, how can they all three be Executive Decision?\n\n30:08.160 --> 30:11.160\nIt was the name of their improv group.\n\n30:11.160 --> 30:15.160\nBut in like the first eight minutes of the movie, Stephen Segal just without warning\n\n30:15.160 --> 30:18.160\njust gets sucked out of the airplane.\n\n30:18.160 --> 30:19.160\nAnd that's part of that.\n\n30:19.160 --> 30:22.160\nIt's like, oh, they had their whole mission planned, and he was like the alpha, and then\n\n30:22.160 --> 30:24.160\nhe just dies right away.\n\n30:24.160 --> 30:25.160\nIt was kind of a fun thing.\n\n30:25.160 --> 30:29.160\nWas that in the script, or they just thought, fuck, we hate this guy.\n\n30:29.160 --> 30:32.160\nI think that was the first week of shooting rewrite.\n\n30:32.160 --> 30:35.160\nYeah, it could have evolved out of working with Segal.\n\n30:35.160 --> 30:37.160\nI don't know.\n\n30:37.160 --> 30:39.160\nHe's supposed to be the worst person, right?\n\n30:39.160 --> 30:42.160\nI heard he actually hurts people in those action scenes.\n\n30:42.160 --> 30:47.160\nLike he's like, I can't act, so I'm just really going to break your arm.\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:52.160\nHe will punch and actually make contact with the stunt guy, which you're not supposed to do.\n\n30:52.160 --> 30:55.160\nNo, and it's arguably easy not to do.\n\n30:55.160 --> 31:01.160\nAnd if you're a martial artist, you really should be even better at not hitting people.\n\n31:01.160 --> 31:04.160\nIt's arguably your job not to hit people.\n\n31:04.160 --> 31:08.160\nAnd if you complain, you're allowed to not be on the movie anymore.\n\n31:08.160 --> 31:12.160\nBut also, I think there's a great story, and I forget who it was, but the stunt coordinator\n\n31:12.160 --> 31:14.160\ncompletely busted his ass.\n\n31:14.160 --> 31:17.160\nLike, just counterpunched him and just knocked him out.\n\n31:17.160 --> 31:20.160\nFuck you, Segal.\n\n31:20.160 --> 31:24.160\nAlso, at some point, he just started wearing shower curtains.\n\n31:24.160 --> 31:28.160\nHe got so fat that he just wore, like, not even Mumus.\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:32.160\nMumus is too polite a word for what Stephen Segal started wearing.\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:35.160\nMumus are too fitted.\n\n31:35.160 --> 31:38.160\nOkay, there's been a change of plans.\n\n31:38.160 --> 31:40.160\nWe're going to go down there.\n\n31:40.160 --> 31:42.160\nWe're going to be ghosts.\n\n31:42.160 --> 31:44.160\nOnly ghosts.\n\n31:44.160 --> 31:49.160\nThere was this movie where I put a clip of it on my Instagram.\n\n31:49.160 --> 31:51.160\nIf you scroll back, you'll see it.\n\n31:51.160 --> 31:53.160\nBut it's like, it's just a wig.\n\n31:53.160 --> 31:59.160\nClearly, it was like he got 300 pounds and he painted a Dracula widow's peak on his head.\n\n31:59.160 --> 32:02.160\nAnd he kept doing, like, even shittier and shittier movies.\n\n32:02.160 --> 32:07.160\nAnd he kept, like, if you watch those latter-day movies, he's, like,\n\n32:07.160 --> 32:10.160\nclearly like, I'm not going to re-memorize the script.\n\n32:10.160 --> 32:12.160\nI'll just talk.\n\n32:12.160 --> 32:13.160\nI'm Stephen Segal.\n\n32:13.160 --> 32:15.160\nWhat am I doing in this scene?\n\n32:15.160 --> 32:17.160\nTelling my sidekick that we're on a mission.\n\n32:17.160 --> 32:19.160\nOkay, we're on a mission.\n\n32:19.160 --> 32:20.160\nIt's going to be good.\n\n32:20.160 --> 32:22.160\nWe now take you to act two.\n\n32:22.160 --> 32:27.160\nStephen Segal has portrayed by Dan Harmon.\n\n32:27.160 --> 32:31.160\nWhatever it's called.\n\n32:31.160 --> 32:34.160\nDamien.\n\n32:34.160 --> 32:36.160\nWe got a mission.\n\n32:36.160 --> 32:38.160\nOkay.\n\n32:38.160 --> 32:41.160\nThere's nothing to get excited about.\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:44.160\nWe're going to go fight some bad guys.\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:46.160\nOkay.\n\n32:46.160 --> 32:48.160\nIt's just a big deal.\n\n32:48.160 --> 32:49.160\nI'm all over the plot.\n\n32:49.160 --> 32:51.160\nI'm just here for comic relief.\n\n32:51.160 --> 32:54.160\nMmm.\n\n32:54.160 --> 32:57.160\nGet in the boat.\n\n32:57.160 --> 32:58.160\nGet in the boat.\n\n32:58.160 --> 33:00.160\nGet in the boat.\n\n33:00.160 --> 33:02.160\nAnd we're on the bayou.\n\n33:02.160 --> 33:05.160\nOn the bayou.\n\n33:05.160 --> 33:08.160\nIt's just a mission on the bayou.\n\n33:08.160 --> 33:12.160\nWhere are we rowing to?\n\n33:12.160 --> 33:15.160\nCage.\n\n33:15.160 --> 33:17.160\nIt's where Cajuns are from.\n\n33:17.160 --> 33:22.160\nCajuns.\n\n33:22.160 --> 33:30.160\nHow long have you been in demolitions?\n\n33:30.160 --> 33:34.160\nWell, it's kind of a family thing.\n\n33:34.160 --> 33:37.160\nMy grandfather was in demolitions.\n\n33:37.160 --> 33:40.160\nAnd my father, when I came of age.\n\n33:40.160 --> 33:41.160\nHold on.\n\n33:41.160 --> 33:42.160\nOkay.\n\n33:42.160 --> 33:43.160\nI'm going to make a three-point turn.\n\n33:43.160 --> 33:44.160\nIt's on alligator.\n\n33:44.160 --> 33:47.160\nAll right.\n\n33:47.160 --> 33:51.160\nI'm going to beat the shit out of him.\n\n33:51.160 --> 33:53.160\nHey, alligator.\n\n33:53.160 --> 33:56.160\nYou like picking on tough guys?\n\n33:56.160 --> 33:58.160\nI mean, are you a tough guy?\n\n33:58.160 --> 34:00.160\nYou like picking on non-tough guys?\n\n34:00.160 --> 34:02.160\nWell, you can't talk?\n\n34:02.160 --> 34:04.160\nWhat are you, some kind of reptile?\n\n34:04.160 --> 34:10.160\nCome here.\n\n34:10.160 --> 34:13.160\nI lost my oars.\n\n34:13.160 --> 34:14.160\nYeah.\n\n34:14.160 --> 34:16.160\nIt's supposed to be connected to the boat.\n\n34:16.160 --> 34:22.160\nAnd the alligator is a protected species, you know.\n\n34:22.160 --> 34:24.160\nIt's not from where I'm standing.\n\n34:24.160 --> 34:26.160\nChop it.\n\n34:26.160 --> 34:30.160\nChop it.\n\n34:30.160 --> 34:32.160\nChop it.\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:34.160\nChop it.\n\n34:34.160 --> 34:36.160\nThe watch is really tossing the boat around.\n\n34:36.160 --> 34:38.160\nDamn it.\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:39.160\nYou!\n\n34:39.160 --> 34:40.160\nWhat?\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:41.160\nDown there in the boat.\n\n34:41.160 --> 34:44.160\nIt's Kurt Russell.\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:50.160\nI just want my truck back.\n\n34:50.160 --> 34:52.160\nThis is a boat.\n\n34:52.160 --> 34:53.160\nYeah.\n\n34:53.160 --> 34:54.160\nYeah.\n\n34:54.160 --> 34:56.160\nChop, chop, chop, chop, chop.\n\n34:56.160 --> 34:59.160\nThere goes the chopper.\n\n34:59.160 --> 35:01.160\nYou see, improv is not hard.\n\n35:01.160 --> 35:02.160\nIt's not a hard...\n\n35:02.160 --> 35:04.160\nIt's not a difficult art form.\n\n35:04.160 --> 35:05.160\nNo.\n\n35:05.160 --> 35:08.160\nIt's all you...\n\n35:08.160 --> 35:10.160\nYeah.\n\n35:10.160 --> 35:15.160\nIt's like painting if all painting was Jackson Pollock.\n\n35:15.160 --> 35:17.160\nNo.\n\n35:17.160 --> 35:20.160\nIt doesn't have to make any sense.\n\n35:20.160 --> 35:24.160\nWho day for you, you're self excluded.\n\n35:24.160 --> 35:29.160\nWho do you think was the most naturally funny kid from the kids in the home?\n\n35:29.160 --> 35:30.160\nNaturally.\n\n35:30.160 --> 35:34.160\nIt's like born funny made you laugh the most.\n\n35:34.160 --> 35:35.160\nKevin McDonald.\n\n35:35.160 --> 35:36.160\nYeah, Kevin.\n\n35:36.160 --> 35:38.160\nOpen the door!\n\n35:38.160 --> 35:41.160\nOpen the door!\n\n35:41.160 --> 35:46.160\nWho is the least funny?\n\n35:46.160 --> 35:49.160\nWho didn't have a funny bone in their whole body?\n\n35:49.160 --> 35:52.160\nThat's varied over the years.\n\n35:52.160 --> 35:55.160\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\n35:55.160 --> 36:01.160\nI had a good time drinking with McKinney.\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:04.160\nI had met Scott.\n\n36:04.160 --> 36:09.160\nCollecting my kids in the hall encounters like a Voltron.\n\n36:09.160 --> 36:12.160\nI've actually never met Bruce.\n\n36:12.160 --> 36:13.160\nNo.\n\n36:13.160 --> 36:16.160\nEither of I.\n\n36:16.160 --> 36:19.160\nBut I finally met McKinney fairly recently.\n\n36:19.160 --> 36:20.160\nRecently?\n\n36:20.160 --> 36:25.160\nWe were posing a fun horror movie together and we hung out at Tribeca.\n\n36:25.160 --> 36:28.160\nHe was a real fun guy to hang out with.\n\n36:28.160 --> 36:31.160\nThat's good.\n\n36:31.160 --> 36:34.160\nDid you guys ever, and you can say no comment and let's move on,\n\n36:34.160 --> 36:45.160\nbut I'm curious, did you guys ever have actual, were there incidents that were dramatic,\n\n36:45.160 --> 36:49.160\nfalling outs or anything, or was it more kind of like...\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:55.160\nWe had a falling out that lasted 35 years.\n\n36:55.160 --> 36:57.160\nWe always fought.\n\n36:57.160 --> 36:59.160\nWas it passive aggressive or was it...\n\n36:59.160 --> 37:00.160\nNo, it was a lot of yelling.\n\n37:00.160 --> 37:01.160\nIt was Scott.\n\n37:01.160 --> 37:04.160\nThere was a lot of breaking furniture.\n\n37:04.160 --> 37:09.160\nIt was vicious right from the very start of it.\n\n37:09.160 --> 37:10.160\nWho was your first ally?\n\n37:10.160 --> 37:11.160\nWas it you and Kevin?\n\n37:11.160 --> 37:12.160\nYeah.\n\n37:12.160 --> 37:14.160\nKevin and I were in a group with a guy named Lucie Casemiri.\n\n37:14.160 --> 37:16.160\nThe three of us never fought.\n\n37:16.160 --> 37:18.160\nWe were always very nice to each other.\n\n37:18.160 --> 37:26.160\nThen we joined up with Mark and Bruce and some other guys, Frank van Kieken, Gary Campbell.\n\n37:26.160 --> 37:29.160\nYeah, I think that's it, those guys.\n\n37:29.160 --> 37:30.160\nThey were horrible.\n\n37:30.160 --> 37:34.160\nThey were just the worst human beings I'd ever met.\n\n37:34.160 --> 37:39.160\nBecause you were used to being with people that you trusted and liked and there was no fighting.\n\n37:39.160 --> 37:43.160\nAnd then you found out that it could be political and crap all the time.\n\n37:43.160 --> 37:47.160\nYeah, because we would be supportive of them and they asked each other and they would give notes like,\n\n37:47.160 --> 37:53.160\noh, my problem with that sketch is that you're a piece of shit as a human being.\n\n37:53.160 --> 37:57.160\nAnd that was kind of the level of debate.\n\n37:57.160 --> 38:09.160\nI remember our improv troupe, The Dead Ale Wives, we would do things like there was one,\n\n38:09.160 --> 38:14.160\nwe would have notes sessions after the show, which I was like, oh man, can we not?\n\n38:14.160 --> 38:16.160\nIt was just like, what are we going to do?\n\n38:16.160 --> 38:20.160\nTell each other I wish you were different on stage.\n\n38:20.160 --> 38:25.160\nWe weren't professional enough to take notes and get better.\n\n38:25.160 --> 38:31.160\nWe were just guys that were trained in short form that wanted to say fucking go longer.\n\n38:31.160 --> 38:34.160\nIt was just the notes thing.\n\n38:34.160 --> 38:37.160\nIt was mean.\n\n38:37.160 --> 38:39.160\nWho was the main note giver?\n\n38:39.160 --> 38:43.160\nBecause there's not only one person that wants to be the person that wants to settle some hatch up.\n\n38:43.160 --> 38:44.160\nIt totally varied.\n\n38:44.160 --> 38:51.160\nAnd there would be in the few short years where we were all together, there were sort of rotating alliances,\n\n38:51.160 --> 39:00.160\nlike somebody's got a beef with someone else and they're kind of expressing that through giving them more notes after the show.\n\n39:00.160 --> 39:06.160\nIt's coming out on stage that this person thinks that that person's not funny,\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:11.160\nor this person thinks that that person is selfish and mean on stage or whatever,\n\n39:11.160 --> 39:14.160\nand it's getting expressed in different ways.\n\n39:14.160 --> 39:16.160\nIt's like trying to hold a family together.\n\n39:16.160 --> 39:23.160\nBecause you're together in this supposedly high stakes thing.\n\n39:23.160 --> 39:31.160\nI'm imagining and trying to imagine your situation because we were in Milwaukee and had no chance of being,\n\n39:31.160 --> 39:37.160\nbut the stakes were that high for us that they were, that was our thing and that was our family and that was our life.\n\n39:37.160 --> 39:38.160\nSo I can't imagine.\n\n39:38.160 --> 39:44.160\nYou got to say that Bruce and Mark moved from Calgary to Toronto to make it,\n\n39:44.160 --> 39:51.160\nwhich shows how dumb they are.\n\n39:51.160 --> 39:56.160\nAnd we did, I think it was, we used to fight, even before we had, when we were just doing our club shows,\n\n39:56.160 --> 39:59.160\nwe used to fight so much that there'd be like rumors going all around town,\n\n39:59.160 --> 40:01.160\noh, there won't be a show this week.\n\n40:01.160 --> 40:05.160\nNo, there's no way they could get on stage together after the things they said to each other.\n\n40:05.160 --> 40:07.160\nWas that from very early on?\n\n40:07.160 --> 40:10.160\nLike from the get go, you guys were already at each other's threshold.\n\n40:10.160 --> 40:14.160\nBut for us, it was like we would fight like dogs all the way up until the show time.\n\n40:14.160 --> 40:17.160\nAnd then once we got on stage, we loved each other again.\n\n40:17.160 --> 40:19.160\nAnd we would have a great time doing the show.\n\n40:19.160 --> 40:22.160\nBecause the show is the show and that's why you were there.\n\n40:22.160 --> 40:26.160\nYeah, and then after the show, by the end of the show, we'd usually be drunk.\n\n40:26.160 --> 40:31.160\nAnd we'd just hang out all night and have a great time.\n\n40:31.160 --> 40:34.160\nSo it was the lead up that was the problem?\n\n40:34.160 --> 40:35.160\nYeah, we're great.\n\n40:35.160 --> 40:36.160\nOnce we're performing, everyone's great.\n\n40:36.160 --> 40:40.160\nAnd actually, everyone gives great notes. Once we've decided what we're doing,\n\n40:40.160 --> 40:42.160\neveryone's really good.\n\n40:42.160 --> 40:45.160\nBut it's the deciding what we're going to do is when we fight.\n\n40:45.160 --> 40:49.160\nPeople have ownership of bits and stuff.\n\n40:49.160 --> 40:53.160\nLike I think we should do the chicken drive-thru.\n\n40:53.160 --> 40:57.160\nAnd then someone's like, I hate that sketch, but they don't want to say I hate that sketch.\n\n40:57.160 --> 41:00.160\nSo they say maybe we've done chicken drive-thru too many times and then it just erupts.\n\n41:00.160 --> 41:02.160\nNo, kids know how we just say I hate that sketch.\n\n41:02.160 --> 41:05.160\nThat was our version of diplomacy.\n\n41:05.160 --> 41:10.160\nWho claimed that we never did that sketch?\n\n41:10.160 --> 41:11.160\nThat would be his way.\n\n41:11.160 --> 41:18.160\nAnd Mark had a gift that if it was four to one against Mark, Mark would consider that a draw.\n\n41:18.160 --> 41:26.160\nThat's very Canadian to me.\n\n41:26.160 --> 41:32.160\nCanadians get off too easy with the whole, it stops at just the politeness thing.\n\n41:32.160 --> 41:37.160\nIt's like the politeness comes with extreme capacity for argumentation.\n\n41:37.160 --> 41:39.160\nLike argumentiveness.\n\n41:39.160 --> 41:44.160\nIt seems like general statements are inherently problematic.\n\n41:44.160 --> 41:49.160\nThe politeness belies a lot of withholding.\n\n41:49.160 --> 41:52.160\nYou're suppressing a lot of shit.\n\n41:52.160 --> 41:58.160\nIt's easy to say I'm sorry, but you really hate everything that's going on.\n\n41:58.160 --> 42:02.160\nAgain, because we never suppressed anything.\n\n42:02.160 --> 42:08.160\nThat would have been sweet, a little repression, and it would have been nice.\n\n42:08.160 --> 42:12.160\nI remember when I first started doing stuff with people that weren't the kids in the hall,\n\n42:12.160 --> 42:17.160\nI was really startled at how fragile everyone was.\n\n42:17.160 --> 42:24.160\nWhy the fuck is everyone crying?\n\n42:24.160 --> 42:28.160\nThat's interesting, in general, what was your family like?\n\n42:28.160 --> 42:32.160\nWas it functional, dysfunctional?\n\n42:32.160 --> 42:38.160\nAll of our families were horribly dysfunctional.\n\n42:38.160 --> 42:41.160\nMost of us had alcoholic dads.\n\n42:41.160 --> 42:45.160\nMost of us came from broken homes that wouldn't quite break.\n\n42:45.160 --> 42:51.160\nParents that would just sort of perforated homes were just dangling.\n\n42:51.160 --> 42:55.160\nAll of us had alcoholic dads except for McKinney.\n\n42:55.160 --> 43:01.160\nHis dad was a diplomat, which I guess is worse.\n\n43:01.160 --> 43:12.160\nAt some point in your life, did therapy or how do you approach your self-care?\n\n43:12.160 --> 43:17.160\nI did therapy when I was trying to find a way to end my first marriage.\n\n43:17.160 --> 43:21.160\nIt worked.\n\n43:21.160 --> 43:26.160\nI started out in couples therapy, and then I sort of hung in there for a while.\n\n43:26.160 --> 43:30.160\nI did that too, even though my couples therapist was like,\n\n43:30.160 --> 43:34.160\nshe helped the couple that I was in get married,\n\n43:34.160 --> 43:37.160\nand then we got divorced in like eight months,\n\n43:37.160 --> 43:41.160\nbut I kept going to her, and every once in a while I'll bring it up.\n\n43:41.160 --> 43:47.160\nYou know, of course, you kind of a failure as a...\n\n43:47.160 --> 43:49.160\nYou had one job, but...\n\n43:49.160 --> 43:55.160\nI went to the schedule therapy, and partway through the therapy,\n\n43:55.160 --> 43:58.160\nmy wife took off back to Canada with my kids,\n\n43:58.160 --> 44:02.160\nand then I just kept going there for a while\n\n44:02.160 --> 44:05.160\nbecause she kept telling me I was nicer than her.\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:07.160\nAnd then eventually she said, you know, you don't have to go anymore.\n\n44:07.160 --> 44:10.160\nAnd then when I got married again, and then my second wife and I were having problems,\n\n44:10.160 --> 44:15.160\nI went to the same couples therapist, and we split up.\n\n44:15.160 --> 44:18.160\nSo it's not very good as a couple.\n\n44:18.160 --> 44:20.160\nBut the current wife you're happy with, and everything's going...\n\n44:20.160 --> 44:22.160\nWell, I'm back together with my second wife.\n\n44:22.160 --> 44:24.160\nOh, right, now things are groovy again, yeah.\n\n44:24.160 --> 44:26.160\nYeah, my second wife is my third wife.\n\n44:26.160 --> 44:28.160\nWow.\n\n44:28.160 --> 44:30.160\nAfter a 10-year gap.\n\n44:30.160 --> 44:35.160\nYeah, that would be a fun, like, Latter-day Matt Damon movie.\n\n44:35.160 --> 44:39.160\nSecond third wife.\n\n44:39.160 --> 44:41.160\nShe's...\n\n44:41.160 --> 44:43.160\nYeah, who'll be the wife?\n\n44:43.160 --> 44:45.160\nThe...\n\n44:45.160 --> 44:48.160\nBorn to Lose.\n\n44:48.160 --> 44:51.160\nLike, Born Identity? I don't know.\n\n44:51.160 --> 44:54.160\nOh, I thought you were trying to make up an actress's name.\n\n44:54.160 --> 44:56.160\nYeah, Born to Lose.\n\n44:56.160 --> 44:58.160\nBorn to Lose.\n\n44:58.160 --> 45:00.160\nIs this roller derby?\n\n45:00.160 --> 45:02.160\nHere comes Born to Lose.\n\n45:02.160 --> 45:04.160\nSchindiggers taking it in the...\n\n45:04.160 --> 45:08.160\nCratchzilla's got it up on the wall.\n\n45:08.160 --> 45:13.160\nWhat is it?\n\n45:13.160 --> 45:18.160\nI just read an article about when to know when to stop going to therapy.\n\n45:18.160 --> 45:20.160\nWhen you're done.\n\n45:20.160 --> 45:24.160\nI felt weird opening the article, but then I felt immediately great\n\n45:24.160 --> 45:28.160\nbecause the article and the professionals cited within it\n\n45:28.160 --> 45:31.160\nall immediately indicated,\n\n45:31.160 --> 45:35.160\nthis is going to make you feel weird having this conversation with yourself\n\n45:35.160 --> 45:40.160\nor with your... And here's why and here's whatever.\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:43.160\nI mean, what's your relationship been with therapy?\n\n45:43.160 --> 45:47.160\nIt was really literally one day,\n\n45:47.160 --> 45:50.160\nwe were in the middle of a session, and the therapist said,\n\n45:50.160 --> 45:54.160\nyou know, you don't have to keep coming.\n\n45:54.160 --> 45:59.160\nAnd I said, oh, well, I didn't want to offend you.\n\n45:59.160 --> 46:02.160\nThat was her saying that you're good to go?\n\n46:02.160 --> 46:04.160\nYeah, you don't need to be here.\n\n46:04.160 --> 46:06.160\nAnd did you stop?\n\n46:06.160 --> 46:08.160\nYeah, that was the last session.\n\n46:08.160 --> 46:09.160\nThat's great.\n\n46:09.160 --> 46:11.160\nSo she's like, yeah, you nailed it.\n\n46:11.160 --> 46:13.160\nIt's a little sad because I mean, but if you're a therapist,\n\n46:13.160 --> 46:16.160\nbreathe your salt, you do understand going into the job,\n\n46:16.160 --> 46:18.160\nwhich is something I wouldn't have known.\n\n46:18.160 --> 46:20.160\nI'm a little more cynical than that.\n\n46:20.160 --> 46:22.160\nI would think that they're just like, they never even confront this idea.\n\n46:22.160 --> 46:25.160\nBut they're actually like, if they want to be a good therapist,\n\n46:25.160 --> 46:29.160\nthey're thinking, my job is to make it so this person never has to come see me again.\n\n46:29.160 --> 46:33.160\nAnd it's kind of like a prostitute\n\n46:33.160 --> 46:36.160\nin that it's an intimate thing, you know, having this guy.\n\n46:36.160 --> 46:39.160\nAnd also, I found you're not supposed to kiss them on the mouth.\n\n46:39.160 --> 46:41.160\nRight.\n\n46:41.160 --> 46:43.160\nAnd they're called mental health workers now.\n\n46:43.160 --> 46:45.160\nYeah, yeah.\n\n46:45.160 --> 46:49.160\nAlso, a prostitute psychologist can blow your mind.\n\n46:49.160 --> 46:51.160\nYeah.\n\n46:51.160 --> 46:58.160\nYeah, that was a nice grown, grown, grown applause.\n\n46:58.160 --> 47:03.160\nYeah.\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:05.160\nOh, I've got more.\n\n47:05.160 --> 47:08.160\nThat was problem atop laws.\n\n47:08.160 --> 47:15.160\nThey were like, hey.\n\n47:15.160 --> 47:18.160\nSan Fonzi.\n\n47:18.160 --> 47:22.160\nHey.\n\n47:22.160 --> 47:27.160\nYeah, I think the signs are if you\n\n47:27.160 --> 47:32.160\nif you have internalized everything so you kind of just hear your therapist's voice in your head a lot\n\n47:32.160 --> 47:35.160\nin situations where you're like, oh, this is what she would say about this.\n\n47:35.160 --> 47:39.160\nAnd if you're when you're going into your sessions, you're kind of like starting to make shit up.\n\n47:39.160 --> 47:41.160\nLike, like reasons to be there.\n\n47:41.160 --> 47:44.160\nSpencer, have you ever gone to therapist?\n\n47:44.160 --> 47:45.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n47:45.160 --> 47:46.160\nI love it.\n\n47:46.160 --> 47:47.160\nHow's that going?\n\n47:47.160 --> 47:51.160\nI wish my therapist would be like, you know, you don't have to keep coming.\n\n47:51.160 --> 47:55.160\nSpencer's seeing Jeremy Piven as a therapist.\n\n47:55.160 --> 47:56.160\nOh, it's great.\n\n47:56.160 --> 48:01.160\nHe just wants him to get a haircut and stop playing Gunges and Dragons.\n\n48:01.160 --> 48:03.160\nDo you currently go Spencer?\n\n48:03.160 --> 48:04.160\nOh, yeah.\n\n48:04.160 --> 48:05.160\nI'm going to go tomorrow.\n\n48:05.160 --> 48:06.160\nOh boy.\n\n48:06.160 --> 48:08.160\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n48:08.160 --> 48:11.160\nTell us something really intimate about your therapy.\n\n48:11.160 --> 48:18.160\nI was talking about how the most interesting probably the most valuable thing my therapist\n\n48:18.160 --> 48:20.160\never said happened at last session.\n\n48:20.160 --> 48:25.160\nHe's like, you know, you seem to be alone a lot and I was like, thank you.\n\n48:25.160 --> 48:31.600\nI'm trying to tell people and it was like there's probably the first time I got what\n\n48:31.600 --> 48:36.160\nfelt like a genuine valuable insight from him because most of what he's most of the\n\n48:36.160 --> 48:37.160\ntime I go therapy.\n\n48:37.160 --> 48:41.160\nI'm like blah, blah, blah, and he's like, you know, and I'm like, yeah, no, I know\n\n48:41.160 --> 48:44.160\nthat, and then I'm like blah, blah, blah, blah, and he's like, you know, and I'm like,\n\n48:44.160 --> 48:45.160\nthat's a stupid observation.\n\n48:45.160 --> 48:49.520\nBut like this is the first time I was like, hey, that's the kind of thing a therapist\n\n48:49.520 --> 48:54.160\nwould say when you give them money to talk about shit that you're alone a lot.\n\n48:54.160 --> 48:55.160\nWell, just yeah.\n\n48:55.160 --> 48:56.160\nI don't know.\n\n48:56.160 --> 48:57.160\nWas there a follow-up to that?\n\n48:57.160 --> 48:58.160\nNo.\n\n48:58.160 --> 48:59.160\nI was like, come on.\n\n48:59.160 --> 49:00.160\nWhat the fuck?\n\n49:00.160 --> 49:01.160\nThat's all.\n\n49:01.160 --> 49:02.560\nI've been here so many times.\n\n49:02.560 --> 49:05.240\nThat's like the one grain of rice you give me.\n\n49:05.240 --> 49:08.080\nThis is literally, he's as therapeutic as a bully.\n\n49:08.080 --> 49:09.880\nHe's saying all the same things a bully says.\n\n49:09.880 --> 49:10.880\nHe's telling you to cut your hair.\n\n49:10.880 --> 49:12.880\nNo bully has told me I'm alone a lot.\n\n49:12.880 --> 49:13.880\nYeah.\n\n49:13.880 --> 49:14.880\nI'd love to hear that.\n\n49:14.880 --> 49:15.880\nYou don't have any friends.\n\n49:15.880 --> 49:16.880\nCut your hair.\n\n49:16.880 --> 49:17.880\nNo one says that.\n\n49:17.880 --> 49:18.880\nI'd love to hear that.\n\n49:18.880 --> 49:19.880\nHe only knows you when he's with you.\n\n49:19.880 --> 49:23.320\nSo you're never alone when you're with like he only knows you not being alone.\n\n49:23.320 --> 49:24.320\nYou go into that asshole.\n\n49:24.320 --> 49:29.800\nJordan Peterson for their yeah, I've been clean in my room in your room.\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:30.800\nStand up straight.\n\n49:30.800 --> 49:31.800\nYou know what?\n\n49:31.800 --> 49:32.800\nLobsters do.\n\n49:32.800 --> 49:33.800\nHuh?\n\n49:33.800 --> 49:34.800\nYou know what?\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:35.800\nLobsters do.\n\n49:35.800 --> 49:36.800\nWhat do they do when their friends are in a bucket?\n\n49:36.800 --> 49:38.800\nThey have diamond dominance hierarchies.\n\n49:38.800 --> 49:39.800\nOh, wait.\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:40.800\nIt was right.\n\n49:40.800 --> 49:41.800\nLobsters have friends.\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:44.320\nLobsters have friends in a bucket.\n\n49:44.320 --> 49:45.320\nYep.\n\n49:45.320 --> 49:46.520\nLike you mean like a lobster pot.\n\n49:46.520 --> 49:47.520\nThey're trapped.\n\n49:47.520 --> 49:51.000\nThey're going to get no lobster bucket in a not a trap.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:52.520\nIt's not a pot.\n\n49:52.520 --> 49:53.520\nIs that his plate?\n\n49:53.520 --> 49:54.520\nOh's cave.\n\n49:54.520 --> 49:55.520\nYeah.\n\n49:55.520 --> 50:01.560\nWell JP JP has a lot of dominance hierarchy stuff as well as like it's all just a bucket\n\n50:01.560 --> 50:03.400\nlike who cares which lobster is more red.\n\n50:03.400 --> 50:07.120\nHe's like all all beings have sexism.\n\n50:07.120 --> 50:08.120\nLook at lobsters.\n\n50:08.120 --> 50:09.120\nOkay.\n\n50:09.120 --> 50:10.120\nPerfect example.\n\n50:10.120 --> 50:16.040\nAnd apparently he will claim that the dominance hierarchies are a good thing because the best\n\n50:16.040 --> 50:18.720\nalways rise to the top in lobsters.\n\n50:18.720 --> 50:19.720\nYeah.\n\n50:19.720 --> 50:23.420\nThey won't be lucky if you know this.\n\n50:23.420 --> 50:24.880\nBut Donald Trump's the president.\n\n50:24.880 --> 50:26.380\nYeah yeah.\n\n50:26.380 --> 50:27.380\nYeah.\n\n50:27.380 --> 50:33.500\nJordan you might wanna go back to Canada and shut up.\n\n50:33.500 --> 50:34.500\nYeah.\n\n50:34.500 --> 50:35.420\nIt's good stuff.\n\n50:35.420 --> 50:42.700\nJP JP would you die for me as I know that so Zazos that calm I just listen to Jesus\n\n50:42.700 --> 50:46.620\nChrist superstar while I was cleaning my video lab.\n\n50:46.620 --> 50:49.240\nI met not nearly Ted Healy Ted Nealy.\n\n50:49.240 --> 50:50.900\nOh, Ted Neely, I was like, he met Ted Healy.\n\n50:50.900 --> 50:53.580\nI meant, you know, why would I bring that up?\n\n50:53.580 --> 50:54.420\nHow old are you?\n\n50:54.420 --> 50:55.440\nYeah.\n\n50:55.440 -->

video switcher.\n\n51:18.820 --> 51:23.860\nTwo cockle shells and a partition or pear tree.\n\n51:23.860 --> 51:27.020\nAnd I'm figuring out how to do a live broadcast.\n\n51:27.020 --> 51:32.540\nAnd I live broadcast my workouts on Instagram.\n\n51:32.540 --> 51:33.700\nAnd I was pointing.\n\n51:33.700 --> 51:36.940\nWith eight GoPros, you can do that bullet time effect.\n\n51:36.940 --> 51:40.260\nYeah, 60 frames per second, baby.\n\n51:40.260 --> 51:43.180\nBut yeah, I've been learning.\n\n51:43.180 --> 51:47.500\nCould you mount the other thing inside the pool, like we talked about?\n\n51:47.500 --> 51:49.540\nI got my waterproof housing.\n\n51:49.540 --> 51:53.100\nIs this like a Chuck Berry story?\n\n51:53.100 --> 51:53.980\nYeah.\n\n51:53.980 --> 51:56.700\nIt's more like a Denny Thomas story.\n\n51:56.700 --> 51:58.580\nYeah, I got waterproof cameras so that people\n\n51:58.580 --> 52:00.660\ncan watch me practice my flip turns.\n\n52:00.660 --> 52:03.580\nIt's a little hobby.\n\n52:03.580 --> 52:04.540\nI'm enjoying it.\n\n52:04.540 --> 52:08.020\nDo you think that the filming of your workouts\n\n52:08.020 --> 52:09.580\nhelps you get in better shape?\n\n52:09.580 --> 52:11.620\nIs that a motivating factor for you?\n\n52:11.620 --> 52:12.380\nYeah.\n\n52:12.380 --> 52:13.540\nI think it's kind of a double-edged sword\n\n52:13.540 --> 52:16.420\nbecause that's something I can both get consumed with\n\n52:16.420 --> 52:19.380\nand I could also get bored with it possibly.\n\n52:19.380 --> 52:21.180\nBut it's sort of like the alternative\n\n52:21.180 --> 52:25.940\nis I'm not going to just keep working out just because, like,\n\n52:25.940 --> 52:31.500\noh, it's like, I don't know, I'm playing a semi-self-aware game\n\n52:31.500 --> 52:34.820\nwith how my brain works by turning my workouts into a thing that\n\n52:34.820 --> 52:37.260\nhas like a nerdy quotient to it.\n\n52:37.260 --> 52:41.580\nBut it's kind of a loaded non-gun or an unloaded actual gun\n\n52:41.580 --> 52:45.660\nof or a double-edged gun sword that\n\n52:45.660 --> 52:49.940\nshoots little hilt bullets that themselves have no edge\n\n52:49.940 --> 52:57.180\nbut are explosive in that, like, yeah, historically,\n\n52:57.180 --> 52:59.660\nI will challenge myself with things that I'm bad at\n\n52:59.660 --> 53:03.100\nand then I'll learn the fuck out of them\n\n53:03.100 --> 53:05.860\nfor the dopamine spike of conquering this thing\n\n53:05.860 --> 53:08.620\nand then I'll just get aggressively bored\n\n53:08.620 --> 53:10.020\nand just walk away.\n\n53:10.020 --> 53:13.740\nI just opened up, like, Logic Pro today.\n\n53:13.740 --> 53:16.140\nAnd I was like, I had forgotten every single thing\n\n53:16.140 --> 53:18.540\nthat I learned about how to make a little song.\n\n53:18.540 --> 53:21.500\nLike, I don't know, I don't remember all the hot keys.\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:23.860\nIt's like, why did I spend all that time learning?\n\n53:23.860 --> 53:25.780\nHave you got the dive?\n\n53:25.780 --> 53:28.140\nGood yet, because you were doing the floppy legs thing.\n\n53:28.140 --> 53:30.300\nHave you got the dive ripped, like, are you?\n\n53:30.300 --> 53:32.580\nI like to think I'm keeping my legs a little straighter.\n\n53:32.580 --> 53:34.180\nI had some floppy legs on my dives.\n\n53:34.180 --> 53:35.420\nOh, I guess so, yeah.\n\n53:35.420 --> 53:37.860\nYou know what I started doing, Dave?\n\n53:37.860 --> 53:40.060\nIs I took off my nose clip.\n\n53:40.060 --> 53:42.700\nOh, that's a big workout.\n\n53:42.700 --> 53:44.020\nAnd on the flips, that's a big voice.\n\n53:44.020 --> 53:44.860\nThen do you get water up?\n\n53:44.860 --> 53:45.700\nDo you have to breathe out?\n\n53:45.700 --> 53:46.540\nI can't do the flips yet.\n\n53:46.540 --> 53:49.300\nThat's like wasabi in the nose when I flip.\n\n53:49.300 --> 53:51.220\nBecause you've got to breathe out, I guess, or something?\n\n53:51.220 --> 53:54.020\nYeah, you've got to get to the end, like, so, yeah.\n\n53:54.020 --> 53:56.580\nYeah, you exhale when you're going upside down.\n\n53:56.580 --> 53:57.420\nOh, really?\n\n53:57.420 --> 53:59.420\nYeah.\n\n53:59.420 --> 54:01.340\nI should try that.\n\n54:01.340 --> 54:04.860\nThere's no air in my lungs, brother.\n\n54:04.860 --> 54:06.620\nI've just swam a whole pool length.\n\n54:06.620 --> 54:10.060\nI'm like, coach also wants you to work on those floppy legs.\n\n54:13.940 --> 54:19.220\nAnywho, were you ever in a comedy troupe, Spencer?\n\n54:19.220 --> 54:19.860\nOh, yeah.\n\n54:19.860 --> 54:22.660\nI was on this podcast called Harmontown.\n\n54:25.780 --> 54:27.260\nOh, I guess they've heard of it.\n\n54:27.260 --> 54:30.420\nI heard it died after 17 years.\n\n54:30.420 --> 54:31.700\nYeah.\n\n54:31.700 --> 54:34.500\nA lot of fighting, a lot of notes.\n\n54:34.500 --> 54:36.900\nYeah, what people don't know is after every Harmontown,\n\n54:36.900 --> 54:39.420\nwe go back into the green room and really fucking\n\n54:39.420 --> 54:44.820\nget into it, about the minutiae of every joke\n\n54:44.820 --> 54:48.300\nis under a microscope.\n\n54:48.300 --> 54:49.460\nIt's all punch up, though.\n\n54:49.460 --> 54:50.100\nIt's good.\n\n54:50.100 --> 54:51.300\nRight.\n\n54:51.300 --> 54:53.340\nMakes it better.\n\n54:53.340 --> 54:55.140\nYeah, like, look how good the show is.\n\n54:55.140 --> 54:57.780\nHow many shows do we have left?\n\n54:57.780 --> 55:00.220\nWhat's the shot clock on right now?\n\n55:00.220 --> 55:02.140\nWhat's today?\n\n55:02.140 --> 55:03.180\nSeven?\n\n55:03.180 --> 55:04.340\nIt's Monday.\n\n55:04.340 --> 55:06.380\nWe've got maybe eight shows left.\n\n55:06.380 --> 55:09.540\nAll right, I can only do eight of them.\n\n55:09.540 --> 55:10.220\nHell, yeah.\n\n55:13.820 --> 55:15.300\nThat's all I've made record.\n\n55:15.300 --> 55:17.100\nDid you ever play in D&D, Dave?\n\n55:17.100 --> 55:19.940\nI've never played D&D.\n\n55:19.940 --> 55:23.060\nYou want to try and be a little like a guest character\n\n55:23.060 --> 55:24.620\nand a little role-playing?\n\n55:24.620 --> 55:33.220\nSure, because, you know, because D&D and video games\n\n55:33.220 --> 55:36.940\nboth kind of broke when I was a kid,\n\n55:36.940 --> 55:39.140\njust after I started having sex.\n\n55:39.140 --> 55:40.700\nRight.\n\n55:40.700 --> 55:41.260\nThat's a bad timing.\n\n55:41.260 --> 55:43.740\nAnd there was just no turning back from there.\n\n55:43.740 --> 55:46.860\nDo you think there was a correlation there that you\n\n55:46.860 --> 55:50.420\ncreated D&D and video games by fucking people?\n\n55:50.420 --> 55:51.780\nOther people would say, hey, have you\n\n55:51.780 --> 55:52.660\nheard about this D&D?\n\n55:52.660 --> 55:55.380\nI said, I'd love to hear about it, but I'm fucking right now.\n\n55:57.940 --> 55:59.060\nWell, what about some video games?\n\n55:59.060 --> 55:59.980\nSame deal.\n\n55:59.980 --> 56:03.180\nI got some fucking to do when I'm done.\n\n56:03.180 --> 56:04.300\nMaybe we can talk about it.\n\n56:04.300 --> 56:05.660\nSo what year are we talking?\n\n56:05.660 --> 56:06.660\nEarly 80s?\n\n56:06.660 --> 56:08.980\nThis is late 70s, I guess, early 70s.\n\n56:08.980 --> 56:12.740\nWell, I guess, no, I lasted my virginity in 1980, I guess.\n\n56:12.740 --> 56:15.180\nSo you were hitting that early hip-hop pussy.\n\n56:15.180 --> 56:16.300\nYeah.\n\n56:16.300 --> 56:17.020\nOh, yeah.\n\n56:17.020 --> 56:21.900\nThat Sugar Hill gang rapping about peas and carrots.\n\n56:21.900 --> 56:22.820\nYeah, look at me.\n\n56:22.820 --> 56:25.820\nHe was fucking to Melly Mel.\n\n56:25.820 --> 56:26.820\nYeah.\n\n56:26.820 --> 56:29.860\nSee, nobody laughs because that's too fucking deep a track.\n\n56:29.860 --> 56:34.660\nYeah, I was fucking to Pink Floyd's The Wall, which\n\n56:34.660 --> 56:38.300\nis really quite a, if you can stay erect during anything\n\n56:38.300 --> 56:40.100\nby Roger Waters.\n\n56:40.100 --> 56:43.940\nIf your lover can stay in a relationship\n\n56:43.940 --> 56:46.380\nwith a guy who's playing Pink Floyd because that's all\n\n56:46.380 --> 56:48.580\nhis songs are about his mommy letting him down\n\n56:48.580 --> 56:50.420\nafter his daddy died, did they?\n\n56:50.420 --> 56:50.920\nYeah.\n\n56:50.920 --> 56:53.140\nHas anybody achieved orgasm during Pink Floyd,\n\n56:53.140 --> 56:53.900\nor is that in person?\n\n56:53.900 --> 56:55.180\nOnly Roger Waters.\n\n56:55.180 --> 56:57.300\nOnly Roger Waters.\n\n56:57.300 --> 56:58.660\nToday, talk about this little asterisk\n\n56:58.660 --> 57:00.660\nbecause I had written this down as a note,\n\n57:00.660 --> 57:03.060\nbut I'm usually blackout drunk by the middle of the show.\n\n57:03.060 --> 57:04.860\nBut did I mention the thing?\n\n57:04.860 --> 57:08.300\nI was like, did you think Pink Floyd had a manager?\n\n57:08.300 --> 57:10.900\nAnd so many Pink Floyd songs have a cigar,\n\n57:10.900 --> 57:12.740\nbut it's just a theme in Pink Floyd songs\n\n57:12.740 --> 57:15.140\nwhere they go meta and talk about how shitty the record\n\n57:15.140 --> 57:16.980\nbusiness is and show biz and all this stuff.\n\n57:16.980 --> 57:20.060\nDo you think they had a really nice manager who's like, guys.\n\n57:20.060 --> 57:20.560\nYeah.\n\n57:20.560 --> 57:22.060\nYeah.\n\n57:22.060 --> 57:24.060\nYeah.\n\n57:24.060 --> 57:26.700\nI thought we got along, and they're like, no, it's a character.\n\n57:26.700 --> 57:27.380\nIt's a thing.\n\n57:27.380 --> 57:33.500\nWell, you're perpetuating a stereotype about my vocation.\n\n57:33.500 --> 57:37.020\nAre you not happy with the hotel?\n\n57:37.020 --> 57:39.220\nDo you think that I'm only interested in money?\n\n57:39.220 --> 57:41.020\nI care about you.\n\n57:41.020 --> 57:43.740\nI like that the job pays.\n\n57:43.740 --> 57:45.300\nI'm pretty transparent about it.\n\n57:45.300 --> 57:47.180\nI hear this latest single, and I'm like,\n\n57:47.180 --> 57:51.220\nis that an impression of me?\n\n57:51.220 --> 57:52.740\nYou wanted to do a concert in Pompeii.\n\n57:52.740 --> 57:55.140\nI said, OK.\n\n57:55.140 --> 57:59.220\nI finished my pudding.\n\n57:59.220 --> 58:01.540\nWhy am I one of these characters coming out\n\n58:01.540 --> 58:04.300\nand putting your soul on trial with your mom\n\n58:04.300 --> 58:06.060\nand your English professor?\n\n58:06.060 --> 58:06.780\nThat's crazy.\n\n58:06.780 --> 58:07.620\nCome on.\n\n58:07.620 --> 58:09.980\nI never shot you up with heroin.\n\n58:09.980 --> 58:12.420\nTurned you into a Nazi with shaved eyebrows?\n\n58:12.420 --> 58:15.220\nI didn't do that.\n\n58:15.220 --> 58:15.980\nI went.\n\n58:15.980 --> 58:17.860\nWell, just Pink Floyd references.\n\n58:17.860 --> 58:23.420\nI don't know a whole lot of Pink Floyd.\n\n58:23.420 --> 58:25.900\nI'm pretty proud that by 1981, I realized\n\n58:25.900 --> 58:28.500\nthat the wall was shit.\n\n58:28.500 --> 58:29.540\nI think that was pretty fast.\n\n58:29.540 --> 58:31.460\nI think that was pretty fast off the mark.\n\n58:31.460 --> 58:33.220\nI would never go that far.\n\n58:33.220 --> 58:37.260\nI'm afraid we'll never reach that apotheosis.\n\n58:37.260 --> 58:38.980\nI'm 46, and I'll make it.\n\n58:38.980 --> 58:41.740\nOh, it's a terrible album.\n\n58:41.740 --> 58:43.820\nWell, if you take out all the Roger Watersongs,\n\n58:43.820 --> 58:46.060\nit's not bad.\n\n58:46.060 --> 58:47.180\nCome on.\n\n58:47.180 --> 58:48.020\nWow.\n\n58:48.020 --> 58:51.260\nCanadian Shots, Fires, Townia.\n\n58:51.260 --> 58:52.500\nI love it.\n\n58:52.500 --> 58:59.100\nI never, I won't bother to like, because I\n\n58:59.100 --> 59:01.940\nfeel like my taste in music is so unqualified and bad\n\n59:01.940 --> 59:08.100\nthat I'm afraid of the glasshouse of ever saying.\n\n59:08.100 --> 59:10.540\nI'll be like, this Katy Perry song is fine.\n\n59:10.540 --> 59:14.580\nI'm afraid if I step on the slightest footstool of snobbery,\n\n59:14.580 --> 59:17.940\nI'll immediately do a triple flip and break my neck,\n\n59:17.940 --> 59:19.780\nbecause people will be like, what do you listen to?\n\n59:19.780 --> 59:22.260\nAnd I'll be like, eh, don't look at those underwear.\n\n59:22.260 --> 59:24.180\nLike, I don't know.\n\n59:24.180 --> 59:26.180\nBrian Posein came up to me and said, hey,\n\n59:26.180 --> 59:28.820\nI heard you have a bit where you can talk anybody out\n\n59:28.820 --> 59:31.700\nof their love of Rush.\n\n59:31.700 --> 59:33.340\nAnd he goes, I fucking love Rush.\n\n59:33.340 --> 59:36.700\nYou go, I can't talk Brian Posein out of Loving Rush.\n\n59:36.700 --> 59:39.020\nI could talk anybody else out of Loving Rush,\n\n59:39.020 --> 59:41.980\nbecause Brian Posein loves his Rush, but wow.\n\n59:41.980 --> 59:43.860\nI'll set you up with Alex Lifeson sometime.\n\n59:43.860 --> 59:44.860\nWith who?\n\n59:44.860 --> 59:46.140\nThe guitar player from Rush.\n\n59:46.140 --> 59:47.300\nOh, really?\n\n59:47.300 --> 59:50.660\nSee, I hate you for even knowing that.\n\n59:50.660 --> 59:52.780\nI remember being in the car with you and Jack Black,\n\n59:52.780 --> 59:54.420\nand then some Led Zeppelin came up.\n\n59:54.420 --> 59:56.140\nAnd you're like, Led Zeppelin sucks.\n\n59:56.140 --> 59:57.740\nAnd you talk for like two minutes.\n\n59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.300\nAnd then Jack Black was like, nah.\n\n01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.980\nAnd it was so unmistakable.\n\n01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.820\nYou're just like, all right, well, that's fine.\n\n01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820\nYou know, that's all.\n\n01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:11.380\nYeah, but like, because it's like an open.\n\n01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.300\nI have no leg to stand on.\n\n01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.340\nLike, I have no credentials, because I know and like sticks\n\n01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.460\nmore than the Pink Floyd.\n\n01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.260\nAnd they're a worst band.\n\n01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.580\nYeah, they are a worst band, no matter what the other band\n\n01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.580\nyou're talking about is.\n\n01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.080\nIt is.\n\n01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.620\nWell, if sticks and Pink Floyd are bad, then what's good?\n\n01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.340\nRight.\n\n01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.380\nKaty Perry?\n\n01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.540\nI got to go see sticks with people.\n\n01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540\nI saw sticks live.\n\n01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.020\nYeah, are they Canadian?\n\n01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.300\nNo.\n\n01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:41.940\nNo, no.\n\n01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.180\nI saw them on the Crystal Ball tour.\n\n01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.060\nWhere are sticks from?\n\n01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:45.940\nAmerica.\n\n01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.900\nThey're yours.\n\n01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.780\nI got invited by Diva Zappa to go see them at the Greek.\n\n01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:58.380\nAnd they opened for Yes, who I truly hate.\n\n01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.460\nThey're the worst of Prague.\n\n01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.940\nI would rather suck Geddy Lee's balls\n\n01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:06.780\nthan go to a Yes concert.\n\n01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.900\nAnd we were backstage, and I asked Tommy, what's his name?\n\n01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.460\nTommy Shaw, who took over from the other guy that\n\n01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.700\nused to be the lead singer.\n\n01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.700\nAnd I go, Yes is on, like you don't want to go watch him?\n\n01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.780\nAnd he goes, no, I've seen him.\n\n01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.060\nYeah, fuck yes.\n\n01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:25.660\nYeah.\n\n01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.420\nI don't have an intent to think of a band that I like hate.\n\n01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.220\nWhat's that song?\n\n01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.220\nLike, nope, nope, nope.\n\n01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.180\nNo, no, that's sticks.\n\n01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.340\nWhat's the fucking word?\n\n01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.380\nRoundabout.\n\n01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.620\nOK, Roundabout is a Yes song.\n\n01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.860\nI don't really feel that way about like, like, like, like.\n\n01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.460\nI was running a game.\n\n01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.660\nLike, there's bands and singers that I recognize are good,\n\n01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.220\nbecause again, I have no confidence in my own taste.\n\n01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:51.020\nBut I hate them the way I hate Apocalypse Now and stuff\n\n01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.820\nlike that, where I like, I resent the idea\n\n01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.300\nthat I'm not allowed to, to not be in love with them.\n\n01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.020\nLike Elvis Costello, I have, I don't, I don't, I don't.\n\n01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:58.780\nHold on.\n\n01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:01.140\nI don't hate Elvis Costello, but I,\n\n01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.180\nI hate the phenomenon of not being allowed\n\n01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180\nto hate Elvis Costello.\n\n01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.300\nI like a couple of Elvis Costello songs.\n\n01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.940\nI know, Dave, you love Elvis Costello.\n\n01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.660\nBut here's where the Elvis Costello,\n\n01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:14.180\nI heard quote saying that called Led Zeppelin,\n\n01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:17.660\nI believe he called them egregious charlatans.\n\n01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.060\nWow.\n\n01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:18.580\nYeah.\n\n01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.100\nI just, he, he pushes through his nose too much.\n\n01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100\nIt's so nasal.\n\n01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:28.100\nLike, I, like, like, it's so fucking nasal.\n\n01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:28.500\nI can't.\n\n01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.380\nWell, I guess goodbye Bob Dylan too.\n\n01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.700\nI fucking, I fucking hate Bob Dylan.\n\n01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.260\nBob Dylan is a fucking fraud and a fucking plagiarist\n\n01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.380\nto fuck Bob Dylan.\n\n01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:37.900\nYeah.\n\n01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.820\nDamn it.\n\n01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.900\nI mean, who, give me sticks any day.\n\n01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.940\nYeah.\n\n01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.820\nSticks, first concert I ever bought a joint at was at Sticks.\n\n01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.500\nUh-huh.\n\n01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.900\nI, first time I ever bought drugs at a concert was at Sticks\n\n01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.900\nwhen I was like 16.\n\n01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.300\nGood for you, good for you.\n\n01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:54.660\nYeah.\n\n01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.740\nWhat kind of drugs was it?\n\n01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.140\nI bought weed.\n\n01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.260\nI bought some, I bought some rolled joints.\n\n01:02:59.260 --> 01:02:59.980\nClassic.\n\n01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.540\nFrom a dude behind me.\n\n01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.020\nSaid, hey dude, you got some extra joints you can sell.\n\n01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.300\nWas that dude a robot?\n\n01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.580\nAnd did you say Domo Arigato to him?\n\n01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.340\nSticks doesn't sing that in concert anymore\n\n01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.220\nbecause they're ashamed of that song.\n\n01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.340\nThey actually don't, they don't do fucking Roboto.\n\n01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.140\nFuck Sticks.\n\n01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.820\nWhat's Japanese for, no thank you.\n\n01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.660\nNo Domo Arigato.\n\n01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.260\nNo Mo Arigato.\n\n01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.420\nNo Mo.\n\n01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.820\nNo.\n\n01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:25.580\nThat's good.\n\n01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.500\nYeah, see here's the thing, like I don't, like the Dao De Jing\n\n01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.020\nsays when you, if some things become beautiful,\n\n01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.780\nother things become ugly, like when you're talking about music,\n\n01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.820\nlike if some, if there's such a thing as a shitty band,\n\n01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.700\nyou know this music sucks, then like, I like Phil Collins,\n\n01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.900\nbut I recognize probably along with Phil Collins that like,\n\n01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:47.860\nyou know, 85% of his stuff is like Styrofoam\n\n01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.540\nand who knows about the last 15%, but like that he's prolific.\n\n01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.340\nHe just like, he, and he wouldn't be able to be\n\n01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.900\nif he listened to these thoughts that you're giving voice to\n\n01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.940\nwhen you talk about music.\n\n01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.460\nI was just saying, we drove by Ellis Island,\n\n01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:04.780\nwe must have talked about in the show,\n\n01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.220\nbut Dan sang Susu Studio and took his shirt off\n\n01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:13.060\nduring the song, security came in,\n\n01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:17.260\nthen Las Vegas PD came in, and we had to,\n\n01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.220\nYeah, it was a whole thing.\n\n01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.980\nDan had to change his clothes like,\n\n01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.580\nlike Sylvester Stallone and Victory,\n\n01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.460\nwhere he had to sneak him out of the fucking arena and-\n\n01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:26.620\nWhich aren't you allowed to do?\n\n01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.700\nTake your shirt off or sing Susu Studio?\n\n01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:33.940\nThe shirt off, which I was so surprised by\n\n01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.140\nuntil I really thought about it.\n\n01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.660\nBecause you're being goaded on by the woman that ran the bar,\n\n01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.860\nlike the bartender, she was like, like hyping you up kind of, right?\n\n01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:45.260\nDid she work there? There was an older woman,\n\n01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.780\nshe had a cigarette dangling from her mouth.\n\n01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.900\nThere were two racist women,\n\n01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:53.260\nthere was a mother and daughter team who were virulently racist,\n\n01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.300\nwho were talking shit about this very handsome black guy\n\n01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.900\nwho was wearing a nice suit,\n\n01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.460\nand they were saying awful, awful racist stuff,\n\n01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.260\nbut clearly the mother wanted to fuck the black guy.\n\n01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.380\nAnd then some college kids came in and sat on the front table,\n\n01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.620\nand it was me, you, Nick Vanne, Sam Simon of Simpsons fame,\n\n01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:16.420\nSchrab was there, a couple of the people,\n\n01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.780\nand then Dan got up and started singing Susu Studio.\n\n01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.180\nAnd he was being kind of peppered on by, I think,\n\n01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.580\neither the bartender or the karaoke...\n\n01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.860\nIt was a fairly empty place,\n\n01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.220\nand then there was like one kind of senior woman\n\n01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.580\nwho had this kind of charisma to her,\n\n01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.660\nbecause she was like into it,\n\n01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.420\nand so she came up to the foot of the stage\n\n01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.260\nand was like kind of dancing to me doing Susu Studio,\n\n01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.860\nand she was encouraging me, and I was playing to her,\n\n01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.260\nand then she said, like, take it off or something like that.\n\n01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:47.700\nSo Dan started kind of sexually slowly, like...\n\n01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.660\nSo being a long-form improviser.\n\n01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.180\nYeah.\n\n01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.460\nStarted taking his shirt off, and now the crowd has gone...\n\n01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.300\nLock, yeah.\n\n01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.580\nThe crowd has gone potty, now it's fucking hype.\n\n01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.020\nThen the security guard comes in, and he goes,\n\n01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.620\nHey, you can't...\n\n01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.780\nYeah, well, I was taking my pants off as well.\n\n01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.100\nYeah, well, there.\n\n01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.980\nDan got completely shirtless,\n\n01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.980\nand now the eight college kids, the two racist ladies,\n\n01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.420\nthe black guy, everybody was freaking out,\n\n01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.900\nand it was really good.\n\n01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:18.660\nAnd then two security guards come in wearing yellow shirts,\n\n01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.020\nand they had like mace...\n\n01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.020\nI feel like, and the hand was over the mace.\n\n01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.020\nOn a taser?\n\n01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.820\nYeah, they came out, not weapons drawn,\n\n01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.140\nbut weapons at the ready.\n\n01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.500\nAnd here was my mistake,\n\n01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.340\nand I know I've told the story of this podcast before,\n\n01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:30.820\nbut you might as well finish it.\n\n01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.500\nHere was my mistake, Dave Foley.\n\n01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.500\nAll right.\n\n01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.420\nThe security came in, and as soon as they said,\n\n01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:37.460\nlike, you can't do that, you can't take our clothes off in here.\n\n01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.980\nAnd I was like, as soon as they said that,\n\n01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.420\nI was mortified, I was like, oh, okay,\n\n01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.020\nI didn't, I started putting my clothes back on.\n\n01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.740\nAnd then I misguided, like,\n\n01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.940\nI thought I would do a bit that...\n\n01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.580\nIn this mistaken world where I live in,\n\n01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.180\nwhere everyone shares my entire vocabulary of references,\n\n01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.580\nI thought I would do an impression of Bono\n\n01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.340\nin the YouTube video,\n\n01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:05.020\nwhere they're getting shut down by the police on the rooftop.\n\n01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.620\nAnd I thought the security guards would have a laugh,\n\n01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:09.980\nand everyone would laugh, because I was like,\n\n01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.820\nit looks like they're trying to shut us down.\n\n01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.540\nBut no one got the reference.\n\n01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.820\nThey thought I was being completely sincere.\n\n01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.060\nBut that was the tipping point that everything was.\n\n01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.540\nThey were like, let them dance!\n\n01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:23.820\nJust let them dance!\n\n01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:30.620\nAnd in this Christmas tree of bad decision-making,\n\n01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.700\nthe security guards take that to heart\n\n01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.660\nand start engaging with the hecklers,\n\n01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.940\nand going like, hey, I don't tell you how to do your job,\n\n01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.060\nand then the people are like, what job, you fucking pig?\n\n01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.580\nBut the woman, the elderly racist woman\n\n01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.820\nthat was trying to fuck the black guy,\n\n01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.580\neven though she kept dropping horrible epithets\n\n01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.220\nat him whenever he walked away,\n\n01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.780\nshe spit on one of the security guards.\n\n01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.460\nAnd that's when things went fucking hell.\n\n01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:58.900\nThat's it, and they start clearing out the entire fucking bar.\n\n01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.900\nSix LVPD, like proper policemen,\n\n01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.860\ncame barging in and out.\n\n01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:07.740\nThese people have guns.\n\n01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.820\nWhile all this is happening, I'm on the karaoke stage,\n\n01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.980\nwhich is ironically now in the background.\n\n01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:22.740\nAnd an incredibly, impressively strategic Rob Schrab\n\n01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.980\nin this shining moment.\n\n01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:27.260\nI just feel this hand grab my wrist,\n\n01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.060\nand he just goes like, come on.\n\n01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.340\nAnd he just pulled me over to the giant booth,\n\n01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.140\nand they took Schrab's hat and jacket and put it on me.\n\n01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.860\nChanging clothes, like if you've ever seen the movie\n\n01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:44.140\nVictory with Michael Cain and Sylvester Stallone in Pele,\n\n01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.900\nthey changed clothes.\n\n01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:49.540\nAnd Rob put his beanie on, we have to get you out of here,\n\n01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.340\nbut you can't be wearing the same clothes\n\n01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340\nthat you were wearing.\n\n01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.620\nAnd Sam Simon was there.\n\n01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:57.220\nAnd now that the college kids, the woman\n\n01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.380\nspit on a police, on a security officer,\n\n01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.220\nthen the police came.\n\n01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.300\nNow the kids were like, hey, let them sing.\n\n01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.180\nAnd they came to your rescue.\n\n01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.980\nThese, like, fratty kind of sorority.\n\n01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.740\nEverybody was, yeah, it was a class war.\n\n01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.180\nAnd so now we're hiding in the background.\n\n01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.780\nAnd now there's a melee.\n\n01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.020\nLike, shit went wild.\n\n01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.620\nAnd we've sneaked out the back.\n\n01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.300\nAnd now we walk out, and there's loads of cop cars outside.\n\n01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.900\nAnd we're slithering down the side of the building at Ellis Island.\n\n01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.780\nPeople were being cuffed on hoods,\n\n01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.420\nbecause they cleared the bar out.\n\n01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.100\nEveryone's like, look at that, just have a fucking good time.\n\n01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.420\nWhy is that against the law?\n\n01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.260\nEveryone had completely forgotten.\n\n01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.580\nAnd the woman that spit on the cop\n\n01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.380\nwas like, you can't kick me out of here.\n\n01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.980\nLike, oh, no, no, the daughter goes, you can't throw her out.\n\n01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.020\nShe's my mother.\n\n01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.020\nAnd he goes, you're out of here, too.\n\n01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.980\nAnd then the fucking fratty's got in there,\n\n01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.220\nand the sorority has got in there.\n\n01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.900\nAnd then it was fucking chaos.\n\n01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.660\nAnd we used that distraction to get out of there.\n\n01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.220\nAnd the black guy in the suit's like,\n\n01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.500\nI thought I was already paying the price for this relationship.\n\n01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.700\nSo we're leaving Ellis Island, which is a terrible,\n\n01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.500\nterrible casino.\n\n01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.860\nBut they have karaoke every night.\n\n01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.900\nAnd they'll be like, there's like an Asian Elvis\n\n01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.300\nand a black Elvis and a fat Elvis and a wheelchair.\n\n01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.180\nBut they don't even know Elvis songs.\n\n01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.860\nThey just know how to dress up like Elvis.\n\n01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.180\nThey don't even know Elvis was a guy.\n\n01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.860\nThey just think that that's how you dress when\n\n01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.860\nyou're successful in Las Vegas.\n\n01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:19.620\nSo we're leaving.\n\n01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:22.060\nAnd Sam Simon, our dearly departed friend who,\n\n01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.980\nyou know, like, awesomely made Simpsons a thing.\n\n01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:26.900\nWe're leaving.\n\n01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.020\nAnd there's police everywhere.\n\n01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.820\nAnd the college kids are being thrown over the hood\n\n01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.140\nand being cuffed.\n\n01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.580\nLike, we're staying here at the best Western or whatever\n\n01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.540\nthe fucking shit hotel is there.\n\n01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.340\nAnd they're like, no, you're going to jail.\n\n01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.940\nAnd Sam Simon goes, yeah, but what about the guy\n\n01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.740\nthat took his shirt off during Phil Collins?\n\n01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.980\nShouldn't we be looking for him?\n\n01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.540\nAnd we had to walk like a half a mile\n\n01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.140\nto go to the fucking like some other hotel that used\n\n01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:58.180\nto be the maximum now is like the Western suites.\n\n01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.500\nWe had to walk a mile to go get a cab\n\n01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.980\nbecause we couldn't get one there.\n\n01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.540\nAnd it was, yeah, it's good karaoke.\n\n01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.540\nYeah.\n\n01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.420\nYeah.\n\n01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.460\nThat's probably the third time in eight years.\n\n01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.100\nLike, we told the story here on the show.\n\n01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.900\nInto the record.\n\n01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.620\nBut like, you know, I always wondered\n\n01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.060\nhow the Vegas riots started.\n\n01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:26.100\nBut of all songs to start some inflammatory awful shit,\n\n01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.140\nSue Sudio is the most anodyne like fucking nonsense.\n\n01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.900\nBut the reason why that all kicked off\n\n01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:35.340\nis because you were nailing it.\n\n01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.260\nYou were so good at it that people were encouraging you\n\n01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.260\nto be nude.\n\n01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:46.980\nWell, one person said take it off.\n\n01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.180\nIt was so good.\n\n01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.260\nWhen I was like 35, whatever I was,\n\n01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.420\nit was funnier to me in my underwear.\n\n01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:53.260\nIt was funnier.\n\n01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.900\nNow I think it's like a little creepy problem.\n\n01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.460\nI took my clothes off at the Traverse City Comedy Festival.\n\n01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:03.660\nAnd nothing happened.\n\n01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.700\nThere was no incident?\n\n01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.500\nNo, it was fine.\n\n01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.020\nNo, people just had a good time.\n\n01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.100\nFully, full naked?\n\n01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:10.660\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.420\nYeah, cock out.\n\n01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:11.920\nYeah.\n\n01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.700\nSo did you cover it?\n\n01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.020\nDid you like, cup your hands over it?\n\n01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:20.660\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.020\nThat was the whole point.\n\n01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.620\nThere was someone in the audience who just\n\n01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.260\nhad to take it off, and everyone started cheering.\n\n01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.340\nAnd I went, all right, fuck it.\n\n01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.420\nI was still drinking in those days.\n\n01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.300\nWhat's it like down there?\n\n01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.020\nWhat's the deal?\n\n01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.580\nBe honest in your objective appraisal.\n\n01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.620\nBe graphic and honest about your genitals.\n\n01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:47.100\nBecause I've heard that your penis is shaped exactly\n\n01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:52.500\nlike an ampersand.\n\n01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.980\nI'm trying to think the best way.\n\n01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:05.460\nI'm fluctuating between adorable and beneficent.\n\n01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.100\nThat's the sweet spot.\n\n01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:07.860\nYeah.\n\n01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.780\nMy penis looks like a third nipple\n\n01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.060\nperched on top of two pendulous tumors.\n\n01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.100\nBecause Dan has enormous balls.\n\n01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:24.660\nYou have conspicuous balls.\n\n01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.100\nOr they may look enormous because, as Ryan Ridley has said,\n\n01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.860\nit's like a bus park next to the UPCON Center.\n\n01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.380\nI'm not saying even by contrast.\n\n01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.700\nI'm saying you have a small dick,\n\n01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.460\nbut your balls are needlessly large.\n\n01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.380\nThere's no.\n\n01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:42.860\nI know.\n\n01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.140\nIt's like, what's the deal?\n\n01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:47.300\nWhat are you going to do with them?\n\n01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.180\nExactly.\n\n01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.020\nWe discussed with Heather Anne Campbell.\n\n01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.380\nI've never dropped what I would call a load.\n\n01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.940\nI'll emit a desperate, dime-sized.\n\n01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.820\nBut your balls are like the size of like if you bifurcated\n\n01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.300\na cantaloupe and made two balls out of it.\n\n01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.260\nIt looks like a cantaloupe, but with a cleft.\n\n01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.980\nYou have giant, giant, giant testicle.\n\n01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.780\nYeah.\n\n01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:26.260\nPicture Garfield the cat, his eyes,\n\n01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.020\nand then a little dick in between them.\n\n01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.580\nLike Garfield's nose, but on top.\n\n01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.580\nIf Garfield's nose was on top of his eyes.\n\n01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.860\nOr if Garfield's just upside down.\n\n01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:40.180\nJust picture two big balls and a little dick.\n\n01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.700\nYou could probably do that.\n\n01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.940\nYou would think, though, that you would have dropped\n\n01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:45.060\nlarger loads without it.\n\n01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.140\nYeah, you know, you'd think I would cum like buckets\n\n01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:50.700\nand be like, that's how you make up for it.\n\n01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:54.460\nUgh, my auto from the Simpsons.\n\n01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.620\nWhose response would that be?\n\n01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.220\nHis dick was little, but oh, so much cum.\n\n01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.780\nWell, ostensibly.\n\n01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.580\nSo much.\n\n01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.900\nI guess God, whatever maniac is behind all these decisions,\n\n01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:10.340\nit's just like, well, I want to find out.\n\n01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.700\nHow do you know you're going to play with these attributes?\n\n01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.140\nLadies love a good drenching.\n\n01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:20.340\nFrom a little dick troll.\n\n01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.260\nThere's certainly a market for tiny dick and too much cum.\n\n01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.740\nI have a penis that usually gets this response.\n\n01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.940\nOh, so much better than I was expecting.\n\n01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.540\nI thought I was going to have to be polite,\n\n01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.020\nbecause you don't expect much from me.\n\n01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.700\nBecause you're beneficent.\n\n01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.220\nYeah.\n\n01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.180\nYeah, you're like a pope.\n\n01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.420\nYeah, that's the thing.\n\n01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.980\nI'm so not sexy in general that it's a pleasure to press.\n\n01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:50.220\nI have been telling women, like if they've heard my rhetoric\n\n01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:56.900\nleading to their maiden foolishity, but doir.\n\n01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.060\nThere's no foreplay like returitions.\n\n01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.820\nThey'll be like, oh, I was actually\n\n01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.140\nanticipating like a micro penis situation,\n\n01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.300\nlike clinically, like small.\n\n01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.780\nAnd shout out to my micro penis listeners.\n\n01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:16.580\nLike, you know, I find it, you know, like, I don't, I mean,\n\n01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:22.540\nlook, I don't like dick size being bandied about as a metric.\n\n01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.100\nHow about this?\n\n01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.580\nEveryone here with a micro penis stand up.\n\n01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.860\nGet a round of applause.\n\n01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:28.700\nYou're good people, micro penises.\n\n01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.740\nOnly women stood up.\n\n01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.580\nYeah, because, yeah, all right.\n\n01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:45.380\nFinally, my giant clitoris can be contextualized in a,\n\n01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.860\nwell, we've gone too far, haven't we?\n\n01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:49.340\nHave we?\n\n01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.020\nIt's that time in the show.\n\n01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.100\nThe thing is now, like, now that we're\n\n01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.220\nticking down to the dying days of Harmontown.\n\n01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:57.700\nYeah.\n\n01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.020\nWe're going to have some weird stuff.\n\n01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.340\nLet's not leave anything, any stone unturned.\n\n01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.580\nThis is like the death rattle?\n\n01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.900\nYeah, it is.\n\n01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:11.140\nI'm glad you came here for the death rattle, Dave Foley.\n\n01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.340\nBasically, that's my career.\n\n01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.420\nDave Foley, can I, one of my favorite things about you,\n\n01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.460\nbecause Dave Foley loves coffee.\n\n01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.260\nAnd are you currently drinking coffee?\n\n01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:19.740\nI was.\n\n01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.980\nThis was full of coffee when I came out here.\n\n01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.820\nThis is the only time I've seen you without coffee.\n\n01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.460\nYeah, this is why I ran out.\n\n01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.340\nAnd I didn't plan ahead.\n\n01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.580\nWhat was the thing when you were on news radio\n\n01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.940\nand you got the inquirer?\n\n01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.580\nMy only time in the National Inquirer.\n\n01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.380\nWhat was the headline?\n\n01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:42.620\nIt said, Dave Foley admits to drinking 50 cups of coffee a day,\n\n01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.700\nwhich I wouldn't consider a huge admission.\n\n01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.460\nBut it was true.\n\n01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:49.420\nMy favorite is that also Dave has trouble sleeping.\n\n01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.820\nYeah, I know.\n\n01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.980\nAnd Greg Proops in the road is like,\n\n01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.220\nyou know that if you drink less coffee, you're like,\n\n01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.540\nhey, if I wanted to have this shit,\n\n01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:00.580\nI could get this to home.\n\n01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.020\nBut is there a correlation?\n\n01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.860\nWere you already insomniac before you drank coffee?\n\n01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.380\nI've been an insomniac since I was about, like, four years old.\n\n01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.460\nTo pre-coffee you were insomniac.\n\n01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.660\nYeah, I was a worried four-year-old.\n\n01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.460\nWhat was your main worry at four years old?\n\n01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.260\nGlobal warming.\n\n01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.100\nI had a good time.\n\n01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:18.860\nI was really ahead of you.\n\n01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:21.580\nDo you have nightmares when you do sleep?\n\n01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.620\nInsomnia, I feel like people misunderstand it.\n\n01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.900\nBecause to me, it sounds like a superpower.\n\n01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.300\nI hate falling asleep.\n\n01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.700\nI'm like, god damn it, I was just getting into this.\n\n01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.860\nI have trouble sleeping at night.\n\n01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.140\nI can sleep in the day easily.\n\n01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.940\nI love sleeping in the day.\n\n01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:35.940\nI said trouble sleeping at night.\n\n01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.060\nYeah, on the van or the tour bus, you can sack right out.\n\n01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.460\nYeah, I'm good at napping.\n\n01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.500\nYou're a good napper.\n\n01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.060\nBut at night, I sort of stay up and just.\n\n01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.260\nIf you get some Rachel Maddow and some headphones,\n\n01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.060\nyou're good to go.\n\n01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.060\nYes.\n\n01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.740\nThat's my MSNBC and a cup of coffee.\n\n01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.100\nThe day full is ready to go.\n\n01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.500\nBecause it's comforting, because I know that I can fall asleep\n\n01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.540\nduring one show, and then the next show\n\n01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:57.780\nwill say the exact same thing.\n\n01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.580\nRight.\n\n01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.660\nSo I don't have to worry about missing anything.\n\n01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.580\nLike, if Chris Hage is taken, then I'll wake up to Maddow's.\n\n01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:05.740\nWait, is that the shouting guy?\n\n01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.540\nWho's the shouting guy?\n\n01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:07.980\nOh, that's Chris Matthews.\n\n01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.580\nYeah, he's a little crazy.\n\n01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.220\nYeah, I can.\n\n01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.180\nHe's just yelling.\n\n01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.100\nIs 50 cups an exaggeration?\n\n01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:13.700\nNope.\n\n01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.180\nBut is that now not true, or are you still 50?\n\n01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:22.100\nNow, I probably, like today, I've probably had 10 espressos.\n\n01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.180\nThat seems mathematically.\n\n01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.540\n50 cups seems mathematically impossible.\n\n01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:28.060\nBut I guess probably none of you get up and you start doing this.\n\n01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:32.860\nI would have a 10-cup pot of coffee at home before going to work.\n\n01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:33.860\nSo that's 10 right there.\n\n01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.740\nAnd then through the day.\n\n01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.780\nThe proplety is, I forget their names, because they don't.\n\n01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.180\nIt's Jody Mann.\n\n01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.500\nAnd she would, they kept two thermoses of coffee\n\n01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.140\non their prop wagon so that I would stop going to get coffee.\n\n01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:49.020\nAnd they were just pointing, they're the ones who told me.\n\n01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.700\nThey said, you've had 50 cups today.\n\n01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.020\nSo that's how I found out.\n\n01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.500\nIs that post-drinking, or was it?\n\n01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.900\nDuring drinking, yeah.\n\n01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:00.140\nYou mean, was it like after night of drinking?\n\n01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.540\nSome people get sober, and then their coffee's there for them.\n\n01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.860\nOh, no, I didn't get sober until like five years ago, Christmas.\n\n01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.220\nSo coffee was always a thing, and that was just like a fight.\n\n01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.780\nI knew this would be coffee up until like 10 o'clock.\n\n01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.220\nAnd then Jody would start bringing me whiskey.\n\n01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:20.060\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.140\nThey had, when I did this show with John Larroquette,\n\n01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.460\nthey had a little in the prop fridge.\n\n01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.220\nThere was a secret pitcher, and they\n\n01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.660\nwould go, we're going to tell a couple people about this.\n\n01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.780\nAnd they had a cocktail of the week.\n\n01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.980\nAnd so they'd be like, Cosmopolitan's in a pitcher,\n\n01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.940\nand they would just give you a little styrofoam cup,\n\n01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.940\nand that was your secret cocktail.\n\n01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.660\nBut that was the same people.\n\n01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.980\nBut you just said one day, fuck it.\n\n01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.380\nAnd you didn't go through programs.\n\n01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.660\nYou just said, I quit.\n\n01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.700\nYeah, yeah, just stopped.\n\n01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:48.980\nJust cold turkeyed it.\n\n01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.140\nYep.\n\n01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:55.100\nI had the advantage of massive brain trauma.\n\n01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:55.860\nOh, that's right.\n\n01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.940\nYou broke your fucking.\n\n01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.300\nI broke my brain.\n\n01:20:59.300 --> 01:20:59.820\nWhat happened?\n\n01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:00.700\nYou fell on the ground?\n\n01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.980\nI fell down at the must downtown, which\n\n01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.540\nwas around the corner from where I lived.\n\n01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.740\nAnd you were found like just like you were just laying?\n\n01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:09.500\nI passed out, fell on the patio, and cracked my head.\n\n01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:14.140\nAnd I hit the patio so hard that my brain gave me a black eye\n\n01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.260\nfrom inside my skull.\n\n01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:15.760\nWow.\n\n01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:25.400\nOh, and then I woke up in the ICU with my ex-wife\n\n01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.040\nand my daughter standing there.\n\n01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.320\nAnd we were going to go to New York after Christmas.\n\n01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.880\nAnd it was one of these guys who went, hey, I think\n\n01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.840\nI'm going to quit drinking.\n\n01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840\nAnd was there?\n\n01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.800\nYeah, it was like, OK, there's rock bottom,\n\n01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:45.240\nand there's like, is there a positive kind of like when\n\n01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.880\nyou're struggling to overcome it,\n\n01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.240\nis there like a kind of what's the question I'm trying to ask?\n\n01:21:52.240 --> 01:22:00.080\nLike a realization you had that kind of makes you strong\n\n01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.200\nas opposed to just going, oh, this is fucked up.\n\n01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.760\nAnd I think I'll quit drinking.\n\n01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.960\nBut at the time, I thought, oh, I might not really do it.\n\n01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.960\nBecause I thought this might be hard.\n\n01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:17.400\nBut the brain injury seemed to actually\n\n01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.520\ncure me of alcohol.\n\n01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.680\nYou might have been one of these privileged people that\n\n01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.320\nfell down while drunk and injured the part of their brain\n\n01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.000\nthat loves drinking.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.280\nYeah, and that's what happened.\n\n01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.000\nAnd also like my depression went away, too.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:31.520\nWhat?\n\n01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.000\nYeah, I've been dealing with depression most of my life.\n\n01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.120\nYou're like alfalfa from the Arging.\n\n01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.680\nA lot of people become serial killers.\n\n01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.800\nWell, yeah, or they suddenly can speak French.\n\n01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.160\nPeople have had head injuries, and then\n\n01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:45.480\nthey can play the piano.\n\n01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.880\nSometimes they turn invisible.\n\n01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.600\nI mean, that's killing in X Island, but.\n\n01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.720\nYeah, oh, I would have been cool.\n\n01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.240\nOh, man.\n\n01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.600\nYou've got to hit just the right spot.\n\n01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.400\nIt's not worth trying.\n\n01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:54.800\nI'm going to try it again.\n\n01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.840\nIt's the part of your brain that makes you invisible,\n\n01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.560\nor keeps you from being invisible,\n\n01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.240\nit's nestled right within the part that\n\n01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.800\nkeeps your heart going.\n\n01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.320\nSometimes I think I'd like to just hit it again\n\n01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.880\nwith a brick or something just so I could start drinking again.\n\n01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.600\nJust have a man who hadn't, and then like, yeah.\n\n01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.160\nWell, because now you know if you get too drunk\n\n01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.200\nand get this failsafe.\n\n01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:15.700\nYeah.\n\n01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.200\nYeah.\n\n01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:18.700\nYeah.\n\n01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:22.120\nI think there was something that my therapist told me\n\n01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:25.640\nabout drinking that, to me, was if I ever\n\n01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.000\nshould choose to stop, like this would\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.240\nbe in the forefront of my brain, which is that when you're 12,\n\n01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:36.520\nwhich is when I'm going to make a guess,\n\n01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.640\nthe guys like you and me maybe had our first experiences\n\n01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:44.640\nwith this liquor, and it's like, oh my god,\n\n01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.240\nthere's this amazing experience, and then your friends\n\n01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.680\nare like, yeah, that was kind of fun, but now my head hurts,\n\n01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.240\nand you're like, I'm Peter Pan.\n\n01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:59.120\nAnd when you're 15, 17, 19, 25, your neurology\n\n01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:04.680\nkeeps growing tree roots around this thing.\n\n01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.480\nAnd it very, well, at a certain point,\n\n01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.000\nit can not only start to lose its actual benefits,\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.680\nits medicinal benefits, but it actually, I mean,\n\n01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.920\nit can lose them entirely.\n\n01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.080\nIt can become just a plain old poison,\n\n01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.320\nand yet the tree roots of your brain\n\n01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.440\nhave kind of like organized themselves\n\n01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:27.480\nin a relationship around the space occupied by this thing,\n\n01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.120\nwhich stops giving you the same kind of, you know,\n\n01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.040\nafter a while, it's like, well, I'm 46.\n\n01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.080\nWhen I get shit-faced drunk, I am no longer\n\n01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.320\nthe hilarious person I was, perhaps.\n\n01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.680\nI might get more depressed.\n\n01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.280\nI might get more blackout.\n\n01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.120\nI might lose my memory more.\n\n01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.000\nIt might become, it's a different thing.\n\n01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.640\nAnd I think that part of it, when somebody\n\n01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.040\ntalks about quitting drinking, like for me,\n\n01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.280\nthe part of my brain that resists it is like, yeah,\n\n01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.640\nbut drinking's always, you know, like, I don't\n\n01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.520\nwant to make that big change.\n\n01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.320\nBut I think that's why it's interesting,\n\n01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.360\nI thought, for my therapist to point out, like, yeah,\n\n01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.160\nbut the change has already happened.\n\n01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.640\nLike, you're already quitting drinking.\n\n01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.520\nYou already quit that relationship\n\n01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:19.520\nwith that wonderful potion that made you happy.\n\n01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.880\nThat relationship is long since over,\n\n01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.840\nand you're dancing with the coffin of this ex-girlfriend\n\n01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.960\nthat left you a long time ago.\n\n01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.920\nShe didn't put it that way.\n\n01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.800\nI'm very articulate because I'm drunk.\n\n01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.640\nI was going to say your therapist is really poetic.\n\n01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.120\nDancing with the coffin of your ex-girlfriend.\n\n01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.040\nShe probably said, you know, it's like Stewie when\n\n01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.000\nhe did the thing and then my eyes glazed over.\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nThe thing was, I think when you're drunk,\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.240\nit becomes a big part of how you define yourself, too.\n\n01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.840\nLike, when you're a drinker, like, for me,\n\n01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.880\nit was, you know, being a drinker and being a hard drinker\n\n01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.560\nwas a big part of how I, like, how I, you know,\n\n01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.440\nwhat I envisioned myself to be.\n\n01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.920\nAnd along the way, and I'll say this,\n\n01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.000\nnot to enable anybody listening or anything,\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.120\nbut it's like, but to acknowledge\n\n01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.880\npart of the reason why we can get stuck in our ways\n\n01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.360\nis because, whether it's smoking, video games, drinking,\n\n01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.840\nor anything, what happens is it brings out\n\n01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.000\nbehaviors and attitudes in the people around you.\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.440\nSo it's not only defining you.\n\n01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:21.520\nIt's defining how you relate to other people.\n\n01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.440\nWell, that's like, because there was one other time\n\n01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.680\nI woke up in a hospital after drinking,\n\n01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.080\nbut that time I didn't quit drinking.\n\n01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.240\nIn fact, I woke up and I had an IV in my arm,\n\n01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.200\nand I sort of took that out and said, where the hell am I?\n\n01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.440\nAnd was walking out and the doctor,\n\n01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.960\nas I was walking out, just said, you know,\n\n01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.440\nyou really have to quit drinking.\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.600\nAnd I just announced, first, everyone else\n\n01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.440\nhas to get a lot more interesting.\n\n01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:51.440\nYeah, yeah, I mean, that sounds very familiar to me.\n\n01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.240\nBut apparently that happened because now\n\n01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.200\nyou don't drink anymore.\n\n01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.480\nYeah, I always said, I drink to make you,\n\n01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.360\nall of you, smarter, something hilarious like that.\n\n01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.200\nI was like, yeah, but it's like, there's\n\n01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.360\nthe self-deluded part of that, but then there's also\n\n01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.200\nthe kind of like, as a former smoker of cigarettes,\n\n01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:19.040\nit's too easy to just say, oh, I was doing this terrible thing\n\n01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.960\nby smoking, and then I stopped, and it was a zero-sum game.\n\n01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.120\nIt's like, while I was a smoker, there\n\n01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.160\nwere many positive things to say about it,\n\n01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:30.440\nand they were all socially-based, because the kinds of people\n\n01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.480\nwho would get on your ass about how you were a smoker,\n\n01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:37.280\nthat was a red flag for the kind of relationship\n\n01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.000\nthat I didn't want to engage in.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.080\nI don't think I was denying myself\n\n01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.240\nthe friendship of people that would have made my life better.\n\n01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.840\nWell, every friendship and relationship I had started drunk.\n\n01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:56.640\nEvery woman I was ever with, it started out drinking.\n\n01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.240\nAnd every friendship, I think, started out drinking\n\n01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.800\nafter the age of about 14.\n\n01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.560\nAnd so it was very beneficial for a long, long time.\n\n01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.240\nWhat's the world's oldest medicine?\n\n01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.120\nI mean, it really was a medicine.\n\n01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.160\nAnd it made me, and I was like, I don't like,\n\n01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.840\nthere's like weed always makes me feel like I'm ugly and stupid.\n\n01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.520\nAnd then you haven't paid taxes, so you're\n\n01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.360\ngoing to have a heart attack.\n\n01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.840\nAnd drinking always made me feel like I was beautiful and smart.\n\n01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.760\nAlways felt very beautiful.\n\n01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.440\nIt made your penis beneficent.\n\n01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.120\nYes.\n\n01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.200\nBeatific.\n\n01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.320\nBeatific.\n\n01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.560\nI love the beatitudes of your balls.\n\n01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.480\nYes.\n\n01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.320\nYeah.\n\n01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.200\nYeah.\n\n01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.400\nYeah, and there's a sweet lofty zone in there.\n\n01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.480\nAnd I think you're always kind of chasing that spot.\n\n01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.360\nAnd it continues to shrink and become less and less reliable.\n\n01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.440\nAnd it's like, oh, this euphoria, this medicinal quality.\n\n01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.800\nAnd as of late, what I've noticed\n\n01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.200\nis that it's becoming more and more calculatably predictable\n\n01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:05.000\nthat I'll use superfluous adverbs.\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.920\nCalculatably predictable.\n\n01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.640\nJust say, oh, like a normal person\n\n01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.640\nif you don't know what you're going to say next.\n\n01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.640\nExcuse me.\n\n01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:19.440\nBut that my mood will just take a crash,\n\n01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.720\nwhich it feels like something I can observe because of therapy.\n\n01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:26.040\nBecause my therapist, among the many things\n\n01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:30.120\nthat I like about her, she never forced that hand.\n\n01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.640\nI think she probably senses in me\n\n01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:39.200\nthat this is a tough beast to get around\n\n01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.440\nand that she would just join many skulls on Golgotha\n\n01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.840\nif she were to try to engage me about my drinking.\n\n01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.640\nAnd so she makes sure I know that she's not here to make me quit.\n\n01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.320\nAnd that way, for that reason, because I can trust her,\n\n01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.240\nI've had more conversations about drinking in my relationship\n\n01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.040\nwith her than I've ever had in my life\n\n01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.120\nwith a qualified professional who knows all about it.\n\n01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:08.040\nAnd I forgot the rest of what I was going to say.\n\n01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.280\nSpencer, you don't drink really.\n\n01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.200\nBut didn't you also quit weed?\n\n01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.200\nOr are you just kind of like ratchet that back?\n\n01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.200\nI'm back, baby.\n\n01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.680\nNo, I don't really buy weed or anything,\n\n01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.520\nbut I'll smoke it with other people or whatever.\n\n01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.320\nYou don't have to.\n\n01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.320\nTom Jones doesn't buy panties.\n\n01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.880\nAnd he's wearing them everywhere.\n\n01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.960\nWere you ever weedy, like Dave?\n\n01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.960\nI would only smoke weed when I was blind drunk.\n\n01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.200\nAnd yeah, because otherwise, it would just\n\n01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.280\nmake me really paranoid.\n\n01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.120\nDoes it bother you when we're on the road together\n\n01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.400\nbecause the rest of the cast of Whose Life\n\n01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.440\nwe're always drinking, doesn't matter to you?\n\n01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.040\nNo, I actually prefer, I don't like being around sober people.\n\n01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:54.960\nThey're horrible.\n\n01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:58.320\nAlso, Dave on the road carries around a little speaker,\n\n01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.240\nand there's always jazz music wherever he goes.\n\n01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:01.760\nThat's cool.\n\n01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.720\nHe just carries around, like after the show,\n\n01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.680\nwe're taking pictures of people or signing stuff or whatever.\n\n01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.560\nAnd Dave just has this awesome affinity of just like,\n\n01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.520\nit's not like you foisted on people.\n\n01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:16.280\nThere's just always a beautiful soundtrack happening.\n\n01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:17.880\nAnd then when you're not there, it's a bummer\n\n01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.400\nbecause we live in abject silence.\n\n01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.160\nOne of you could get a speaker.\n\n01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:25.760\nNo, we're too drunk.\n\n01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.400\nReggie Watts was at the Harmon Quest premiere.\n\n01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:34.760\nHe gave me a free sample of the beta test of his cartridge\n\n01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.560\nthat he's developing.\n\n01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.040\nReggie Watts is trying to develop a weed cartridge.\n\n01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.680\nIt's great time for weed babies.\n\n01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.880\nJust as they're about to be banned.\n\n01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.080\nYeah, I guess that's how it did.\n\n01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.960\nYou read the New York Times thing about the bust in Wisconsin?\n\n01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.720\nThe two guys?\n\n01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.400\nNo, no.\n\n01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.360\nI guess they were doing like.\n\n01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:54.000\nYeah, I didn't understand this whole vaping thing.\n\n01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.960\nIt was like this running gag happening.\n\n01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.520\nBecause Cody was a fucking, what are those things called?\n\n01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.960\nJules.\n\n01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.440\nShe was a jewelhound.\n\n01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.720\nAnd I'm so glad she got scared off of it,\n\n01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.760\nwhether it was valid or not, because I just\n\n01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.320\nhated that she was like sucking down nicotine\n\n01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.080\nbecause I was a smoker until I was 32.\n\n01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.520\nAnd anyways, hey, me, get off my lawn.\n\n01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:14.520\nGood night.\n\n01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:20.840\nBut I guess what it is, is that because POTS not\n\n01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.520\nlegalized everywhere and then vape cartridges,\n\n01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.000\nso they kind of open the window.\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.400\nSo it's like, yeah, and it's like making gin in a bathtub.\n\n01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:35.440\nThere's just a lot of invitation for people\n\n01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:42.120\nlike homebrew weed juice, oil, and it's\n\n01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.080\nlike you put anything in there that you think\n\n01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.160\ngets the job done.\n\n01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.080\nAnd apparently, something that some people are putting in.\n\n01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.400\nApparently, vitamin E oil they were using.\n\n01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.840\nYeah, and is that what makes it long to turn into?\n\n01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.360\nIt was linked, but who knows?\n\n01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.080\nIt seems, though, as Dan was saying,\n\n01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.840\nit was just more tainted, specific tainted stuff.\n\n01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.800\nThat was gray market stuff.\n\n01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.760\nBut vitamin E is used in legal stuff.\n\n01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.480\nI don't know.\n\n01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.360\nBut I mean, there's been no studies\n\n01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.280\nabout how safe or unsafe vaping is.\n\n01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:10.840\nLike, I don't think we've ever done it.\n\n01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.520\nWe're in really good one.\n\n01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:15.880\nI apply vitamin E oil to my lungs topically.\n\n01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.000\nAnd that's been fine.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:20.520\nBut it's weird.\n\n01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.800\nThey're banning flavored tobacco cartridges, which I'm\n\n01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.300\ncertain.\n\n01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:25.800\nThat's good.\n\n01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.840\nI'm fairly certain they're not linked to any of the anything.\n\n01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.720\nIt's like a single case I don't think\n\n01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.960\nis linked to actual flavored tobacco.\n\n01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.080\nNo, no, that's just linked to we don't\n\n01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.880\nwant our children to die of cancer.\n\n01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.560\nSure.\n\n01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.720\nDoes it give you cancer?\n\n01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:42.400\nDoes vapor?\n\n01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.760\nNo, no, the tobacco products that\n\n01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.520\nare like candy floss flavored, that they're not\n\n01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.120\nmarketing to children, mind you.\n\n01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.320\nRight, but does the vaping itself,\n\n01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.880\ndoes that actually lead to cancer?\n\n01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.000\nOr is it just a fear that they're talking to them on?\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.200\nThey don't really know.\n\n01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:55.880\nThey don't know.\n\n01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.760\nThey say there's some heavy metals.\n\n01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:00.200\nThere are some heavy metals in vaping.\n\n01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:00.700\nRight.\n\n01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.200\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.160\nThere's metal pieces in when you get heated up.\n\n01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.600\nSome of the molecules fly off the surface of the metal.\n\n01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.800\nAnd that's definitely great.\n\n01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:16.880\nBecause I use the CBD vape pens because I'm old, sure.\n\n01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.360\nAnd I don't want my bones to hurt.\n\n01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.200\nBut I love those.\n\n01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.880\nThose are great for arthritis.\n\n01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.120\nI did a little puff off of a DMT pen, and I like it.\n\n01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.200\nAnd you saw the dwarves that build time.\n\n01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:35.440\nSo I'm pretty sure I hung out with a palm tree\n\n01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.720\nfor about 15 minutes.\n\n01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.720\nWait, are you serious?\n\n01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.720\nYou did DMT?\n\n01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.560\nOut of a pen, like a vape pen.\n\n01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.040\nI thought DMT was sort of a free base.\n\n01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.040\nThe idea of it coming out of a pen is kind of like a.\n\n01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.560\nI think it's not as strong.\n\n01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.800\nI've never done DMT properly.\n\n01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.560\nBut I did it out of a pen.\n\n01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:53.120\nAnd there was like a Joshua tree.\n\n01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.040\nAnd I was like, hey, Betty.\n\n01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.840\nI was grooved chickens for a while.\n\n01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.920\nAnd then it was over.\n\n01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.760\nJeff was grooved chickens.\n\n01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.960\nIt only lasts like 15 minutes, right?\n\n01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.960\nJoe Rogan's a big DMT guy.\n\n01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:04.460\nWho?\n\n01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:04.960\nJoe Rogan.\n\n01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:05.720\nTake it enough.\n\n01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:11.520\nHe's like an expert on DMT and other psychedelics.\n\n01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.600\nI'm too old to try transformative stuff.\n\n01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.560\nLike, I'm not going to.\n\n01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.960\nLike, I maybe think maybe I would do ayahuasca before I'm 50.\n\n01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.760\nI'd like to do that.\n\n01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.260\nYeah.\n\n01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.840\nLike, let's do it on the final Harmontown.\n\n01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.480\nYeah.\n\n01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.480\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.480\nI'm in.\n\n01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:31.520\nWe can say fully Spencer, Dan, me, Curtis Armstrong,\n\n01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:34.760\nand we fucking and we just just to ayahuasca.\n\n01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.840\nAll right, because I like that ayahuasca at least\n\n01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.120\nis kind of like transparent about it.\n\n01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.040\nThey're like, this is probably going to be awful.\n\n01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:40.520\nYeah.\n\n01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.320\nYou're going to puke in a bucket while you're\n\n01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.920\nlike, don't you barf for a while?\n\n01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.160\nDon't you have to like go puke for a lot of drugs\n\n01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:50.200\nthat are poisonous, but but ayahuasca is a poison\n\n01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.280\nthat's drug in us.\n\n01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.720\nIs anybody here done ayahuasca proper two or three?\n\n01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:58.800\nDid you go out of town?\n\n01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.080\nOr did you like Costa Rica?\n\n01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:07.920\nOr that's because you wanted to be with the legit shaman.\n\n01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.560\nYeah, I didn't.\n\n01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.480\nI did it in Bushwick next to a guy.\n\n01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.320\nYeah.\n\n01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.880\nYou're going to talk dangerous.\n\n01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:25.120\nWere you at a house or like a party or what did you do?\n\n01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.320\nOh, you're kidding.\n\n01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:29.960\nYou had a friend that could fly in a shaman into into Brooklyn.\n\n01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.320\nBut that's the shittiest part of ayahuasca is the shaman.\n\n01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.640\nBullshit spirituality.\n\n01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:39.640\nNo, but he's the guy that tells you where to barf\n\n01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.680\nand where not to barf and things like that, right?\n\n01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.560\nYeah.\n\n01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.680\nI want to do it.\n\n01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:45.680\nBut I don't want to do this like the touristy thing\n\n01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.800\nwhere you have to go be in a waterfall at Machu Picchu\n\n01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.400\nor whatever the fuck.\n\n01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.840\nI'd rather go to Brooklyn and do it.\n\n01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.480\nBrooklyn, you know, but with a shaman,\n\n01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.800\nI will do it like however the people tell me to do it.\n\n01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.680\nBecause I do not want to go off the rails.\n\n01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.680\nIt's probably illegal and stupid to say\n\n01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:02.120\nthat we're going to do the finale of harm and temper.\n\n01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:02.600\nProbably.\n\n01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:03.800\nWe're all going to be in ayahuasca.\n\n01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.240\nWell, it takes six hours.\n\n01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.200\nYou take six hours.\n\n01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:06.640\nWell, DMT.\n\n01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.320\nHoly shit.\n\n01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:11.560\nBut the effective drug in ayahuasca is DMT.\n\n01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.000\nIs it?\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:12.720\nOh, really?\n\n01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:13.640\nYeah.\n\n01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.480\nI did that in a pool.\n\n01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.800\nThat just comes in a pen.\n\n01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.800\nYeah, and you don't even have to get a shaman.\n\n01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.920\nPocket shaman.\n\n01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:23.720\nI love you.\n\n01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.800\nMy husband's boss is coming over for dinner.\n\n01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.200\nI haven't made the casserole.\n\n01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:32.840\nHello.\n\n01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.960\nI'm pocket shaman.\n\n01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.840\nI can't trip.\n\n01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.080\nThat'll be six hours.\n\n01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:37.800\nYes, you can.\n\n01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.680\nJust one hit.\n\n01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.120\nI'm a pen.\n\n01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:43.320\nWhoa, dwarves build time.\n\n01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.160\nI'm back.\n\n01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.120\nNow make that casserole.\n\n01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.120\nBut aware of the fact that casserole doesn't matter.\n\n01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.480\nThank you, pocket shaman.\n\n01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.800\nGod, I wish it were 10 o'clock so we\n\n01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.240\ncould end the show on that joke.\n\n01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.320\nChemical release by DMT may be the chemical release\n\n01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.600\nin your brain when you die.\n\n01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:06.480\nMember FDIC.\n\n01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.200\nI just did a little bit of it.\n\n01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.560\nI didn't get super duper high, but there was a tree,\n\n01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.360\nand we had a thing.\n\n01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:19.640\nAnd it was kind of a romantic moment with a tree.\n\n01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.320\nI'm going up to the Storm Area 51 thing.\n\n01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:23.880\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.760\nSo that would be a good time to do DMT.\n\n01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.160\nThat's this Friday.\n\n01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:30.520\nDidn't Keanu Reeves say he was going to fucking make it?\n\n01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.600\nI don't know.\n\n01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:35.000\nApparently he tweeted and said, I'll see you there.\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:35.960\nSo like what?\n\n01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.520\nI think we should do a test run on a normal military base\n\n01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.520\nfirst, just to make sure this is a good idea.\n\n01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.840\nBefore we go to the one that made the whole event.\n\n01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.240\nI think Area 51 is probably, I think\n\n01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.320\nwe have a fence outside of a fence,\n\n01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.120\nand you have to get through that fence first.\n\n01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.120\nThey have sensors for the miles and miles of desert\n\n01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.000\nsurrounding them before you get to the fence.\n\n01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.560\nYou don't get to the fence before I like a jeep show.\n\n01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.440\nLet's say it was 7,000 people.\n\n01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.880\nWell, the one I'm going to is just\n\n01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.240\nlike they're calling it the base camp,\n\n01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.760\nand they're not near the base, and they're not\n\n01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:10.600\ngoing to storm the base.\n\n01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:11.400\nNow you got to split up.\n\n01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.280\nYou got to have a bunch of UFO people.\n\n01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.160\nYou got to split up.\n\n01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.080\nYou got to do it from all sorts of different angles.\n\n01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:17.920\nRight.\n\n01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.600\nYou should go storm base boardin' when you're in Canada.\n\n01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:23.440\nBase boardin'?\n\n01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.840\nYeah, it's a military base.\n\n01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.840\nI'm going to do Fort Wayne, was the one that's way up there.\n\n01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.680\nIs that Fort Wayne?\n\n01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:30.520\nFort Wayne, I don't know.\n\n01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:32.640\nNo, what's the one that's way up in the fucking Yukon\n\n01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.480\nand shit?\n\n01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.320\nIt's Fort.\n\n01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.160\nI don't know.\n\n01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.000\nI'm Canadian.\n\n01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.840\nI don't go north.\n\n01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.760\nI can't believe you Canucks still have an army\n\n01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.880\nafter we kicked your ass in 1812.\n\n01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.120\nI believe we won.\n\n01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.480\nOh, shit.\n\n01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.120\nSome of the telegrams still haven't made it through.\n\n01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:50.600\nDid you guys burn down our White House?\n\n01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.760\nYou know, the reason that happened,\n\n01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.440\nthat was an insurance scam.\n\n01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.240\nWe wanted to build a new one.\n\n01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.760\nAnd you paid for it.\n\n01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.400\nThe war of 1812 was completely because\n\n01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.400\nwe had hit the tipping point of how aggression moved\n\n01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.760\njust faster than communication.\n\n01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.840\nLike it was just sort of like people would write a letter\n\n01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.720\ngoing like, wait, no, we didn't know what.\n\n01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.000\nThey were going to liberate Canada.\n\n01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.960\nThe Americans were going to liberate Canada from the\n\n01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.960\nBritish and then they came up and they

was fighting the Battle of New Orleans\n\n01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.000\nand all that shit.\n\n01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.920\nThat war was over and he was still kicking dick\n\n01:40:37.920 -->

01:40:46.560\nIt's a war that only Canadians care about.\n\n01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.520\nNo Americans care about the war of 1812.\n\n01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.120\nYou know what's amazing now is

infrastructure\n\n01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:16.880\nand I was like, you can't leap\n\n01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.520\nfrom whatever we were talking about to burgers.\n\n01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.920\nThe show's fucking to over, Dan.\n\n01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.360\nI don't give a shit anymore.\n\n01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.080\nI'm going to do ayahuasca, not on the show.\n\n01:41:29.080 -->

make us sound like we know what we're doing.\n\n01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.960\nIt's fucking great.\n\n01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.280\nI love it.\n\n01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.120\nWe go in there, we just goof off for five minutes\n\n01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.760\nand we sell underwear.\n\n01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.400\nDo you think you'll still all be friends?\n\n01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.320\nOr more to the point, have you guys become friends?\n\n01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.720\nYeah, I think so.\n\n01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.560\nI think so.\n\n01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.560\nThe friendship with me, though, it's kind of a mixed bag.\n\n01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.560\nBut I got a pool now.\n\n01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.560\nYeah, I got one of those.\n\n01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.400\nThen you live right by me, so.\n\n01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.200\nYeah, I come over, but your pool's full of cameras.\n\n01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.080\nI think I can swim in your pool.\n\n01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.840\nIt's fucking creepy.\n\n01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.160\nYeah, I pull them out.\n\n01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:55.000\nAlso, there's small cameras, but they film loads of...\n\n01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.480\nThat's a callback to my...\n\n01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.680\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.240\nA rolling, like, is

01:43:24.760\nwas at your pool,\n\n01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.920\nwe were just day drinking in a pool\n\n01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.480\nin the heat of the valley sun,\n\n01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.960\nand then you just fucking wrecked.\n\n01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.600\nAnd then we went to Barone's and we had, like, red wine,\n\n01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:35.680\nbut yeah, that was bad.\n\n01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.360\nYeah, it can get nasty.\n\n01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:39.200\nYeah.\n\n01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:40.880\nI kind of miss it, yeah.\n\n01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:43.200\nYour house is very large.\n\n01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.200\nHow much of the house have you actually used?\n\n01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.720\nBecause there's parts of that house\n\n01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.320\nthat's never gonna be occupied.\n\n01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.320\nI just used the Room 232.\n\n01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.600\nI don't know, I tried to riff the...\n\n01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.440\nWhat's the shiny name?\n\n01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.600\nYour house is enormous.\n\n01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.120\nHow many of your bathrooms haven't you pooped in?\n\n01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.440\nI have not pooped into the guest bedroom bathroom.\n\n01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.480\nThat's polite.\n\n01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.160\nLet's see, poop.\n\n01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.160\nWhat about that exterior one?\n\n01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.160\nI pooped in there while the decorators were there,\n\n01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:18.240\nand that's how I found out I will never poop in there again,\n\n01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:21.080\nbecause the door to that one is like glass.\n\n01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.360\nYeah, you could see right in it.\n\n01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:26.840\nYeah, it's like, I'm a standing wiper, I'll just say it.\n\n01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.080\nMm-hmm, oh yeah.\n\n01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.040\nAnd before you fucking freak out,\n\n01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.000\nthat's 40% of the public, so fuck off.\n\n01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.120\nIs there another way?\n\n01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:36.720\nHow do you arrive at that number?\n\n01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:38.000\n40% of the public?\n\n01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.200\nBy researching it after I found out\n\n01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.360\nthat not everyone is a standing wiper\n\n01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.400\nin, like, season three of Community.\n\n01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.800\nYou're not a stand-away portfolio, are you?\n\n01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.600\nHow do you wipe while still sitting?\n\n01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.760\nYou lean forward.\n\n01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.680\nYou're a stand-away per?\n\n01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.520\nYeah.\n\n01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.360\nYou're a stand-away per?\n\n01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:55.440\nI got work to do.\n\n01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:56.280\nYeah.\n\n01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.120\nYeah.\n\n01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:57.940\nWhat?\n\n01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.480\nThank you.\n\n01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.320\nYeah.\n\n01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.160\nIt's the work.\n\n01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.000\nGod damn, yeah.\n\n01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.680\nIs the work explaining why you stand up and wipe your butt?\n\n01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.200\nWe're just getting it done, getting it in there.\n\n01:45:07.200

anyway?\n\n01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.760\nThere's a roll of toilet paper,\n\n01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.560\nthere's a toilet that will clog\n\n01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.240\nif you fill it with the toilet paper,\n\n01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.920\nand there's an ass that has plenty of shit\n\n01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.760\nfor the roll of toilet paper.\n\n01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.680\nSo I'm like, yes, I'm standing.\n\n01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:29.920\nWhy does standing help that process?\n\n01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.680\nBecause sitting and doing all that,\n\n01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:34.920\nthat's just a confident person who's like,\n\n01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.160\nwell, my ass has a certain amount of poop in it,\n\n01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.760\nand I'm gonna just reach back and do these things.\n\n01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.600\nI don't know, I just wasn't.\n\n01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.360\nWhat kind of a princess sits there like this, ooh.\n\n01:45:42.360 -->

like,\n\n01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.320\nokay, so that's like, I compare it to a swatch\n\n01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.160\nfrom Home Depot.\n\n01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.320\nLike, six more wipes to go.\n\n01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:57.800\nI'm only at like an acorn, like.\n\n01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.920\nThree flushes.\n\n01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.800\nOkay, I'm gonna make an executive\n\n01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:02.560\ncomptroller decision right now.\n\n01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.960\nHarmontown lasts another year\n\n01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.160\nuntil we get to the fucking bottom of this.\n\n01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.600\nOoh, the fans are loving it.\n\n01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.960\nLike, you stand up and just, no.\n\n01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.360\nNo, you don't stand up and reach between your legs.\n\n01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:17.440\nIs that what you just mimed?\n\n01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.960\nWait, you stand up, is it front to back or back to front?\n\n01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.560\nFront to back for fuck's sake.\n\n01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.400\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.120\nThat's how you avoid an objection.\n\n01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.200\nFor us that stand, it's down to up,\n\n01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.360\nbecause we're standing.\n\n01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:34.920\nYeah.\n\n01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.720\nNo, you don't reach between your legs\n\n01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.760\nand pull shit towards your fucking vagina.\n\n01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.760\nThat's how you get in the fact.\n\n01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.800\nWhy not just sit and kind of gently\n\n01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:44.600\nlean over to the side and do that?\n\n01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:47.280\nBecause, well, I'm gonna, I'm not gonna pretend\n\n01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.160\nI made this Ben Franklin like decision.\n\n01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.120\nI'm like, oh, a wise man always stands up.\n\n01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.360\nI obviously like, I don't think our mommies,\n\n01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:59.720\nwhen you're a little kid, you wipe standing up pretty much.\n\n01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:00.560\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.680\nIt doesn't matter, of course.\n\n01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.080\nOtherwise you fall in.\n\n01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.680\nI just think your parents are like helping you\n\n01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:07.520\nwipe your ass like in the beginning.\n\n01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.120\nAnd then like, I was never helped.\n\n01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.680\nEither later, I never, I learned on the mean streets\n\n01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.000\nof Tustin, California.\n\n01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.800\nYeah.\n\n01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.640\nTustin.\n\n01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.640\nI just, I'm assuming socialization.\n\n01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.000\nI mean, I really don't think it was like,\n\n01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.160\nI truly made it to the age of like 37\n\n01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.640\nbefore I found out that not everyone stands up\n\n01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.640\nwhen they wipe their ass.\n\n01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:33.200\nAnd that in fact, a
