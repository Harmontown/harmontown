--> 01:25.000\nI couldn't be a stronger supporter of gay marriage\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:27.000\nStraight marriage, I\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:29.000\nMe too\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.000\nI just don't think it works\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nI think you guys take it more seriously\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nI think we should just hand off the mantle\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:38.000\nWe'll take care of it for a while\n\n01:38.000 --> 01:42.000\nObviously straight people have decided at some point\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nThat we get married three times a lifetime minimum\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:48.000\nIt's like molting for us\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.000\nIt's like you have your\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:54.000\nI don't know, they have expressions for it\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nThe third wife is the lizard wife\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nI don't even know\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nThird wife, lizard wife\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:04.000\nPaper anniversaries, same thing\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nWell, the first time we met\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.000\nI think was on this stage\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.000\nAnd we inadvertently found out\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nBut it makes total sense looking at you\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:16.000\nThat you're like a huge back to the future fan\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:21.000\nIs it accurate to say that when you\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nWhen you pick the look\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.000\nYou're like I want to look like Marty McFly a little bit\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.000\nYeah, a little bit, and a little bit of George\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:29.000\nAnd a little bit of Biff\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:32.000\nJust like a little bit of each one\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:34.000\nAnd then Lorraine at heart, you know\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\n1955 Lorraine at heart\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\nNot original 1985 Lorraine at heart\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:43.000\nNo, god no, just a weird clay face\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.000\nJohn's performer, they wanted to reach up\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:48.000\nAnd just tell a story\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.000\nBut we were both in San Francisco\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.000\nWhen you came back, you have a little story\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nSpeaking of which\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nI do have a story, so this morning\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:59.000\nI was in San Francisco International Airport\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:01.000\nWhich is a very small airport\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nAnd I saw this woman in a pair of uggs\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nAnd then just like a general airport outfit\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nAnd she looked very familiar to me\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:09.000\nAnd I was like pfft, no way\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.000\nAnd then I started walking around a little bit more\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:13.000\nAnd I was like no, maybe\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:15.000\nAnd then I saw her again, I was like pfft, no way\n\n03:15.000 --> 03:17.000\nAnd then we got on the same plane together\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.000\nAnd she had like a bunch of teenage kids with her too\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:21.000\nAnd we got on the same plane\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:24.000\nAnd then as I passed her, she like turned on the seat\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.000\nTo talk to somebody behind her\n\n03:26.000 --> 03:29.000\nAnd I looked back and it was, in fact\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:32.000\nLeah Thompson on my flight\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:34.000\nAnd I was like oh my god, it's your mother\n\n03:34.000 --> 03:38.000\nAnd uh, I did\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\nI wasn't going to bother her because it was a plane and stuff\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:42.000\nBut then I went to the bathroom and was walking back\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:44.000\nAnd she was walking towards me\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:46.000\nAnd I was like, I'm really sorry\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nBut I have to just tell you my huge fan of yours\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.000\nAnd she was very nice, she was like, what's your name?\n\n03:50.000 --> 03:52.000\nAnd I was like, oh my name's Leah\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:54.000\nShe's like, oh, so close\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.000\nOh no, oh\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.000\nAnd it was perfect\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nThat's the Japanese version of my name\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\nYeah, yeah, exactly\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:07.000\nUh, I had a\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:10.000\nFucking airport plane story as well\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.000\nYeah\n\n04:11.000 --> 04:13.000\nFucking Delta\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nCock\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nCock-marrying Delta\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:24.000\nEqual rights, cock-treating\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.000\nDelta, I fucking, like\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:30.000\nI would never fly Delta by choice\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:33.000\nBut it was like the festival booked the flight\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:34.000\nSure\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:35.000\nSo flying back\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nI'm so sorry\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nBut I have not flown coach since the first time\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:41.000\nI flew first class\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nI put it off\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nI really literally have not\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nExcept for maybe once to Las Vegas\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nBecause it was like\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.000\nBut like, so, you know, I mean\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.000\nOh, I fucking\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.000\nOh\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:57.000\nAgain, always with the thing\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nWith the once again\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:01.000\nLadies and gentlemen, we have a full flight\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:03.000\nOh, how did that happen?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:05.000\nAnd I'm so sorry\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nI'm so sorry for your full flight\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:09.000\nAre you gonna be okay?\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:11.000\nAnd every fucking thing they say\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nIs once again, just a reminder\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:15.000\nOnce again, because it's a subtle\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nTechnique to infantilize you\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nThey're always implying that\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\nYou're a fucking idiot\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:23.000\nOnce again, once again\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.000\nOnce again, folks, once again\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:27.000\nWe do have a full flight\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.000\nTalk to me like a normal person\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:31.000\nAnd what will be revealed is that you're shitty business\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:33.000\nLike, stop, stop, stop\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:35.000\nTalking to me like you're a teacher\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nYou know, and that I haven't learned\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:39.000\nSomething about your fucking full flight yet\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:41.000\nAnd\n\n05:41.000 --> 05:43.000\nAnd then I go to my seat\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:45.000\nIt says 6A and it's in fucking coach\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\nAnd I'm like, well, maybe\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nTheir definition of a full flight\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:51.000\nLeaves the seat open next to me\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nThey're doing one of those things where they\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:55.000\nI'm like, and then this guy\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\nPlows down next to me and I'm like, what the fuck\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nAnd he's like, who's this guy\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.000\nI was like, I guess\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:03.000\nMaybe it's because I texted Steve just to make him feel bad\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:05.000\nWho was on the plane\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\nI was like, you're fired\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nI said you're fired as you walk by\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:11.000\nSo I think maybe for that reason\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.000\nSteve, did you contact somebody on the\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:15.000\nDid you tell somebody that I was\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.000\nOkay, so that's what\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:19.000\nSo then the flight attendant comes by\n\n06:19.000 --> 06:21.000\nAnd says\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nWho's supposed to be in 1A\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:25.000\nBecause we had when we bought\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:27.000\nHey, I had a receipt\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.000\nIt was a warning pass at 6A\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:31.000\nBut the receipt said 1A\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.000\nAnd I said, oh, me\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\nYeah, and he said\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nWe apologize, sir\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:39.000\nBut I'll pause it right there\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.000\nThat's not an apology\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\nWe have to stop doing that\n\n06:43.000 --> 06:45.000\nEspecially corporations\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:47.000\nThey say we apologize, sir, but\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.000\nYeah, you can't include sorry and but\n\n06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\nIn the same sentence ever\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\nSorry, but it's your fault\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nI'm just saying\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nYou can't narrate a theoretical apology\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.000\nYou can't\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nI owe you an apology\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:03.000\nI'm sorry, I spilled that\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nThat thing on you, I owe you an apology\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:07.000\nWe'll fucking make it\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:09.000\nCash it, let's cash that sucker down\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:11.000\nBecause as my therapist told me\n\n07:11.000 --> 07:13.000\nAn apology is\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.000\nAn acknowledgement of the offense\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:17.000\nAn expression of remorse and\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:19.000\nA commitment to change\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nAnd without all three of those ingredients\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.000\nIt's an apology, I'll take one delta\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nOne of those\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:27.000\nWe apologize\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.000\nBut sometimes we downgrade\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nThe aircraft and then sometimes\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nWhen we do that, sometimes this happens\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:35.000\nThat was his apology\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:37.000\nThat was his addressing of it\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.000\nAnd he said\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:41.000\nAnd if we had caught it on time\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:43.000\nWe could have done something\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:45.000\nAnd I said, what does that mean?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:47.000\nI'm sorry\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.000\nWhen we downgrade the craft\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:51.000\nSometimes this happens\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:53.000\nAnd then sometimes this happens\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:55.000\nI said, I heard you\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nBut if we had caught it on time\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.000\nWhat does that mean?\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:01.000\nIt sounds like you have a disease\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:03.000\nSounds like cancer\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:05.000\nI think you have delta cancer\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nI forgot there was people over here\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nSorry, I'll do this show a little bit\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nWho is the we that's supposed to catch it on time?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nAm I responsible for this?\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nNo, we apologize\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:17.000\nBut sometimes we downgrade the fight\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:19.000\nHe just kept repeating himself\n\n08:19.000 --> 08:21.000\nWhat would you have done if you caught it on time?\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nOffer you miles?\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nAnd he said, delta miles?\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nDo I look like a\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nLike a guy to whom those are worth things?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nOh, delta miles, my favorite\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:37.000\nLike I'm cuckoo for delta miles\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:41.000\nI'm delta rich\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.000\nHoney\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:47.000\nI don't have any money, but I have the equivalent\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:49.000\nOf money and opportunities\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:51.000\nTo interact with delta\n\n08:51.000 --> 08:53.000\nA million delta\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nHours are coming\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nThe thing is, the guy is standing\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nHe knows what he's doing\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nIf you ever have a complaint\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.000\nOn an airline, they have\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:05.000\nAll the control, because I can't sit\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:07.000\nIn coach going\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:09.000\nI'm too rich to be sitting next to\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.000\nEveryone with an earshot of me\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:13.000\nThere's been some kind of mistake\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nI can't do it\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:17.000\nAnd he's projecting\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:19.000\nHis answers to me\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnd I'm trying to murmur\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nI'm too rich to be\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nAnd his answers are like\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nI'm sorry, sir\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nHe never said I'm fucking sorry\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.000\nWe apologize, sir\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.000\nEveryone's story is going to be\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nThere's some prick up there\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nThat doesn't understand downgrading very well\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nAnd keeps demanding things\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.000\nAnd then it's just actually because\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nI'm a big fan of community\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nAnd it takes a selfie\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.000\nWith me on the way out\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.000\nThe flight attendants are like\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:53.000\nSix seasons in a movie\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd I'm like you fucking suck\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nYou fucking suck\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nSix seasons into miles\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:01.000\nSix thousand miles of\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.000\nI don't know what's your miles\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:05.000\nI want my money back\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:07.000\nYou know why that plane was downgraded\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.000\nYou know it was because it was not full enough\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.000\nAnd I can't stand that shit\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:13.000\nIf you book an airplane ticket\n\n10:13.000 --> 10:15.000\nGod damn it\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:17.000\nIf you book an airplane ticket\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:19.000\nAnd you don't show up\n\n10:19.000 --> 10:21.000\nThey keep your money so why do they consider it\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:23.000\nA fucking crisis to have an empty seat on their plane\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.000\nIt's not\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nThey're not losing money\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:29.000\nIf everybody didn't show up\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:31.000\nFly the fucking empty plane over the ocean\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:33.000\nAnd fucking keep your fucking money\n\n10:33.000 --> 10:35.000\nYou fucking cartel\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nYou fucking horrible\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nHorrible companies\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:41.000\nJust like\n\n10:41.000 --> 10:43.000\nThey do everything they can to murder you\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:45.000\nBy taking you up in a metal tube\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nThat should not be able to stay in the air\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nThere's monsters on the wings\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nThey keep denying it\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:57.000\nAnyways congratulations on your marriage\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:59.000\nThank you\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nThank you\n\n11:05.000 --> 11:07.000\nI don't know why my straight marriage\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:09.000\nDidn't work\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:11.000\nI'm a delightful person to be around\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:13.000\nAnd travel with\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:15.000\nDon't know why my wife would have left me\n\n11:17.000 --> 11:19.000\nBut I have a feeling she's probably in the arms\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:21.000\nOf a woman right now\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.000\nIf she's smart\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.000\nLet's see\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.000\nSo fuck Pixar\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:29.000\nI have a hair\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nJust because the Golden Globes were tonight\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nAnd Anomalyza\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nMy movie\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.000\nThat I executive produced\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.000\nThank you\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nI did a hell of a job\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nExecutive produced the fuck out of that movie\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.000\nIt lost to\n\n11:45.000 --> 11:47.000\nYou know\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.000\nM&M's in your head\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:51.000\nOr whatever\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:55.000\nThe memory islands\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:57.000\nAlso memory marbles\n\n11:57.000 --> 11:59.000\nPick a lane\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:03.000\nAre the islands made of marbles?\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:05.000\nAre they powered by them?\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nBing Bong felt a little lazy\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:19.000\nFirst thought, best thought I guess on Bing Bong\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nHome by 5\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nI'm just being bitter\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nOf course we all love Pixar movies\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nIt's just tonight's not a very good night\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:29.000\nTo love them\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:31.000\nI don't know why everyone had to love them that much\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:33.000\nThey're doing fine\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:35.000\nWe made a fucking movie\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.000\nAbout the futility of monogamy\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:39.000\nIn a garage with Charlie Kaufman\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.000\nCan't have a Golden Globe\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nI don't know why your applause\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:47.000\nFront row\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nThey're just getting the vodka off their hands\n\n12:49.000 --> 12:51.000\nAnd it keeps flying off my\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.000\nIt's a really bad night for you guys\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.000\nI haven't trimmed my beard\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:57.000\nAnd it's like really like wicking\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nAnd like\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nThere's just droplets are flying\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.000\nSo I'm really sorry I just pretend you're at SeaWorld\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.000\nAlright\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nSo I want to\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nSo last night\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nThat episode hasn't aired yet\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nBut we had a young lady who had just\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:17.000\nAnd I mean just gotten done\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nWith a double mastectomy come up on stage\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:21.000\nShe wanted to talk about it\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.000\nAnd all I know\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:25.000\nI mean she's like\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:27.000\nHad done chemo and she was\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:29.000\nStill on the stuff\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:31.000\nShe was like fresh off of the\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:33.000\nProcess and was like\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nJust sharing her story\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nAnd all I know as a guy\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.000\nIs like I only know like\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:41.000\nOh it's so important that women\n\n13:41.000 --> 13:43.000\nTalk about this I totally know\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nThat's why I was so excited\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:47.000\nBut I had no idea what to ask her\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.000\nIf I did a good job or a bad job\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:51.000\nBecause she was like\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:53.000\nHad just gotten done being sick\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nAnd it wasn't about me so I couldn't be like\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.000\nAm I doing a good job?\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:59.000\nBut I think I did anyway and I was like\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:01.000\nAm I supposed to be doing this difference\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:03.000\nWhat's your relationship with your boobs\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:05.000\nI don't know what to do\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:07.000\nI'm fucking everything up\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nAnd I tweeted at her like\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:11.000\nHow did that go for you the next day\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nAnd I don't think she responded\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nI may have done it wrong\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nIt doesn't revolve around you\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nAnd she needed sleep Dan\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:21.000\nShe just got done with a fucking operation\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nBut I don't know\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nI don't know\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nIs there a connection\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nYou must have more friends than I do\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:31.000\nThat have been through breast cancer\n\n14:31.000 --> 14:33.000\nI don't actually\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nReally? No\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:37.000\nI mean you're gonna tell me you don't\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:39.000\nHang out with Tignataro all the time\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:41.000\nWell she did drive me here\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:43.000\nIt's for the lesbian shuttle service\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nYeah\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:47.000\nIt's very convenient\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.000\nThere's gotta be a great app name\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nFor that\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nHomobile\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nThat's not mine\n\n14:55.000 --> 14:57.000\nThat's a real thing that exists\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nHomobile?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:01.000\nYeah homobile\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:03.000\nIt's like a ride sharing service\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:05.000\nFor other things\n\n15:05.000 --> 15:07.000\nYeah prostitutes\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:09.000\nAnd drag queens\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nAnd people who specialize in body glitter\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd stuff\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.000\nThere's a lot of discrimination\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:17.000\nIn taxicab services\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nAnd they also don't like glitter\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nAnd stuff\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nAnd so like they really\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nApparently you know\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:27.000\nIt's hard to get a cab when you're in drag\n\n15:27.000 --> 15:29.000\nIs the discrimination\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:31.000\nBecause of the glitter?\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:33.000\nOr do you think it's like a cultural discrimination\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:35.000\nI don't want that person in my car\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:37.000\nI bet there's 16 people for which\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:39.000\nIs just a practical concern\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:41.000\nIntolerance\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nBut for those people\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.000\nThere's a\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:47.000\nPhobomobile\n\n15:47.000 --> 15:49.000\nFo...\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:51.000\nThey can drive each other around\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:55.000\nThey just use glitter\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nTwitter\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nThat was bad\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nIt just rhymed\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nIt wasn't a pun or anything\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.000\nI just rhymed two words\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.000\nBut I guess the answer is you don't have\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nAn appropriate\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nIt wasn't my job\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.000\nIt's good for more women to talk about it\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:15.000\nBecause the alternative is\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:17.000\nI think this era is kind of\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nMore past ending\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:21.000\nIt's not like\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:23.000\nWe get it now\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nWomen should talk about it\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:27.000\nBecause otherwise the risk is\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:29.000\nWomen being so ashamed\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.000\nThat they don't check themselves\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:33.000\nOr don't seek treatment\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:35.000\nOr just like\n\n16:35.000 --> 16:37.000\nWhat is the risk of women\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nNot talking about it\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nWhat's the terrible thing that can happen\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:43.000\nAll of it\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nI think it's women withering away\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nIn towers\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nWithout anyone coming and talking to them\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\nJust in our own tower by ourselves\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nFalling apart\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nAging\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nI felt a lump but I'm not going to tell anybody\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nBecause my breasts are my\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:01.000\nThat seems like a very 50s thing\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:03.000\nOr if it was ever anything\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:05.000\nWe could blame everything on the 50s\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:07.000\nI'd say blame Delta\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:09.000\nOr maybe it's\n\n17:09.000 --> 17:11.000\nMore for men's benefit\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nWomen need to talk about it\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nBecause men sexualize and objectify women\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nAnd it's like we're like\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:19.000\nWe need to\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:21.000\nThe alternative would be men being like\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nEw gross\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:25.000\nYour boobs got\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:27.000\nYour boobs got a cold\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:29.000\nYour boobs used to be sick\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:33.000\nBut now they're sick\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:35.000\nThat's according to her\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.000\nShe sounds like I don't know if this is\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:39.000\nLucky for her or if\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.000\nThis is just the new\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nThis is the advance of medicine\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:45.000\nOr technology\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nThat you can just\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nThat you just basically\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:51.000\nEnd up with I think\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nA nice pair of fake boobs\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nBecause they take them off\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:57.000\nAnd then they put in the bags\n\n17:57.000 --> 17:59.000\nBut somebody else told me\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nI had a friend who has a mother\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nWho went through this process\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nBut maybe it was longer ago\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:07.000\nAnd she said you know\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:09.000\nThey're like mannequin boobs\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:11.000\nAnd I was like boing\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:17.000\nWhy were you like that?\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nMy penis became erect\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nSo fast that it made a cartoon\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:25.000\nDiving board\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:27.000\nSound\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nI miss mannequins in films\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nOh man\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nWe just don't put mannequins in film and TV\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.000\nAs much as we used to in the 80s\n\n18:37.000 --> 18:39.000\nWhat about the film mannequin?\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:41.000\nI mean I like that one\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:43.000\nIn my top three mannequin based films\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:47.000\nMannequin is definitely in my top three\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:53.000\nBut Kim could trial\n\n18:53.000 --> 18:55.000\nYeah of course\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:57.000\nIt's my favorite thing about lesbians\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nYou can go there\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nBut also like Andrew McCarthy too\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:03.000\nBecause he's like kind of a hot lesbian\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nExactly\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:09.000\nGod damn it\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nI want to talk about hot chicks with you\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:13.000\nI know Andrew McCarthy\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:15.000\nIs a hot chick\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nThat is true\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nHe's funny\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nI was a kid and I saw that movie\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:23.000\nWith a high voice\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:25.000\nHe's a leading man\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:27.000\nHe's a dreamy lady\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:29.000\nHe's pretty dreamy\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nAnd you know\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:33.000\nI'm sure\n\n19:33.000 --> 19:35.000\nMayshack Taylor's performance\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nIs still heralded as progressive\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:39.000\nBy the gay community\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:41.000\nI'm assuming\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:43.000\nEveryone on Homobile\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.000\nFor sure\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:47.000\nLoves Mayshack Taylor's\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:49.000\nThat must be a\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:51.000\nThat must be a serious bummer\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nFor actors who are like\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nCulture advances so quickly\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:57.000\nThere's actors out there\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nWho are like oh I played\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nLike gay guy number five\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nIn this thing and then it's like\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\n15 years later\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nThey must feel like\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:09.000\nMan I got conned\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.000\nI was told that I was doing a great job\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:13.000\nAnd all this stuff\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nAnd I feel like I'm part of the problem\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nAnd then they go to the library\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nAnd they just sit in the corner\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nAnd they eat peanuts\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nJust loudly eat peanuts\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nIn the library\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nHis 80's style glasses break\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:29.000\nAnd he can't read any of the books\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:31.000\nIn the library\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nHis 3D glasses\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:35.000\nI was asking you in the green room\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:37.000\nYou haven't seen the Back to the Future documentary\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nThat I was in\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.000\nWhere they tricked me into saying\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:43.000\nBack to the Future 2 and 3 suck\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nFine\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:47.000\nI was\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:49.000\nAt an airport and I rode down\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nAn escalator next to one of the guys\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nThat shot that interview\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nAnd he was like hey it's me\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:57.000\nI was like oh hey\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nYou guys really kept that thing in there\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:01.000\nAnd he's like yeah\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nBut you know what it's good\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nIt's good\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nPeople like it\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:09.000\nI was like\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nYou can't just make something true\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:13.000\nI mean I'm sure it's good for you guys\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nTo have a villain in your documentary\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.000\nBecause I said\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:21.000\nIn the thing I was like\n\n21:21.000 --> 21:23.000\nI said come on\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:25.000\nAnd he's like what\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:27.000\nAnd I was like come on\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nDon't make me say it\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.000\nTo make you say what\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:33.000\nI know that you're shooting a documentary\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nThat Zemeckis and Gayle are going to be in\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.000\nThey're my heroes don't make me say\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:39.000\nBack to the Future 2 and 3 sucked\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:41.000\nAnd they put it in right before\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nA whole chapter of the documentary about\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nHow great Back to the Future 2 is\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nSo I mean\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nThey knew what they were doing\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nPeople love to hate me\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nAnd I look great in it too\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nI look like fucking Bigfoot\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nSo not like now\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:03.000\nNow you're like well groomed and handsome\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nI'm just telling you it was a bad day\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nIf you watch it I look like\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nWalked into a fan\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nThe fan part is added so that Matt Groening\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nDoesn't get offended\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nI don't know what\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:21.000\nThe effect of the fan is\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nI just\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nBy the way I'm not texting\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:27.000\nI realize you're here\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nAnd I respect you I'm just\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:31.000\nLooking at my notes\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nOh I saw that Golden Globes\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nHighlights like\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:37.000\nThe only thing I saw was\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nDenzel Washington got the Cecil B. DeMille Award\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:41.000\nAnd during his speech\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:43.000\nHe said\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:45.000\nHe started breaking up\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.000\nHe started to cry a little bit\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nRight after he said this\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:51.000\nWe'll never know what he meant\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:53.000\nHe said I want to thank my mother\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:55.000\nFor convincing my father\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nTo\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:59.000\nGet higher than 25 watt bulbs\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nYeah\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nBecause he thought\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:05.000\nIf they were lower wattage we could save money\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:07.000\nAnd then he started crying and then he moved on\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:09.000\nAnd then he was like done\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.000\nWe'll never know\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nI care more about that\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.000\nThan what Ricky Gervais said to Mel Gibson\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:17.000\nThat got blamed\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.000\nDo you know what he said?\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nHe said what does sugar tits even mean\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nI wasn't sure I thought maybe I had inside info\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nBecause I was texting people and sitting in the Golden Globes\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:29.000\nWhich is why I know that Brad Pitt loves Anomalysa\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:31.000\nAnd then he came and he was sitting at the table\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nWith our guys\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nThere was a chair available\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nFor him because Charlie left\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nAfter we had lost\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nI think I'm probably not supposed to\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nSay that\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nI just think that's funny\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nBrad Pitt sitting here in Charlie's chair\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nWhere's Charlie\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nHe took off\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.000\nCharlie's gone\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:59.000\nBut\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:01.000\nHe likes Anomalysa\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd that's cool because\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nHe uses my beard in the big short\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nThe 25 watt bulb\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nMy only theory was\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nDid his dad get\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:17.000\nLike his mom said you should get more than 25 watt bulbs\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:19.000\nAnd his dad was like\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nDoes this satisfy you\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nAnd he got a big spotlight\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nAnd then little Denzel stood in\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.000\nLike\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nIt's showtime\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nIt's showtime\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nI don't know if I have a Denzel impression\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:37.000\nI thought I'd find out\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:39.000\nIt's showtime\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nIt's showtime\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nIt's showtime\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nYep\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nI'm Denzel Washington\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nI'm John Lithgow\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nJohn Lithgow\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nI'm John Lithgow\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nMy mouth is a circle\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:01.000\nYou sound like John Lithgow\n\n25:01.000 --> 25:03.000\nWhen you put your mouth in a circle\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nYou don't look like him\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:07.000\nBut you sound like him\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:09.000\nSometimes\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nI got some gifts\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nI'm talking about girls screaming\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nIn the green room\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:23.000\nIt happens to me all the time\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:27.000\nEvery time I enter a room\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:29.000\nGirls start screaming\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nYou were saying your hotel was next to a playground\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nIn San Francisco\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nAnd there were girls\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:41.000\nWatching a football game\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:43.000\nIn the airport\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nAnd I thought there was an\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.000\nIsis attack\n\n25:47.000 --> 25:49.000\nGirls\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:51.000\nFrom\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:53.000\nAge\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:55.000\n3 to 20\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nWill just shriek\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:59.000\nTo express happiness\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.000\nThey won't even differentiate\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:03.000\nIt sounds like there's a murder happening\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:05.000\nMy adrenaline\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:07.000\nI was mad\n\n26:07.000 --> 26:09.000\nSitting at the airport\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nI can't do an impression of it\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:13.000\nI thought Isis was there\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nIt's a football game\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nThere's teams winning\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.000\nAnd grown men\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.000\nWhen you're little tiny kids\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:27.000\nAll kids do the same things\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nBut grown men\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nThey make these horrible sounds too\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:33.000\nWhen they're watching sports\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:35.000\nBut for that\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:37.000\nYou think there's a person\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:39.000\nAbout to hurt you\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:41.000\nA person's about to get hurt\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:47.000\nIf you will\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:51.000\nI'm so happy\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nAnd I made\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nSome of your favorite\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nPulled pork sliders\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nI got to stop doing that\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nMy throat is shredded\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nFrom shrieking at the football game\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.000\nYou and I came to the same\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nConclusion\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nIt's because girls\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.000\nIt's not because girls are socialized\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:23.000\nTo do that\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:25.000\nIt's because they're socialized to do so much other shit\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nThat they repress them\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nWhen they're little kids on the playground\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nAll they can do is scream\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nThat's all they can do to affect\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nIt affects people\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nMen\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nStart inheriting a planet\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:41.000\nWhere they can just\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:43.000\nThrow chairs and\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:45.000\nSmash it! Smash it again!\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.000\nAnd that is a sport\n\n27:49.000 --> 27:51.000\nAnd women are just like\n\n27:51.000 --> 27:53.000\nI'm gonna do that thing\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.000\nIt's my carry power\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nEveryone flies\n\n27:57.000 --> 27:59.000\nAgainst the wall\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nYeah, women\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nWhat can we do?\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nJust like being married\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nTo one\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.000\nIt was my fault\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nIt was my fault\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.000\nMy wife is a hero\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nShe got away\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:21.000\nShe got away\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:27.000\nFuck Pixar, Brad Pitt lives on\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nAnnalisa, Miss Dectomy, Wedding\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:31.000\nLeah Thompson, Airport\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nDenzel, Flight 25\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:35.000\nWhat bulbs\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nThey were showing the real\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nDenzel Washington real to give him his award\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:41.000\nBut they were like\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.000\nShowing all those little phrases\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nAnd things\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nBut they were like showing him flying\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nThe plane upside down\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nIt wasn't like\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nIt was kind of funny\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nLike what an actor\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nIt's amazing\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nRemember when he flew that plane upside down\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nThey were just showing the plane\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:03.000\nHits his head\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nThen they just cut to him getting knocked unconscious\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nHe's so good at getting knocked unconscious\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:09.000\nYeah\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI'm pretty sure\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nThey really should have shown him doing all those lines\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nIn that movie\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nDid you like that movie?\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nI was very affected by that movie\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nI thought it was the best alcoholic movie\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.000\nThat I've ever seen\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.000\nIt's not like the whole Jekyll and Hyde\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:27.000\nYou're such a terrible person when you're drunk\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:29.000\nThat's why you should quit\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:31.000\nAnd then people don't relate\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:33.000\nBut that was the first movie I ever saw\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:35.000\nNo, I'm great at my job when I'm drunk\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nI save lives\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.000\nFantastic! I still should quit drinking\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nAnd it's up to me\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:43.000\nBecause I will get away with anything for the rest of my life\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.000\nIt got to me\n\n29:55.000 --> 29:57.000\nIt really got to me\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.000\nYeah, okay\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.000\nLet's get to the gift portion\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:03.000\nOf our friend Michael\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nMichael, do you want to come up here\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nSo you can\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:09.000\nYou brought me a couple of gifts\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nYou brought me like a...\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nThey got him back in the green room\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nSomeone could bring him up\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nCan you bring that big box out?\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nThis is very nice\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nThanks, Steve\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nI knew what it was\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nThrough the wrapping\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nI thought I'd open it out here\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nGot to use comic book paper\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nMike, draw\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nSorry about that\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nFor the podcast\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:57.000\nIt's a leg-shaped object\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nI know there's no replacing old faithful\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nNo, yeah, and I found out\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nIt was a heartbreaker\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nI found the thing\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nOne of the writers suggested\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nWhy don't you look on the mannequin leg\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nAnd see if there's a model number\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nAnd it was a\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nCarol Barnhart\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nDisplays\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nIncorporated\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nAnd I found old faithful\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nI found my plastic mannequin legs\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nThere's a whole career\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nMaking those things, apparently\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\nCarol, whatever\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nThere's a whole group of people\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nMaking mannequin legs, apparently\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nBranding\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nGet into that\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nBut I guess she went out of business\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nNo one's picking up the phone\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nIt was ringing\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nAnd I was kind of relieved\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nThat no one picked up\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nHere we go again\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nThis conversation, but I would have had it\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\nIs 197B available?\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nAnd the...\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nI'll take two bent\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nStraight, but no, they're gone\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nI found this on eBay first\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nAnd then I found a phone number\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nAnd it was like a place in El Monte\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nAnd I was like, oh, do you have...\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nI don't know what the part number is\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nAnd it's like, oh, well, is it\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nMN-189, color?\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nI was like, oh, I'm speaking your language\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nThat's how you got that mannequin leg?\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nYep\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nShit, you could just...\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nOkay\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nI found a physical place\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nWait, what do you mean you had it?\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nOh, wait, no, I can't talk about that\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nI found the physical place\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nNo, I tried, me and Steve have been trying\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nTrying to get a replacement leg\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nWith toe articulation\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nNot articulation, but, you know\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nWith toes\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nWe went to the swap meet this week\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nAnd we walked it backwards\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nI mean, there was a mannequin\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nBut the toes weren't separate\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nThere's a lot of caveats\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nIn mannequin work\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nYou go to a mannequin thing\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nAnd you're like, oh, I want a leg\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nAnd they're like, we got legs\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nThey're just attached to mannequins\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:10.000\nYeah, yeah\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nAnd I'm like, you don't have legs?\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:12.000\nI know I've seen legs\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nAnd they're like, we got legs\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nBut they're just for sandals and shoes\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nLike, they don't have articulation\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nAnd then\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nIt was just a weird, weird situation\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nThey took me up to the mannequin graveyard\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nWhich is where\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\nProp buyers\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nFor horror movies come\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:31.000\nAnd pick up, like, shitty, ratty, creepy-looking mannequins\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nBecause that's a good half of the business\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nApparently of mannequins\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nIs simply props for horror movies\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nSpecifically, not horror movies\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nLike, that probably represents\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\n75% of all mannequin uses\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nBut, yeah, I mean, horror\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nHorror films use all sorts of these mannequins\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nThere's all these guys\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:50.000\nThey are fabricating mannequins\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nAnd I was like, this seems easy\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.000\nYou can just make me one, right?\n\n33:52.000 --> 33:55.000\nAnd they're like, well, not so fast, Junior\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nAnd I had to go to, like, a back office\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nAnd meet someone's dog\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nAnd, like, sit in front of a rada\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nThat's to go through the mannequin's guild first\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nLet's get this straight\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nMeanwhile, across the street\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nA guy has a shopping cart full of AK-47s\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nIt's just going down an aisle\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nOh, I need grenades, grenades!\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nI think that's the cover of The New Yorker\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nJust described\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nOh, by the way, Rhea, I\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nWhen I masturbate, I rub a mannequin leg\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nWith hosary on it on my nipple\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nGot it\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nMakes total sense\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\nAnd I had one\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:34.000\nThat was a 1983 Carol Barnhart display model\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:35.000\nApparently, I don't know\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nWhich is vintage\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nDid somebody yell something out?\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nOr...\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nMy mom's ghost\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nOh, fuck, my mom died\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nI should call my dad\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\nI think I just murdered my mom with my mind\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nOh, god, dad's now there...\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nI guess the house burnt down\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nOh, muffin\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nOh, lucky\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nThe pets are going\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nOh, my brother was visiting\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nMy brother was visiting\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nOh, it was a vintage thing\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:27.000\nAnd it was a nice foot\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nGreat foot\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nRub it on my nipple\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nNot to offend Michael, but these are a dime a dozen\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nI thought you would laugh at that\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nI didn't think you\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nTake it really seriously\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nNo, it's very thoughtful\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nI'm going to try it\n\n35:49.000 --> 35:51.000\nNothing's going to stop you now\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nI mean, when I saw it\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nI was like, it's probably not as cool\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nAs the vintage one\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nBut I mean, it didn't look terrible\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nIf you have an opportunity\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nTo buy a mannequin part\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nJust go for it\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nWhat's the worst that could happen?\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nYou're going to need it eventually\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nIt is more of a third lizard wife\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nType of a\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nmannequin leg\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nBut that could be the most joyful one\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nAbsolutely\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nYou already tried to fix people\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nNow you're just sailing through\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nLet's be honest with each other\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nLet's just do this thing\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nI love that\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nHave you ever seen Legs lavish?\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nLegs lavish the YouTube site?\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nThe YouTube channel?\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nThat was my spot\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nI was referencing\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nYou're weird\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nI'm wearing overalls though\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nBut I'm trying to be MC John\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nOh, I didn't realize that\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nThat's nice\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nSan Diego\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nThat's fantastic\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nAlso, you brought beer\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nI brought some homebrew\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nHe brought homebrew beer\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nSomebody grabbed it because it was chilling in the fridge\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nIn the fridge\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nWhere beer goes\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nAre you a beer person?\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nI am not a beer person, I no longer drink\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nWhy'd you stop?\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nBecause I got too good at it\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nBecause I nailed it\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nI finished drinking\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nI did it all\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nDid you\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nAre you comfortable talking about it?\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nDid you have blackouts\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nYou were a troubled drinker\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:39.000\nI realized that when I got\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nReally good at vomiting\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nThere was a problem\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nThat I could hide it\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nI was totally comfortable puking\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nOh, this is a problem\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nSteve, inhale\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nShe just grabbed it\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nAnd ran out\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nLike the Phantom of the Opera\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nAnd I take the leg with me\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nI'm a little jealous\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nIn some respects of people\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nBecause I'm too much like Denzel in flight\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nI could just keep doing it forever\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nAnd I will eventually die\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nBecause I won't, so far\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nI'll black out while drinking\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nBut I won't wake up in blood\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nAnd I don't typically\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nHave\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nSuper bad stories happen to me\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nWhich means I can keep doing it\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nBut I can tell I'm slowly rotting my brain away\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nBecause I'm just so able to drink\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\nAll the time\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nBut it's medication for\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nSickness called you people\n\n38:39.000 --> 38:41.000\nThis is\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nSuper smart juice for you\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nWhat else is going on\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:51.000\nWhat's the deal with this beer?\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:53.000\nI was reaching for more vodka\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nYou had warned me you're still getting the carbonation\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nYeah, I just always have to\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nI always throw that out\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:01.000\nI don't suppose you have an opener\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.000\nOh, shit\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:05.000\nI have a lighter\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nHe's got one\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nHow do you lighter people do the lighter thing?\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nIt's hard, man\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:13.000\nIt's just a fulcrum thing\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:15.000\nWell, I know the principle, but I just don't\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nI've never been able to do it\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:19.000\nI'll demonstrate it for you\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:21.000\nLet's hope he succeeds\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:23.000\nCan you make sure\n\n39:23.000 --> 39:25.000\nStates couldn't be higher\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nIs he on it?\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:29.000\nYeah, the one with the red light\n\n39:29.000 --> 39:31.000\nOh\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.000\nYou want it there as firm as possible\n\n39:33.000 --> 39:35.000\nAnd then you just\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:37.000\nOh\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nHeads up\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:41.000\nWatch out\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nBut I really don't know\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:49.000\nWhat you did\n\n39:49.000 --> 39:51.000\nThat downward angle\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nYeah, shove it in hard there\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:55.000\nThat was close\n\n39:55.000 --> 39:57.000\nI heard something, but I think that's just because\n\n39:57.000 --> 39:59.000\nYou bottled it\n\n39:59.000 --> 40:01.000\nI didn't\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:03.000\nI didn't mean he's bad at bottling\n\n40:03.000 --> 40:05.000\nI just meant like it's probably\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:07.000\nIt's probably harder with a store bought\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nAlmost\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:11.000\nOne more\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nOne more\n\n40:15.000 --> 40:17.000\nIt hurts\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:19.000\nIt hurts\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:21.000\nThat's the thing, man\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:23.000\nYes, love\n\n40:23.000 --> 40:25.000\nAnd up higher\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nYeah, you want\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nIf you show me, then you do it\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:33.000\nI'm a big boy\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.000\nShow me\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:39.000\nWait\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:43.000\nOkay\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:47.000\nYou see\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nFor the podcast, they're failing to open a bottle\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nOkay\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nOkay, I mean you, all right\n\n40:57.000 --> 40:59.000\nYou want this part of your thumb\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:01.000\nClose to the cap\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:03.000\nOh, the thumb's part of it\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:05.000\nThat's the fulcrum\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nI thought the bottle was the fulcrum\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:09.000\nIt's the thumb\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nOh my god\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:13.000\nIt was the thumb the whole time\n\n41:13.000 --> 41:15.000\nThat's why it hurts\n\n41:15.000 --> 41:17.000\nI'm gonna have to\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:23.000\nI loosened it\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:27.000\nAll right, thank you, Michael\n\n41:27.000 --> 41:29.000\nDo you want to talk about this beer? You brewed it yourself\n\n41:29.000 --> 41:31.000\nSure\n\n41:31.000 --> 41:33.000\nYou said it's Asahi\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:35.000\nLike, Asahi, that\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:37.000\nASAHI\n\n41:37.000 --> 41:39.000\nThat company that sells really light beer\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.000\nThey have a Japanese beer that they make\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:43.000\nThat's dark, and my buddy went to visit\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nAnd they brought some back\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nSo, for New Year's, this is my New Year's beer\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nIs the darker version\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nCalled\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nSo Veli Veli Asahi\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nSo Asahi\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nYeah\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nHow is it like Asahi?\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:03.000\nWhat did you do to make it like Asahi?\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nLet's move past it\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nIt's a clone\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nHow do you clone an Asahi?\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nBy taste\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nI mean, any beer\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nYou can figure out what's in it by taste\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nSo it's not a clone\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nYou just tried to reinterpret it\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nYeah\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nThat's more impressive than just\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nFinding a recipe to me\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nYeah\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:29.000\nIf you have the complete recipe, though\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:31.000\nYou could be like, oh, well, this is wrong\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nBecause of this\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:35.000\nIf you're just making up a recipe\n\n42:35.000 --> 42:37.000\nYeah, it's more experimental\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nCertainly to do it by taste\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nDefinitely\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nEngaging\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nWhy'd you bump it on the podium?\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nTime and place\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nThat's how I cheers\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:55.000\nLike this moment\n\n42:55.000 --> 42:57.000\nIn this place\n\n42:57.000 --> 42:59.000\nI don't know\n\n42:59.000 --> 43:01.000\nThat's how I learn to cheers\n\n43:01.000 --> 43:03.000\nI'm into it, I like learning\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nWell, it's yummy\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nThank you\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nI'm getting woozy\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nNo\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nI guess the joke was that he\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nDrugged me\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nYou know, a lot of people make that joke, I don't know\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nI guess it's just easy to make\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\nIt's the overalls\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nYeah, it was a\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nFarmer John, I decided\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nThe Farmer John thing, MC John\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nI thought it would be\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nIt's L.A.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nWe just assumed\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nYeah\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nI had to call probably\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\n11 places to find\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nOveralls, though\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:45.000\nThis is a good celebration\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nOf my 43rd birthday, which was January 3rd\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nWe didn't have a show\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.000\nThank you very much, Michael\n\n43:51.000 --> 43:53.000\nThank you for the leg\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nI will think about you\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nWhile I'm using it\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nWell, I mean\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nIt's Los Angeles\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nWhat's the new legs name?\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nI never named the legs, but if you\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nSophie\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.000\nGreat choice\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:15.000\nYeah\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:17.000\nYeah\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nYeah\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nYou got some Algonquin round table\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nWith tea\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\nI'll pop in every now and then\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nRhea played\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nWith us on Harmon Quest\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nComing soon to see so\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nIn spring 2016\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nAnd you had a real\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nBurner in there\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nLike a banana\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:45.000\nLike that was fast\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nLike your word play\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nThank you\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:51.000\nYes\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.000\nAnd\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:55.000\nBy the way\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:57.000\nI invited Cameron to do this first\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nAnd then she donated her wife\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nBut it was only because you were in the Harmon Quest show\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:03.000\nTotally\n\n45:03.000 --> 45:05.000\nYou're my favorite\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.000\nYes\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nI know that\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nAnd I'm going to go home and tell her that\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.000\nNo\n\n45:13.000 --> 45:15.000\nAlright\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:17.000\nFor our next segment\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nDid Ridley ever show up?\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nNah, he's beat\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:23.000\nHe's a piece of shit\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:25.000\nHe fucking stranded me\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.000\nWhat I got a text message\n\n45:27.000 --> 45:29.000\nJust in Royland\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:31.000\nIs he here?\n\n45:31.000 --> 45:33.000\nNah, he's not gonna hope so\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:35.000\nI invited him and he's watching Making a Murderer\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nWhat's he saying?\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nWhat's he saying about Stephen Avery?\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.000\nJesus Christ\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:43.000\nDo people not know that cops are bad sometimes?\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:45.000\nLike, why is that still shocking?\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nYeah, but that shit's crazy\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:49.000\nWell, again\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:51.000\nI keep saying this lately\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nBut Philadelphia police bombed a neighborhood\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nTo kill a bunch of black people\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nLike, not, yeah, not funny\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nIt's something that happened\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nIt's horrifying\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nBut that was the 70s\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nThose black people were scary\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:07.000\nWe didn't know what they were gonna do\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.000\nThey were making disco\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:13.000\nParliament\n\n46:13.000 --> 46:15.000\nThere was a guy with a diaper\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nIt was a funk music\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:19.000\nYou're a guy with a fiber\n\n46:19.000 --> 46:21.000\nThey were unpredictable\n\n46:21.000 --> 46:23.000\nAnd I'm not saying we should have bombed them\n\n46:29.000 --> 46:31.000\nI didn't know that\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:33.000\nAre you sure? He said firebomb\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:35.000\nThey firebombed because they thought there were some black panthers\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:37.000\nIn that neighborhood\n\n46:37.000 --> 46:39.000\nWhich, I mean, why would that make it okay?\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nThe reason that conversation came up\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:43.000\nOf course, is because of these dudes\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nOh, yeah, we gotta talk about\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nAbout that list\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nThe ones you guys are calling Yolkata on\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:51.000\nOn Twitter\n\n46:51.000 --> 46:53.000\nThey updated their list of\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:55.000\nYou probably\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:57.000\nI tweeted it\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:59.000\nOr Spencer tweeted it and I retweeted it\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nI told Spencer about it\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nWhile I was still talking about it\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nAnd I really got in there\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nUnder the buzzer\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:09.000\nDo you have the\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nThe last thing I saw was\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nThey wanted the American girl\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nDoll Molly to come back\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:23.000\nWait, is that a\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:25.000\nThat's a joke\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nBecause the list\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:29.000\nThat's my wish\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.000\nThat I'm just putting it in as one of theirs\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.000\nA specific model of radio from\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nWalmart, like they really want the Walmart one\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.000\nWhich is like adorable kind of\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nBut then you're mad\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nBut it also has\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:43.000\nA miracle whip and mayonnaise\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:45.000\nRight above each other\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:47.000\nI'm from Ohio and so\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nI can completely understand that\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nBecause sometimes you want the tangy zip\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:53.000\nOf miracle whip\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:55.000\nAnd sometimes you simply want mayonnaise\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:57.000\nOn your sandwich, I understand\n\n47:57.000 --> 47:59.000\nWhat are those times when you don't let the tangy whip\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nAll the other times\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nDo people in Ohio just get scared\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nThat they're going to taste\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nFor too much good things\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nAnd they're mayonnaise\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nI don't want all that spice in there\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nWhenever I make food for my family\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nThey're like, I don't know, there's a lot of spice in there\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nI'm like, it's pepper\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.000\nIt says miracle right on the jar\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:23.000\nI don't think we should be cracking this open that often\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:25.000\nThis is Ohio\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:27.000\nTake it easy\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nI assumed it was like\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nThey couldn't quell a civil war\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:33.000\nOn that topic\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nGuys, guys, guys, bigger fish\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nHow are we going to take out the government\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nWe can't settle this dispute\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:41.000\nI got that list if you want it\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nGive us some highlights\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.000\nWell, I think my favorite is definitely\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nJust the word\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.000\nAprilans, four inches\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nYeah, four inch aprans\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nThey have Kepler elves\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nAt their place\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nMaking mayonnaise cookies\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nI just, I mean, I guess\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nThey must have multiple people writing the list\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nBecause they have, like, hot dogs\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:07.000\nAnd then they have brats\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.000\nAnd then they have markers\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:11.000\nAnd then later on they have paper\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.000\nAnd chisel tipped markers\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:15.000\nIt's just, it's weird\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:17.000\nIt sounds like they're going to have a science fair\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:19.000\nPotatoes, wires\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nThis is my school\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nSmall light bulb, diesel batteries\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:25.000\nQueen size bed sheets\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:27.000\nTwin size bed sheets, pillowcases\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nI don't know what they're trying\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\nYeah, why queen size, that seems too specific\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nYeah, that's very...\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nHow many beds are in that outpost, right?\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nWell, they also want tampons\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:39.000\nAnd, like, a lot of 100s cigarettes\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:41.000\nWell, tampons makes a lot of sense\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:43.000\nWell, I didn't know they were allowed to have girlfriends\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nAre they supposed to be holed up\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nAnd, like, taking over the government\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nOr defending themselves from it\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nWell, they're not gay or anything\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:53.000\nThey just had...\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:55.000\nThey could just have...\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:57.000\nThey could just, girlfriends just came\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nAnd they're like, we miss you\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nAnd they're like, get in here\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:03.000\nAnd now they're just like, Amy needs tampons\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:05.000\nAnd some basic 100s\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nStat\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nAnd the list is so disorganized\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nBecause I guess they were, like, putting it together\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nAnd somebody was like, well, can we at least alphabetize this\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:15.000\nAnd they're like, hey, what the fuck do you think\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nWe're trying to get away from around here\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:19.000\nWell, maybe we should make a president\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.000\nTo the list, and he should\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.000\nCollect a list tax\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:25.000\nOkay, Steve\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:27.000\nPoint taken\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nWe'll get Miracle Whip and mayonnaise\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nOven cleaner is on this list\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nOven cleaner?\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nWhy does that a priority to anyone ever?\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nLike, they're roughing it, right?\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:43.000\nMy favorite one is throw rugs\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nFor doorways\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:47.000\nYeah, throw out rugs\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:49.000\nNot any in all size\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nFor doorways\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\nBecause doorways\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nNot any in all size\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nHow many doorways are in this thing?\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nJeez, ice scrappers? What does that mean?\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.000\nIce scrapers\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nWhy can't you spell\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:05.000\nI guess it's just a shopping list\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.000\nThey probably didn't prove for you to\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nIt's weird because they just have\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nThey have a lot of half form thoughts\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nLike sugar and flour, but they're not doing anything\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nHow can you think scrapers\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nTo peas\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:19.000\nHow does that person think\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:21.000\nYou spell scrapper with three peas?\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nWell, scrapper's just a thing\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nIt's not a word you spell\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nRight\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:33.000\nIt's not a word used by people that spell a lot\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nWrite it down\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nIt's not something scrappers do\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:39.000\nScrappers just exist\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:45.000\nThey ain't no word or nothing\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nWho here isn't through\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nMaking of a murderer yet?\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nSorry\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nAll our little...\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nThanks for holding up the show, everybody\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nCan't talk about it\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nA little spoiler allergist\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:03.000\nWell, it's fucked up\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:05.000\nThat's all I can tell you\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:07.000\nIt's fucking crazy\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:09.000\nBut in Death of the Salesman\n\n52:09.000 --> 52:11.000\nHe dies\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.000\nThat I can tell you\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:15.000\nHow does he die?\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:17.000\nToo many sales\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.000\nHe oversells\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:23.000\nHe oversells\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nHe sells everything and then there's nothing left\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:27.000\nAnd he looks at himself\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:29.000\nAnd then the lights go down\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nAnd you hear a gunshot\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.000\nAnd a cash register\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nAnd then\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:37.000\nAnd then you hear God saying\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\nJust what I wanted\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nBut if you stay until after the credits\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nGod returns it\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nAnd then he's just like\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nIt's like fire in the sky\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nAnd then someone comes by\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nAnd says are you okay?\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nAnd he goes yeah\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nAnd they go here have some soup\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nAnd he's like what is soup?\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nAnd they're like it's soup from a story\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nAnd they get products\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nWho gives them to them?

54:43.000\nAnd they're like boy that Dan\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nShe sure isn't racist\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:49.000\nWhy do you say that honey\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.000\nWell didn't you notice that\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:53.000\nHe can't even do Sam Jackson very well\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nThe man sounds like\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nIf you did a good impression of him\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nYou'd sound racist\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nYeah I guess you're right\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:03.000\nHe just made him sound like Kate Blanchett\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:05.000\nDo you want to stop in Arby's\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:07.000\nYeah\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nI guess\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:11.000\nIs today our cheat day or are we taking it tomorrow\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:13.000\nWell\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nThe last week we did Friday\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nI figured we could do Thursday tonight\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:19.000\nIt's tonight Thursday we just saw Harmontown\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:21.000\nUh\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nEvery night is Thursday\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nOh my god there's a head in the sky\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:27.000\nPull over\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nThrow a crowbar at it\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nIt's a miracle whip\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nI am miracle whip\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:37.000\nI will make your species\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nTangy\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\nForever\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nNo more mayonnaise\n\n55:45.000 --> 55:47.000\nI don't know why I'm looking at my phone\n\n55:47.000 --> 55:49.000\nI'm really kind of scared\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nI went through a list of things to talk about\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nI think\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nI don't think I have any lesbian questions left\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.000\nWhat was the wedding like\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.000\nHow's the process, is this an offensive\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nHow's the process of planning a wedding\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nSure, well we got fitted for our Birkenstocks together\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.000\nIn October, no we just had it\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:17.000\nWe had it at a venue that we performed at\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.000\nSo that was super fun\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.000\nIt's like a little house type venue in Chicago\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:23.000\nIt's called the hideout\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nAnd we got married there\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nAre you guys both from Chicago?\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:29.000\nCameron's from Chicago, I'm from Akron, Ohio\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:31.000\nYeah, we already knew you were from Ohio\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nI don't retain anything\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:35.000\nIt's fine\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nI just stand up here and sweat and try to get away with things\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:43.000\nHere's my final lesbian question\n\n56:43.000 --> 56:45.000\nDo you ever wish that I saw you as something\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:47.000\nOther than a lesbian?\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:49.000\nNo\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.000\nI'm a lesbian first and everything\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:57.000\nI am nothing if not a lesbian\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:01.000\nYou showed me in the back\n\n57:01.000 --> 57:03.000\nYou have a t-shirt, you got it in a gas station\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.000\nIt says zero to lesbian in 60 seconds\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nLove that T\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.000\nIt's not a bald spot, it's a solar panel\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.000\nFor a lesbian machine\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:15.000\nI liked that one\n\n57:15.000 --> 57:17.000\nLesboholic\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nIf you're reading this\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nThe woman that I really love and respect\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nHas fallen off of my motorcycle\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nPlease help her now\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:29.000\nThat's funny\n\n57:47.000 --> 57:49.000\nThey're great\n\n57:49.000 --> 57:55.000\nAlright\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nHello\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nHow are you?\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:05.000\nWhat?\n\n58:05.000 --> 58:07.000\nCISO is live right now\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:09.000\nYou should watch it\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:11.000\nAnd Harmon Quest comes to it in the spring\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.000\nThank you\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:19.000\nThank you Plugfinger\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:21.000\nPlugfinger?\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.000\nI don't know\n\n58:27.000 --> 58:29.000\nI'm awful sorry about that\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nI'm always the last person to know\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:33.000\nWhen there's regional chicanery\n\n58:33.000 --> 58:35.000\nI believe that's just because of the old studios\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.000\nUniversals at the top of this\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nAnd Sony was at the top of the Yahoo thing\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.000\nA lot of people got mad at Yahoo\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:43.000\nThat's Sony stuff\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:45.000\nYou couldn't watch\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:47.000\nThey didn't play everywhere\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:49.000\nBecause they have these really old school deals\n\n58:49.000 --> 58:51.000\nCarved out for different parts of the planet\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:53.000\nGoing back\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nTo the history of these studios\n\n58:59.000 --> 59:01.000\nI don't know why they don't want to change that\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.000\nI was so excited\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:05.000\nWhen Yahoo thing was happening\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nBecause I was like we're going to be able to count clicks\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nAnd just get an honest number\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:11.000\nOf people like the show\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:13.000\nAnd I was like oh no it's like\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:15.000\nIt's very frustrating\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:17.000\nAnd I didn't know CISO was the same way\n\n59:17.000 --> 59:19.000\nOr if it is or whatever\n\n59:19.000 --> 59:21.000\nBut I got nothing to do with it\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:23.000\nJust moved to America\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.000\nLike all these immigrants are doing\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nGotta build a wall\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nAround the thing\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:33.000\nDonald Trump stuff\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nLooks like Bernie Sanders\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nAnd Hillary are tied\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nWhatever the thing is there that people care about\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nThe elections?\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nThe polls?\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:47.000\nThe polls in Iowa\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.000\nOr something like that\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:51.000\nWhatever the latest data is\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:55.000\nShe's feeling the burn\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.000\nShe should be\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nI have only boring thoughts about politics\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nLike the fact that if there's a neck and neck\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000\nThing going on in the Democratic Party\n\n01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000\nBecause he's running as a Democrat\n\n01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nSo is she\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nAnd then Trump\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nHe's running as a Republican\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000\nThe Republicans have made him\n\n01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000\nDo sign promises\n\n01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000\nAnd do pinky swears that he's going to\n\n01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000\nAbide by all Republican doctrine\n\n01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nIt's really ridiculous\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nI don't know\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nHave they done that before?\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nBecause it's been kind of funny\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nThe kinds of things that they're trying to control Donald Trump with\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nI guess it's not that funny\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nWell if it is\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nYou'd have to get specific\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nI'm not blaming them at all\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000\nDon't get me wrong\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000\nIt's not real clear here\n\n01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nYou can't just allude to a pie fight that happened\n\n01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000\nWell apparently you can\n\n01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nI can\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nI'm a storyteller\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nNot blaming them\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000\nI haven't been following\n\n01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000\nBecause I'm getting scared\n\n01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nThe basic fact that if he's running as a Republican\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nAnd there's nobody even close to him\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nAnd they're all terrified of him now\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nAnd now we have these two people\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nBut Sanders has said\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nThat he won't split the ticket\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nHe'll back out\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nYeah and Obama's not been endorsing either candidate\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nI don't think the people who like Bernie Sanders are like\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000\nOh it's Bernie Sanders\n\n01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nOr Donald Trump for me\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nSo\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nWhen one of them loses\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000\nThey'll switch over\n\n01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nIt'll just\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nIt'll be great\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nWhat no but the idea is\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nIt's Bernie Sanders or\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nYeah I mean like\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nThat's what they don't both run\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nBernie and Hillary you know that's the thing\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000\nOh you mean in the general election\n\n01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000\nYeah when the rubber meets the road\n\n01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nIf they were to somehow split the ticket\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nLike if you were to go off like\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nRun like a nader\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nYeah I don't think that people run as naters these days\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nSeriously do that\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000\nBernie Sanders is Ralph Nader\n\n01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nThat's what\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nWell he's in the Democratic\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nTicket like contest right now\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000\nLike if we get past that point and then he's still going\n\n01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000\nNow I'm going to run as an independent or something\n\n01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nI don't think that's going to happen but if it did\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nThat'd be a possible thing\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nBut I don't think that's likely either way\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nBut I mean everyone's talking about that\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nYou know him presenting a strong challenge to Hillary\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nIs only going to make her seem more\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000\nYou know a better candidate\n\n01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000\nBecause she's actually fighting against a real competition\n\n01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000\nYeah\n\n01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000\nSee boring political thought\n\n01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nBut it's getting kind of important\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nLike we're getting down to the deadline\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000\nAnd this guy is this hitler man\n\n01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nIs still running\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nIt's really scary\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nWell no the real fear is that fucking Ted Cruz\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nIs the one that's hiding behind his shoulder\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000\nIs everyone's going to be like oh great\n\n01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nWe got rid of Donald Trump\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nNow we have Ted fucking Cruz\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000\nAre you kidding me\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000\nTo go with this\n\n01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000\nThis is a reference no one gets\n\n01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nBut like trans metropolitan\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nI was wrong\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nWe're in the back of a comic book store after all\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nBut like Ted Cruz is the fucking\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000\nSmiler\n\n01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nHe was a political candidate\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nWho was like invented by an institution\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000\nHe doesn't have a past\n\n01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nAnd he doesn't believe in anything\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nHe's even said as much\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nAnd in the debates\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nHe gets a lot of steam and attention for saying\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nI'm going to dismantle journalism\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nHe gets fucking applause\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nFor talking about who he's going to destroy\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nThe freedom of the press\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nLike it's fucking insane\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nDonald Trump is like I'm going to fuck my daughter\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000\nBut it's not like\n\n01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nI'm going to fuck my daughter\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nAnd no one can talk about it ever\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nLike he's just a raging asshole\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nBut raging asshole\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000\nIt's not really his platform to be fair\n\n01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000\nIt's just his wish list\n\n01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nYou can't pretend like you can't be both\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000\nFollowing and not following politics\n\n01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000\nOne of his central planks is fucking his daughter\n\n01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nIf elected\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nYou're going to be a chicken in every pot\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nAnd I will fuck my daughter in every home\n\n01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nHe's going to take his daughter\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nInto every home\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000\nAnd fuck her\n\n01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nSorry everybody I got off track\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nBut I mean I don't know\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nDonald Trump is like a crazy asshole\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nBut I feel like a crazy asshole believes\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nThat he's like doing good stuff\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nAnd might actually deep down\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nHave real principles at heart\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000\nBut I don't think Ted Cruz has displayed anything\n\n01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nOther than\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nA baseless desire for\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nPower\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nAnd utter lack of principles\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nBoring political thoughts\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nI'm really terribly unfamiliar\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nWith the guy entirely\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000\nIf he was standing in front of me I wouldn't be able to\n\n01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000\nI've never even seen a picture of him\n\n01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nIf you saw him you wouldn't want him to be\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nAnywhere near you or people you cared about\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000\nHe looks like\n\n01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nHe does bad stuff to kids\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000\nDoes he really?\n\n01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nSo he has a comb over\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nAnd a patchy beard?\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000\nYeah again I've talked about this before\n\n01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000\nI also made passing reference to the fact that I\n\n01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000\nAs someone who looks like a child in a luster\n\n01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000\nNo\n\n01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nWhen someone looks like a child in a luster\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nIt's a real, it's like my version of\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nGaydar\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000\nIt's just like\n\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000\nOnly it's just based on looks\n\n01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nYeah\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000\nIsn't this not how Gaydar works?\n\n01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000\nIf all gay people looked like\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nRip Taylor\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000\nThat everyone would have Gaydar\n\n01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nYou might be right about that\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nWhat do you think gay community\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nDo you have political\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nPolitical thoughts\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nDo you care about politics?\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000\nNo I care about politics\n\n01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000\nBut I just\n\n01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000\nI want\n\n01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000\nHillary to run\n\n01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nBut I feel like it's crazy that I'm like a woman\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000\nIn 2016 and I'm like scared to say that\n\n01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nBecause so many people are like\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000\nBOOM\n\n01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nWe did a show in San Francisco and we're like\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nJust off the cuff said Hillary\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000\nLike not even talking about her and all\n\n01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000\nThe whole room was like\n\n01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nBOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nIt's just like amazing to me\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nThat there's a female candidate and people are like\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000\nNo no we have a socialist old white guy\n\n01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nSo we're going with him now\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nShe's going to have to wait 20 more years\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nI mean\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000\nIs it just\n\n01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nThat she's a woman I mean\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nNo I think she's capable\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nI know that she has made bad choices\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nHere's the thing like\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nShe wasn't always on board with gay rights\n\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nIn the government but also like\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000\nHey my family wasn't always on board\n\n01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nWith gay rights until I\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000\nTalked to them a bit and they were like\n\n01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nOh okay now I get it\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nYou yourself probably maybe\n\n01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000\nOh yeah I was like I'm not gay\n\n01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nFor like\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000\n20 years\n\n01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nSo\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000\nHappens to the best of us Hillary\n\n01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000\nI understand\n\n01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nWell but keep going\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nCause I don't really know anything\n\n01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000\nSell me on her and I'm not unsold on her\n\n01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nBut now's your chance\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nYou gotta pulp it\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nIt's 9-11 it's a perfect time to do it\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nOh yeah\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nWell\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nAs we all know Hillary was\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nHere are some other things you should never forget\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nHillary was\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000\nThe mastermind behind 9-11\n\n01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000\nAnd brought no I don't know\n\n01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nI just\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nNo I'm kidding it's a joke thing\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000\nShe voted to change the melting point\n\n01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nOf steel\n\n01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nYes she did\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000\nShe keeps trying to lower it\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nYeah\n\n01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000\nI'm just\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000\nI'm totally curious like I'm not\n\n01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000\nSure I mean my position is just that\n\n01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000\nIt's America and it's\n\n01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000\n2016 and it's time to have a female\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000\nPresident and I think she's more than\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nQualified to do the job and like\n\n01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000\nShe could be better but\n\n01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000\nEvery candidate could always be better\n\n01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nSo that's how I feel about that\n\n01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000\nOutside my depth I don't have enough\n\n01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000\nIf anyone calls me\n\n01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nUp to the carpet\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nTo explain any of it I won't have anything\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nTo back it up but\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nMaybe I'm reflective of all of America\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nIn that regard\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nBecause none of us have time to\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nResearch any of this shit but it just seems\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000\nLike she's a little\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nShe's very\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nEffective and a little\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nShe's\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nLike she's on the right side of\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nLike left\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nNess like she's very\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nShe's a little\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000\nKind of conservativey\n\n01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nThat's what\n\n01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nYou don't care\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nI'm tired\n\n01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nI just want it\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000\nDo you think that'll change the national\n\n01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000\nPsyche on a fundamental level? Obviously\n\n01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000\nI do actually\n\n01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000\nDonald Trump will change the fucking national\n\n01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nPsyche\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nObviously electing Barack Obama didn't\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nFix everything but I do think\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nThat on a long enough timeline\n\n01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000\nLike something that Chris Rock\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nActually said in a Rolling Stone\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000\nInterview like affected me a lot\n\n01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000\nIn that he was talking about his kids and he was like\n\n01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nMy kids are growing up\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nKnowing from the time\n\n01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nThat they were children that a black\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000\nMan has been the president of this country\n\n01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000\nAnd they will not think the other way\n\n01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nLike they don't think the way\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000\nThat we think in this room because\n\n01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000\nWe weren't kids and so that is just\n\n01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000\nIn their brains and that's how they're going through the world\n\n01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000\nSo I think that as\n\n01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000\nChildren for boys and girls\n\n01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000\nAnd everyone on the gender\n\n01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000\nSpectrum to see a woman\n\n01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000\nIn the White House would be an effective\n\n01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000\nChange for this country\n\n01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000\nTo see women as equals that can do the same jobs\n\n01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nAs men\n\n01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000\nIt would put a woman\n\n01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000\nLike Obama's getting such a bad fuck it\n\n01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nLike this is such a\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nSuch a shitty time to become president\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nAbsolutely, I mean he had a congress\n\n01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000\nThat was like no on everything no matter\n\n01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000\nWhat he did\n\n01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000\nIt took us 20 years\n\n01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000\nTo realize that Jimmy Carter wasn't\n\n01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000\nA pariah because it was just put in our\n\n01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000\nHeads he was a bad president\n\n01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000\nHe just spent his\n\n01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000\nTerm handcuffed and like\n\n01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000\nHe couldn't do anything and like\n\n01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000\nMe the most important thing though\n\n01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000\nIs personality because I'm too jaded\n\n01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000\nI just feel like we're electing\n\n01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000\nA person that's going to speak for the country\n\n01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000\nLike at fucking holiday\n\n01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000\nParties\n\n01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000\nLike they're going and meeting\n\n01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000\nLike oil sheiks and like\n\n01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000\nWalking around and being in newspapers\n\n01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000\nAnd saying stuff like I don't\n\n01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000\nReally believe in the system\n\n01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000\nEnough to think that the president has more of a job\n\n01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nThan that but that's the thing is like\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000\nWhen you look at that job description\n\n01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000\nLook what JFK did look\n\n01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000\nWhat Roosevelt did\n\n01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000\nThe other one the\n\n01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000\nThe guy with the pith helmet\n\n01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000\nThe guy in the wheelchair\n\n01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nLike there's a you know you can create\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000\nA whole national psyche\n\n01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000\nSo if she was\n\n01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000\nLike elected and then\n\n01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000\nShe was like walking around and she was kind of\n\n01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000\nBad ass just in terms of swagger\n\n01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000\nI do think that would be\n\n01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000\nThat would be good beneficial for everybody\n\n01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000\nWhether they realize they're benefiting from it\n\n01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000\nOr not I just I'm not\n\n01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000\nI don't know if I trust her to\n\n01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000\nHave that swagger like\n\n01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nObama talks like a fucking game show host\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000\nHe's amazing like listening\n\n01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000\nTo his fucking soothing voice and his\n\n01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000\nLack of\n\n01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000\nLike after eight years\n\n01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000\nOf that fucking potato\n\n01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nYeah\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000\nI want to not care about politics\n\n01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nEvery time that guy opened his fucking\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000\nMouth he was like\n\n01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nI'm sorry I'm sorry\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000\nTo the fucking retarded people\n\n01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000\nI thought\n\n01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000\nMy sister's retarded\n\n01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000\nYou need to deal with it\n\n01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000\nShe gave me a pass\n\n01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nShe looked into my eyes\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000\nAnd she said no I'm not going to do it\n\n01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nHe's going to Gervais\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000\nHe's going to Gervais\n\n01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000\nThe anyways\n\n01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000\nLike her personality\n\n01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nIf we started this conversation\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000\nAnd I said I don't like her personality\n\n01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000\nYou might walk away going\n\n01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000\nHer personality is that she has a vagina\n\n01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000\nThat's what you don't like\n\n01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000\nWe're ending the conversation that way\n\n01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000\nBecause you\n\n01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nYeah\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000\nI would love a woman president\n\n01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000\nI don't\n\n01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000\nShe's\n\n01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000\nHer speeches\n\n01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nHer fucking\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000\nShe's\n\n01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000\nGot a uterus\n\n01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000\nNo I'm just kidding\n\n01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nIt's not true I swear to God\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000\nI mean if she was just more bubbly\n\n01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nAnd had some pom poms\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000\nI mean\n\n01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nI like all kinds of women\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000\nMiss Mame\n\n01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000\nMiss October\n\n01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nThere's a woman\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000\nEvery month that I really approve of\n\n01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000\nI just\n\n01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000\nI want her to be Margaret Thatcher\n\n01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000\nEven though you ask British\n\n01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nPeople are you fucking insane\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000\nBut I just mean\n\n01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nIn terms of\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000\nHave a woman\n\n01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000\nWe eventually put on a coin\n\n01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000\nWhen we call old iron fucking\n\n01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000\nButt\n\n01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nTo get away\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000\nFrom those\n\n01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nDiacotomies and stuff\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000\nWe had a fucking badass\n\n01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nRuler\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000\nThat issued us into a world\n\n01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000\nOf exploring space\n\n01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000\nAnd reducing our prison population\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000\nAnd things turned around\n\n01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000\nAnd it would be great\n\n01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000\nTo have a\n\n01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000\nJust as with a ship\n\n01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000\nTo have a woman at the front of that\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000\nGoing like this\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000\nWith a lesbian t-shirt on\n\n01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000\nLike I'm up here\n\n01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000\nNot shells\n\n01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nHillary's coin\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000\nI'm up here\n\n01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000\nBut\n\n01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000\nAnyways\n\n01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000\nBut yeah\n\n01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nI fully admit\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000\nI have no fucking nothing\n\n01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000\nBecause I'm just kind of disgusted by the whole thing\n\n01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nEvery time I start getting into politics\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000\nI always\n\n01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000\nWithin the first five minutes\n\n01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000\nI'm like this is so gross\n\n01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000\nI'm an anarchist\n\n01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000\nI want that guy\n\n01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nThat landed the helicopter\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000\nOn the congress lawn\n\n01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000\nWith a male man\n\n01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000\nWith all the letters\n\n01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000\nI want him to be president\n\n01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000\nI want that guy\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nVote for me\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nAnd I will make campaign reform\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000\nI'll call for campaign reform\n\n01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nAnd then quit\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000\nAnd then whoever's my vice president can take over\n\n01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nAnd you can impeach him if you want\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nBut there will be a mandate\n\n01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000\nIncluding conservatives\n\n01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000\nIt's a bipartisan issue\n\n01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000\nEveryone wants campaign reform\n\n01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000\nEven\n\n01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000\nI will honestly say it's more important than\n\n01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000\nGlobal warming campaign reform\n\n01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000\nBecause it encompasses everything\n\n01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000\nBecause we're still so far\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000\nThe biggest country in the world\n\n01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000\nMaking the biggest effects\n\n01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000\nOn the world\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000\nWe have the biggest chance of getting China to stop\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000\nPumping fucking smoke into the sky\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nWe can't get our shit together\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000\nUnless we stop intermingling\n\n01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000\nCapitalism with politics\n\n01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000\nHas no place in it\n\n01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000\nIt's insane\n\n01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nThe idea that in order to run for president\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nYou have to have billions of dollars\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000\nWe're so fucked because of that\n\n01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000\nAnd all we have to do is pass\n\n01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000\nOne law\n\n01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000\nSo shut up you jaded fucking redditor\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000\nI'm jaded here\n\n01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000\nIt used to be illegal\n\n01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nTo spend money on a campaign\n\n01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000\nI think\n\n01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000\nBack in George Washington's day\n\n01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000\nHe didn't spend money\n\n01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000\nMaking the case that you should be president\n\n01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000\nTo the point it's gotten today\n\n01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000\nIt's just astonishing to think about that\n\n01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000\nCitizens united\n\n01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000\nJesus Christ\n\n01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nI mean that shit is so fucked up\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000\nYo\n\n01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000\nIt's gotten so much more fucked up\n\n01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000\nAlso what happened to all these antitrust laws\n\n01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000\nThey made us learn about in high school\n\n01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000\nWho just merged now\n\n01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000\nAnd fucking like\n\n01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000\nMobile exon\n\n01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nAnd fucking time magazine merged\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nOr something\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000\nWhat those companies merged\n\n01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nWhat the fuck in the goddamn monopoly\n\n01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nWhat the fuck\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000\nThe idea\n\n01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nWhen the phone company got too big\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nAnd people panicked and had to break them up\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nNow we have businesses that are too big to fail\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nSo we gotta keep them\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000\nWe gotta keep them around\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nWe gotta keep them not failing\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nIt's the exact opposite of busting a trust\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nThat's when I get boring\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nEveryone said it before\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000\nThat's the big short\n\n01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000\nIt takes that dark turn\n\n01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000\nThey knew the whole time\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nWe were asking ourselves if they were stupid\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nOr if they were stupid\n\n01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000\nBut they were evil and they were just confident\n\n01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nIn the government they would bail them out\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nAnd make poor people pay for everything\n\n01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000\nI'm gonna eat a dick\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000\nSo mad I'm gonna eat a dick\n\n01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nYeah\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nOld iron butt\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nI'm gonna put\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000\nI'm gonna put\n\n01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000\nCan you imagine a welder at work\n\n01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nAnd it's like hey did you hear\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nWhat the chancellor of Germany\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000\nSaid\n\n01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000\nAt the UN\n\n01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000\nAnd then\n\n01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nHillary said what she said back\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000\nAnd she told him\n\n01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000\nOur president's awesome\n\n01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000\nAnd then he goes back to welding\n\n01:17:33.000 -->

01:17:41.000\nAnd he'd be like I'm so hard welding today\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000\nAnd my dad hit me so\n\n01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nAnd then he'd see his wife's face\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000\nAnd he'd be like you look like the president\n\n01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nJust\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000\nJust make me a sandwich\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nYou

01:18:45.000\nWell\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000\nWhat's your name sorry\n\n01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000\nMy name's Adam\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000\nApologies to people don't like anyone named Adam\n\n01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000\nBut that's what's happening\n\n01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nI was just gonna make a joke about how the voting\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nStarts once everyone's\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000\nApologize to each other\n\n01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nBut then you apologize for your name\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nAnd it's the first name ever\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nIt's like the least offensive name\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000\nAnyone can ever have\n\n01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nIt's the one god named Adam\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000\nI'm the first person\n\n01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000\nSorry\n\n01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000\nNo in Canada\n\n01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000\nShit is totally different because we don't vote for a president\n\n01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000\nMan we vote for like\n\n01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nOur individual\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nRepresentatives like if there was a senator\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nThe senator\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nWould go off to Washington\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nAnd then all the senators\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nAll the individual parties would get together and talk to everybody\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nAnd be like here's what our party believes\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000\nAnd there would be all the different parties\n\n01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000\nAnd like the fucked up thing is imagine there was like a Texas party\n\n01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nBecause we have the Quebec party\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nAnd they all they get tons and tons of votes\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000\nImagine there's like a Texas party\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000\nAnd they control like a third of it\n\n01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nAnd then there's like the conservative party\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nWhich is like way more left-wing\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nThan your guys is like left-wing party\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nWe hate them and then\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000\nWe have our like left-wing party\n\n01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000\nAnd then the middle party which is like\n\n01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000\nEh let's shit happen\n\n01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nAnd everyone gets elected\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000\nThey get a certain number of seats and then they divide it up\n\n01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000\nAnd whoever has the most gets to run the place\n\n01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000\nAnd nobody leaves a tip\n\n01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nNo no 15%\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000\nReally? Yeah 15% man it's pretty standard\n\n01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nOr if you don't you say sorry\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nWait you tipping\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000\nI thought you didn't tip\n\n01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nI thought tipping wasn't customary in Canada\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000\nAnd that's why like waiters and bartenders\n\n01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nLike they complain about Canadians\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000\nHave you not been tipping in Canada?\n\n01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nJack I tip everywhere\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000\nTossing toonies all over the place\n\n01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000\nYeah man\n\n01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000\nIs it toonies or loonies\n\n01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000\nWe're getting a $5 coin\n\n01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nAnd then shit's gonna get real confusing\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nNo I really thought that I don't know\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nAnd I also wouldn't be surprised if you said\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000\nIn this fucking\n\n01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nWhat do you call them?\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nProcedurals? What are your territories?\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000\nI don't know yeah\n\n01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000\nBecause I thought\n\n01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nWhere did I get that from\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000\nThe tipping thing is that changed\n\n01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nOr has it been over 15%\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000\nI think it's Europe\n\n01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000\nWhen I went to Europe I was trying to give people money\n\n01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nAnd they were like oh we don't do that here\n\n01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000\nAnd it was really confusing\n\n01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000\nSome people are genuinely offended\n\n01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000\nThey feel like you're saying you can own them\n\n01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nOr something\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000\nIt's included like their bosses\n\n01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000\nDon't take tips\n\n01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000\nWe're gonna pay you more\n\n01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000\nAnd there's a big argument\n\n01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nAdam explains different Adam\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000\nAnd he has a thing\n\n01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nOr Adam shits on this thing\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000\nAdam ruins everything\n\n01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nSorry that was rough\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000\nApologize\n\n01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nI'm very sorry to everyone\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000\nHe had a thing about tipping that was very accurate\n\n01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000\nWell will you do it for us?\n\n01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nWill you say\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000\nSay the word about\n\n01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000\nAbout\n\n01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000\nWow\n\n01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000\nAre you faking?\n\n01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000\nNah I listen to too much American television\n\n01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000\nDo you want me to say it properly?\n\n01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000\nHouse?\n\n01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000\nHouse\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000\nDo they say who's?\n\n01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nOkay let me tell you what that's about\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nSee there's about\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nOn the east coast\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nThat's where everyone sounds more Irish\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000\nAnd that's where everyone's all talking about\n\n01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nThe trawler and the fish\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000\nSee how you going there boy\n\n01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000\nGoing to Newfoundland\n\n01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000\nThey sound like the stereotypical Canadians\n\n01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nBut that's not me\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000\nWhich is obviously a cousin\n\n01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nOf my homeland Wisconsin\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000\nEverybody talks\n\n01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nLike the Fargo people\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nPeople don't talk like that\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000\nThat's a little over the top\n\n01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000\nBecause now you're watching\n\n01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nMaking of a murderer in Manitowoc\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nAnd it's like\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000\nAt that particular time\n\n01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000\nYou gotta get him out\n\n01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nNotice that the murder weapon\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nWas in place there\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000\nIs that a RAV4?\n\n01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nThat's a 99\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nToyota\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000\n99\n\n01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nYou looking at the plates there?\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000\nNo\n\n01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nI'm not looking at the vehicle\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000\nThat was insane\n\n01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nFuck you guys\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nWe're conscious of your spoilers\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nBut also it's a real thing\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nIn the world\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000\nThat happened\n\n01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nIt's been in the news\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nYou can't really spoil a thing\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000\nI'm interested now\n\n01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nYou get to watch the whole thing\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nAnd then you get to do\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nThe whole second wave\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nBecause everyone starts talking about how\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000\nThat's not accurate\n\n01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000\nAnd then you get to read all the extra shit\n\n01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nIt's fun\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nIt's fun when people go to prison\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nLike the Memphis\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000\nThis is like a genre\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nOf entertainment for us\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nIs miscarriage of justice stories\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nThat we never paid attention to\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nIn real life\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000\nSecond screen experience\n\n01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nAnd then there was like\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nThe CNN on TV\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000\nAnd the airport\n\n01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nThat was like\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nNetflix is so popular\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nOf course people are petitioning\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000\nAnd saying like\n\n01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000\nI'm trying to not do any spoilers\n\n01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000\nAnd it's like\n\n01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000\nNothing's gonna change\n\n01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nNo one cares\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nThat you watched the Netflix show\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000\nLike they were aware\n\n01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nOf the stakes at the time\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000\nThat this shit was happening\n\n01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nIt is\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000\nAnd not that I disapprove of that\n\n01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000\nI think it's great that when you're watching\n\n01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nSomething like that\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nYeah, whatever, what am I talking about?\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000\nStick your head up your ass\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000\nI'm talking about the\n\n01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nSorry for interrupting\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nNo, no, no, I wanted to get back to that character\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nAt that point in time\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nWe had noticed that\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nThe blood was\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nComing out of a decapitated head\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nAnd so\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000\nWe decided\n\n01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nAt that particular time\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000\nTo go and investigate\n\n01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000\nBehind the barn\n\n01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nAnd what did you see\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000\nBehind the barn\n\n01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000\nCorporal Langerhanger\n\n01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000\nWe saw\n\n01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000\nThe rest of the body\n\n01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nAnd there was blood all over the place\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000\nYeah, it's like a relative\n\n01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nNone of that is real from the thing\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000\nThere's no decapitated\n\n01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nThere's no blood\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nIt's like\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nIt's like a Norwegian thing\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000\nRight?\n\n01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000\nHow does that actually work?\n\n01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000\nI think it's like a British Isles\n\n01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nActually thing that diluted\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nIt got really\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000\nIt's a poor people accent, actually\n\n01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nNo, really\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nIf you guys want to talk about what divides people\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000\nEveryone's like, oh, race this, race that\n\n01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000\nOr regions this, no, it's just rich and poor people\n\n01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nBack in the day it was all Irish people\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000\nOh, Canada\n\n01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000\nOh, Canada\n\n01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nFor us it was the Ukrainians\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nEveryone shout on the Ukrainians\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000\nAnd they were like, oh, you smell like cabbage\n\n01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000\nBut the Irish for the longest time\n\n01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nWere the shitty people\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nAnd that was like the ghetto-wise\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nThe language that was floating around\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nSo that's where a lot of it comes from\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000\nThat doesn't change the fact that\n\n01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000\nAccents are, they're genealogical\n\n01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nLike definitely for sure\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000\nWisconsin, for sure\n\n01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nOh, yeah\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000\nThe most effect on Wisconsin's accent\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000\nIt's like\n\n01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nIt has to do with the earliest\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000\nSettlers to that area\n\n01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nComing through the\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000\nNorth and coming down\n\n01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000\nOh, you're down the south there\n\n01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000\nBut they were coming from\n\n01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000\nI believe\n\n01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nIt's like when you hear it and you compare it to\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nNorwegian accents and stuff\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nIt has something to do with that, I don't fucking know\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000\nI don't know\n\n01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000\nBut I have opinions and I'm like shouting years down\n\n01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000\nI don't know\n\n01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nBecause you're like, it's just, when you're poor\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nWhen you're poor you don't just decide to elongate your o's\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nI can't afford\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nTo talk cool\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nThat's from now on\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nThat's a boat\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nYour dad's too\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nPoor to go to the country club\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nAnd then you just all sit around talking about lumber\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nAnd then he's like, I don't fucking\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000\nLet's go fishing then, alright\n\n01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nI can't afford the letter U\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nYeah, pretty much\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000\nI sold it\n\n01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nI sold it for a boot\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nWe traded it in for rye down at the store, eh?\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nLet's see\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nCanada questions\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nWhat does Canada think about lesbians?\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nWe're very cool with lesbians\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000\nWe're all over gay rights and gay marriage\n\n01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000\nTell her like you mean it\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nI'm just kidding, we're into it\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nWe're with you\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000\nI really appreciate your support\n\n01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nI do have to say one thing though\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nEve was framed\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nYeah\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000\nLilith\n\n01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nLilith was framed actually\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nThere you go, this guy knows what's talking\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000\nSorry for Lilith\n\n01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000\nI appreciate it\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000\nWho's Lilith again?\n\n01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nCome on\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000\nI'm sorry\n\n01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000\nWait, wait\n\n01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nThat's not in the real bible\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nEducation time\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000\nWas this in the Torah?\n\n01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nThis is a super old story\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nAdam had a first wife before Eve\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\nAnd she came down\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nAnd she was all like, here's the way it's gonna be\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nAnd Adam's like, whoa now\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nThat's a little too aggressive for me\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nThat's a little too gay\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nGet the fuck out\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nLet's make a new one, pull a rib out\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nMake an Eve and she's all like, I do whatever you want\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nAnd so that's the story that Christians know\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nBut there's like Lilith Fair\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nOf course\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nIs based off the idea that there was an uppity woman\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nWho didn't do what she was told\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nWas there or wasn't there?\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nI mean I'm not asking if the bible was real\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nIs there some version of the bible?\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nIt's apocryphal, there's a lot of apocryphal\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nIs it Gnostic?\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nIt's like Gnosticism\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nThere's texts out there\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nMidrash\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nI love Midrash\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nSo there's actual texts\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nThat have been filed away\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nMaking a Midrash\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nI'm only halfway through though\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nI won't spoil the ending for you\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nI won't spoil it for me\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nWhat was the other thing?\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nWas it that there was a female disciple\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000\nOr was it just that Mary had more of an active role?\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nMary Magdalene was actually\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nDisciple\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nShe got married to Jesus\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nAnd then there was a baby\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nTom Hanks\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nTom Hanks was there\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nI remember that one\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nIn Canada we believe all of these things\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nThat's the problem actually\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nRight now we just actually came through\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nA big push to get back to\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nOur more lefty side\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nWe had an asshole that was kind of Ted Cruzy\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nIn Canada by the way\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nAnd we just had a big election\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nWhere we elected a reality TV star\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nWho's very funny\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nOh we should try that\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nYeah do it man\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nWho's a charismatic\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nReality TV star\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nWho's kind of like lefty\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nAnthony Bardane\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nThe guy from Shark Tank\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nWhat's that guy?\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nRobert\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nNo the liberal one\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nI'm a religious\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nRobert\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nRobert Dvorirak\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nWhat?\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nWell here's the thing\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nHis dad was actually\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\nA really super famous\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nPrime Minister before this\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nHe called on all sorts of shit\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nBut then after that his son came out\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nAnd did a bunch of blah blah blah\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nI'm a rich kid I don't care\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nHe had a really famous video of him being famous\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nFor falling down the stairs\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.320\nMr. Justin Trudeau, yes?\n\n01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.520\nJustin Trudeau, he came in.\n\n01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.840\nHe created a Junesberry.\n\n01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.840\nYep.\n\n01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.400\nYeah.\n\n01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.640\nAll right, well, so yeah, I think, like, yeah,\n\n01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.880\nobviously, I was kidding when I got\n\n01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.200\njingoistic about Canada because I'm not feeling particularly\n\n01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.280\npatriotic over the last eight years or so.\n\n01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.520\nBut not because it's just eight years.\n\n01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.800\nIt's not far back as I can remember.\n\n01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.400\nI think, but I think it is, like,\n\n01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.880\nsince his election, which was a kind of exciting thing that\n\n01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.840\nmade you feel like politics could be part of a story again,\n\n01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.200\nthat whole national psyche thing, and then it just, like,\n\n01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.960\nturning back into the Jimmy Carter thing,\n\n01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.800\nor it's just like, oh, so we're just going to watch people.\n\n01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.960\nThey love fucking lying, and they think it's all a game,\n\n01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.240\nand their job is to win, and it fucking everybody just, like,\n\n01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.400\nblames everybody else.\n\n01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.560\nWell, your guys' media is fucked up.\n\n01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.840\nYeah, it's definitely bad.\n\n01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.360\nI'm not blaming you, sorry, I'm just saying.\n\n01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.280\nIt's like, well, here's the thing.\n\n01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.800\nAll right, here's all society's problem.\n\n01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.240\nWe don't have a fucking, when you get those freemium games.\n\n01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.960\nDon't blame Candy Crush for your politics, man.\n\n01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.040\nThey know, because inevitably, in those freemium games,\n\n01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.920\nthere's always, like, two forms of currency.\n\n01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920\nYou know, the way they get you is they go, like,\n\n01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:05.480\nsplooges to buy more seeds, and the splooges, you can,\n\n01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.760\nlike, there's always a secondary currency, though.\n\n01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.360\nThere's always, like, mana points or something like that,\n\n01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:14.080\nand it's like, it's because if there was just splooges,\n\n01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.360\nand that's all that mattered, there's inevitably going\n\n01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.120\nto be a way to cheat the system.\n\n01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.360\nLike, the system's not going to keep working unless there's\n\n01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.040\nsome kind of, like, secondary value system,\n\n01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.280\nand obviously, what it needs to be is, like,\n\n01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.400\na fucking, like, actual cultural one.\n\n01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:31.960\nLike, we actually need to understand, and in some way,\n\n01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.160\nwe need to understand that there's, like,\n\n01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.640\nthe money is, like, poker chips that make the casino run,\n\n01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.800\nbut that there's something larger, like, the electricity,\n\n01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.680\nwhich is, like, human life.\n\n01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.040\nLike, it's like, like, where it's like,\n\n01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.560\nif you could just make electricity,\n\n01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.000\nthat's more valuable to Las Vegas than any of your money,\n\n01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:50.840\nor it's either because they're like,\n\n01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.320\noh, we can make the cowboy on the sign,\n\n01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.800\nlike, have more lassos now.\n\n01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.000\nLike, so you can stay, and you're valuable at this casino too.\n\n01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.560\nIt's like, we don't have, like, it's like,\n\n01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.240\nand you can't use the word religion,\n\n01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.320\nbecause it turns people off,\n\n01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.720\nbecause religion has been co-opted\n\n01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.040\nby a bunch of fucking capitalists.\n\n01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.680\nAnd, like, but it's like, that is the problem\n\n01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.920\nthat America infected the whole planet with,\n\n01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.200\nis just like this, because we're so good at, like,\n\n01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.120\nwe were just like, oh, fuck it, no class systems,\n\n01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.160\nno kings, no family history, fuck it,\n\n01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.360\nlike, it's just like, money, money, money, money,\n\n01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.000\nit'll be the biggest, it'll be the hotel lobby of the world,\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.680\nand everybody can come in, and it's just like,\n\n01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.120\nif you're Irish, you're a piece of shit,\n\n01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.240\nuntil you know how to make something like soap\n\n01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.240\nthat we can use, or Lucky Charms, and then we'll use it.\n\n01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.280\nAnd then if you're valuable, then you can be rich,\n\n01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.800\nand you can be mayor, and you can be president,\n\n01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.280\nand fuck it, and it doesn't, nothing matters,\n\n01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.400\nand it's like the American dream,\n\n01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.160\nthat that's our, whether that ever actually existed,\n\n01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.840\nthat was the dream, that was the idea,\n\n01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.360\nit was egalitarianism through capitalism, meritocracy.\n\n01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.520\nYeah, but then someone monetized egalitarianism.\n\n01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.600\nThen someone monetized monetization.\n\n01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.000\nSomeone said, I'll watch the money, that'll be my job,\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.960\nand I'll pay myself out of the money,\n\n01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:00.920\nand then I'll give you interest,\n\n01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.320\nand someone said, hey, what if a tornado comes through?\n\n01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.280\nOh, I'll sell you insurance.\n\n01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.120\nWhat's insurance?\n\n01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.680\nSomething you're now required to have,\n\n01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.320\nif you get pulled over, a guy with a gun\n\n01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.440\ncan ask to see your insurance,\n\n01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.400\nbecause if you hit someone, it might cost him money.\n\n01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.600\nWell, that doesn't seem very fair.\n\n01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.600\nWell, why don't you sue me?\n\n01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.760\nWho, what do you mean sue?\n\n01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.000\nWell, suing is a new form of law.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.840\nIt means you can just take all of someone's money.\n\n01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.680\nWell, who can sue who?\n\n01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.440\nAnyone can sue anyone.\n\n01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.960\nBut if you're more rich than someone,\n\n01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.720\nyou can survive the suing, and if you're poor, you can't.\n\n01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.360\nSo if you're poor, you can't sue rich people,\n\n01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.960\nbut if you're rich, you can sue anyone,\n\n01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.480\nand if you're rich, you can also get sued,\n\n01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.960\nand it won't matter.\n\n01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.160\nLike, well, who's gonna conduct all this?\n\n01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.000\nLawyers.\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.600\nYou have a right to counsel.\n\n01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.520\nHow does that work?\n\n01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.160\nWell, if you're poor, you get one assigned to you,\n\n01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.400\nand you're fucked, and if you're rich,\n\n01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.880\nyou can decapitate a woman with a knife,\n\n01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:44.800\nand then walk away.\n\n01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.360\nIt's like, yeah, you know what?\n\n01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.600\nI'm taking that stance.\n\n01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.040\nI think O.J. done it.\n\n01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.560\nI got a hunch, and I'm just going with it.\n\n01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.080\nEvery problem we have stems from,\n\n01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.160\nit's not that capitalism is inherently evil,\n\n01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.160\nit's that it was never designed,\n\n01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.560\nit was never meant to be unmitigated.\n\n01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.880\nI don't think it was ever designed.\n\n01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.200\nIt just kind of fucking sprang up and was a monster.\n\n01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.400\nThat's the good thing about it, though.\n\n01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.440\nThe reason it's sprang up and is useful\n\n01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.040\nis because it's not a bad thing by nature.\n\n01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.160\nIt's about efficiency.\n\n01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.480\nIt's about getting more shit done per minute.\n\n01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.720\nIt is about, it does hold an enormous potential\n\n01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.520\nto equivocate, what the fuck is the word?\n\n01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.040\nWhat's he saying?\n\n01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:34.880\nEquivocate?\n\n01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.600\nNo, that's when you wishy-wash, doesn't it?\n\n01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.440\nEquivalency?\n\n01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.680\nEquivocate means like, whatever.\n\n01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.400\nIt does have an enormous potential to even everybody out,\n\n01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.560\nespecially in a world where we were like,\n\n01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.720\nokay, divine right of kings and we're done with that\n\n01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.520\nand now it's just like poker chips.\n\n01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.240\nIt has, it's all the more necessary,\n\n01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.760\nall the more necessary in a world\n\n01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.720\nwhere that is the only thing that's important,\n\n01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.520\nthat there be another more important thing.\n\n01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.360\nIt has to be.\n\n01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.640\nOtherwise, it's like, how much does this bullet cost\n\n01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.760\nand how much is this black kid going to do\n\n01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.320\nif we pursue his presumption of innocence\n\n01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.400\nor we protect him?\n\n01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.120\nLike, how much money is that gonna cost?\n\n01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:13.080\nLike, everything gets turned into money\n\n01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.920\nand then people actually fucking start suffering\n\n01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.560\nand we have to like, I don't know,\n\n01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.600\nit's like, you can't invent it,\n\n01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.920\nyou can't just come out with something.\n\n01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.640\nBut imagine a world where you were driving down the street\n\n01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.360\nand you saw somebody that needed help\n\n01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.400\nand you were on your way to a meeting\n\n01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.760\nwhere you might make a bunch of money.\n\n01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.240\nI know that there's, working backwards from the goal,\n\n01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.240\nI know that there's a world where you could stop your car,\n\n01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.040\nget out and be like excited\n\n01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.640\nbecause you haven't seen someone in need in so long\n\n01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.440\nthat it's like fucking bubble wrap.\n\n01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.360\nIt's like a thing you get to do that's fun.\n\n01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.080\nLike, and it's something you get to brag about\n\n01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.120\nwhen you get to the meeting that you have to reschedule.\n\n01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.960\nThat meeting just became worth less\n\n01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.840\nbecause of this opportunity to be happy for you.\n\n01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.200\nI'm not talking about all of a sudden\n\n01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.720\nbecoming good people,\n\n01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.080\nI'm talking about the fact that we look at goodness\n\n01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.240\nas being this weird thing,\n\n01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.400\nlike advertising that we have to tolerate or something\n\n01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.400\nthat we have to force ourselves to do.\n\n01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.040\nI'm talking about switching that\n\n01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.040\nwhere because we all know that once we're forced\n\n01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.960\nto do good shit for other people, much like showering,\n\n01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.440\nwe're always happy we did it afterwards.\n\n01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.280\nLike, like I just-\n\n01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.120\nAre you though?\n\n01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:17.960\nDon't lie.\n\n01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.320\nIt's just hard to take off your pants\n\n01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.240\nand get into a fucking cold water\n\n01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.960\nthat's pelting your Asperger skin.\n\n01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.040\nLike, it's like, you don't have Asperger's,\n\n01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.880\nshut up, I'm rich, I can say whatever I want.\n\n01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.560\nSee, that's the problem.\n\n01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.280\nBut I know that there's,\n\n01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.760\nbecause there was like, if there was currency to that,\n\n01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.280\ninstead of it, it always feels like,\n\n01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.880\nyou were saying like stupid people incur loss\n\n01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.520\nand rich people are smart people gain.\n\n01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.920\nAnd it could be like,\n\n01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.480\nyou don't have to be talking about money,\n\n01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.240\nyou can talk about like getting upset and all this shit,\n\n01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.040\nlike stupidity is like loss and you try,\n\n01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.880\nlike if there was a way to gain\n\n01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.400\nin a way that you could measure somehow\n\n01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.720\nfrom helping other people,\n\n01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.880\nit would be, it would turn around so quick.\n\n01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.280\nCause the market would fucking flood\n\n01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.400\nand there wouldn't be so many homeless people\n\n01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.320\nthat you would have to feel like you were doing nothing\n\n01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.080\nand wasting your time and becoming homeless yourself\n\n01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:17.920\nby helping them.\n\n01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.760\nThat's the fear.\n\n01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.800\nThat's all we, we're not like this.\n\n01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.240\nWe don't want to not care.\n\n01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:23.480\nWe're forcing ourselves.\n\n01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.320\nWe're like emotionally anorexic.\n\n01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.920\nLike we're controlling our fucking spirituality.\n\n01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.200\nWe're like starving ourselves because we are scared.\n\n01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.960\nAnd like, that if we spend the time helping somebody\n\n01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.000\nthat they're going to suck our time and our money away\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.800\nand we're going to become just like them.\n\n01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.600\nAnd then it's like that.\n\n01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.640\nWe, so we got to figure out how to flip that system\n\n01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.240\nso that it can be a video game.\n\n01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.280\nWe'll never gonna, we're never going to not be monkeys.\n\n01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.560\nWe're never going to not want to gain.\n\n01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.480\nWe just have to figure out how to put a value on that.\n\n01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.600\nChina, you know, China's been doing that.\n\n01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600\nThey started with their murder vans.\n\n01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.560\nYeah, you know, hear about these Chinese murder vans.\n\n01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.920\nNo, they, they, they, they started this game.\n\n01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.120\nI don't remember what it's called,\n\n01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.840\nbut it's, it's like meow, meow beans.\n\n01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.320\nYeah. The good citizen game\n\n01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.760\nor some shit. That's like a cult, man.\n\n01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.760\nThat's fucked up.\n\n01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.680\nI mean, it's more like fascism, but okay.\n\n01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.040\nLike a fascist cult.\n\n01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.280\nWell, fascism is like a cult when it's fascist, I think.\n\n01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.400\nAnyway, I'm just like, it's this game where you,\n\n01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.680\nyou get points for being a good citizen\n\n01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.080\nand it's like all fun and games,\n\n01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.680\nexcept in five years it becomes mandatory for all citizens.\n\n01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.040\nSo everyone's going to be required to be all like,\n\n01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.720\noh, I, you know, I prayed to Mao.\n\n01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.360\nThat's racist, right?\n\n01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.560\nDo they pray to Mao?\n\n01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.760\nIt's a good analogy.\n\n01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.800\nAnyway, like, or, or if you're friends with people\n\n01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.160\nwho say bad stuff about the government,\n\n01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.880\nyou'll, you'll be docked points.\n\n01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.360\nSo you got to unfriend your buddies on Facebook\n\n01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.360\nwhen they're taking anti-party lines.\n\n01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.880\nAnd that's, that's like an evil version\n\n01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:49.920\nof what you're talking about.\n\n01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.560\nBut there could maybe be a game\n\n01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.720\nthat's more just about like karma points.\n\n01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:54.840\nYeah. Or something.\n\n01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.240\nYeah. And I can't, I don't know if it's like\n\n01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.920\nactually just instituting points like that.\n\n01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.200\nOr if it is just more like, like, like, I don't know.\n\n01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.040\nLike just-\n\n01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:02.960\nYou're talking about points, man.\n\n01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.000\nStop talking about points.\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000\nWe don't need points.\n\n01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:05.840\nMoney is points.\n\n01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.440\nStop talking about what people should stop talking about.\n\n01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.000\nNo, points are the problem, man.\n\n01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.440\nMoney is literally points.\n\n01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.400\nYou argue, you love art.\n\n01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.560\nYou love like, you're telling people that they're wrong.\n\n01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.400\nSorry.\n\n01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.520\nJust have a conversation.\n\n01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.360\nYou don't have to just,\n\n01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.760\nyou don't have to just tell people.\n\n01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.520\nHave you ever talked about movies with a Canadian?\n\n01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.720\nIt's fucking galling.\n\n01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.960\nIt's like, it's like, will you take it easy?\n\n01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.520\nIt's like, I can either like or not like Godzilla\n\n01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.360\nand so can you.\n\n01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.840\nJust fucking stop yelling at me.\n\n01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.480\nUnless you're talking about the Matthew Broderick one\n\n01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.080\nin that case, that's bad.\n\n01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.360\nNo, at university.\n\n01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.840\nAny movie can just be liked or not liked.\n\n01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.000\nYou guys are, you have great socialized medicine,\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.320\nbut you're terrible at talking about movies.\n\n01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.440\nAnd your Taco Bells have french fries.\n\n01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.280\nSorry.\n\n01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.000\nWhereas Americans are obviously,\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.320\nour greatest gift is for not generalizing.\n\n01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.880\nNo, I think, well, you're talking about points\n\n01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.600\nand like a system of rewards or like a-\n\n01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600\nThat's how the human brain operates.\n\n01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.760\nThat's why money works.\n\n01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.800\nIt's like, it's dopamine.\n\n01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.560\nIt's like getting a fucking like prize.\n\n01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.440\nIt's getting a jackpot, getting a fucking like-\n\n01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.280\nIt's winning points.\n\n01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.560\nLighting something up.\n\n01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.000\nLike, there was this thing on NPR.\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.240\nThere was like, there was this medicine\n\n01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.600\nthat helps you get over, was it Parkinson's or?\n\n01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.920\nGet over Parkinson's.\n\n01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.240\nThere's medicine that helps you get over Parkinson's.\n\n01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.080\nGet over it.\n\n01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:17.920\nHoly shit.\n\n01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.040\nNo, it's a treatment for some kind of,\n\n01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.040\nsome illness I can't remember,\n\n01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.520\nbut it like, it spikes your dopamine so high\n\n01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.040\nthat they didn't realize what was happening\n\n01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.320\nuntil a couple people like actually got really fucked up\n\n01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.160\nby this, dopamine causes you,\n\n01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.840\nit makes you really, really susceptible\n\n01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.000\nto gambling addiction.\n\n01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.520\nOh, is this the multiple sclerosis medicine?\n\n01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.520\nIt could be, I don't know.\n\n01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.360\nThe important thing is the dopamine aspect of it\n\n01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.240\nbecause they found out by this happening,\n\n01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.120\nit was like, why are these people\n\n01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.480\non this medicine becoming like inveterate gamblers?\n\n01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.960\nLike they're fucking losing their homes.\n\n01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.440\nAnd it turns out, and they did this thing where they're like,\n\n01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.840\noh, it's just fucking like three cherries come up\n\n01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.200\nand a little reward comes out.\n\n01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.720\nAnd it's like, what happens in your brain\n\n01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.920\nis this dopamine spike.\n\n01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.160\nAnd that's what has driven our entire species\n\n01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.760\nbecause we experiment and then we,\n\n01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.560\nsomething happens that benefits us\n\n01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.160\nand we get a fucking little baby orgasm about it\n\n01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.440\nand it like marks it.\n\n01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.760\nAnd then we, so that's how we get addicted to drugs.\n\n01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.280\nThat's how we get, we're always chasing that spike.\n\n01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.680\nAnd so that causes racism.\n\n01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.480\nThat causes like our capacity for categorization\n\n01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.440\nand solving problems.\n\n01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.640\nI figured it out.\n\n01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.680\nAll of the people that made me have a bad day yesterday\n\n01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:25.600\nwere Mexican.\n\n01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.160\nI'm like, what a reward.\n\n01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.120\nIt's bad, it's good and bad,\n\n01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:34.200\nbut it's like, it's this powerful engine that we run on.\n\n01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.000\nSo I think like, you can write software\n\n01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.040\non top of that machine language\n\n01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.840\nthat maybe it's a point system, maybe that's bad,\n\n01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.160\nmaybe there's a way to get beyond a point system.\n\n01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.800\nBut I think the biological fact is\n\n01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.720\nthat our brains do run on that engine.\n\n01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.400\nLike we do run on like figuring out puzzles\n\n01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.240\nand getting rewarded for it.\n\n01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:56.520\nOh, totally, you're totally right.\n\n01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.440\nWe're very much like meaning engines,\n\n01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.920\nwe're problem solvers, we attribute things to points.\n\n01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.720\nBut when someone says, this is worth a point,\n\n01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.440\nsomeone else is gonna go, how can I make money off that?\n\n01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.520\nHow can I make two points for every one point I make?\n\n01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.480\nSo if you can get rid of that system\n\n01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.640\nand instead say, well, what if I gave away all my points\n\n01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.280\nand then I stopped feeling like a piece of shit,\n\n01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.200\nthat would be a better system.\n\n01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.560\nIf it was just like getting rid of stuff,\n\n01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.320\nmade everyone around you feel good,\n\n01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.880\nand then as a result of that, you felt better.\n\n01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:30.120\nThat socialism, motherfuckers.\n\n01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.840\nYeah, I mean, there was a way to create a system\n\n01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.840\nby which we could all hit the tip,\n\n01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.160\na tipping point of understanding that as in the video games\n\n01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.000\nwhere we have points and then you spend them\n\n01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.280\non like upgrading things,\n\n01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.240\nthat the upgrades weren't just for you,\n\n01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.200\nthe upgrades were actually your contribution\n\n01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.360\nto the society and all that shit.\n\n01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.080\nYeah, we'll figure it out, we're gonna figure it out.\n\n01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080\nHope you do.\n\n01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.840\nWe're better quick.\n\n01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:52.840\nCanada's doing pretty good,\n\n01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.000\nso we're waiting for you to catch up.\n\n01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.480\nYeah, I mean, you guys can't be doing that good, right?\n\n01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.920\nNot well, our dollar sucks,\n\n01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.760\nit sucks being down here right now\n\n01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.400\nbecause everything costs like a buck and a half more.\n\n01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.600\nIt must be a nightmare to buy magazines in Canada, right?\n\n01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.120\nThey already cost more and then the dollar is weaker, right?\n\n01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.200\nSo it's like they gotta cost like 25 bucks\n\n01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.960\nfor a fucking people.\n\n01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.520\nWhat?\n\n01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:20.240\nYou think people buy people?\n\n01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.800\nI mean, if they wanted to.\n\n01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.920\nThey're the luckiest people of all.\n\n01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.600\nHere's my equivalency.\n\n01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.080\nMagic cards cost five bucks a booster pack.\n\n01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.280\nThat sucks.\n\n01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.080\nDid you just try to say buster pack?\n\n01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:36.320\nNo, it's a nerd thing, I don't know.\n\n01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.760\nBut everything costs more.\n\n01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.360\nAll right, well, let's thank Prime Minister Adam\n\n01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.200\nfor coming by.\n\n01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200\nThank you.\n\n01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.480\nAll right.\n\n01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.480\nSo what do you think?\n\n01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.640\nDeMorge isn't back there, right?\n\n01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640\nIs he?\n\n01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640\nNo, I think he might be at Sketchfest.\n\n01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640\nYeah.\n\n01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.560\nI'm in 2016.\n\n01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560\nThank you.\n\n01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.680\nI know that means you love me,\n\n01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.600\nbut I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.\n\n01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.280\nBut what we should do is go out in the street\n\n01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.560\nand grab people that we really, really like\n\n01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.880\nand just make them be president.\n\n01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.360\nThat would be the way to do it.\n\n01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.280\nBecause it should just be a job that's like,\n\n01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.600\nit's a civil servant, you know?\n\n01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.800\nLike the country runs itself.\n\n01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800\nHow the fuck do you

01:46:37.480\nYou ever wonder what would have happened if Watergate had happened at like a Marriott?\n\n01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.480\nOr Four Seasons?\n\n01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.480\nAnd then there would be...\n\n01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:47.480\nIf a president got caught embezzling, it would be called like embezzle Four Seasons.\n\n01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.480\nOr embezzle Flate Four Seasons.\n\n01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:58.480\nThat's the kind of stuff me and Stephen Wright think about in 1980.\n\n01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.480\nWho's your favorite stand-up, Rhea?\n\n01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:08.480\nWho was your hero that made you want to be a stand-up?\n\n01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.480\nWell, honestly, this is going to be so cliche, but Ellen DeGeneres.\n\n01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:16.480\nBut I watched her when I was like...\n\n01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480\nI wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.480\nYeah, I mean, it's perfect, isn't

01:47:36.480\nI remember when I was a kid, I thought Ellen was very plucking and fun and funny.\n\n01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:42.480\nThat was before she became an icon of controversy slash progress slash whatever.\n\n01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.480\nShe is a solid stand-up comedian.\n\n01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:49.480\nCertainly because her contemporaries, not to throw them too much under the bus,\n\n01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.480\nbut her contemporaries were Rita Rudner.\n\n01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.480\nActually, Paula Poundstone was really funny.\n\n01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:56.480\nDid you watch Paula Poundstone's show on HBO?\n\n01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480\nDid you ever see that?\n\n01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.480\nI feel like I did.\n\n01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.480\nShe just had regular people up and talk to them.\n\n01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:05.480\nShe would have firemen and dentists and stuff.\n\n01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.480\nShe was like...\n\n01:48:10.480 -->

01:48:49.480\nEach $10 gets you entered into a thing where you have a chance of being a voice on Rick and Morty.\n\n01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.480\nYeah.\n\n01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.480\nAnd I'll hang
