00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Music

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I have to do this myself?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Anyway, I'm here to control her Rhea Butcher

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Music

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
From well down comics in Hollywood, California

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Harvard Town is now in session

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Music

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, it's for

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Music

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Help me welcome to the stage

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Spencer

00:41.000 --> 00:53.000
Music

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
And the man of the three hours, Dan Horvath

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Music

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Thank you,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Comptroller Rhea Butcher

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Applause

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Congratulations on your wedding

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Thank you, Dan

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
To Cameron

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
For bringing Cameron his procedure

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It is a real thing

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
I couldn't be a stronger supporter of gay marriage

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Straight marriage, I

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Me too

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
I just don't think it works

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I think you guys take it more seriously

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I think we should just hand off the mantle

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
We'll take care of it for a while

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Obviously straight people have decided at some point

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
That we get married three times a lifetime minimum

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
It's like molting for us

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
It's like you have your

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't know, they have expressions for it

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
The third wife is the lizard wife

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I don't even know

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Third wife, lizard wife

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Paper anniversaries, same thing

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, the first time we met

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I think was on this stage

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
And we inadvertently found out

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
But it makes total sense looking at you

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
That you're like a huge back to the future fan

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Is it accurate to say that when you

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
When you pick the look

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
You're like I want to look like Marty McFly a little bit

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, a little bit, and a little bit of George

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
And a little bit of Biff

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Just like a little bit of each one

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And then Lorraine at heart, you know

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
1955 Lorraine at heart

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Not original 1985 Lorraine at heart

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
No, god no, just a weird clay face

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
John's performer, they wanted to reach up

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And just tell a story

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
But we were both in San Francisco

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
When you came back, you have a little story

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Speaking of which

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I do have a story, so this morning

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I was in San Francisco International Airport

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Which is a very small airport

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And I saw this woman in a pair of uggs

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
And then just like a general airport outfit

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And she looked very familiar to me

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
And I was like pfft, no way

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And then I started walking around a little bit more

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And I was like no, maybe

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
And then I saw her again, I was like pfft, no way

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
And then we got on the same plane together

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
And she had like a bunch of teenage kids with her too

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
And we got on the same plane

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
And then as I passed her, she like turned on the seat

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
To talk to somebody behind her

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
And I looked back and it was, in fact

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Leah Thompson on my flight

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And I was like oh my god, it's your mother

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
And uh, I did

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I wasn't going to bother her because it was a plane and stuff

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
But then I went to the bathroom and was walking back

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And she was walking towards me

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And I was like, I'm really sorry

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
But I have to just tell you my huge fan of yours

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And she was very nice, she was like, what's your name?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
And I was like, oh my name's Leah

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
She's like, oh, so close

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh no, oh

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
And it was perfect

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
That's the Japanese version of my name

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Uh, I had a

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Fucking airport plane story as well

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Fucking Delta

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Cock

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Cock-marrying Delta

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Equal rights, cock-treating

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Delta, I fucking, like

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
I would never fly Delta by choice

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
But it was like the festival booked the flight

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Sure

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
So flying back

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I'm so sorry

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
But I have not flown coach since the first time

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I flew first class

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I put it off

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I really literally have not

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Except for maybe once to Las Vegas

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Because it was like

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But like, so, you know, I mean

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Oh, I fucking

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Again, always with the thing

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
With the once again

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a full flight

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Oh, how did that happen?

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
And I'm so sorry

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm so sorry for your full flight

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Are you gonna be okay?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And every fucking thing they say

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Is once again, just a reminder

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Once again, because it's a subtle

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Technique to infantilize you

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
They're always implying that

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You're a fucking idiot

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Once again, once again

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Once again, folks, once again

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
We do have a full flight

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Talk to me like a normal person

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And what will be revealed is that you're shitty business

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Like, stop, stop, stop

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Talking to me like you're a teacher

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
You know, and that I haven't learned

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Something about your fucking full flight yet

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
And then I go to my seat

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
It says 6A and it's in fucking coach

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
And I'm like, well, maybe

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Their definition of a full flight

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Leaves the seat open next to me

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
They're doing one of those things where they

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I'm like, and then this guy

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Plows down next to me and I'm like, what the fuck

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
And he's like, who's this guy

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I was like, I guess

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Maybe it's because I texted Steve just to make him feel bad

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Who was on the plane

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I was like, you're fired

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
I said you're fired as you walk by

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So I think maybe for that reason

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Steve, did you contact somebody on the

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Did you tell somebody that I was

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Okay, so that's what

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
So then the flight attendant comes by

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
And says

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Who's supposed to be in 1A

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Because we had when we bought

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Hey, I had a receipt

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It was a warning pass at 6A

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
But the receipt said 1A

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
And I said, oh, me

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Yeah, and he said

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
We apologize, sir

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
But I'll pause it right there

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
That's not an apology

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
We have to stop doing that

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Especially corporations

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
They say we apologize, sir, but

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah, you can't include sorry and but

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
In the same sentence ever

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Sorry, but it's your fault

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I'm just saying

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You can't narrate a theoretical apology

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
You can't

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I owe you an apology

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm sorry, I spilled that

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That thing on you, I owe you an apology

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
We'll fucking make it

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Cash it, let's cash that sucker down

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Because as my therapist told me

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
An apology is

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
An acknowledgement of the offense

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
An expression of remorse and

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
A commitment to change

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
And without all three of those ingredients

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
It's an apology, I'll take one delta

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
One of those

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
We apologize

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
But sometimes we downgrade

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
The aircraft and then sometimes

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
When we do that, sometimes this happens

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
That was his apology

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
That was his addressing of it

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And he said

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And if we had caught it on time

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
We could have done something

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And I said, what does that mean?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm sorry

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
When we downgrade the craft

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Sometimes this happens

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
And then sometimes this happens

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I said, I heard you

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But if we had caught it on time

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
What does that mean?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It sounds like you have a disease

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Sounds like cancer

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I think you have delta cancer

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I forgot there was people over here

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Sorry, I'll do this show a little bit

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Who is the we that's supposed to catch it on time?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Am I responsible for this?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
No, we apologize

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
But sometimes we downgrade the fight

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
He just kept repeating himself

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
What would you have done if you caught it on time?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Offer you miles?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
And he said, delta miles?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Do I look like a

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Like a guy to whom those are worth things?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Oh, delta miles, my favorite

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Like I'm cuckoo for delta miles

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
I'm delta rich

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Honey

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
I don't have any money, but I have the equivalent

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Of money and opportunities

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
To interact with delta

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
A million delta

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Hours are coming

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
The thing is, the guy is standing

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
He knows what he's doing

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
If you ever have a complaint

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
On an airline, they have

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
All the control, because I can't sit

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
In coach going

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm too rich to be sitting next to

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Everyone with an earshot of me

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
There's been some kind of mistake

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I can't do it

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
And he's projecting

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
His answers to me

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And I'm trying to murmur

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm too rich to be

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And his answers are like

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm sorry, sir

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
He never said I'm fucking sorry

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
We apologize, sir

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Everyone's story is going to be

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
There's some prick up there

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
That doesn't understand downgrading very well

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
And keeps demanding things

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And then it's just actually because

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm a big fan of community

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And it takes a selfie

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
With me on the way out

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
The flight attendants are like

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Six seasons in a movie

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And I'm like you fucking suck

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
You fucking suck

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Six seasons into miles

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Six thousand miles of

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I don't know what's your miles

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I want my money back

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
You know why that plane was downgraded

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
You know it was because it was not full enough

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And I can't stand that shit

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
If you book an airplane ticket

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
God damn it

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
If you book an airplane ticket

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And you don't show up

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
They keep your money so why do they consider it

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
A fucking crisis to have an empty seat on their plane

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It's not

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
They're not losing money

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
If everybody didn't show up

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Fly the fucking empty plane over the ocean

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And fucking keep your fucking money

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You fucking cartel

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You fucking horrible

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Horrible companies

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Just like

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
They do everything they can to murder you

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
By taking you up in a metal tube

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
That should not be able to stay in the air

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
There's monsters on the wings

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
They keep denying it

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Anyways congratulations on your marriage

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Thank you

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Thank you

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't know why my straight marriage

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Didn't work

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm a delightful person to be around

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
And travel with

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Don't know why my wife would have left me

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
But I have a feeling she's probably in the arms

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Of a woman right now

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
If she's smart

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Let's see

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So fuck Pixar

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I have a hair

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Just because the Golden Globes were tonight

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And Anomalyza

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
My movie

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
That I executive produced

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Thank you

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I did a hell of a job

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Executive produced the fuck out of that movie

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It lost to

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
You know

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
M&M's in your head

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Or whatever

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
The memory islands

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Also memory marbles

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Pick a lane

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Are the islands made of marbles?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Are they powered by them?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Bing Bong felt a little lazy

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
First thought, best thought I guess on Bing Bong

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Home by 5

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm just being bitter

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Of course we all love Pixar movies

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
It's just tonight's not a very good night

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
To love them

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't know why everyone had to love them that much

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
They're doing fine

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
We made a fucking movie

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
About the futility of monogamy

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
In a garage with Charlie Kaufman

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Can't have a Golden Globe

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I don't know why your applause

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Front row

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
They're just getting the vodka off their hands

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And it keeps flying off my

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
It's a really bad night for you guys

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I haven't trimmed my beard

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And it's like really like wicking

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And like

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
There's just droplets are flying

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
So I'm really sorry I just pretend you're at SeaWorld

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Alright

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So I want to

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
So last night

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That episode hasn't aired yet

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
But we had a young lady who had just

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And I mean just gotten done

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
With a double mastectomy come up on stage

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
She wanted to talk about it

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And all I know

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I mean she's like

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Had done chemo and she was

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Still on the stuff

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
She was like fresh off of the

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Process and was like

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Just sharing her story

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And all I know as a guy

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Is like I only know like

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Oh it's so important that women

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Talk about this I totally know

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
That's why I was so excited

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
But I had no idea what to ask her

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
If I did a good job or a bad job

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Because she was like

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Had just gotten done being sick

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And it wasn't about me so I couldn't be like

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Am I doing a good job?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
But I think I did anyway and I was like

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Am I supposed to be doing this difference

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
What's your relationship with your boobs

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I don't know what to do

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I'm fucking everything up

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And I tweeted at her like

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
How did that go for you the next day

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And I don't think she responded

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I may have done it wrong

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
It doesn't revolve around you

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And she needed sleep Dan

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
She just got done with a fucking operation

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
But I don't know

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't know

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Is there a connection

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
You must have more friends than I do

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
That have been through breast cancer

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I don't actually

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Really? No

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I mean you're gonna tell me you don't

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Hang out with Tignataro all the time

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Well she did drive me here

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It's for the lesbian shuttle service

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
It's very convenient

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
There's gotta be a great app name

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
For that

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Homobile

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
That's not mine

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
That's a real thing that exists

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Homobile?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah homobile

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
It's like a ride sharing service

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
For other things

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah prostitutes

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And drag queens

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And people who specialize in body glitter

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And stuff

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
There's a lot of discrimination

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
In taxicab services

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And they also don't like glitter

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And stuff

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
And so like they really

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Apparently you know

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
It's hard to get a cab when you're in drag

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Is the discrimination

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Because of the glitter?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Or do you think it's like a cultural discrimination

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I don't want that person in my car

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
I bet there's 16 people for which

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Is just a practical concern

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Intolerance

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
But for those people

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
There's a

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Phobomobile

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Fo...

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
They can drive each other around

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
They just use glitter

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Twitter

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
That was bad

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
It just rhymed

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It wasn't a pun or anything

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I just rhymed two words

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
But I guess the answer is you don't have

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
An appropriate

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It wasn't my job

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
It's good for more women to talk about it

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Because the alternative is

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
I think this era is kind of

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
More past ending

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
It's not like

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
We get it now

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Women should talk about it

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Because otherwise the risk is

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Women being so ashamed

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
That they don't check themselves

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Or don't seek treatment

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Or just like

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
What is the risk of women

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Not talking about it

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
What's the terrible thing that can happen

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
All of it

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I think it's women withering away

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
In towers

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Without anyone coming and talking to them

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Just in our own tower by ourselves

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Falling apart

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Aging

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I felt a lump but I'm not going to tell anybody

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Because my breasts are my

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
That seems like a very 50s thing

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Or if it was ever anything

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
We could blame everything on the 50s

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I'd say blame Delta

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Or maybe it's

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
More for men's benefit

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Women need to talk about it

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Because men sexualize and objectify women

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
And it's like we're like

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
We need to

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
The alternative would be men being like

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Ew gross

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Your boobs got

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Your boobs got a cold

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Your boobs used to be sick

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
But now they're sick

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
That's according to her

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
She sounds like I don't know if this is

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Lucky for her or if

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This is just the new

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
This is the advance of medicine

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Or technology

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
That you can just

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
That you just basically

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
End up with I think

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
A nice pair of fake boobs

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Because they take them off

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And then they put in the bags

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
But somebody else told me

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I had a friend who has a mother

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Who went through this process

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But maybe it was longer ago

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And she said you know

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
They're like mannequin boobs

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
And I was like boing

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Why were you like that?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
My penis became erect

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So fast that it made a cartoon

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Diving board

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Sound

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I miss mannequins in films

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh man

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
We just don't put mannequins in film and TV

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
As much as we used to in the 80s

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
What about the film mannequin?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
I mean I like that one

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
In my top three mannequin based films

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Mannequin is definitely in my top three

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
But Kim could trial

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah of course

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
It's my favorite thing about lesbians

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
You can go there

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
But also like Andrew McCarthy too

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Because he's like kind of a hot lesbian

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Exactly

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
God damn it

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I want to talk about hot chicks with you

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I know Andrew McCarthy

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Is a hot chick

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
That is true

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
He's funny

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I was a kid and I saw that movie

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
With a high voice

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
He's a leading man

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
He's a dreamy lady

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
He's pretty dreamy

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
And you know

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm sure

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Mayshack Taylor's performance

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Is still heralded as progressive

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
By the gay community

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I'm assuming

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Everyone on Homobile

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
For sure

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Loves Mayshack Taylor's

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
That must be a

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
That must be a serious bummer

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
For actors who are like

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Culture advances so quickly

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
There's actors out there

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Who are like oh I played

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Like gay guy number five

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
In this thing and then it's like

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
15 years later

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
They must feel like

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Man I got conned

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I was told that I was doing a great job

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And all this stuff

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And I feel like I'm part of the problem

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
And then they go to the library

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And they just sit in the corner

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
And they eat peanuts

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Just loudly eat peanuts

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
In the library

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
His 80's style glasses break

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
And he can't read any of the books

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
In the library

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
His 3D glasses

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I was asking you in the green room

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
You haven't seen the Back to the Future documentary

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
That I was in

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Where they tricked me into saying

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Back to the Future 2 and 3 suck

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Fine

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I was

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
At an airport and I rode down

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
An escalator next to one of the guys

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
That shot that interview

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
And he was like hey it's me

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I was like oh hey

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
You guys really kept that thing in there

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And he's like yeah

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
But you know what it's good

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It's good

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
People like it

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I was like

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
You can't just make something true

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I mean I'm sure it's good for you guys

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
To have a villain in your documentary

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Because I said

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
In the thing I was like

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I said come on

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And he's like what

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And I was like come on

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Don't make me say it

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
To make you say what

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I know that you're shooting a documentary

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That Zemeckis and Gayle are going to be in

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
They're my heroes don't make me say

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Back to the Future 2 and 3 sucked

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And they put it in right before

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
A whole chapter of the documentary about

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
How great Back to the Future 2 is

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
So I mean

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
They knew what they were doing

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
People love to hate me

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And I look great in it too

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I look like fucking Bigfoot

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
So not like now

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Now you're like well groomed and handsome

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I'm just telling you it was a bad day

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
If you watch it I look like

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Walked into a fan

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
The fan part is added so that Matt Groening

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Doesn't get offended

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I don't know what

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The effect of the fan is

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I just

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
By the way I'm not texting

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I realize you're here

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And I respect you I'm just

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Looking at my notes

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Oh I saw that Golden Globes

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Highlights like

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
The only thing I saw was

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Denzel Washington got the Cecil B. DeMille Award

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
And during his speech

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
He said

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
He started breaking up

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
He started to cry a little bit

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Right after he said this

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
We'll never know what he meant

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
He said I want to thank my mother

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
For convincing my father

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
To

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Get higher than 25 watt bulbs

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Yeah

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Because he thought

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
If they were lower wattage we could save money

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
And then he started crying and then he moved on

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
And then he was like done

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
We'll never know

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I care more about that

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Than what Ricky Gervais said to Mel Gibson

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
That got blamed

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Do you know what he said?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
He said what does sugar tits even mean

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I wasn't sure I thought maybe I had inside info

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Because I was texting people and sitting in the Golden Globes

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Which is why I know that Brad Pitt loves Anomalysa

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And then he came and he was sitting at the table

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
With our guys

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
There was a chair available

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
For him because Charlie left

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
After we had lost

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I think I'm probably not supposed to

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Say that

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I just think that's funny

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Brad Pitt sitting here in Charlie's chair

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Where's Charlie

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
He took off

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Charlie's gone

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
But

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
He likes Anomalysa

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
And that's cool because

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
He uses my beard in the big short

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
The 25 watt bulb

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
My only theory was

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Did his dad get

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Like his mom said you should get more than 25 watt bulbs

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And his dad was like

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Does this satisfy you

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And he got a big spotlight

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And then little Denzel stood in

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Like

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It's showtime

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
It's showtime

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I don't know if I have a Denzel impression

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I thought I'd find out

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
It's showtime

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
It's showtime

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
It's showtime

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Yep

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I'm Denzel Washington

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I'm John Lithgow

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
John Lithgow

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I'm John Lithgow

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
My mouth is a circle

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
You sound like John Lithgow

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
When you put your mouth in a circle

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
You don't look like him

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
But you sound like him

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Sometimes

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I got some gifts

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I'm talking about girls screaming

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
In the green room

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
It happens to me all the time

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Every time I enter a room

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Girls start screaming

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
You were saying your hotel was next to a playground

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
In San Francisco

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
And there were girls

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Watching a football game

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
In the airport

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And I thought there was an

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Isis attack

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Girls

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
From

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Age

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
3 to 20

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Will just shriek

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
To express happiness

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
They won't even differentiate

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It sounds like there's a murder happening

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
My adrenaline

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I was mad

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Sitting at the airport

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I can't do an impression of it

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I thought Isis was there

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It's a football game

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
There's teams winning

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
And grown men

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
When you're little tiny kids

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
All kids do the same things

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
But grown men

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
They make these horrible sounds too

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
When they're watching sports

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
But for that

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
You think there's a person

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
About to hurt you

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
A person's about to get hurt

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
If you will

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I'm so happy

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
And I made

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Some of your favorite

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Pulled pork sliders

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I got to stop doing that

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
My throat is shredded

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
From shrieking at the football game

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
You and I came to the same

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Conclusion

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
It's because girls

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
It's not because girls are socialized

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
To do that

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's because they're socialized to do so much other shit

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
That they repress them

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
When they're little kids on the playground

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
All they can do is scream

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
That's all they can do to affect

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
It affects people

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Men

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Start inheriting a planet

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Where they can just

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Throw chairs and

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Smash it! Smash it again!

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
And that is a sport

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And women are just like

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm gonna do that thing

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's my carry power

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Everyone flies

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Against the wall

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Yeah, women

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
What can we do?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Just like being married

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
To one

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
It was my fault

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It was my fault

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
My wife is a hero

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
She got away

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
She got away

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Fuck Pixar, Brad Pitt lives on

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Annalisa, Miss Dectomy, Wedding

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Leah Thompson, Airport

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Denzel, Flight 25

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
What bulbs

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
They were showing the real

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Denzel Washington real to give him his award

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
But they were like

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Showing all those little phrases

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
And things

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
But they were like showing him flying

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
The plane upside down

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
It wasn't like

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It was kind of funny

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Like what an actor

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
It's amazing

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Remember when he flew that plane upside down

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
They were just showing the plane

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Hits his head

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Then they just cut to him getting knocked unconscious

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
He's so good at getting knocked unconscious

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Yeah

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I'm pretty sure

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
They really should have shown him doing all those lines

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
In that movie

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Did you like that movie?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I was very affected by that movie

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I thought it was the best alcoholic movie

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
That I've ever seen

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
It's not like the whole Jekyll and Hyde

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
You're such a terrible person when you're drunk

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
That's why you should quit

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
And then people don't relate

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But that was the first movie I ever saw

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
No, I'm great at my job when I'm drunk

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I save lives

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Fantastic! I still should quit drinking

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And it's up to me

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Because I will get away with anything for the rest of my life

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
It got to me

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
It really got to me

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, okay

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Let's get to the gift portion

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Of our friend Michael

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Michael, do you want to come up here

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
So you can

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
You brought me a couple of gifts

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
You brought me like a...

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
They got him back in the green room

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Someone could bring him up

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Can you bring that big box out?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
This is very nice

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Thanks, Steve

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I knew what it was

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Through the wrapping

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I thought I'd open it out here

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Got to use comic book paper

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Mike, draw

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Sorry about that

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
For the podcast

30:41.000 --> 30:57.000
It's a leg-shaped object

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
I know there's no replacing old faithful

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
No, yeah, and I found out

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
It was a heartbreaker

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I found the thing

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
One of the writers suggested

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Why don't you look on the mannequin leg

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And see if there's a model number

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
And it was a

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Carol Barnhart

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Displays

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Incorporated

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
And I found old faithful

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
I found my plastic mannequin legs

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
There's a whole career

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Making those things, apparently

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
What do you mean?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Carol, whatever

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
There's a whole group of people

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Making mannequin legs, apparently

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Branding

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Get into that

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
But I guess she went out of business

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
No one's picking up the phone

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
It was ringing

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And I was kind of relieved

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
That no one picked up

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Here we go again

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
This conversation, but I would have had it

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Is 197B available?

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And the...

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I'll take two bent

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Straight, but no, they're gone

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I found this on eBay first

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
And then I found a phone number

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
And it was like a place in El Monte

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And I was like, oh, do you have...

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I don't know what the part number is

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And it's like, oh, well, is it

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
MN-189, color?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I was like, oh, I'm speaking your language

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
That's how you got that mannequin leg?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Yep

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Shit, you could just...

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Okay

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I found a physical place

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Wait, what do you mean you had it?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Oh, wait, no, I can't talk about that

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I found the physical place

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
No, I tried, me and Steve have been trying

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Trying to get a replacement leg

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
With toe articulation

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Not articulation, but, you know

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
With toes

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
We went to the swap meet this week

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
And we walked it backwards

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
I mean, there was a mannequin

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
But the toes weren't separate

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
There's a lot of caveats

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
In mannequin work

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
You go to a mannequin thing

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
And you're like, oh, I want a leg

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
And they're like, we got legs

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
They're just attached to mannequins

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Yeah, yeah

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
And I'm like, you don't have legs?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
I know I've seen legs

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
And they're like, we got legs

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
But they're just for sandals and shoes

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Like, they don't have articulation

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And then

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It was just a weird, weird situation

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
They took me up to the mannequin graveyard

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Which is where

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Prop buyers

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
For horror movies come

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
And pick up, like, shitty, ratty, creepy-looking mannequins

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Because that's a good half of the business

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Apparently of mannequins

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Is simply props for horror movies

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Specifically, not horror movies

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Like, that probably represents

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
75% of all mannequin uses

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
But, yeah, I mean, horror

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Horror films use all sorts of these mannequins

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
There's all these guys

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
They are fabricating mannequins

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
And I was like, this seems easy

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
You can just make me one, right?

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
And they're like, well, not so fast, Junior

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
And I had to go to, like, a back office

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
And meet someone's dog

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And, like, sit in front of a rada

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
That's to go through the mannequin's guild first

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Let's get this straight

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Meanwhile, across the street

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
A guy has a shopping cart full of AK-47s

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It's just going down an aisle

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Oh, I need grenades, grenades!

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
I think that's the cover of The New Yorker

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Just described

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Oh, by the way, Rhea, I

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
When I masturbate, I rub a mannequin leg

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
With hosary on it on my nipple

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Got it

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Makes total sense

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
And I had one

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
That was a 1983 Carol Barnhart display model

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Apparently, I don't know

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Which is vintage

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Did somebody yell something out?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Or...

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
My mom's ghost

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Oh, fuck, my mom died

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I should call my dad

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I think I just murdered my mom with my mind

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Oh, god, dad's now there...

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I guess the house burnt down

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Oh, muffin

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Oh, lucky

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
The pets are going

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Oh, my brother was visiting

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
My brother was visiting

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Oh, it was a vintage thing

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
And it was a nice foot

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Great foot

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Rub it on my nipple

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Not to offend Michael, but these are a dime a dozen

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I thought you would laugh at that

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I didn't think you

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Take it really seriously

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
No, it's very thoughtful

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I'm going to try it

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Nothing's going to stop you now

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I mean, when I saw it

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I was like, it's probably not as cool

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
As the vintage one

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
But I mean, it didn't look terrible

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
If you have an opportunity

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
To buy a mannequin part

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Just go for it

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
What's the worst that could happen?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
You're going to need it eventually

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
It is more of a third lizard wife

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Type of a

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
mannequin leg

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
But that could be the most joyful one

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Absolutely

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You already tried to fix people

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Now you're just sailing through

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Let's be honest with each other

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Let's just do this thing

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
I love that

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Have you ever seen Legs lavish?

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Legs lavish the YouTube site?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
The YouTube channel?

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
That was my spot

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I was referencing

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
You're weird

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I'm wearing overalls though

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But I'm trying to be MC John

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Oh, I didn't realize that

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
That's nice

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
San Diego

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
That's fantastic

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Also, you brought beer

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I brought some homebrew

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
He brought homebrew beer

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Somebody grabbed it because it was chilling in the fridge

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
In the fridge

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Where beer goes

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Are you a beer person?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I am not a beer person, I no longer drink

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Why'd you stop?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Because I got too good at it

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Because I nailed it

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I finished drinking

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
I did it all

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Did you

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Are you comfortable talking about it?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Did you have blackouts

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
You were a troubled drinker

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I realized that when I got

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Really good at vomiting

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
There was a problem

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
That I could hide it

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I was totally comfortable puking

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Oh, this is a problem

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Steve, inhale

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
She just grabbed it

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
And ran out

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Like the Phantom of the Opera

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
And I take the leg with me

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm a little jealous

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
In some respects of people

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Because I'm too much like Denzel in flight

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I could just keep doing it forever

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
And I will eventually die

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Because I won't, so far

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
I'll black out while drinking

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
But I won't wake up in blood

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And I don't typically

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Have

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Super bad stories happen to me

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Which means I can keep doing it

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
But I can tell I'm slowly rotting my brain away

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Because I'm just so able to drink

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
All the time

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
But it's medication for

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Sickness called you people

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
This is

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Super smart juice for you

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
What else is going on

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
What's the deal with this beer?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I was reaching for more vodka

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You had warned me you're still getting the carbonation

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Yeah, I just always have to

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I always throw that out

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I don't suppose you have an opener

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Oh, shit

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I have a lighter

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
He's got one

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
How do you lighter people do the lighter thing?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
It's hard, man

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
It's just a fulcrum thing

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Well, I know the principle, but I just don't

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I've never been able to do it

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
I'll demonstrate it for you

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Let's hope he succeeds

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Can you make sure

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
States couldn't be higher

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Is he on it?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Yeah, the one with the red light

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Oh

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
You want it there as firm as possible

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And then you just

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Oh

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Heads up

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Watch out

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
But I really don't know

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
What you did

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
That downward angle

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Yeah, shove it in hard there

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
That was close

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
I heard something, but I think that's just because

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
You bottled it

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I didn't

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I didn't mean he's bad at bottling

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I just meant like it's probably

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
It's probably harder with a store bought

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Almost

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
One more

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
One more

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
It hurts

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
It hurts

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
That's the thing, man

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Yes, love

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
And up higher

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Yeah, you want

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
If you show me, then you do it

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I'm a big boy

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Show me

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Wait

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Okay

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
You see

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
For the podcast, they're failing to open a bottle

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Okay

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Okay, I mean you, all right

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
You want this part of your thumb

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Close to the cap

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Oh, the thumb's part of it

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That's the fulcrum

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I thought the bottle was the fulcrum

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It's the thumb

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Oh my god

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It was the thumb the whole time

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
That's why it hurts

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm gonna have to

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I loosened it

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
All right, thank you, Michael

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Do you want to talk about this beer? You brewed it yourself

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Sure

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
You said it's Asahi

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Like, Asahi, that

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
ASAHI

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
That company that sells really light beer

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
They have a Japanese beer that they make

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
That's dark, and my buddy went to visit

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
And they brought some back

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
So, for New Year's, this is my New Year's beer

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Is the darker version

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Called

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
So Veli Veli Asahi

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
So Asahi

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Yeah

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
How is it like Asahi?

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
What did you do to make it like Asahi?

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Let's move past it

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
It's a clone

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
How do you clone an Asahi?

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
By taste

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I mean, any beer

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
You can figure out what's in it by taste

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
So it's not a clone

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
You just tried to reinterpret it

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Yeah

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
That's more impressive than just

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Finding a recipe to me

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Yeah

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
If you have the complete recipe, though

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
You could be like, oh, well, this is wrong

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Because of this

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
If you're just making up a recipe

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah, it's more experimental

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Certainly to do it by taste

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Definitely

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Engaging

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Why'd you bump it on the podium?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Time and place

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
That's how I cheers

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Like this moment

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
In this place

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I don't know

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
That's how I learn to cheers

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I'm into it, I like learning

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Well, it's yummy

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Thank you

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I'm getting woozy

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
No

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I guess the joke was that he

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Drugged me

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
You know, a lot of people make that joke, I don't know

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I guess it's just easy to make

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
It's the overalls

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah, it was a

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Farmer John, I decided

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
The Farmer John thing, MC John

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I thought it would be

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It's L.A.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
We just assumed

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Yeah

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I had to call probably

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
11 places to find

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Overalls, though

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
This is a good celebration

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Of my 43rd birthday, which was January 3rd

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
We didn't have a show

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Thank you very much, Michael

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Thank you for the leg

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I will think about you

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
While I'm using it

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Well, I mean

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It's Los Angeles

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
What's the new legs name?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I never named the legs, but if you

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Sophie

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Great choice

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Yeah

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Yeah

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
You got some Algonquin round table

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
With tea

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I'll pop in every now and then

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Rhea played

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
With us on Harmon Quest

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Coming soon to see so

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
In spring 2016

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
And you had a real

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Burner in there

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Like a banana

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Like that was fast

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Like your word play

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Thank you

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Yes

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
By the way

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
I invited Cameron to do this first

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
And then she donated her wife

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
But it was only because you were in the Harmon Quest show

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Totally

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
You're my favorite

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Yes

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I know that

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
And I'm going to go home and tell her that

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
No

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Alright

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
For our next segment

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Did Ridley ever show up?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Nah, he's beat

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
He's a piece of shit

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
He fucking stranded me

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
What I got a text message

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Just in Royland

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Is he here?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Nah, he's not gonna hope so

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I invited him and he's watching Making a Murderer

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
What's he saying?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
What's he saying about Stephen Avery?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Jesus Christ

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Do people not know that cops are bad sometimes?

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Like, why is that still shocking?

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Yeah, but that shit's crazy

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Well, again

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I keep saying this lately

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
But Philadelphia police bombed a neighborhood

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
To kill a bunch of black people

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Like, not, yeah, not funny

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
It's something that happened

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
It's horrifying

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But that was the 70s

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Those black people were scary

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
We didn't know what they were gonna do

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
They were making disco

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Parliament

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
There was a guy with a diaper

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It was a funk music

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
You're a guy with a fiber

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
They were unpredictable

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And I'm not saying we should have bombed them

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I didn't know that

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Are you sure? He said firebomb

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
They firebombed because they thought there were some black panthers

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
In that neighborhood

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Which, I mean, why would that make it okay?

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
The reason that conversation came up

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Of course, is because of these dudes

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Oh, yeah, we gotta talk about

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
About that list

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The ones you guys are calling Yolkata on

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
On Twitter

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
They updated their list of

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
You probably

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
I tweeted it

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Or Spencer tweeted it and I retweeted it

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
I told Spencer about it

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
While I was still talking about it

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
And I really got in there

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Under the buzzer

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Do you have the

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
The last thing I saw was

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
They wanted the American girl

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Doll Molly to come back

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Wait, is that a

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
That's a joke

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Because the list

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
That's my wish

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
That I'm just putting it in as one of theirs

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
A specific model of radio from

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Walmart, like they really want the Walmart one

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Which is like adorable kind of

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
But then you're mad

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
But it also has

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
A miracle whip and mayonnaise

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Right above each other

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I'm from Ohio and so

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I can completely understand that

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Because sometimes you want the tangy zip

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Of miracle whip

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
And sometimes you simply want mayonnaise

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
On your sandwich, I understand

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
What are those times when you don't let the tangy whip

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
All the other times

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Do people in Ohio just get scared

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That they're going to taste

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
For too much good things

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
And they're mayonnaise

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
I don't want all that spice in there

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Whenever I make food for my family

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
They're like, I don't know, there's a lot of spice in there

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
I'm like, it's pepper

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
It says miracle right on the jar

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I don't think we should be cracking this open that often

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
This is Ohio

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Take it easy

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I assumed it was like

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
They couldn't quell a civil war

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
On that topic

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Guys, guys, guys, bigger fish

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
How are we going to take out the government

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
We can't settle this dispute

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I got that list if you want it

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Give us some highlights

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Well, I think my favorite is definitely

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Just the word

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Aprilans, four inches

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Yeah, four inch aprans

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
They have Kepler elves

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
At their place

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Making mayonnaise cookies

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I just, I mean, I guess

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
They must have multiple people writing the list

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Because they have, like, hot dogs

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
And then they have brats

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
And then they have markers

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
And then later on they have paper

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And chisel tipped markers

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
It's just, it's weird

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
It sounds like they're going to have a science fair

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Potatoes, wires

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
This is my school

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Small light bulb, diesel batteries

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Queen size bed sheets

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Twin size bed sheets, pillowcases

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I don't know what they're trying

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Yeah, why queen size, that seems too specific

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Yeah, that's very...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
How many beds are in that outpost, right?

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Well, they also want tampons

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And, like, a lot of 100s cigarettes

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Well, tampons makes a lot of sense

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Well, I didn't know they were allowed to have girlfriends

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Are they supposed to be holed up

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And, like, taking over the government

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Or defending themselves from it

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Well, they're not gay or anything

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
They just had...

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
They could just have...

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
They could just, girlfriends just came

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And they're like, we miss you

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And they're like, get in here

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
And now they're just like, Amy needs tampons

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
And some basic 100s

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Stat

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
And the list is so disorganized

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Because I guess they were, like, putting it together

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And somebody was like, well, can we at least alphabetize this

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
And they're like, hey, what the fuck do you think

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
We're trying to get away from around here

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Well, maybe we should make a president

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
To the list, and he should

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Collect a list tax

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Okay, Steve

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Point taken

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
We'll get Miracle Whip and mayonnaise

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Oven cleaner is on this list

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Oven cleaner?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Why does that a priority to anyone ever?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Like, they're roughing it, right?

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
My favorite one is throw rugs

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
For doorways

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Yeah, throw out rugs

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Not any in all size

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
For doorways

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Because doorways

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Not any in all size

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
How many doorways are in this thing?

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Jeez, ice scrappers? What does that mean?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Ice scrapers

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Why can't you spell

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I guess it's just a shopping list

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
They probably didn't prove for you to

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
It's weird because they just have

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
They have a lot of half form thoughts

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Like sugar and flour, but they're not doing anything

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
How can you think scrapers

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
To peas

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
How does that person think

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
You spell scrapper with three peas?

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Well, scrapper's just a thing

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
It's not a word you spell

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Right

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
It's not a word used by people that spell a lot

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Write it down

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It's not something scrappers do

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Scrappers just exist

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
They ain't no word or nothing

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Who here isn't through

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Making of a murderer yet?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Sorry

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
All our little...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Thanks for holding up the show, everybody

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Can't talk about it

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
A little spoiler allergist

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Well, it's fucked up

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
That's all I can tell you

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
It's fucking crazy

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
But in Death of the Salesman

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
He dies

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
That I can tell you

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
How does he die?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Too many sales

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
He oversells

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
He oversells

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
He sells everything and then there's nothing left

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And he looks at himself

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
And then the lights go down

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
And you hear a gunshot

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And a cash register

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
And then

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And then you hear God saying

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Just what I wanted

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
But if you stay until after the credits

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
God returns it

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
And then he's just like

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
It's like fire in the sky

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
And then someone comes by

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
And says are you okay?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
And he goes yeah

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
And they go here have some soup

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
And he's like what is soup?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And they're like it's soup from a story

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
And they get products

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Who gives them to them? Salesman

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I like this job salesman

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I will be a salesman

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And then

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
More credits

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
But then if you stay long enough

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
He's getting out of salesman school

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
And they're like good job

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
You're gonna be a salesman now

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And he's like I hope I'm a good one

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
I'm gonna live forever

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And then he goes home

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Offscreen voice they oh you think

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
You're gonna live forever huh

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
And he turns and Sam Jackson's in his kitchen

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
And

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Salesman gonna live forever

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
This shit just got started mother fucker

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
And then he hands him a list and he's like

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Ice scrapper

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
That's right mother fucker

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Who can't do Sam Jackson

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I love that continental

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Samuel Jackson

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
That's right mother fucker

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
That was like Kate Blanchett

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Samuel Jackson

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
That is white mother fucker

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
It's on my white guilt cockpit

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
The altimeter for like racist

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I don't want to make him sound

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Like if I can't do an impression of him

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
And nail it then I'm just racist

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I just sound like a crazy racist

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Like a black accent

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And I'm not gonna do that

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I'm trying to do Sam Jackson

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
But I'm not gonna risk it

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
So I'm just giving him this tremolo

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Like opera singer voice

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That's right mother fucker

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
It's beautiful

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And then everyone's driving home

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
And they're like boy that Dan

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
She sure isn't racist

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Why do you say that honey

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Well didn't you notice that

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
He can't even do Sam Jackson very well

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
The man sounds like

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
If you did a good impression of him

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
You'd sound racist

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Yeah I guess you're right

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
He just made him sound like Kate Blanchett

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Do you want to stop in Arby's

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Yeah

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I guess

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Is today our cheat day or are we taking it tomorrow

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Well

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
The last week we did Friday

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
I figured we could do Thursday tonight

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
It's tonight Thursday we just saw Harmontown

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Uh

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Every night is Thursday

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Oh my god there's a head in the sky

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Pull over

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Throw a crowbar at it

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
It's a miracle whip

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I am miracle whip

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I will make your species

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Tangy

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Forever

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
No more mayonnaise

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I don't know why I'm looking at my phone

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I'm really kind of scared

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I went through a list of things to talk about

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I think

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I don't think I have any lesbian questions left

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
What was the wedding like

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
How's the process, is this an offensive

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
How's the process of planning a wedding

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Sure, well we got fitted for our Birkenstocks together

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
In October, no we just had it

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
We had it at a venue that we performed at

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
So that was super fun

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
It's like a little house type venue in Chicago

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
It's called the hideout

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
And we got married there

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Are you guys both from Chicago?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Cameron's from Chicago, I'm from Akron, Ohio

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Yeah, we already knew you were from Ohio

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I don't retain anything

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
It's fine

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
I just stand up here and sweat and try to get away with things

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Here's my final lesbian question

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Do you ever wish that I saw you as something

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Other than a lesbian?

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
No

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I'm a lesbian first and everything

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I am nothing if not a lesbian

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
You showed me in the back

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
You have a t-shirt, you got it in a gas station

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It says zero to lesbian in 60 seconds

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Love that T

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
It's not a bald spot, it's a solar panel

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
For a lesbian machine

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I liked that one

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Lesboholic

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
If you're reading this

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
The woman that I really love and respect

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Has fallen off of my motorcycle

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Please help her now

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
That's funny

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
They're great

57:49.000 --> 57:55.000
Alright

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Hello

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
How are you?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
What?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
CISO is live right now

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
You should watch it

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
And Harmon Quest comes to it in the spring

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Thank you

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
Thank you Plugfinger

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Plugfinger?

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
I don't know

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I'm awful sorry about that

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I'm always the last person to know

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
When there's regional chicanery

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I believe that's just because of the old studios

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Universals at the top of this

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And Sony was at the top of the Yahoo thing

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
A lot of people got mad at Yahoo

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
That's Sony stuff

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
You couldn't watch

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
They didn't play everywhere

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Because they have these really old school deals

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Carved out for different parts of the planet

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Going back

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
To the history of these studios

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
I don't know why they don't want to change that

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I was so excited

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
When Yahoo thing was happening

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Because I was like we're going to be able to count clicks

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
And just get an honest number

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Of people like the show

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
And I was like oh no it's like

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
It's very frustrating

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
And I didn't know CISO was the same way

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Or if it is or whatever

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
But I got nothing to do with it

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Just moved to America

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Like all these immigrants are doing

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Gotta build a wall

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Around the thing

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Donald Trump stuff

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Looks like Bernie Sanders

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
And Hillary are tied

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Whatever the thing is there that people care about

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
The elections?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
The polls?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
The polls in Iowa

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Or something like that

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Whatever the latest data is

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
She's feeling the burn

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
She should be

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I have only boring thoughts about politics

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Like the fact that if there's a neck and neck

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Thing going on in the Democratic Party

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Because he's running as a Democrat

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So is she

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And then Trump

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
He's running as a Republican

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
The Republicans have made him

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Do sign promises

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And do pinky swears that he's going to

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Abide by all Republican doctrine

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
It's really ridiculous

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I don't know

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Have they done that before?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Because it's been kind of funny

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The kinds of things that they're trying to control Donald Trump with

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I guess it's not that funny

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Well if it is

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You'd have to get specific

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I'm not blaming them at all

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Don't get me wrong

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It's not real clear here

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You can't just allude to a pie fight that happened

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Well apparently you can

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I can

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I'm a storyteller

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Not blaming them

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I haven't been following

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Because I'm getting scared

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
The basic fact that if he's running as a Republican

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And there's nobody even close to him

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And they're all terrified of him now

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And now we have these two people

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But Sanders has said

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
That he won't split the ticket

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
He'll back out

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Yeah and Obama's not been endorsing either candidate

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I don't think the people who like Bernie Sanders are like

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Oh it's Bernie Sanders

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Or Donald Trump for me

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
When one of them loses

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
They'll switch over

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It'll just

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It'll be great

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
What no but the idea is

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It's Bernie Sanders or

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Yeah I mean like

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
That's what they don't both run

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Bernie and Hillary you know that's the thing

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Oh you mean in the general election

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah when the rubber meets the road

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
If they were to somehow split the ticket

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Like if you were to go off like

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Run like a nader

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Yeah I don't think that people run as naters these days

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Seriously do that

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Bernie Sanders is Ralph Nader

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That's what

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Well he's in the Democratic

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Ticket like contest right now

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Like if we get past that point and then he's still going

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Now I'm going to run as an independent or something

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I don't think that's going to happen but if it did

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That'd be a possible thing

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
But I don't think that's likely either way

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
But I mean everyone's talking about that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
You know him presenting a strong challenge to Hillary

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Is only going to make her seem more

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
You know a better candidate

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Because she's actually fighting against a real competition

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
See boring political thought

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But it's getting kind of important

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Like we're getting down to the deadline

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And this guy is this hitler man

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Is still running

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It's really scary

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Well no the real fear is that fucking Ted Cruz

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Is the one that's hiding behind his shoulder

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Is everyone's going to be like oh great

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
We got rid of Donald Trump

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Now we have Ted fucking Cruz

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Are you kidding me

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
To go with this

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
This is a reference no one gets

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But like trans metropolitan

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I was wrong

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We're in the back of a comic book store after all

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
But like Ted Cruz is the fucking

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Smiler

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
He was a political candidate

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Who was like invented by an institution

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
He doesn't have a past

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And he doesn't believe in anything

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
He's even said as much

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And in the debates

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
He gets a lot of steam and attention for saying

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I'm going to dismantle journalism

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
He gets fucking applause

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
For talking about who he's going to destroy

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The freedom of the press

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Like it's fucking insane

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Donald Trump is like I'm going to fuck my daughter

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
But it's not like

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I'm going to fuck my daughter

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And no one can talk about it ever

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Like he's just a raging asshole

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But raging asshole

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
It's not really his platform to be fair

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
It's just his wish list

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You can't pretend like you can't be both

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Following and not following politics

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
One of his central planks is fucking his daughter

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
If elected

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
You're going to be a chicken in every pot

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And I will fuck my daughter in every home

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
He's going to take his daughter

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Into every home

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And fuck her

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Sorry everybody I got off track

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But I mean I don't know

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Donald Trump is like a crazy asshole

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
But I feel like a crazy asshole believes

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
That he's like doing good stuff

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
And might actually deep down

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Have real principles at heart

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But I don't think Ted Cruz has displayed anything

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Other than

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
A baseless desire for

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Power

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And utter lack of principles

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Boring political thoughts

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I'm really terribly unfamiliar

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
With the guy entirely

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
If he was standing in front of me I wouldn't be able to

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I've never even seen a picture of him

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
If you saw him you wouldn't want him to be

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Anywhere near you or people you cared about

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
He looks like

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
He does bad stuff to kids

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Does he really?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
So he has a comb over

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And a patchy beard?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Yeah again I've talked about this before

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I also made passing reference to the fact that I

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
As someone who looks like a child in a luster

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
No

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
When someone looks like a child in a luster

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
It's a real, it's like my version of

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Gaydar

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It's just like

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Only it's just based on looks

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Isn't this not how Gaydar works?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
If all gay people looked like

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Rip Taylor

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
That everyone would have Gaydar

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
You might be right about that

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
What do you think gay community

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Do you have political

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Political thoughts

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Do you care about politics?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
No I care about politics

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But I just

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I want

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Hillary to run

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
But I feel like it's crazy that I'm like a woman

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
In 2016 and I'm like scared to say that

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Because so many people are like

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
BOOM

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
We did a show in San Francisco and we're like

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Just off the cuff said Hillary

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Like not even talking about her and all

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
The whole room was like

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It's just like amazing to me

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
That there's a female candidate and people are like

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
No no we have a socialist old white guy

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
So we're going with him now

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
She's going to have to wait 20 more years

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I mean

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Is it just

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
That she's a woman I mean

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
No I think she's capable

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I know that she has made bad choices

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Here's the thing like

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
She wasn't always on board with gay rights

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
In the government but also like

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Hey my family wasn't always on board

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
With gay rights until I

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Talked to them a bit and they were like

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Oh okay now I get it

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
You yourself probably maybe

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Oh yeah I was like I'm not gay

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
For like

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
20 years

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Happens to the best of us Hillary

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I understand

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Well but keep going

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Cause I don't really know anything

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Sell me on her and I'm not unsold on her

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But now's your chance

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You gotta pulp it

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
It's 9-11 it's a perfect time to do it

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Oh yeah

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Well

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
As we all know Hillary was

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Here are some other things you should never forget

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Hillary was

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The mastermind behind 9-11

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And brought no I don't know

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I just

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
No I'm kidding it's a joke thing

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
She voted to change the melting point

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Of steel

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Yes she did

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
She keeps trying to lower it

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Yeah

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I'm just

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm totally curious like I'm not

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Sure I mean my position is just that

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
It's America and it's

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
2016 and it's time to have a female

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
President and I think she's more than

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Qualified to do the job and like

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
She could be better but

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Every candidate could always be better

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
So that's how I feel about that

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Outside my depth I don't have enough

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
If anyone calls me

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Up to the carpet

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
To explain any of it I won't have anything

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
To back it up but

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Maybe I'm reflective of all of America

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
In that regard

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Because none of us have time to

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Research any of this shit but it just seems

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Like she's a little

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
She's very

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Effective and a little

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
She's

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Like she's on the right side of

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Like left

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Ness like she's very

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
She's a little

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Kind of conservativey

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That's what

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
You don't care

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I'm tired

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I just want it

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Do you think that'll change the national

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Psyche on a fundamental level? Obviously

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I do actually

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Donald Trump will change the fucking national

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Psyche

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Obviously electing Barack Obama didn't

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Fix everything but I do think

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That on a long enough timeline

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Like something that Chris Rock

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Actually said in a Rolling Stone

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Interview like affected me a lot

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
In that he was talking about his kids and he was like

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
My kids are growing up

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Knowing from the time

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
That they were children that a black

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Man has been the president of this country

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And they will not think the other way

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Like they don't think the way

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That we think in this room because

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
We weren't kids and so that is just

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
In their brains and that's how they're going through the world

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So I think that as

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Children for boys and girls

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And everyone on the gender

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Spectrum to see a woman

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
In the White House would be an effective

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Change for this country

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
To see women as equals that can do the same jobs

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
As men

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
It would put a woman

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Like Obama's getting such a bad fuck it

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Like this is such a

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Such a shitty time to become president

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Absolutely, I mean he had a congress

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That was like no on everything no matter

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
What he did

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
It took us 20 years

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
To realize that Jimmy Carter wasn't

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
A pariah because it was just put in our

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Heads he was a bad president

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
He just spent his

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Term handcuffed and like

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
He couldn't do anything and like

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Me the most important thing though

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Is personality because I'm too jaded

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I just feel like we're electing

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
A person that's going to speak for the country

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Like at fucking holiday

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Parties

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Like they're going and meeting

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Like oil sheiks and like

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Walking around and being in newspapers

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And saying stuff like I don't

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Really believe in the system

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Enough to think that the president has more of a job

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Than that but that's the thing is like

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
When you look at that job description

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Look what JFK did look

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
What Roosevelt did

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
The other one the

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
The guy with the pith helmet

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
The guy in the wheelchair

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Like there's a you know you can create

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
A whole national psyche

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So if she was

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Like elected and then

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
She was like walking around and she was kind of

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Bad ass just in terms of swagger

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I do think that would be

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
That would be good beneficial for everybody

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Whether they realize they're benefiting from it

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Or not I just I'm not

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I don't know if I trust her to

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Have that swagger like

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Obama talks like a fucking game show host

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
He's amazing like listening

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
To his fucking soothing voice and his

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Lack of

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Like after eight years

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Of that fucking potato

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yeah

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I want to not care about politics

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Every time that guy opened his fucking

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Mouth he was like

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
To the fucking retarded people

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I thought

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
My sister's retarded

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
You need to deal with it

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
She gave me a pass

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
She looked into my eyes

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And she said no I'm not going to do it

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
He's going to Gervais

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
He's going to Gervais

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
The anyways

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Like her personality

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
If we started this conversation

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And I said I don't like her personality

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
You might walk away going

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Her personality is that she has a vagina

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That's what you don't like

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
We're ending the conversation that way

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Because you

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Yeah

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I would love a woman president

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I don't

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
She's

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Her speeches

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Her fucking

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
She's

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Got a uterus

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
No I'm just kidding

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's not true I swear to God

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I mean if she was just more bubbly

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And had some pom poms

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
I mean

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I like all kinds of women

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Miss Mame

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Miss October

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
There's a woman

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Every month that I really approve of

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I just

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I want her to be Margaret Thatcher

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Even though you ask British

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
People are you fucking insane

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
But I just mean

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
In terms of

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Have a woman

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
We eventually put on a coin

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
When we call old iron fucking

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Butt

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
To get away

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
From those

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Diacotomies and stuff

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
We had a fucking badass

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Ruler

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
That issued us into a world

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Of exploring space

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And reducing our prison population

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And things turned around

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And it would be great

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
To have a

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Just as with a ship

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
To have a woman at the front of that

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Going like this

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
With a lesbian t-shirt on

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Like I'm up here

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Not shells

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Hillary's coin

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I'm up here

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
But

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Anyways

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But yeah

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I fully admit

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I have no fucking nothing

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Because I'm just kind of disgusted by the whole thing

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Every time I start getting into politics

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I always

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Within the first five minutes

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I'm like this is so gross

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I'm an anarchist

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I want that guy

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
That landed the helicopter

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
On the congress lawn

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
With a male man

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
With all the letters

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I want him to be president

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I want that guy

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Vote for me

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And I will make campaign reform

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I'll call for campaign reform

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And then quit

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And then whoever's my vice president can take over

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And you can impeach him if you want

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
But there will be a mandate

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Including conservatives

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
It's a bipartisan issue

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Everyone wants campaign reform

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Even

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
I will honestly say it's more important than

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Global warming campaign reform

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Because it encompasses everything

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Because we're still so far

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
The biggest country in the world

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Making the biggest effects

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
On the world

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We have the biggest chance of getting China to stop

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Pumping fucking smoke into the sky

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
We can't get our shit together

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Unless we stop intermingling

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Capitalism with politics

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Has no place in it

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's insane

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
The idea that in order to run for president

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
You have to have billions of dollars

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
We're so fucked because of that

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And all we have to do is pass

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
One law

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So shut up you jaded fucking redditor

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I'm jaded here

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
It used to be illegal

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
To spend money on a campaign

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I think

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Back in George Washington's day

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
He didn't spend money

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Making the case that you should be president

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
To the point it's gotten today

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's just astonishing to think about that

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Citizens united

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Jesus Christ

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I mean that shit is so fucked up

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Yo

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It's gotten so much more fucked up

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Also what happened to all these antitrust laws

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
They made us learn about in high school

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Who just merged now

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And fucking like

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Mobile exon

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And fucking time magazine merged

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Or something

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
What those companies merged

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
What the fuck in the goddamn monopoly

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
What the fuck

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
The idea

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
When the phone company got too big

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And people panicked and had to break them up

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Now we have businesses that are too big to fail

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
So we gotta keep them

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
We gotta keep them around

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
We gotta keep them not failing

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It's the exact opposite of busting a trust

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
That's when I get boring

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Everyone said it before

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
That's the big short

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
It takes that dark turn

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
They knew the whole time

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
We were asking ourselves if they were stupid

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Or if they were stupid

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
But they were evil and they were just confident

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
In the government they would bail them out

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And make poor people pay for everything

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I'm gonna eat a dick

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So mad I'm gonna eat a dick

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Yeah

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Old iron butt

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
I'm gonna put

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I'm gonna put

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Can you imagine a welder at work

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And it's like hey did you hear

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
What the chancellor of Germany

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Said

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
At the UN

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And then

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Hillary said what she said back

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And she told him

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Our president's awesome

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And then he goes back to welding

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
And he's like I love women

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
That's what I'm saying

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
He wouldn't go home and hit his wife

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And he'd be like I'm so hard welding today

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And my dad hit me so

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And then he'd see his wife's face

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And he'd be like you look like the president

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Just

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Just make me a sandwich

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You guys

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Reactions

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Miracle whip this time

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's a special night

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
You guys really disapprove of that

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Welder

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Just do what Canada's doing man

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We gotta figure it out

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
You just stayed north of a successful country

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And fucking

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I fucking trumped you

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
You got like five parties

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Now fight over everything

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
But we figure shit out at a base level

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Alright get up here Canada

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
If you want

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I got some shit to say

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Alright

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Well yeah

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Let's talk about

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
How does the voting work

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Well

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
What's your name sorry

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
My name's Adam

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Apologies to people don't like anyone named Adam

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
But that's what's happening

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I was just gonna make a joke about how the voting

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Starts once everyone's

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Apologize to each other

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
But then you apologize for your name

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And it's the first name ever

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's like the least offensive name

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Anyone can ever have

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It's the one god named Adam

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I'm the first person

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Sorry

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
No in Canada

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Shit is totally different because we don't vote for a president

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Man we vote for like

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Our individual

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Representatives like if there was a senator

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
The senator

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Would go off to Washington

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
And then all the senators

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
All the individual parties would get together and talk to everybody

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And be like here's what our party believes

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And there would be all the different parties

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
And like the fucked up thing is imagine there was like a Texas party

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Because we have the Quebec party

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
And they all they get tons and tons of votes

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Imagine there's like a Texas party

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And they control like a third of it

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
And then there's like the conservative party

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Which is like way more left-wing

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Than your guys is like left-wing party

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
We hate them and then

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
We have our like left-wing party

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And then the middle party which is like

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Eh let's shit happen

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And everyone gets elected

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
They get a certain number of seats and then they divide it up

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And whoever has the most gets to run the place

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And nobody leaves a tip

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
No no 15%

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Really? Yeah 15% man it's pretty standard

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Or if you don't you say sorry

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Wait you tipping

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I thought you didn't tip

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I thought tipping wasn't customary in Canada

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And that's why like waiters and bartenders

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Like they complain about Canadians

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Have you not been tipping in Canada?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Jack I tip everywhere

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Tossing toonies all over the place

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Yeah man

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Is it toonies or loonies

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
We're getting a $5 coin

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And then shit's gonna get real confusing

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
No I really thought that I don't know

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And I also wouldn't be surprised if you said

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
In this fucking

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
What do you call them?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Procedurals? What are your territories?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I don't know yeah

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Because I thought

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Where did I get that from

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
The tipping thing is that changed

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Or has it been over 15%

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I think it's Europe

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
When I went to Europe I was trying to give people money

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And they were like oh we don't do that here

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And it was really confusing

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Some people are genuinely offended

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
They feel like you're saying you can own them

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Or something

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
It's included like their bosses

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Don't take tips

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
We're gonna pay you more

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And there's a big argument

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Adam explains different Adam

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
And he has a thing

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Or Adam shits on this thing

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Adam ruins everything

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Sorry that was rough

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Apologize

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I'm very sorry to everyone

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
He had a thing about tipping that was very accurate

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Well will you do it for us?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Will you say

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Say the word about

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
About

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Wow

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Are you faking?

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Nah I listen to too much American television

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Do you want me to say it properly?

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
House?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
House

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Do they say who's?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Okay let me tell you what that's about

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
See there's about

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
On the east coast

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
That's where everyone sounds more Irish

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And that's where everyone's all talking about

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
The trawler and the fish

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
See how you going there boy

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Going to Newfoundland

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
They sound like the stereotypical Canadians

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But that's not me

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Which is obviously a cousin

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Of my homeland Wisconsin

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Everybody talks

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Like the Fargo people

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
People don't talk like that

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
That's a little over the top

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Because now you're watching

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Making of a murderer in Manitowoc

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And it's like

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
At that particular time

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
You gotta get him out

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Notice that the murder weapon

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Was in place there

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Is that a RAV4?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
That's a 99

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Toyota

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
99

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
You looking at the plates there?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
No

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I'm not looking at the vehicle

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
That was insane

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Fuck you guys

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
We're conscious of your spoilers

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
But also it's a real thing

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
In the world

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
That happened

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
It's been in the news

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
You can't really spoil a thing

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I'm interested now

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
You get to watch the whole thing

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And then you get to do

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
The whole second wave

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Because everyone starts talking about how

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
That's not accurate

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And then you get to read all the extra shit

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
It's fun

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
It's fun when people go to prison

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Like the Memphis

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
This is like a genre

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Of entertainment for us

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Is miscarriage of justice stories

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
That we never paid attention to

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
In real life

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Second screen experience

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And then there was like

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
The CNN on TV

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And the airport

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
That was like

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Netflix is so popular

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Of course people are petitioning

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And saying like

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I'm trying to not do any spoilers

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And it's like

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Nothing's gonna change

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
No one cares

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
That you watched the Netflix show

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Like they were aware

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Of the stakes at the time

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That this shit was happening

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It is

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And not that I disapprove of that

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I think it's great that when you're watching

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Something like that

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Yeah, whatever, what am I talking about?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Stick your head up your ass

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I'm talking about the

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Sorry for interrupting

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
No, no, no, I wanted to get back to that character

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
At that point in time

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
We had noticed that

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
The blood was

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Coming out of a decapitated head

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And so

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
We decided

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
At that particular time

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
To go and investigate

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Behind the barn

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And what did you see

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Behind the barn

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Corporal Langerhanger

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
We saw

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
The rest of the body

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And there was blood all over the place

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Yeah, it's like a relative

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
None of that is real from the thing

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
There's no decapitated

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
There's no blood

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
It's like

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
It's like a Norwegian thing

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Right?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
How does that actually work?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I think it's like a British Isles

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Actually thing that diluted

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It got really

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It's a poor people accent, actually

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
No, really

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
If you guys want to talk about what divides people

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Everyone's like, oh, race this, race that

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Or regions this, no, it's just rich and poor people

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Back in the day it was all Irish people

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Oh, Canada

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Oh, Canada

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
For us it was the Ukrainians

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Everyone shout on the Ukrainians

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And they were like, oh, you smell like cabbage

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
But the Irish for the longest time

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Were the shitty people

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And that was like the ghetto-wise

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
The language that was floating around

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So that's where a lot of it comes from

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
That doesn't change the fact that

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Accents are, they're genealogical

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Like definitely for sure

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Wisconsin, for sure

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Oh, yeah

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
The most effect on Wisconsin's accent

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
It's like

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It has to do with the earliest

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Settlers to that area

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Coming through the

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
North and coming down

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Oh, you're down the south there

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
But they were coming from

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I believe

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
It's like when you hear it and you compare it to

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Norwegian accents and stuff

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
It has something to do with that, I don't fucking know

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I don't know

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
But I have opinions and I'm like shouting years down

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I don't know

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Because you're like, it's just, when you're poor

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
When you're poor you don't just decide to elongate your o's

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I can't afford

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
To talk cool

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That's from now on

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
That's a boat

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Your dad's too

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Poor to go to the country club

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And then you just all sit around talking about lumber

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And then he's like, I don't fucking

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Let's go fishing then, alright

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I can't afford the letter U

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Yeah, pretty much

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I sold it

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I sold it for a boot

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
We traded it in for rye down at the store, eh?

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Let's see

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Canada questions

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
What does Canada think about lesbians?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
We're very cool with lesbians

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
We're all over gay rights and gay marriage

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Tell her like you mean it

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I'm just kidding, we're into it

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
We're with you

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
I really appreciate your support

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I do have to say one thing though

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Eve was framed

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Yeah

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Lilith

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Lilith was framed actually

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
There you go, this guy knows what's talking

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Sorry for Lilith

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I appreciate it

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Who's Lilith again?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Come on

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
I'm sorry

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Wait, wait

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
That's not in the real bible

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Education time

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Was this in the Torah?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
This is a super old story

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Adam had a first wife before Eve

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
And she came down

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And she was all like, here's the way it's gonna be

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
And Adam's like, whoa now

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
That's a little too aggressive for me

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
That's a little too gay

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Get the fuck out

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Let's make a new one, pull a rib out

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Make an Eve and she's all like, I do whatever you want

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And so that's the story that Christians know

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
But there's like Lilith Fair

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Of course

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Is based off the idea that there was an uppity woman

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Who didn't do what she was told

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Was there or wasn't there?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I mean I'm not asking if the bible was real

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Is there some version of the bible?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
It's apocryphal, there's a lot of apocryphal

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Is it Gnostic?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
It's like Gnosticism

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
There's texts out there

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Midrash

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I love Midrash

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
So there's actual texts

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
That have been filed away

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Making a Midrash

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I'm only halfway through though

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I won't spoil the ending for you

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I won't spoil it for me

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
What was the other thing?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Was it that there was a female disciple

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Or was it just that Mary had more of an active role?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Mary Magdalene was actually

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Disciple

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
She got married to Jesus

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And then there was a baby

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Tom Hanks

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Tom Hanks was there

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I remember that one

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
In Canada we believe all of these things

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
That's the problem actually

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Right now we just actually came through

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
A big push to get back to

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Our more lefty side

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
We had an asshole that was kind of Ted Cruzy

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
In Canada by the way

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
And we just had a big election

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Where we elected a reality TV star

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Who's very funny

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Oh we should try that

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Yeah do it man

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Who's a charismatic

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Reality TV star

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Who's kind of like lefty

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Anthony Bardane

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
The guy from Shark Tank

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
What's that guy?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Robert

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
No the liberal one

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I'm a religious

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Robert

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Robert Dvorirak

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
What?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Well here's the thing

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
His dad was actually

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
A really super famous

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Prime Minister before this

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
He called on all sorts of shit

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
But then after that his son came out

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And did a bunch of blah blah blah

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I'm a rich kid I don't care

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
He had a really famous video of him being famous

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
For falling down the stairs

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.320
Mr. Justin Trudeau, yes?

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.520
Justin Trudeau, he came in.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.840
He created a Junesberry.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.840
Yep.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.400
Yeah.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.640
All right, well, so yeah, I think, like, yeah,

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.880
obviously, I was kidding when I got

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.200
jingoistic about Canada because I'm not feeling particularly

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.280
patriotic over the last eight years or so.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.520
But not because it's just eight years.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.800
It's not far back as I can remember.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.400
I think, but I think it is, like,

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.880
since his election, which was a kind of exciting thing that

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.840
made you feel like politics could be part of a story again,

01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:16.200
that whole national psyche thing, and then it just, like,

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.960
turning back into the Jimmy Carter thing,

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.800
or it's just like, oh, so we're just going to watch people.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.960
They love fucking lying, and they think it's all a game,

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.240
and their job is to win, and it fucking everybody just, like,

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:28.400
blames everybody else.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.560
Well, your guys' media is fucked up.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.840
Yeah, it's definitely bad.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.360
I'm not blaming you, sorry, I'm just saying.

01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.280
It's like, well, here's the thing.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.800
All right, here's all society's problem.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.240
We don't have a fucking, when you get those freemium games.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.960
Don't blame Candy Crush for your politics, man.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.040
They know, because inevitably, in those freemium games,

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.920
there's always, like, two forms of currency.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920
You know, the way they get you is they go, like,

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:05.480
splooges to buy more seeds, and the splooges, you can,

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.760
like, there's always a secondary currency, though.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.360
There's always, like, mana points or something like that,

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:14.080
and it's like, it's because if there was just splooges,

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:16.360
and that's all that mattered, there's inevitably going

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.120
to be a way to cheat the system.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.360
Like, the system's not going to keep working unless there's

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.040
some kind of, like, secondary value system,

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.280
and obviously, what it needs to be is, like,

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.400
a fucking, like, actual cultural one.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:31.960
Like, we actually need to understand, and in some way,

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.160
we need to understand that there's, like,

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:38.640
the money is, like, poker chips that make the casino run,

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.800
but that there's something larger, like, the electricity,

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.680
which is, like, human life.

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:46.040
Like, it's like, like, where it's like,

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.560
if you could just make electricity,

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.000
that's more valuable to Las Vegas than any of your money,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:50.840
or it's either because they're like,

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.320
oh, we can make the cowboy on the sign,

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.800
like, have more lassos now.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.000
Like, so you can stay, and you're valuable at this casino too.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.560
It's like, we don't have, like, it's like,

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.240
and you can't use the word religion,

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.320
because it turns people off,

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.720
because religion has been co-opted

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.040
by a bunch of fucking capitalists.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.680
And, like, but it's like, that is the problem

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.920
that America infected the whole planet with,

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.200
is just like this, because we're so good at, like,

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.120
we were just like, oh, fuck it, no class systems,

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.160
no kings, no family history, fuck it,

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.360
like, it's just like, money, money, money, money,

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.000
it'll be the biggest, it'll be the hotel lobby of the world,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.680
and everybody can come in, and it's just like,

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.120
if you're Irish, you're a piece of shit,

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.240
until you know how to make something like soap

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.240
that we can use, or Lucky Charms, and then we'll use it.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.280
And then if you're valuable, then you can be rich,

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.800
and you can be mayor, and you can be president,

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.280
and fuck it, and it doesn't, nothing matters,

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.400
and it's like the American dream,

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:44.160
that that's our, whether that ever actually existed,

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.840
that was the dream, that was the idea,

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.360
it was egalitarianism through capitalism, meritocracy.

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.520
Yeah, but then someone monetized egalitarianism.

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.600
Then someone monetized monetization.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.000
Someone said, I'll watch the money, that'll be my job,

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.960
and I'll pay myself out of the money,

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:00.920
and then I'll give you interest,

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.320
and someone said, hey, what if a tornado comes through?

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.280
Oh, I'll sell you insurance.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.120
What's insurance?

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.680
Something you're now required to have,

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:09.320
if you get pulled over, a guy with a gun

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.440
can ask to see your insurance,

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.400
because if you hit someone, it might cost him money.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.600
Well, that doesn't seem very fair.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.600
Well, why don't you sue me?

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.760
Who, what do you mean sue?

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.000
Well, suing is a new form of law.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.840
It means you can just take all of someone's money.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.680
Well, who can sue who?

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.440
Anyone can sue anyone.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.960
But if you're more rich than someone,

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.720
you can survive the suing, and if you're poor, you can't.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.360
So if you're poor, you can't sue rich people,

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.960
but if you're rich, you can sue anyone,

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.480
and if you're rich, you can also get sued,

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.960
and it won't matter.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.160
Like, well, who's gonna conduct all this?

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.000
Lawyers.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.600
You have a right to counsel.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.520
How does that work?

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.160
Well, if you're poor, you get one assigned to you,

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.400
and you're fucked, and if you're rich,

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.880
you can decapitate a woman with a knife,

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:44.800
and then walk away.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.360
It's like, yeah, you know what?

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.600
I'm taking that stance.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:53.040
I think O.J. done it.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.560
I got a hunch, and I'm just going with it.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.080
Every problem we have stems from,

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.160
it's not that capitalism is inherently evil,

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.160
it's that it was never designed,

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:08.560
it was never meant to be unmitigated.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.880
I don't think it was ever designed.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.200
It just kind of fucking sprang up and was a monster.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.400
That's the good thing about it, though.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.440
The reason it's sprang up and is useful

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.040
is because it's not a bad thing by nature.

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.160
It's about efficiency.

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.480
It's about getting more shit done per minute.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.720
It is about, it does hold an enormous potential

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:31.520
to equivocate, what the fuck is the word?

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.040
What's he saying?

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:34.880
Equivocate?

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.600
No, that's when you wishy-wash, doesn't it?

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.440
Equivalency?

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.680
Equivocate means like, whatever.

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.400
It does have an enormous potential to even everybody out,

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.560
especially in a world where we were like,

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.720
okay, divine right of kings and we're done with that

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.520
and now it's just like poker chips.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.240
It has, it's all the more necessary,

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.760
all the more necessary in a world

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.720
where that is the only thing that's important,

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.520
that there be another more important thing.

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.360
It has to be.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.640
Otherwise, it's like, how much does this bullet cost

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.760
and how much is this black kid going to do

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.320
if we pursue his presumption of innocence

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.400
or we protect him?

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.120
Like, how much money is that gonna cost?

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:13.080
Like, everything gets turned into money

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.920
and then people actually fucking start suffering

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.560
and we have to like, I don't know,

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:20.600
it's like, you can't invent it,

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.920
you can't just come out with something.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.640
But imagine a world where you were driving down the street

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.360
and you saw somebody that needed help

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.400
and you were on your way to a meeting

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.760
where you might make a bunch of money.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.240
I know that there's, working backwards from the goal,

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.240
I know that there's a world where you could stop your car,

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.040
get out and be like excited

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.640
because you haven't seen someone in need in so long

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:41.440
that it's like fucking bubble wrap.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.360
It's like a thing you get to do that's fun.

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.080
Like, and it's something you get to brag about

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:50.120
when you get to the meeting that you have to reschedule.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.960
That meeting just became worth less

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.840
because of this opportunity to be happy for you.

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:55.200
I'm not talking about all of a sudden

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.720
becoming good people,

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.080
I'm talking about the fact that we look at goodness

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:00.240
as being this weird thing,

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.400
like advertising that we have to tolerate or something

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.400
that we have to force ourselves to do.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.040
I'm talking about switching that

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.040
where because we all know that once we're forced

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.960
to do good shit for other people, much like showering,

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.440
we're always happy we did it afterwards.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.280
Like, like I just-

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.120
Are you though?

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:17.960
Don't lie.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.320
It's just hard to take off your pants

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.240
and get into a fucking cold water

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.960
that's pelting your Asperger skin.

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.040
Like, it's like, you don't have Asperger's,

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.880
shut up, I'm rich, I can say whatever I want.

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.560
See, that's the problem.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.280
But I know that there's,

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.760
because there was like, if there was currency to that,

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.280
instead of it, it always feels like,

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.880
you were saying like stupid people incur loss

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.520
and rich people are smart people gain.

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:48.920
And it could be like,

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.480
you don't have to be talking about money,

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.240
you can talk about like getting upset and all this shit,

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:57.040
like stupidity is like loss and you try,

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:00.880
like if there was a way to gain

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.400
in a way that you could measure somehow

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.720
from helping other people,

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.880
it would be, it would turn around so quick.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.280
Cause the market would fucking flood

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.400
and there wouldn't be so many homeless people

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.320
that you would have to feel like you were doing nothing

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:17.080
and wasting your time and becoming homeless yourself

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:17.920
by helping them.

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.760
That's the fear.

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.800
That's all we, we're not like this.

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.240
We don't want to not care.

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:23.480
We're forcing ourselves.

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.320
We're like emotionally anorexic.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.920
Like we're controlling our fucking spirituality.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.200
We're like starving ourselves because we are scared.

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.960
And like, that if we spend the time helping somebody

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.000
that they're going to suck our time and our money away

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.800
and we're going to become just like them.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.600
And then it's like that.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.640
We, so we got to figure out how to flip that system

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.240
so that it can be a video game.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.280
We'll never gonna, we're never going to not be monkeys.

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.560
We're never going to not want to gain.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:50.480
We just have to figure out how to put a value on that.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.600
China, you know, China's been doing that.

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600
They started with their murder vans.

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.560
Yeah, you know, hear about these Chinese murder vans.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:59.920
No, they, they, they, they started this game.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.120
I don't remember what it's called,

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.840
but it's, it's like meow, meow beans.

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.320
Yeah. The good citizen game

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.760
or some shit. That's like a cult, man.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.760
That's fucked up.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:09.680
I mean, it's more like fascism, but okay.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.040
Like a fascist cult.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.280
Well, fascism is like a cult when it's fascist, I think.

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:18.400
Anyway, I'm just like, it's this game where you,

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.680
you get points for being a good citizen

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:22.080
and it's like all fun and games,

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.680
except in five years it becomes mandatory for all citizens.

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.040
So everyone's going to be required to be all like,

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.720
oh, I, you know, I prayed to Mao.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.360
That's racist, right?

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.560
Do they pray to Mao?

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.760
It's a good analogy.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.800
Anyway, like, or, or if you're friends with people

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.160
who say bad stuff about the government,

01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.880
you'll, you'll be docked points.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.360
So you got to unfriend your buddies on Facebook

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.360
when they're taking anti-party lines.

01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:48.880
And that's, that's like an evil version

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:49.920
of what you're talking about.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.560
But there could maybe be a game

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.720
that's more just about like karma points.

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:54.840
Yeah. Or something.

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.240
Yeah. And I can't, I don't know if it's like

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.920
actually just instituting points like that.

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.200
Or if it is just more like, like, like, I don't know.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.040
Like just-

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:02.960
You're talking about points, man.

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.000
Stop talking about points.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
We don't need points.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:05.840
Money is points.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.440
Stop talking about what people should stop talking about.

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.000
No, points are the problem, man.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.440
Money is literally points.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.400
You argue, you love art.

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.560
You love like, you're telling people that they're wrong.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.400
Sorry.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.520
Just have a conversation.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.360
You don't have to just,

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.760
you don't have to just tell people.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.520
Have you ever talked about movies with a Canadian?

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.720
It's fucking galling.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.960
It's like, it's like, will you take it easy?

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.520
It's like, I can either like or not like Godzilla

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.360
and so can you.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.840
Just fucking stop yelling at me.

01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.480
Unless you're talking about the Matthew Broderick one

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:32.080
in that case, that's bad.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.360
No, at university.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.840
Any movie can just be liked or not liked.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.000
You guys are, you have great socialized medicine,

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.320
but you're terrible at talking about movies.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.440
And your Taco Bells have french fries.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.280
Sorry.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.000
Whereas Americans are obviously,

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.320
our greatest gift is for not generalizing.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:52.880
No, I think, well, you're talking about points

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.600
and like a system of rewards or like a-

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.600
That's how the human brain operates.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.760
That's why money works.

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.800
It's like, it's dopamine.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.560
It's like getting a fucking like prize.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.440
It's getting a jackpot, getting a fucking like-

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.280
It's winning points.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:06.560
Lighting something up.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:09.000
Like, there was this thing on NPR.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.240
There was like, there was this medicine

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.600
that helps you get over, was it Parkinson's or?

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.920
Get over Parkinson's.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.240
There's medicine that helps you get over Parkinson's.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.080
Get over it.

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:17.920
Holy shit.

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:20.040
No, it's a treatment for some kind of,

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.040
some illness I can't remember,

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.520
but it like, it spikes your dopamine so high

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.040
that they didn't realize what was happening

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.320
until a couple people like actually got really fucked up

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:32.160
by this, dopamine causes you,

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.840
it makes you really, really susceptible

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.000
to gambling addiction.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.520
Oh, is this the multiple sclerosis medicine?

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:38.520
It could be, I don't know.

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:40.360
The important thing is the dopamine aspect of it

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.240
because they found out by this happening,

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.120
it was like, why are these people

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:45.480
on this medicine becoming like inveterate gamblers?

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.960
Like they're fucking losing their homes.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.440
And it turns out, and they did this thing where they're like,

01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.840
oh, it's just fucking like three cherries come up

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.200
and a little reward comes out.

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.720
And it's like, what happens in your brain

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.920
is this dopamine spike.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.160
And that's what has driven our entire species

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:02.760
because we experiment and then we,

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.560
something happens that benefits us

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:07.160
and we get a fucking little baby orgasm about it

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.440
and it like marks it.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.760
And then we, so that's how we get addicted to drugs.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:14.280
That's how we get, we're always chasing that spike.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.680
And so that causes racism.

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.480
That causes like our capacity for categorization

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:21.440
and solving problems.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.640
I figured it out.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.680
All of the people that made me have a bad day yesterday

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:25.600
were Mexican.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.160
I'm like, what a reward.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.120
It's bad, it's good and bad,

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:34.200
but it's like, it's this powerful engine that we run on.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:37.000
So I think like, you can write software

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.040
on top of that machine language

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.840
that maybe it's a point system, maybe that's bad,

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.160
maybe there's a way to get beyond a point system.

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.800
But I think the biological fact is

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.720
that our brains do run on that engine.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.400
Like we do run on like figuring out puzzles

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.240
and getting rewarded for it.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:56.520
Oh, totally, you're totally right.

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.440
We're very much like meaning engines,

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.920
we're problem solvers, we attribute things to points.

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.720
But when someone says, this is worth a point,

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.440
someone else is gonna go, how can I make money off that?

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.520
How can I make two points for every one point I make?

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:12.480
So if you can get rid of that system

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.640
and instead say, well, what if I gave away all my points

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.280
and then I stopped feeling like a piece of shit,

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.200
that would be a better system.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.560
If it was just like getting rid of stuff,

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.320
made everyone around you feel good,

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.880
and then as a result of that, you felt better.

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:30.120
That socialism, motherfuckers.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.840
Yeah, I mean, there was a way to create a system

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.840
by which we could all hit the tip,

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.160
a tipping point of understanding that as in the video games

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.000
where we have points and then you spend them

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.280
on like upgrading things,

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.240
that the upgrades weren't just for you,

01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:44.200
the upgrades were actually your contribution

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.360
to the society and all that shit.

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.080
Yeah, we'll figure it out, we're gonna figure it out.

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.080
Hope you do.

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.840
We're better quick.

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:52.840
Canada's doing pretty good,

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.000
so we're waiting for you to catch up.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.480
Yeah, I mean, you guys can't be doing that good, right?

01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.920
Not well, our dollar sucks,

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.760
it sucks being down here right now

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.400
because everything costs like a buck and a half more.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:08.600
It must be a nightmare to buy magazines in Canada, right?

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.120
They already cost more and then the dollar is weaker, right?

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.200
So it's like they gotta cost like 25 bucks

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.960
for a fucking people.

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.520
What?

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:20.240
You think people buy people?

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.800
I mean, if they wanted to.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.920
They're the luckiest people of all.

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.600
Here's my equivalency.

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.080
Magic cards cost five bucks a booster pack.

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.280
That sucks.

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.080
Did you just try to say buster pack?

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:36.320
No, it's a nerd thing, I don't know.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.760
But everything costs more.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.360
All right, well, let's thank Prime Minister Adam

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.200
for coming by.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.200
Thank you.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.480
All right.

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.480
So what do you think?

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.640
DeMorge isn't back there, right?

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.640
Is he?

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:53.640
No, I think he might be at Sketchfest.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640
Yeah.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.560
I'm in 2016.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560
Thank you.

01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:00.680
I know that means you love me,

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.600
but I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.280
But what we should do is go out in the street

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.560
and grab people that we really, really like

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.880
and just make them be president.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.360
That would be the way to do it.

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.280
Because it should just be a job that's like,

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.600
it's a civil servant, you know?

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:17.800
Like the country runs itself.

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800
How the fuck do you know?

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.120
Like this idea that you get to be king and get blowjobs,

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.240
it's fucking really.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.120
I was about to say retarded, but I don't want to praise it.

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.480
OK, so maybe we should talk about what we learned

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.480
in the form of a nice, slow rap.

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.280
Uh-oh.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:47.280
You took off your headphones.

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:48.280
Does that mean you're...

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.280
Give me a minute.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.280
OK, he needs a minute.

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.280
All right.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.280
What did you hold up, Levy?

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.280
A cup.

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:54.280
Oh, OK.

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.280
Are you drinking?

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.280
He isn't drinking.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.280
Levy, come on here.

01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.280
Give us a Levy update.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:00.480
Yeah, you need a hype man for your rapping.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:02.480
Hype man.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480
Steve Levy.

01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:05.480
You need a boss tone.

01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:12.480
We're going to be in Miami next week, so no show here, right?

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.480
Right.

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:14.480
Next week?

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.480
OK.

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.480
We're going to be in Miami at something con.

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.480
Magic, magic city con.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.480
Magic city con.

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.480
There's cons and there's gates.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:32.480
The objective is to get more cons and less gates.

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:37.480
You ever wonder what would have happened if Watergate had happened at like a Marriott?

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.480
Or Four Seasons?

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.480
And then there would be...

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:47.480
If a president got caught embezzling, it would be called like embezzle Four Seasons.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.480
Or embezzle Flate Four Seasons.

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:58.480
That's the kind of stuff me and Stephen Wright think about in 1980.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.480
Who's your favorite stand-up, Rhea?

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:08.480
Who was your hero that made you want to be a stand-up?

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:13.480
Well, honestly, this is going to be so cliche, but Ellen DeGeneres.

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:16.480
But I watched her when I was like...

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.480
Yeah, I mean, it's perfect, isn't it?

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:21.480
Did you and Tig go and see her a lot?

01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:23.480
Yeah, yeah, we like held hands, watched it.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.480
We're like, this is great, right?

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.480
Should we take the homeobile to Ellen's concert?

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.480
Yeah, let's take the homeobile.

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:36.480
I remember when I was a kid, I thought Ellen was very plucking and fun and funny.

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:42.480
That was before she became an icon of controversy slash progress slash whatever.

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.480
She is a solid stand-up comedian.

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:49.480
Certainly because her contemporaries, not to throw them too much under the bus,

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.480
but her contemporaries were Rita Rudner.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.480
Actually, Paula Poundstone was really funny.

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:56.480
Did you watch Paula Poundstone's show on HBO?

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480
Did you ever see that?

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.480
I feel like I did.

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.480
She just had regular people up and talk to them.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:05.480
She would have firemen and dentists and stuff.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.480
She was like...

01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.480
He's still working on it.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.480
You got beats?

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.480
Oh, shit.

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.480
Oh, there was one more.

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.480
Oh, go to omaze.com slash...

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.480
Rick and Morty.

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.480
Is that going to get them there?

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.480
Yeah, I think there's only like a week left.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.480
Yeah, you can still buy shit there or just donate $10 and each $10 donation.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.480
Justin just made, I think, nine original artworks that you can donate.

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.480
There's more stuff to buy.

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.480
Each $10 gets you a...

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:37.480
It's for AIDS, which is bad.

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.480
It's not for AIDS, it's against AIDS.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:49.480
Each $10 gets you entered into a thing where you have a chance of being a voice on Rick and Morty.

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.480
Yeah.

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.480
And I'll hang out with you, too.

01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:01.480
Well, what a night.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.480
Hype him.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.480
Oh, shit.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.480
Dan Harmon.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.480
Keep going, keep it up.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:12.480
All right, everybody, fucking play your hands together for Dan Harmon.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.480
He's going to do a slow rap.

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480
What?

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480
Slow rap.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.480
Ask him if we're ready for it.

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.480
Are you ready for Dan Harmon?

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.480
It doesn't sound like you're fucking ready.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.480
Come on, get louder.

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.480
Yeah.

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.480
Question there, readiness.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.480
Yeah, you don't sound like you're ready.

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.480
Come on, get ready.

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.480
Yo.

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480
Yo.

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.480
Yo.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:38.480
Yo.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480
Yo.

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.480
Coast to coast.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.480
Left to right.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.480
The fuck's your mama so hard?

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.480
She is no longer tight.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.480
Took her shoes off and put them on her head.

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:51.480
I rolled around with her in bed.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.480
We slept till noon.

01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.480
We woke up and watched Netflix.

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:56.480
We had a great time.

01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.480
We ate some Czechs mix.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.480
I went downstairs.

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.480
I got us scared.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.480
I heard a sound.

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.480
There was a sound.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.480
Somebody was around.

01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:13.480
I wanted to look like a man, so I went down.

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:17.480
I said nobody's here, but I didn't look around that much.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.480
I just wanted your mama to think I did.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:23.480
Truth is, I was scared.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.480
Went back up to bed.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.480
Rolled around.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.480
Heard another sound instead.

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.480
Got scared again.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.480
Should I call 911?

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:33.480
No, don't worry about that.

01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:35.480
My manhood's just begun.

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.480
I went back downstairs.

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.480
Looked around again.

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.480
Looked more around.

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:47.480
Opened doors fast and said,

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:50.480
I've got a gun, which wasn't true.

01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:53.480
But what you're gonna do

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.480
when you're white in the suburbs

01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:57.480
and you don't have a gun

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.480
and somebody might be in your house?

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.480
Oh, shit!

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.480
Dan Harmon, come on!

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:06.480
Come on!

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.480
You want to hear that second verse?

01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:10.480
You want to fucking hear that second verse?

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.480
Yo!

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.480
Yo!

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.480
Yo!

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:15.480
Yo!

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:16.480
Yo!

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:17.480
Yo!

01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:18.480
Yo!

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.480
Yo!

01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:20.480
Yo!

01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:21.480
Yo!

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.480
Yo!

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.480
Yo!

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.480
Yo!

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:28.480
Rhea Butcher, controlling like a motherfucker.

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:31.480
She's a motherfucker.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.480
She's literally a motherfucker.

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.480
She's able to fuck your mother.

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:39.480
Just like me, she's a lesbian bee.

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:45.480
The heterosexuality is united with lesbianity

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.480
because guys fuck women.

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:49.480
And so do lesbian women.

01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:51.480
We go swimming with women.

01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.480
We take off their clothes

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:58.480
and then we come in.

01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:00.480
Come in.

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.480
Take them on the beach.

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:04.480
Roll around.

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.480
Oh, no!

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:08.480
I heard another sound.

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:10.480
Went into the woods,

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.480
went to the store,

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:14.480
bought some goods and services

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.480
through capitalism.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.480
It's impregnating evil with chism.

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:22.480
I fucked your mama with it.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.480
I came on her head.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:26.480
I squeezed her tit.

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.480
Oh, you did the run DMC thing

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.480
where you said tit at the same time?

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.480
No, that was me.

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.480
Oh, oh.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.480
Alright, because I invite that.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:37.480
Okay.

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.480
Hit me.

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.480
Hit me.

01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480
Stamps.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.480
Alright.
