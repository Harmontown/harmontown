00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Music

00:06.000 --> 00:08.800
From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics,

00:08.800 --> 00:13.000
Harmontown is now in session!

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Music

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Spencer Crittenden did, everybody!

00:22.000 --> 00:32.000
Music

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
And the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
Music

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Thank you!

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
You're looking very smart in your camouflage hoodie. I like that.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I walked off the set of Great Minds wearing this. This isn't mine.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
This is Wardrobe?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yeah.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm probably still wearing makeup, too.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
What do I mean, probably? I am still wearing makeup.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Are we allowed to know what this character is about?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I play Dan Harmon.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You play you, but like...

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh, it's just finished shooting with Sarah Silverman as Betsy Ross.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
Yesterday was Ron Funches as Edie Amin.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
And he's, I mean, well, Sarah's fantastic.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I can sing her praises lots, but Ron's new to our family.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
My life, I knew he was adorable and cuddly and giggly,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
and we worked with him on a Harmon quest,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
but yesterday, playing Edie Amin,

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
he revealed a depth of dramatic chops that was like stunning.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So I'm really looking forward. I think that episode's going to be great.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
He's like a great dramatic actor.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
And I'm obviously a terrible comedy writer

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
if you'll find out he's a great dramatic actor in my comedy show.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay, so here's some thoughts that I had.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
So I find this hard to believe.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
So I have not, in this podcast,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
if I talked about the Uber Rape Data leak...

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Okay, it seems like I would.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
First of all, if you're a company,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
just strategically, don't have rape data.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
But sometimes, apparently, it's if you're going to...

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I was going to...

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, it's a big company.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It's been growing very quickly,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and they have a customer service database,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
and there was kind of a, I don't know, semi-whistleblower,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
a customer service person who...

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
They leaked images, screenshots of the Uber customer service database

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
with examples of things that you would type in and how many results you'd get.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
So if you type in the word rape, you get 5,583, something like that.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I think it's as many feet as there are in a mile.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
That's my mnemonic device.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Over three years, but Uber released a rebuttal,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
which just...

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
There's no good way to rebut this,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
and they did not find the good way.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
They said, that is so misleading.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
What if the driver or passenger is named Jason Rape?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
That's the example that they said.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
What they said is some drivers or users might have that word in their last name,

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
and the two examples they used in this order were like Jason Rape or Don Draper.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
They should have started with Don Draper.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
You should have started and finished with Don Draper.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Why did you create this Marvel villain?

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
I don't care if he exists and is driving for Uber to bury that lead.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Don Draper, the guy that thought of Don Draper in the Uber PR war room,

03:56.000 --> 04:04.000
promote that guy and send him home early because you're done with that plank of your debate.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Don't then go, yeah, Jason Rape.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
I would have started with Don Draper, then Alexander the Grape.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
The other pop flavor.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, this is the other thing they say,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
not to mention colloquialisms in a complaint,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
someone might say, you raped my wallet.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Are you making that up?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
That's a real one.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
I'm not making that up.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
That was Uber's rebuttal.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
They're just saying, hey, this is something...

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Look, it's not always...

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
And they said, that's over three years.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Also, by the way, the screenshots go,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I don't think these defenses hold up for the phrase sexual assault,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
which was also typed in and had thousands and thousands of...

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Anyways, all right.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
If you're a company, I mean, hey, I'm no Donald Trump.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I don't have a book on how to run a business.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm just saying, don't have rape data.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Just consider that, consider the existence of it at all to be a crisis.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Deal with it very quickly.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Do you think the person that came up with the name Don Draper

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
from Mad Men thought of like Don D. Raper?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Who knows?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
But the other end of that spectrum is like,

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
as we said at the end of the Cordury episode,

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
our friend, the Uber driver, Abed, seems to me,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I don't want to speculate too widely or too quickly,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
but it just sort of sounds like he's the victim

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
of some kind of crazy entrapment sting operation,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
which must surely start from something,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
as much as we want to vilify Uber in the press,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
probably because they target the press,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
also because of the rape data.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
But also on the other side of that, it's like,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
well, where are we coming from?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
We're coming from this crazy system where

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
cities are in charge of medallions and all that crap.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
But thanks to Spencer, Uber,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm sorry, Abed met his goal, like Lickety Split.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I didn't even have time to tweak.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
It's just from people who probably watched the live stream

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
and people who knew about it just that day.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I saw your Facebook post about that,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
and I went on to do it, and you had not met the goal

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
when I was putting information in,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
and by the end of it, it was way over.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
That's how fast it was coming in, it was really great.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
That's a very cool of you, Spencer, to take that on.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I wasn't thinking, no, it's not me, it's, you know.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
No, I'm saying like, it absolutely was you.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Who is it, what?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
It's the kindness of all the people who donated.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, fuck those people.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
No, but he means like, you made it easy for them to do it.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, I opened a door so kindness can pour through

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
and bathe Abed in compassion.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah, that's nothing.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I wouldn't have thought to do it.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I didn't think about it.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I was so happy listening to the episode,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
because that happened, and then Rob Corddry,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
we find out that he is in love with everybody.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
He was sad, and it totally wasn't here.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That made me so happy.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Alright, so, is there a way to turn off comments on Instagram,

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
and if so, would you?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You could delete comments.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't want to delete no comments.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That's like reading a book.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Who hurt your feelings, what was it?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
No, I just, nobody did.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
I'm not a photographer.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm not into, I don't paint with light.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I just...

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Clearly from that sentence, you paint with words.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Correct.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Yes.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Photographers don't even know they're allowed to say that about themselves.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
They're too busy painting with light.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Less are known, but more valid saying about me.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
My words are worth a thousand pictures.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But each of them.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
So, if I take a picture, it's worth...

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
What's a thousand times a thousand?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Ten.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
No, you just said...

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Your picture would be worth it with one word.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Oh, no, divided by a thousand?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't know.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We'll be right back.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Goldbond powder.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
No, it's absolutely not.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I'm not Kim Kardashian, so I don't...

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
There's people who I'm sure...

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Don't say yourself short again.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
She'll post a picture of herself sleeping or waking up,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
or be like, I'm waking up,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
and then the top comment will just be slut or something.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I don't have that problem.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
People aren't trying to hurt me, generally,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
and then the ones that are...

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
You know what? It's the funny people.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I don't...

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't like...

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I'll take a picture of a silly thing,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
and I'll go like, this is why this is silly.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And then it's just like...

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
People pointing out the joke that you told...

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Now I'll try that joke,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
but I'm not going to quite land it.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't know why that makes me angry.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
It makes me angry.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
You know what?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It's not a popular stance of me.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
This is like...

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
There's some people on my comment section

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
where it's always the exact same comment every time.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And it's just...

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
What people don't know is that we have a rare turkey.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Half turkey, half man.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's the first day of spring,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
and it's a new Harmontown tradition,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
the spring turkeys here,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
to spread his turkey eggs of renewed life.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Isn't it the worst thing to make fun of somebody's laughter?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Everybody should laugh however they want to.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Well, yes, but...

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I just want to balance the scales and say,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
that person's timing and nature of that laugh,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm going to say, was in mockery.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
No, they were like,

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
you guys are idiots.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I felt a little bit of that.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I feel like that person had like half a five hour energy

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
down their throat and then laughed at the same time.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Yeah, but think about what they would have been laughing at.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It wasn't like you were like,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
who's there Santa Claus is underwearing.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
There's some people who like the same comment every time,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
and they're like...

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I think they were like,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
what is this, the grandpa show?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Or...

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Or the wear turkey is like,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
oh shit, that's me, he's talking about me.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I always type in gobble gobble.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh, you know what it might have been?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It's six people who came together,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
the person who laughed

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
is the friend of a friend of a friend.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Who does that?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
No, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, I'm sorry.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Yes, yes.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But the friend of a friend of a friend,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
the person that laughed is like,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
I was just complaining about Steve.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah, Steve was just...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Oh my God.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Because the person that shortled the wear turkey

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
went...

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
went to Trisha.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Let's add some gender balance to this story.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Trisha's the...

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
the listot of this group of six

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
that came here tonight.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
And Damien,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
the wear turkey,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
went up to Trisha and said,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
are you really bringing Stephen?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
He...

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
he mono-comments on Instagram.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
He's...

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
he's an Instagram mono-commenter.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
He mono-comments on Instagram.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And Stephanie was like,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I think you're judgmental and

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I'm not saying anything like that to him

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
and you need to think about friendship

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
and no one shares that point of view.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But then the cloud comes away from the moon

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and the moon comes out and you're...

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
That's... you're just... I mean, this is...

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I'm... I'm... I thought...

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Well, yeah, I mean...

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Can any animal be aware... can you be aware anything?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah, yeah, anything, yeah.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Any animal can have lycanthropy.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I want to see a movie about a wear turkey.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
But I want to know, is it always a person that gets bit

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
by... by something

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
before you even get into the biting?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Like, is it always a person

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
that turns into

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
a sardine? Is it different when a sardine

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
turns into a person?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Like, like a sardine?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Does the animal kingdom have their own

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
version of wearer things?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I bet they do.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Because the wearer is the person part

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
and then the animal part. Sorry, what?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
So...

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It was a wearer man.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Oh, was that the Native American, like, reservation thing?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
No.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Kumail was it? Oh, they did...

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
The new X-Files has like a wear man?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Or what... wouldn't that be like a...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It was a lizard.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Who turns into a guy?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
All right.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Well, you know...

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I mean, I'm not pitching stuff up here.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm...

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I'm asking questions. I wasn't going to run out the door

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
and make a movie.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
No, I mean... You might have, you might have.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Well, if there had been silence, I might have,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
so thank you.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Can anybody say,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
has there been a wear turkey today?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, I doubt it.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
We own that intellectual property.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Okay, so you guys

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
spot like this movie, I think,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
there's a little movie. But did you guys watch

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
all the way to the end of the credits?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Well, there's a whole thing after the credits.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
It's all done by Wallace and Grumman.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It's...

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
You know how the guy...

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
You know that guy that leans on Michael Keaton

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
in the bar, in that scene,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
where Michael Keaton goes, is this how it works?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
A guy leans on a guy, and then all of a sudden,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
remember that scene, that guy?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
And that guy says like, so what are you going to do?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
You know, Marty Barron, he does this in Miami,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
he does this in Cleveland,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and now he's going to be gone in a couple years.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Where are you going to go?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Something to think about.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And he leaves, remember that scene?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
After the credits, if you keep watching

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
all of Spotlight, all the way through the credits,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
there's a bonus scene.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I haven't watched it yet.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
And it's that guy again,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
he comes up to Michael Keaton

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
in the bar, and he goes,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
well, where are you going to go?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Because, you know,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Michael Keaton goes, Rome.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And the guy's like,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
good one.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I wouldn't be surprised.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
And Michael Keaton's like,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
and he starts walking away.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And then the camera stays on that guy,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
and he starts drinking, and then he does a double take.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
He's like, whoa.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
And then the camera whips over,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
and Michael Keaton is walking away,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
and what you thought was his napkin.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
He places it on his head,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and it's a giant white hat.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
He goes to the camera,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
and he pulls two cords in his

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
suit jacket,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
which turns into long robes.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
And then in a move I can only

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
describe, I can't imitate.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't know if they use CG

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
to make this possible, but

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
he does a genuflect

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
that where the horizontal

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
part of the cross is him

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
removing a mask.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
So I can't do it quite right,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
but it's like,

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
oh.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
So when I do it, it just looks like

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I went like this, and then removed a mask.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But I guess Michael Keaton studied with the Vatican.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
He unzips it.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
This is the unzipping of the part of the mask,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
and that's the pulling off of the mask.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Anyways, revealing that Michael Keaton

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
was the pope the whole movie.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And they're raising a ton more questions

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
for Spotlight 2.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So just stay until

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
after the credits.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
You know?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You guys, you know,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
you should be watching them anyway.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
The grip worked hard on that.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
That's your little reward

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
is now you know that

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Michael Keaton was the pope in that movie.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Mark Rufalo is like

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
on Rufalo level 10

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
in that movie. So he's making his little

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Rufalo kissy faces.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Mark Rufalo can't,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
the entire movie is

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
it seems Mark Rufalo comes into him,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
sits down and hunches

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and puts his head at the Rufalo angle

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and then he's like

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I guess he's the character there.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
No.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
No.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Why'd they fuck the children, Marty?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I don't know.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
And he makes his little Rufalo kissy lips

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
and you just want to

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I'm on record.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I want to make love to this man.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
But he's extra adorable

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
because he's doing an impression of some

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
real guy. Who must be like

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
imagine being that guy?

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Like talk about it.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
You've got to use that date wisely.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, let's go see a movie.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, I forgot this movie.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Is this the one? This movie is about me.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Oh, yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh, that's me at Mark Rufalo's playing me.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Oh, yeah, I'm yelling at Michael Keaton

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
in this game. How many degrees is the

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
sexiest Mark Rufalo angle?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Like 30 degrees?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Like when you said the...

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I don't know. I mean, he's sexy all the time, but

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
he...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
He's got those very pouty lips.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, I said

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
my girlfriend, I tried

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
to figure out how to describe

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
what's going on at Mark Rufalo's standing

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
face when he's not

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
making little kissies or talking.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
And his standing face

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
in the spotlight is

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
mommy just finished

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
giving me medicine.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Like

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
he just...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
like the spoon just left frame

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
that had like dime a tap on it.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And he's like

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
he doesn't know if it's good or bad

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
yet, but...

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Subscribe to Harmontowns so you can see this face

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
on the live stream

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
because he's doing a very good kissy

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
face Mark Rufalo.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Boy, that's a lot...

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Those priests, huh?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
That's a lot of...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
That's a lot of fucking...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
At the

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
end of the movie, there's no spoilers.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
You know, the spoilers are...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Yeah.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But at the end, you know what? At the end,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
when it's like, oh, they're...

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
in...

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Up here?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
No.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Shit, I thought there'd be phones ringing.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
We sent the phone answers

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
downstairs.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Downstairs.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Prrrring!

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Whoa! The phones were ringing.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Where... where... where Turkey's

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
girlfriend?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
See?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I have the screener sitting on my

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
dining room table.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
That was very rude, ma'am.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Why did I cast you as where Turkey's girlfriend?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's fucked up.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Why do you have to be She-Hulk? Why can't you have your own franchise?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
That's Generation X.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm sorry.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
You millennial, that was just a new lady.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Do you think where Turkey's girlfriend...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
She doesn't even know him.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Do you think where Turkey's girlfriend is aware of something else

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
like you think that where Turkey is just dating

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
some regular... regular woman?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh, no way. I mean, like, it's got to be

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
like the Marvel Universe. I'm sure she's got

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
a tail or...

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I don't know. She could probably see through hate

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
or something.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That would be the worst power

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
in today's society. I could see through their hate

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and they're like, well, that's the problem.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Sure, we're trying to detect the hate.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
No, it seems to me like everything's fine.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Are you sure you have a superpower?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Yes.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I think you might just be blind

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
to crime.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Well, yeah, but...

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah, I can see any

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
crime that doesn't involve hate.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Wait, what was I... I was talking about something important.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, so

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
what were you thinking at the end of the movie?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Because all the phones were ringing? Because it was like...

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
And the guy comes up and he goes like...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Or somebody lowers the phone

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
for a second and the phones are ringing.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
They're all victims. All of them.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And I just thought the next

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
shot would be Michael Keaton going, well,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
tell him, thanks, but that ship

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
kind of sailed. We already did the story.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I...

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
We...

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
We...

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
We get at a priest fuck you. I...

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
We know. We exposed it.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Now you read it in the paper, you want to tell the world.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
The paper told the world,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
get your own paper.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
But then it says in the next

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
five years they did

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
600 more stories. Okay.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Well, I guess that's how

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
the newspapers work. I don't know.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I guess they just keep doing it.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Do you think the Catholic Church has been chasing by that?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, well,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I was going to

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
scoff and say like, oh, yeah, look at them.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
But I don't know.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
I don't know anything about that shit.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I never...

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I was shocked. That was the most...

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
The shocking thing to me wasn't the

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
shocking things in that movie.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The shocking thing was

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
like how Catholic people still are.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Like in the modern world.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
You hear that stuff, but it just seems like

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
a kind of like 50s stickball on the street

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
and like kind of thing, but

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
this is a story that takes place in the modern world

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
and the church is a part of their lives.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And honestly,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't know nothing about nothing.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Alright, so

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Amazon Package

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
makes up. I got a dog sitter.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
She does very well.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
She's there all the time.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That's what makes her a good dog sitter. I'm very busy.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
So, you know, and I'm also ordering a lot of

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Amazon stuff because I'm in a new relationship

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and I...

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I'll put a pin in that.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Well, it's kind of...

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I mean, that's the thing.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I see an Amazon package and I'm like, oh boy!

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Because it might be...

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Because it might be like an outfit.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And then I'm like...

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I rip it open and I'm like, why are these...

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
What are these gold Nikes?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And it's like, oh, it's my go... I just opened someone's

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Amazon package because of my dog sitter.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
So now I got... So the thing is...

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
She's having her own Amazon stuff sent to your place.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Which makes sense. Good. I'd rather that...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
That to me is a sign that she's...

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Your dog sitter has gold Nikes?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Ha ha ha!

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Fuck it!

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
You have...

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
You have made it, bro!

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
My dog sitter's dog sitter

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
has gold Nikes.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Dan, if somebody told you

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
25 years ago when you were

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
in a shitty apartment in Milwaukee,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
that you had a dog sitter to start, that'd be one thing.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
You would never consider...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Start with dogs!

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
And I'm not eating them?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
No, they're pets. You let them just hang out.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
You buy them food.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
What?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
What?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
But it sounds like I'll be stuck at home

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
walking these dogs and picking up their poop

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
all the time. Bro, bro,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
wake up to capitalism.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
You got someone paid to hang out with

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
your dogs and you buy her food too!

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, but she's probably just walking around

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
with some flip-flops, like being all bummed out.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
That bitch gets gold Nikes!

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Ha ha ha!

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Ha ha ha!

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Ha ha ha!

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Her feet never touch the earth!

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Ha ha ha!

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
She was raised above grounds

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
in a harness

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
surrounded by images of well-fed dogs.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Ha ha ha!

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And told that was the ordinary world.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And then, periodically,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
there would be a dog that needed to be fed

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
during which she'd get an electric shock.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Ha ha ha!

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And then she was dropped to the earth, a door opened,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
and it turned out she was in my backyard in a tent.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And now she goes into my home...

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Wait, she's a dog walker, but she doesn't even touch the earth?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
She's not even walking. She's just a dog...

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
During the raising of her, she's like, veal,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
is my metaphor? Oh!

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Coby-coby-beef?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Aren't her muscles so flabby

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
that she can't even really walk a dog anymore?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That's why you got the gold Nikes, so she floats around.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Don't body-shame her.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Why not just get your...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Ha ha ha!

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Ha ha ha!

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Ha ha ha ha!

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Cha-ching!

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
People listening...

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Harmon's podcast, up 3% on the...

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Ha ha ha!

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
The Shame Watchers report card.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Why not just get your...

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
If you really make it, get your dogs

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
some gold Nikes, they walk themselves.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Don't dog-shame me!

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
It doesn't work as well.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Well, it didn't work the first time, because you made a face

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
for camera. Ouch! Oh.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
People listening are going to think that joke was hilarious,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
but the audience didn't dig it until you made a face

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
after the body-shaming.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Don't comedy-shame me.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Ha ha ha!

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Ha ha ha!

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Yes.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
He's not making a face.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
That joke was that funny.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Ha ha ha ha!

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Ha ha ha ha!

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Ha ha ha ha!

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
All right, politics corner.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Uh oh!

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And then we're going to bring out our friends.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
So tell them...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Don't forget your pain.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It's always been of open use.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Just for a second.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
This was on Harvey Fierstein's Facebook page,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
and I found it kind of like uplifting

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
in an apolitical way.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It's going to sound very political,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
very specific.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Real quick, do you follow him, or is this something that...

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I saw this, no, I found this third, fourth, fifth hand,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
but this was on his Facebook page

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
is where he shared it.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Because at first I was like, wait, was he on a talk show?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Because goddamn, if he's this like eloquent,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
like would he just rap him?

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
But I mean, he has a playwright,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
and he has fire in his name.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
He just...

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I don't know.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
You know what, for three months I haven't been thinking this way.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And I don't know.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
It's...

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Keep telling people why you're going to share it.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Just share it, you fucking tub of shit.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Watching our people

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
protest Trump today, I have to say

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
that I don't understand what we're doing.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I understand that we must always

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
speak out against intolerance and bigotry

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
and anyone who would destroy American values

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
to ensure their own profits, but at this moment

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
why are we doing the Republicans job for them?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
They created Trump.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
They earned him, as if their hateful rhetoric

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
wasn't enough, just in how they treated

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
our president. They earned Trump

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
with every racist slight, every

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
homophobic slander, every manufactured

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
semi-automatic weapon and oil spill

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and fracking disaster and shuttered women's clinic

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
and attack on affordable healthcare.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
The Republican leadership built this Frankenstein monster.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Let the monster they created and nurtured

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
destroy them.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
What do you think they'll do

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
if we manage to dump Trump?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
They'll only turn around and give us the next horror

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
from their arsenal of selfish intolerance.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Look who they have to offer America.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Next up is Ted Cruz

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
who's who's scared

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Spencer Moore.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And then I saw his face. Yeah, he looks

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
like a silly putty on a radiator.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Which is not, I mean

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
you can be ugly

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
and be president, it's fine.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
There was a neurologist

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
who did a study on why his face

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
instantly makes you unhappy.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
People that when they smile.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And they isolated it to the things coming

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
out of the mouth region.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
As waves of sound.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
When he smiles his eyebrows do the opposite

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
of what happy people's eyebrows do

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and his mouth doesn't.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Somebody was asked

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
one of his old colleagues

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
said, why do people

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
instantly hate Ted Cruz?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
And his answer was, because it saves time.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That's great.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I like that guy.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Politics will take us into two hours of stuff.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But let's bring out

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
the end of that.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
He has a couple more thoughts

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
but really they're mostly just about how Ted Cruz

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
is a piece of shit.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I don't know what it was.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
If I try to articulate it, I won't.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I'm not reading that because I'm like

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
oh my god, what a new revelation about Trump.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
It's actually a revelation about him.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
The idea that we hate people that incite violence

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
at their presidential campaign rally

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
and then so people are going to go out

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
and cause more violence is like, no.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Let them implode, let them

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
eat themselves.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I guess I'd be a sliver

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
over to a different side of that.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I think

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
it's more like

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
well,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
that party

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
that lady said on that panel thing

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
he was listening to this show

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
and it almost was like

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
she stumbled into saying something

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
that you're not even supposed to say.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Someone can tell me, I'll get the name wrong.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It was a panel of Republicans

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
that were basically talking about the Trump problem.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It's one of the female Republican senators

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
who has a lot of media quotes these days

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
but she said like Trump is forcing

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
the Republican party to

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
examine its core beliefs

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and that's something we definitely don't want to have happen.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Like

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
they're talking about examination of their core beliefs

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
like it's the China syndrome.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Which is, I think that is a beautiful thing

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
because it's like, I don't know

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
how much scrutiny the Democratic

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
party would hold up.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I don't know any political gigantic party

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
that represents, like nothing

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
that big would hold up to any scrutiny

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
in terms of core beliefs but my god.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I mean,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
there's a lesser of evils or

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
you know, shit stinks more than piss.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I don't know what to say.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
But

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
it is funny because he's like

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
this mordred that was born out of this

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
like weird slime that drips out of the machine

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
that they've been cranking on

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
and the machine is really built on dishonesty

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
because you can't be

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
a financial elitist

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
and expect a majority vote.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So you have to do all these weird gears

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and Rube Goldberg kind of contraptions

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
that link financial elitism

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
to homophobia

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
which doesn't make any

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
sense. First of all, gay people

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
are rich beyond belief.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Whatever. Let's forget it.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Let's just talk to our guest. You can listen to this shit on

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
other podcasts.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I wanted to share Harvey Firestein's words

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
because I found them with a strange kind of

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
a little spoonful of dimetap for the

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Mark Ruffalo kissy face.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
It felt good going down.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Made my eyebrows wiggle and made my head

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
decide and made me think and ask questions

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
about fucking kids.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Are you auditioning for Mad TV

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
this week? What's going on?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
What other celebrity impressions

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
have you got?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
You got to show Jeff Herried Shopper.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Whoa!

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
It's usually better.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Alright, let's bring out

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
our next guest

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
again.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
We keep having him back because the audience seems to

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
like him. Please welcome Rob Schrab.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
They like it more than you.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
That was a louder cheers.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
He brought the vodka.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
He brought the vodka.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
We didn't even realize that there wasn't any vodka

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
on stage until Rob came out.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Yeah, I got a full glass.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I heard that the reason that we got rid

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
of the Spider-Man

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
bucket

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
was because it was rusted

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and you guys

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
were drinking that.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
We have this

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
lovely dish right here

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
full of ice and cup.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
A little bit of backstage

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
trivia.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Do you think you can get tetanus

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
from ice out of a rusty bucket?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
What happens when you drink rest because they make flasks

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
out of metal? We're going to find out

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
in about a month.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Rob, do you know what a rusty bucket is?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
No, I don't, Jeff.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
That's when I poop on your chest.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Why didn't you say 50 bucks

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
same as downtown?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
20 bucks?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
20 dollars same as downtown.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
All right, all right.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Settle down.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Dan's going to say something.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Here we go.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Here's an observation I came up with

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
that I think you'll enjoy.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Sometimes I come up with

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
little thoughts and things

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
and then I hear myself say it

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
and I go, bye golly.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
That's like something

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
that should go on like a Dave Berry calendar.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Too long

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
to tweet, too good to not share.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
This is this segment called

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Harmon's Gems.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Harmon's Charmons.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Harmon's Charmons.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Wow.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
The ladies liked that one.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Yeah.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Shit.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
They really did.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
The guys were, nope.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Not all the ladies.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
All the people that liked that were ladies.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
It would be a logical fallacy

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
to say the ladies liked that.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Ladies like apostrophes.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Should we talk about how much louder

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
people cheered for Rob Schrab's entrance

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
than yours or mine or Spencer's or anybody's?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I told them to.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
By saying, I play into it.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
He's in my control.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Absolutely.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
He drives me here.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
He tells me what to think.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Best reason

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
to go to therapy.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
For no other reason.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Achieving mental health

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
is great.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
That's way up there on the list.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
But I came up with a new one.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Good reason to go to therapy.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
If you pay for therapy...

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Sorry, let me start over.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
If you're not

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
paying for therapy,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
you can't complain about how

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
crazy you are.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
If you are, you can.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So if I go,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
hey Rob, fuck you, piece of shit.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Aw man, that's terrible.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I know, right?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I'm gonna rip off.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
You think you got problems, you fucking turd?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm getting ripped off of therapy.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I can't believe I just said that to you.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Monster cock

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
noblin

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
jizzblasting

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
fuck nut

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
You just called him a cock noblin

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
jizzblasting fuck nut?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Yeah.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Am I in a good one?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Am I blasting jizz

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
while I'm noblin a cock?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Is that what it is?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
What are you spending your money on in the therapy session?

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I know, right?

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Can you explain to me what a cock nobler does?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Like, give me a day in the life

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
of a cock nobler.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
What's a cock noblest do?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
I know what a regular nobler is.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
No, I don't.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
But for the people who don't,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
explain.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Oh yeah, tell me

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
what just your work a day nobler does.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I'll connect the dots after that.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
What's a day in the life of a nobler?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I mean, I know what a jizzblaster does.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I think I got thrown

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
on the word nobbling.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
It's like the cobblers make shoes,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
coopers make barrels,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
a nobler makes doors.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Cougars make barrels.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Cooper Smith.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Cooper Smith.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Cooper makes barrels.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Cobblers make shoes,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
doopers make barrels.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Noblers make doors.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Okay, so he's a cock nobler.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Yeah.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
So he puts a door on your dick?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Fuck him.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Am I right?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Guilty as charged, Shab.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I cut my balls with a scissors today.

36:42.000 --> 36:52.000
What?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
I'm sorry, would you

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
please repeat that?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
No, I don't want to talk about it.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
No, okay.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So, uh...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Were you trimming your balls?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, I was doing some pubic maintenance

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
without my glasses.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Which was not a good idea.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
We're getting old, aren't we?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Yeah.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Well, the thing is,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
the thing is, is like,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I never had to, you know,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
really keep up, you know, with the Joneses.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But as you, you know,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I'm 46 and, you know,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I mean, it's interesting,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
like, you know, I mean,

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I've been bald since I was 19,

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
but, you know, everybody,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Jesus Christ!

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
The were-tricky!

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
The were-tricky was back!

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Holy shit!

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
There's a were-tricky out there.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Oh, my God!

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Okay, so...

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Yes, it was really tragic.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
It was hard.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It was sad.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Really, really painful to go through.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
So you won't walk us through

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
this tragedy here?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Well, I made an agreement with Kate,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
my lovely wife, that I would, you know,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
keep up, you know,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
appearances and...

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You know, I was...

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
When did you make that agreement?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
You left that part out.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Well, I...

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I don't know, just recently,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
everything just kind of went into overdrive.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Wait, wait,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
wait, recently,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
like, I have this to look forward to next year?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, you know, back.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
How does pubic hair go into overdrive?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
It just gets...

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
It's already more.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
He's a cock nobler that does a door.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
This is terrifying.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
When that door opens, more pubes come out.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Everything, just your arms, your shoulders,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
your back. Yeah, I got the check, check, check.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Well, you probably have as much as I

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
do right now, so you don't have to worry.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I think there's only one way to find out.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I think there's only one way to find out.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
All right.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Things started going

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
into overdrive so much

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
that there was a family meeting

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
about it. Well, yeah,

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Kate said, can you do me a favor?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
If I'm getting a wax,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
can you, you know, take care of...

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Previous, but I want to be clear on this,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
and let me know when I'm invading your privacy.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Oh, yeah, please.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Thank you, Dan. I appreciate that.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
But, like, this specifically, this wasn't

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
a matter of, we've been married this

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
long and together this long, and

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I'd like to now make this

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
new request just based on, like,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
like, all time, you know,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
why not? Let's make a change.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
This was really specifically, like,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
there's a new problem

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and here's a new solution.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I don't know if it was a...

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
You know what I'm asking, like, I want to know

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
about the timeline of, like, I want to know

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
what the plot point of this monster house is,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
like, like, what...

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
When did the kids run

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
across

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Never Crackers Long?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I was saying, like, God damn it,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
it was she, like, okay, she's your wife

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
and then you finish making love

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
and then she was like, ah, that was great

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and you're like, thanks, man!

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I was in a little box

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and she was like, well,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I'd love to hang out and chat

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
about your fucking day, but I got to go

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
go get some stuff

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and also

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I get it, Lego 2 is hard.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I'm going to go,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
oh, by the way, you know,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
one of the places I'm stopping by

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
is Brazilian Wax.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Here's the card.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
You might want to think about it

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and then, like, and you're like, wait,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
is this something that you've always

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
wanted?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And she said, no, this is something

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
that needs to be done as of three weeks ago.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
No, I don't...

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It wasn't something that was, like,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
retroactive.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
She didn't, like, say, like,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
yeah, I've been waiting

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
12 years to tell you this.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I think she just said,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
you know,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
it wasn't like an immediate thing.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It wasn't an embarrassed thing.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Maybe because

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
you have been more neglectful of that

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
or because your body has gone into

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
overdrive and you're producing more

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
shrubbery down there.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Maybe a bit of both.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Oh, well, if there's been previous,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
am I a bad person?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I've never done anything.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Yeah, yeah, you're a bad person.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I'm a bad person.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
No,

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
no, you're a saint.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
You're a saint

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
You don't trim your pubes.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That's how that math works.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Spencer's balls are so

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
glossy you can see yourself in them.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
His nuts

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
are like the top of the Chrysler building.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I shaved

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
my balls once when I was, like, 32.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Oh, that's painful.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
No, it was all right.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Oh, maybe I'm bad at it.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It was, like, a week later,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
that's when it sucked.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
It starts growing in.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
So, Spencer, I mean,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
you have, like, a giant, long head of hair.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I have a ponytail on my balls, yeah.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
But

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
is it braided?

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
No, it's too coarse.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Oh, don't

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
sell your pubes short.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I texted my girlfriend,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
do you want me to trim my pubic hair?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Don't just do it, just do it.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I was just asking because I just found out

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
that Spencer does.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And he only fucks invertebrates.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Wait, what?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Yeah, yeah.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Slugs, those are invertebrates, right?

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Mollux.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Mollux. You fuck a gastropod once in a while?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
A nautilus. You fucking nautilus?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Yeah, well, my dick goes like a corkscrew.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Oh, perfect.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Yeah.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Well, no, that was them.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
That was, like, a roller coaster.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
They were riding down his dick in their minds.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Whoa!

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
The Spencer dick.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Wow.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
300 miles per hour break,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
corkscrew speeds.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Oh, death defying spirals

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and loop-de-loops.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
You won't believe the vast efference of the

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
abadudumus.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
What the fuck?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
No response?

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
In response to your wife's

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
suggestion, did you get to work?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Oh, yeah.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I cut my balls with the scissors.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Okay.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I got too much to work.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I forgot.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I forgot with the lead-off of that story.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
So you stabbed yourself with scissors?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
No, it wasn't a stabbing.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
You got too close?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I was like, you know, you go,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
and then you get a little bit.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Shit, I gotta get going.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I mean,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
you stop

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
enough until,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I mean, like, but...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Yeah, it's just like a pinch.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It's a pinch, but there was blood in it.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Oh, there's blood.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
There will be blood.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Yeah.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
And then you do a stupid thing,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
well, I won't do that again.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Ah, fuck me.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
And then I just put the scissors down.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I have a team of young Korean boys

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
that come over while I'm sleeping.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I would love their email address.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
It's expensive,

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
but it's worth it.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Is this why my wife left me?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
No, it's because

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
she went away for eight weeks

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and you didn't wash your butthole.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Ah, I remember.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Yeah,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
you're not gonna wash your butthole,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
but you're,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
I better shave my pews.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I do wash my butthole.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
When's the last time?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Be honest.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
When was the last time? Be honest.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Sunday.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
That's today.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
A week ago?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I thought today was Tuesday when I said that, so do the math.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
It's Harmontown.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I know.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
How many times do you do it here on a Tuesday?

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Friday.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Friday I wash my butthole.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Thoroughly.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
That's all it takes.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
You didn't shit for two days probably, right?

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
I see where you're going with this.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I'm telling you, you can wash,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
you can bleach,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
you can just get it as clean

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
as possible.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
You can really get in there.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
It's really antibacterial,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
but if you shit right afterwards,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
it's gonna be dirty still.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
It's not gonna be clean.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Don't inject her mate.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I am your in-doctor mate.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Don't inject her to my office.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Howard Hughes,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
fucking shit that ended with you scalding your

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
asshole with hot water.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I am the other side of

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
the prism here.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I didn't.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I didn't.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You can go too far obviously.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
On Friday,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I took a shower

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
and yes, Saturday and Sunday,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
but seven in the morning call times till

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
seven.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Oh my god.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
This time,

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I'm the villain.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
You're actually too busy

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
to wash your own ass.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Has she replied?

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
My girlfriend's response was,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
why don't we should bring Andrew Weinberg out here?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Is there a guest?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Read the text!

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Let's get her responses.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Oh, cause you guys won't have any responses to this.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Andrew will be back there for

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
this first.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
This is a co-creator

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
of Eagle Heart, one of my favorite shows,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Adult Swim.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
It's on Adult Swim.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Sorry.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
He's also

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
the

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
beating heart. He's the Chris McKenna

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
of this history channel

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
thing I'm doing, The Great Minds.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Andrew Weinberg.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Hello, Andrew.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Hello.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I just wanted to get you out here before

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Andrew, you've come at a rather

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
propitious time. Right, right, right.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I don't know if you've been listening to us.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
I've heard of maintenance.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Yes, but

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
damned dodging right now. Come on, read.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Her response was,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Spencer, I love it.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Does Steve Levy?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Steve Levy, get out here and answer that question.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
The show is for the ladies.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
We might need to spin off podcasts

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
for about this.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Mount

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Hushmore.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Secrets from men.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
What's she asking?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Well, let me finish her catch.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
She asked me the most inappropriate questions.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Whoa, that's good.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
But you love it. I mean, she coaches you.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
What are you doing later?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Ha!

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
She said, ha! Not like that.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Spencer, I'm assuming she's okay with me

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
reading this. Ha!

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I love it. Does Steve Levy?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Jeff for sure does.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I think that's an educated guess,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
not research.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Mine's like a Zen garden.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
It's like, there's waves.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Nah!

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
You don't need to, for me,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
bean.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
It's never been an issue.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I mean, I would be fine either way.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
That means I'm supposed to.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
That's why you don't ask.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
We have an answer.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
All right. I laser my...

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Every six weeks, I don't fuck around, son.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
She's saying, laser, you're fucking...

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
She's saying, I'm carrying my weight.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I just said, you know what?

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I got caught tonight.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
I thought this was like a new thing,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and if you were off the market, then you didn't...

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
You know, I'm like Archie Bunker.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I don't like Bill Maher

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
with that much.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Do you, Steve?

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Steve?

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Actually, my answer is sort of unfortunate.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Uh-oh.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Yeah, I have to.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I have to shave completely.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Or what?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Because I have an autoimmune skin disorder,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
and it's really

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
fucking bad down there.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
So in order to apply the fucking

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
medication,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
you gotta be smooth.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
You gotta be smooth.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
What are the bravest things that's ever been said

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
on this stage?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
You said it's really fucking bad

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
down there.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
It sucks.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
That's why I take those fucking...

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
those pills that knock me out every week.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
I thought I was giving

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
those to you.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
So I think we have the full...

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
the full rainbow up here.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Well, we haven't heard from Weinberg.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
By the way, you don't have to participate.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Yes, you do.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I'm honestly not sure

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
precisely which area we're talking about.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
The balls.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Oh, you mean the area down there?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Yeah.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Well, I can't answer that because I haven't gone down there...

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Do you do some little

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
pubic, you know, gardening?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
No, I don't.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
You don't trim, not at all?

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
No.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I guess...

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I guess the answer to either

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
would have been no, but I didn't know

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
if you meant, like, butthole maintenance.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Oh.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Because that was, at one point,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
someone was talking about that.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Definitely him.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Rob, Rob, I don't want to

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
put words in his mouth, but Rob...

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Rob, I think it was in his

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
thirties,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
started realizing

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
that...

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You know where this is going.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I have no idea.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
You started realizing that you're, as you put it,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
you had an awakening...

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Oh, okay, yeah, now where you're going.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Yeah.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I think it was a little, it had to be

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
earlier than 30.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
It had to be earlier than 30.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
I just remember at a certain point you started becoming obsessed with how dirty your asshole was.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Yes.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
No, no, no, that was before we loved Milwaukee,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
so it was like 26.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
24, 26, yeah.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
It was crazy that people accept

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
that much shit in them

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and on them.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
If you got feces on your arm

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
and just took a piece of paper and were like,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
fine, I'm going about

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
my day now.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Wiping your ass is a private thing.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
You don't see it,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
in detail,

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
in movies, or they don't show you a cartoon

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
on Saturday

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
morning or anything,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
your parents just don't want to deal with it

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and it's just yours to find out.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
And if, you know,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
thank God I was in the improv comedy

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
scene back in

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
the 90s because

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I never would have found out.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I never would have found out

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
if I wouldn't have been constantly

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
showing my balls and ass

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
and dick to my friends.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I would have never have known

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
that

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
you're supposed to clean it and it made so much

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
sense.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Made so much sense, there was a click

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
that happened in my brain

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
that happened and now

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
beautiful.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
It's so...

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It's so good.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
It's so...

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
It's like...

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Surgeons,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
surgeons call up

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I wouldn't call myself a foodie, but

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
it's...

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
It's like the same thing.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I'm a foodie.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Yeah.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Very important to me.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
At what point

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Rob became Icarus and flew too close to the sun?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Yeah, for sure with his

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
butthole stuff because he scalded his

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
anus.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
A quest for cleanliness that turns

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
really into more

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
a higher level

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
of

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
what do you call it?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Scepticity? Is that a word?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Well no, it's just like

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
if grossness is your concern

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
nothing's grosser than breaching

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
the...

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Because the thing is

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
our alimentary canal technically is outside

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
our body.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
That shape the torus, it's like a donut.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
That's like

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
how multicellular organisms formed and that's

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
why then they turned into worms. I know I've been through this

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
on this podcast before, but it's like

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
the reason why worms,

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
that's the earliest kind of multicellular

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
thing and it's like what's happening

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
is it's like a donut that's extruded

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
that's still outside the body

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
stuff that goes in our mouth and eventually

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
comes out our butt. All it is is

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
rubbing up against the outside

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
of a collective of cells.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
The way that cells eat, they rub up against a thing

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
and so when you eat a donut, the donut

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
you're just sending it into the part of

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
your body that you rub up against the outside

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
world. So that's why

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
it's really dangerous when you...

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I was just imagining myself in a highway

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
stop for the last

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
30 seconds.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
You're like a guy walking by and listening to

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
my podcast. Or Mike, just while

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
you were going in that, I was like, I'm, he lost

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
me. I'm gonna fall over.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
But I say, like

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
that's why it's really dangerous like septic shock

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
and stuff. It's like when there's are perforated

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
you know, Crohn's disease, anything that involves

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
that barrier between

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
what's going on in that canal and what's going

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
on inside your body where there's blood. If you get

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
poop in your blood, so I'm saying

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
this guy brinches butt so much

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
you know, that's, that's, that's grosser than having

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
poop in your butt. I don't want to talk about it anymore.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Like

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Oh, Bean. What, what do

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
we, we've got a lot of

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
dudes up here. You know, what, what do the

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
women think? Let's

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
by applause a little bit of

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
trimming. What do you think? Anybody

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
buy a little bit of trimming? Are you

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
asking the women here if

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
guys should do that? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
You appreciate some trimming. Yeah.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
How about the whole thing?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
You know, like a 12-year-old

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
huh? Something

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
like that. I was saying earlier, like

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I don't really like Bill Maher that much, but there was one thing

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
that I'm sure one of his funnier writers wrote

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
like, like, about

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
about finding

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
shots fired. Finding a final

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Bill Maher's a cut.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Shots landed.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
War over.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
No, I, I

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
I just like him, but

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
that was

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
clarification.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Yeah.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Dan, you're a cut, but I love you.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
He said, like,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
like new rules or whatever, like, like

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
we find a fine line between completely

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
like shaving and not

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
at all. Like, there has to be some sort of

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
sweet spot between, like, prepubescent

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
and Dr. Livingston, I presume.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Which is a reference for people that are

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
old.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah, I, okay, well

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
what do I, what do I do?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Do I take a scissors?

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Yeah, you just take a scissors. You pull the ball

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
hair and then you cut it.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Why do you have to pull it?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Because it separates it from the scrotum. You don't

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
want to get up in there. Yeah.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
You make curls and stuff. It's not going to lie flat.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Dan, don't fall the way of

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
the Schrab. Put your glasses

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
on before you go.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
I'm your future, man. You don't want to do that.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
That, that, that is a,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
that's a, that, you don't want to

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
do that. Don't do it.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
No, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
woke now. I, I, I, because I

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
realized, you know, I used

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
that, like, like, like, you know, I don't know.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I guess I was, I was not thinking about

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
it. I wasn't really thinking about it objectively.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
No, no, no. And I am the beneficiary

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
of, of, of people thinking about that stuff

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
for themselves. Do you have opinions about

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
how much a woman's public

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
care should be? Like, do you like less women?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Well, it's one of those things. See, that's the thing. That's like, this is

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
where, you know, like, like, that's

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
this, like, like, male, this is a

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
patriarchy in action. Like, we don't have to think about it.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Like, that's, that's part

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
of the crime. Like, don't, don't, don't

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
get me started. You know,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
that's, I've drawn my own up to that. Like, you don't

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
have to, like, the society in which a guy

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
would have to, like,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
would request it. That's like,

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
that's, that's the, you know,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
oh, that would be, yeah, that would be

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
closer to equality than kind of like, like,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
like, I've never had to ask. I would say

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
if, if I were your girlfriend, I would say

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
start washing your butt more, then we'll get to the pubes.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I wash it, I wash it. I've never,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I've never, I've never been intimate

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
with, with a, with a,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
with a companion

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
without, without fully

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
cleaning my areas,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
except in, in occasions

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
of, of, you know,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
rapturous,

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
silliness, uh, perhaps, uh,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
you know, just, just wash your butt.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Yeah, man. Wash your butt.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I fucking do, bros. Wash your butt.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
You didn't do it, you didn't do it since Friday.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Get, get, dude,

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
I've been busy. Get a, get a bidet, man.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
7 a.m. get a boss.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
We're gonna get you a bidet. I got one.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I got one, I fucking love it.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
A separate, an actual separate.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
No, no, no, I got like, the most

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
total, total. One of the Jopin toilets.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Brundle swash, you know, you just

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
hook it up and then you just press the button

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and everything. Swashes your brundle.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
It's like, yeah.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
It's like. Oh, you're money back.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
It's like, how George

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Jetson takes a shit.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
It's like, you press

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
the button. I'm gonna get one that has a fan

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and it'll dry it off.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I'm gonna save paper.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I saw, I, I was in a, a, Joe

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
McHale, I had a hotel room in Las Vegas once

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
and I tried it and. How did you

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
find this out? What do you mean?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
What?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
He was doing

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
is that a. He's shoving it.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Yeah.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And I tried, I tried the bidet.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
It burnt my, burnt my butt.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
How hot was it? Did you set it at?

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I don't know. I didn't know you could set it

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
at a temperature. It's like, this is a whole

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
different. Well, you could get one that you could set the temperature.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Mine has three settings.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
It's

59:52.000 --> 59:53.100
speaking to George

59:53.100 --> 59:55.000
Jetson, she, she get a little

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
she get, she got that

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
she get something for your pews where

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
you're, you get a good one. Different hairstyles

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and all that. No I know. I'm getting,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
we're getting, we're getting, we're getting distant

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
from the three settings. I want to

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I'm like, what are they, it's not gonna be

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
through the three settings there. Warm,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
hot, and mevita

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
loka.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
You know?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's like ordering Thai food, you know?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
You know, it's like, you know, it's like, mild, spicy.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:25.960
Yes.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.280
Thank you for writing the scripts

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.280
and climbing aboard, Great Minds.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.520
I'm so busy and I don't know if anybody out there

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.860
has been watching it.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.480
Thank you, we just...

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.800
And thank you for being here

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.120
on a very special All Poop episode of Heart and Heart.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.440
Or no poop, no poop, poop, poop so bad.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.520
Yeah, it's poop.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.360
It's poop.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.520
Yeah, it's trying to get out of your body.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.280
Because it's healthy.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.480
If you'd been listening to my biological explanation,

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.680
you'd understand that it's a donut that's been turned

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.080
into poop by you rubbing against it like a cat.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.080
No, I wasn't listening.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.360
I wasn't.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.480
We are poop, by the way.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.840
We're the poop of stars.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.680
You're...

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.320
Don't subvert Carl Sagan's beautiful sentiments

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.200
to your own weird poopy agenda.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.280
I will, sir.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.600
When I please.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.200
Yeah, the donut shape, the toros.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.440
Yeah.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.600
Oh, is that what you...

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.040
Oh, you're getting me back on track.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:37.880
Yes.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.200
Here's the thing, Weinberg.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.360
Thank you for creating Eagle Heart.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.640
I love it very much.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.080
No, no, you can't do that now.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.080
Is it gone now?

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.280
Oh, yeah, long gone.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.800
You had your chance.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.600
I was willing to take a significant financial hit

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.560
to prove a point to you for not watching.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.440
I bothered because I was like,

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.160
okay, well, I don't know that much about you

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.120
except that you're a lifesaver on that show

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.720
because it needed somebody to be there to...

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.800
I heard, yes.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.640
To what's that?

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.560
Someone to be there.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.720
Yes, be there, period.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.240
Yes.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.600
But I was like, I'm gonna Wikipedia him.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.960
I don't wanna accidentally trigger him or anything.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.920
Like maybe he's a Quaker or...

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.280
I don't know.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.400
So, would you believe I'm not a Quaker?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.720
But I'm actually Jewish.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.360
You ever looked at your Wikipedia?

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.720
Weinberg sounds like a Quaker name.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.240
Yeah, I don't know who made, who makes?

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.720
I honestly did not make it.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.600
So, I'm honestly asking who makes.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.120
No, no, I don't think anybody would suspect you

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.400
of making your own these days.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.400
But you worked on Conan at both places.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.160
You crossed the Conan threshold with him to L.A.,

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:05.160
did Eagle Heart, and then this is this section

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.760
of your Wikipedia.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.000
There's a heading I've never even seen

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.320
that just says, Association.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.600
And I'm like, Association?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.440
What is that?

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.260
What is it gonna say?

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.600
Like, oh, he's been seen with Tommy Hilfiger

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.240
in the post Nazi era of Germany.

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.920
It says, Weinberg joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.480
at Cornell University, and through that organization,

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.560
the Irving Literary Society.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.480
What does that mean?

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.120
It's also ominous.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.280
Well, I don't know what the Irving Literary Society is,

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.440
but probably someone from my...

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.520
Apparently Wikipedia experts.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.160
Well then, but that makes me think

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.080
someone from the fraternity made this.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.760
But you went to Cornell?

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.600
Yes.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.440
That's where Carl Sagan went.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.320
Yes, and Steve's dead.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.160
No, shit.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.000
That's true.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And we had the same major.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.680
Which was what?

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.560
Industrial and labor relations.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.520
I L.R. school.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.360
Yeah.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.720
Which is dead, like...

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.120
What were his pubes like?

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.160
My therapist told me in my last session

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.320
that she's worried about Steve Levy.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.160
She should be.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.360
She's never spoken to him.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.440
I've never had a conversation with him.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.800
She based it on a voicemail, or a succession of voicemails.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.080
I only left one.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.640
He sounds tired.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.880
Are you working?

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.040
Are you guys busy?

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.840
Yeah, I guess.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.920
I think she made me think that I'm killing Steve.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.920
That's not important.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.560
But I...

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560
It's pretty important.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560
Steve?

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560
It's very important.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560
Steve?

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560
Yeah.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560
Is Dan killing him?

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.560
No.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560
I mean, we're just working real hard.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560
That's how you die.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.200
It's all based on what you tell her.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.960
He's not also giving his side of the story.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.600
No, but she was seriously just going like,

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.600
Oh, boy, he sounds like he's worn down.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600
That's what...

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600
I mean, it wasn't like about...

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.600
I was like, I don't go in there and tell stories about how hard it is to make Steve

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600
leave me miserable.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600
So I need therapy.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600
You don't make me miserable.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.600
We were...

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.840
Please don't kill me.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.960
We're working seven days a week.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960
Seven days.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
It'll be over soon, buddy.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960
I promise you.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960
No, it won't be over, Steve.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960
It'll be months.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960
This is the rest of your life.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960
Yeah, it's good.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960
I'm going to be working for him soon.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960
I'm trying to move.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960
He's saying that's what...

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960
It's not just me.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960
Spencer, too.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960
It's working real hard.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960
Yeah, we're working real hard.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960
It's working so hard.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960
It's working.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960
Team Harmon.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960
All right.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.720
Steve, as an example of your sacrifice, because I do feel it's such a sausage party up here,

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.280
and obviously what we need to talk about is the pubic hair and the buttholes and the

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280
balls.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.780
We have to.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:53.240
We need a woman up here or someone that presents us such...

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240
Cha-ching.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.520
And there's only so many chairs and microphones.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520
I get it.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:05.800
So could you go and pull the car around and give it just a light buff, like not a waxing.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800
You don't have to get waxed.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.440
It's 9-11.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.720
And then warm it up like five minutes before I come out.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:18.240
You know I would if you had a car.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.240
It's 9-11.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.240
All right.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.240
Steve Levy, everybody.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240
Steve Levy.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.760
What's that?

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.240
Steve, our thoughts and prayers go to your weird pubic situation.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:39.920
His GoFundMe is GoFundMe at Steve's pubes.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920
Right?

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920
Yes.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.840
He left it very cryptic, a lot to wonder about.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.840
Yeah.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.240
Well, that's part of his allure.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240
Yeah.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.920
Do you think I'm a good person, Andrew?

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920
No.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920
No.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
Oh, you were talking to him.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.240
I'm trying to get fresh eyes on something that you guys already have in mind.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240
Right, right, right.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.240
Yeah, we do.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.240
You've been working with me for a couple episodes.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240
Yeah.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240
Two-pan thing.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:13.240
I just feel like if I say yes, you're going to say see.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.240
I've been kind of mean to you a couple of times.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240
No.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240
Well, yeah, but...

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.240
Get used to it.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.240
Get used to it.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.240
Get used to it.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.240
Get used to it.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.240
Get used to it.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.240
Get used to it.

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.240
It gets worse.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.240
The closer you get, it gets worse the closer you are to him.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.240
The more you reach out, the more he'll hit you and difficulty you down.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.240
It gets worse.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240
Get worse.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240
Get worse.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.240
Have an exit plan.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.240
Have enough in the bank that you can leave and walk out at any time.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.240
Just have an exit plan. It gets worse. It gets worse.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.240
It gets worse! Worse!

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.240
It gets worse!

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:09.240
Not only do I need, I demand somebody put that to a beat and some music.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.240
I want that to be my ringtone, my alarm clock, everywhere.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.240
Well, I don't know that it could be put to a beat.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.240
That's why you need me. I always provided the rhythm.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.240
He was the lyrics and I was the beat.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.240
You are the sun, I am the moon.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.240
What were you going to say? Here's the thing, to get specific.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.240
I'm acting in this show. There has to be a script when I show up.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:46.240
Sometimes there's jokes. If I don't know how to do the thing,

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.240
I'll do this thing where I caught myself and realized what I was doing.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:55.240
I don't know how to deliver this line because I'm not really an actor.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.240
I get nervous and go, I don't know how to do this.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240
I'm doing this wrong and I can't remember it.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.240
Then I go, it must be poorly written, the line.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.240
That's when I'm questioning the line.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.240
Can we beat this?

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.240
I've experienced worse.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.240
He worked at Conan.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.240
I'm not talking about Conan himself.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240
He seems really nice.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.240
He's like a nice guy to work for.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.240
You've experienced worries in terms of writer on writer cruelty.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:37.240
Or like cruel overlord.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:44.240
That's not what I'm saying you are.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.240
When I started knowing what I thought I knew about you,

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.240
at some point he's going to explode at me over something.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.240
It never happened week after week.

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.240
One or two little things.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:10.240
I wish this thing exploded.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.240
It makes me sound like...

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.240
But not based on who you actually are.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.240
No, I'm talking about the legend of me.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.240
I'm fine with it circulating that I'm always hard to work for.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240
It's that one thing.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.240
That sounds like such a pretentious thing where you're throwing a water bottle

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240
and you're screaming about something.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240
I don't really do...

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.240
But I do something probably worse.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:43.240
I start manic obsessing and then I'm saying rude things.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:57.240
It's like because you have a...

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.240
I'm sorry about him by the way.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.240
It's like everybody goes like bring Rob back.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.240
Kids love Rob and it's like it hurts but I bring him back for them.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.240
And then he's doing worse things than I'm accused of doing.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.240
I feel like Andrew is giving you the same response that you got about should you shave your pubes.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.240
He's being very diplomatic like Cody was.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:25.240
He's saying like I'd be fine if you trimmed your personality.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.240
You don't have to because I'm a professional.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240
I don't fuck around.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240
I laser my...

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.240
I have been with people with more pubes than you but that person was a gorilla.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.240
Anyway is that what you...

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:50.240
Yeah so it was like kind of I was dropped into it and I was like okay now like edit this into something Dan's going to love and go.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:12:01.240
And then he's going to come in and have zero involvement for like five days and on the sixth day come in and judge it.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.240
But then I stay until it's perfect.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.240
Yeah and it's been fine.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.240
I'm sorry to disappoint your bloodthirsty audience.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240
No, no.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240
It's been fine.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240
It's been fine.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240
It's been fine.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240
It's been fine.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240
It's been okay.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.240
It's fine.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.240
No that aspect has been fine.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240
Fine.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.240
Overall it has been great.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.240
The enjoyment was fine.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.240
That's what I'm saying.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.240
Went to see a movie and walked out.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.240
It was fine.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.240
Hey how was that sex you had last night?

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.240
Did you enjoy it?

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.240
It was fine.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.240
I was not...

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.240
Clearly I was not talking about the overall experience.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.240
No I was.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.240
Andrew.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.240
Andrew you said quite enough.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.240
Mm-hmm.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.240
All right.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.240
I just want...

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.240
Here's the thing.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.240
He's currently texting how to fire Andrew.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.240
I was at least pushed into wherever I ended up right?

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.240
No I love you for being as honest as you are.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.240
My right foot fell asleep.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240
Oh jeez.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240
You gotta shave that.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.240
Gotta shave those pews bro.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.240
Come on.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:10.240
Come on Bilbo.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.240
Shave that foot.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.240
You gotta shave that foot man.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:19.240
Foot's got too much hair.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.240
Choking that foot off.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.240
Is there...

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.240
I feel like...

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:30.240
I just want to get anybody from the other side

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.240
because we are talking about a gender thing.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:39.240
Just want to get a lady type person up here.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.240
What woman wouldn't want to come up

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.240
and share in the rich conversation

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.240
of butthole culliness and pubes.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240
It'll just be a check-in

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.240
just because I don't want to feel...

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.240
I don't want to commit the crime of underrepresented...

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.240
Anybody want to come up and be representative?

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.240
We have a hand there.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.240
A point of view that you're willing to share

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.240
about the specific thing.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.240
Welcome to the Thunderdome.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.240
Come on up.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.240
There you go.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:07.240
Hello.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.240
What's your name young?

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.240
It's Kelly.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.240
Kelly.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.240
All right thank you.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240
Thank you for your bravery.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.240
We will not betray you or hurt you.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.240
What if you really pushed the limits on that?

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240
What if you were...

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.240
He said something and everyone was like,

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.240
ah fuck.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.240
He's a terrible person.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.240
So you're willing to share your thoughts

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.240
about the...

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.240
You need to shave.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.240
Okay.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.240
I mean, shave but as opposed to trim with the scissors.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240
I would get a trimmer.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.240
How big is your scissors?

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.240
How big are your scissors?

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.240
How big?

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.240
I was talking to him.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.240
He was doing this.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.240
Kelly, when you say shave,

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240
do you mean like get it like all gone?

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.240
No.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.240
Yeah, but like just maintain.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.240
Maintain.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240
Maintain the borders.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240
Trim.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.240
Maintain borders.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.240
No.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240
I mean give me a...

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.240
Repel borders lads.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.240
From outside eyes then so looking at the mail

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.240
like when the pants are coming off

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.240
to give me some guidelines about...

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.240
You know like I saw a queer eye for the straight guy once

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.240
and they said the sideburns,

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.240
like they had some rules about like where your ears are

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.240
and your sideburns should be.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.240
Do you have any rules about...

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.240
If I'm going to go down...

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.240
Your pubes are by your ears, man.

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.240
If I'm going to...

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.240
How do I know when I'm finished?

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.240
Like what's my goal?

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.240
Because I obsess about stuff.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.240
Well, I would get your girlfriend involved

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.240
and do a little trimming and then go...

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240
What do you think about this?

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.240
And then she could go a little off the top.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.240
Because it's really more for her comfort.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.240
Right.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240
Okay.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240
So she'll be the judge of that.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.240
Yeah.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.240
Well, but now...

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.240
Guys typically...

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.240
Why do you have to guess?

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:54.240
Can't you just ask her?

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240
No, of course I can.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.240
You guys are presidents of the High Road Club,

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.240
but now getting back,

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.240
since we have you up here,

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240
would you be willing to,

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240
I don't want to pry into you,

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240
but you knew why you're coming up.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.240
Can you tell us about your personal taste?

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.240
So just as a yard...

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Sure.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.240
Why'd you think you were coming up here?

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.240
No.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:18.240
I prefer it to be...

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.240
The shaft needs to be clear and free.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240
Clear and...

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240
Okay.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.240
That's what got me into trouble.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.240
That, because I can see that.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.240
Sorry, Kelly,

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.240
I thought I'd slow you down

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240
because it's like...

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.240
Every word is worth a thousand pictures here.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.240
The shaft needs to be free and clear.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.240
I could interpret that as a lot of different images.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240
She's saying,

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.240
get the hair off the shaft of your dick.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.240
Okay, even that though,

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.240
off of it meaning,

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.240
at the base of it,

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.240
I don't have hair on the shaft of my dick.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240
Are we talking about...

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.240
Well, then you're halfway home.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240
You're halfway home.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.240
That's fine.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240
When you look at my dick,

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.240
if I'm laying down and you look down at me naked

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.240
from a helicopter,

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.240
is there just a circle of baldness around the...

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.240
And then there's like a fryer,

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:20.240
like a fryer's haircut kind of thing going in a circle around.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.240
Like there's like a blast radius of...

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.240
The shaft needs to be free and clear.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.240
Do you mean at the base

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.240
or do you mean like the encroaching kind of like on the...

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.240
There shouldn't be hair on it, right?

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.240
There should be no hair on it.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240
Yeah.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.240
And where her lips might touch,

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240
keep that clear.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.240
Yeah, you don't want to get the hair in your teeth.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240
It's gross.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.240
I don't want somebody who is different from me freaking out,

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.240
but I didn't think these are places where there could be hair.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.240
Like it's touching and that affecting her.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.240
Do you have like a big 70s natural like bush down there?

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.240
Do you have like a big old satch?

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.240
I don't know.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.240
I mean, it sounds like this mail

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.240
or I get every year from the fire department

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.240
about brush clearance.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:21.240
But Kelly's gotten specific about tooth areas now.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.240
She's just getting started.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.240
She's working her way down.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.240
Well, I just want to take it slow.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.240
She's talking about that.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240
She's saying clear the shaft,

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.240
get any hairs off the shaft, right?

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.240
Yes.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240
Then...

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240
How could there be hairs on the shaft?

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.240
Sometimes hairs on the shaft just accept it.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.240
Jesus Christ.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.240
I know what you're talking about.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.240
I know what you're talking about.

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:47.240
You probably have hairs on the base of the shaft of your dick.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:48.240
I'll take a look.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.240
You might not.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.240
Give it a look, see.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.240
Everyone's different, Dan.

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.240
That might not be an issue for you.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.240
You might have a clear and free shaft already.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.240
Right.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.240
Well, what if this is an ugly duckling story?

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.240
What if I have a beautiful, perfect...

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.240
What if it turns out all you guys have, like,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.240
afros on the tip of your dicks?

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:11.240
You gotta get that shit off of there.

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240
I don't have that.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240
I have alopecia on my penis.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.240
Like, there's no...

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.240
You guys are like,

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.240
no, my dick looks like a 70s sportscaster.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.240
It's got a headset on the tip and like a toupee.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.240
I'm like, oh, well, see,

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:28.240
no wonder you guys thought I was weird for not doing anything.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.240
So, Kelly, let's keep moving along.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.240
So, shaft brain clear, then next stage, what?

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.240
Again, her preference,

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.240
because if she's doing stuff with your balls,

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.240
I would keep it trimmed down.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.240
Keep it classy.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.240
Have you named this imaginary third party

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.240
what she would like?

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.240
She's saying that...

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.240
Eve.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.240
The customer is always right.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240
Exactly.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.240
That goes without saying, and that's why...

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.240
I'm trying to actually liberate,

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.240
because I don't want her to have to be an ambassador of anything.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.240
I wanted to have representation up here,

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.240
but she shouldn't...

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.240
You know, what if she...

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.240
Then somebody's going to tweet at her,

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240
like, you got it, right?

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240
She's an individual.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.240
I just wanted to hear what her preferences are,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240
so we could just...

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.240
Because I know I'm going to go talk to my girlfriend,

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240
and I'll work it out with her,

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.240
but I'm just curious what we have you up here.

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240
What the terminology...

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240
How would...

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240
What...

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.240
Just mow the lawn, man.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.240
If you had a lawn and you lived in a nice neighborhood,

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.240
you would be like,

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.240
oh, shit, the grass is getting a little long.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240
I'm going to...

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.240
I feel like you guys are mad at me

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.240
for not knowing how to trim my dick hair.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.240
It's just a simple concept, is all.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240
It's a simple concept.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240
Yes.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.240
You make the hair shorter than it is.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.240
I love you, Spencer.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.240
With your glasses on.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.240
Preferably with glasses on.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.240
Yes.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.240
Probably with a magnifying mirror, too.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240
Yeah, it's helpful.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240
Be safe.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.240
Kelly, do you get the full nine,

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.240
like the Brazilian, the whole waxy,

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.240
the whole front-to-back wax thing?

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240
No.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.240
Have you ever tried it?

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240
No.

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240
Me?

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240
Me?

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.240
That would be amazing.

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
I was just like, I don't do shit.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240
Are you kidding me?

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240
Yes.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.240
They would carry you out on their shoulders.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.240
They'd be like, wow, I don't agree with her,

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.240
but that was amazing.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.240
Kelly looks like Leo Sayer down there.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.240
Oh, boy, no one got that reference.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.240
Google Leo Sayer,

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.240
and you'll be very happy about it.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:46.240
Do women, to what extent is outside help fundamental

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.240
to this whole thing?

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.240
And to what extent?

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.240
Do it yourself.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.240
Would you guys stop pissing and whining at me?

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.240
It's such a ridiculous thing

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.240
when someone is putting themselves down this low.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240
I know.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.240
You're saying, should you ask for outside assistance,

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.240
or should you do it yourself?

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.240
No, I'm asking a question about a curiosity

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240
to the women's side of the fence,

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.240
because I've heard the things about like,

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240
oh, I'm going to get lasered,

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240
I'm going to do these things,

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.240
and I'm curious about the amount of maintenance

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.240
that we currently consider to be fundamental,

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.240
like or default, whatever you would call it,

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.240
like kind of like a cultural average or whatever.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.240
How much of that involves third parties

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.240
for women and how much for men?

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.240
Because when you're thinking about your maintenance,

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.240
it's never occurred to you to pay someone to do it.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240
You're thinking about things you do yourself.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240
Right, well, yeah.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.240
But it's very possible that a woman

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.240
goes somewhere and pays someone to do that for her.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.240
You're seeing what I'm seeing.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.240
I think so.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240
Don't you think that's an interesting thing?

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.240
There's no indication of that from the audience.

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.240
Well, maybe they're leaning in.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.240
They're like, wait a minute.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.240
I don't know.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.240
And who knows that that might be like,

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.240
oh, yeah, because that's how we like it.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.240
And we were in control.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.240
But it's also like, do men go to places

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.240
and get it done like a lot?

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.240
Yeah, you can.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.240
Don't use Nair.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240
Yes, that is true.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240
Don't use Nair.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.240
That's not for down there.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.240
Do you have a bad experience with Nair?

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.240
I did.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.240
What happened?

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.240
It burned like a mother mother.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.240
Because Nair is like acid that goes down into your follicles

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.240
and burns out the root, right?

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:36.240
And for some reason, your penis is more sensitive to acid

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.240
than your shoulders.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.240
Where are you supposed to use Nair?

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240
I've talked to women, some of them I've dated

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240
and some of them I've just friends that we've talked about this before.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.240
And they're feeling as like guys sometimes demand

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.240
that they want the woman to be Brazilian waxed

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.240
like all the way across the board.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.240
And I think it's fair for the woman to say,

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.240
then you fucking do it too.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.240
Like you go in there and have somebody put some hot ass wax on your balls

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.240
and some stranger rip it off you.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.240
And there's a chick that she goes to a place,

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.240
I said, do guys go in and do it?

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.240
She said, yeah, but it has to be a referral.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.240
Because you can't just go in like, hey, I want you to do it.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:16.240
I'm just a regular person coming in here,

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.240
paying customer.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.240
I think there's guys that love to go in there

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.240
and it's like a cheap diamond atrix basically.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:27.240
And to them that's important, like the intent?

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:31.240
No, no, no, there's a million ways to be turned on by weird things.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.240
They don't want...

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.240
No, no, the woman that run these...

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.240
Oh, because he'd have an erection and he'd be an assault.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.240
We do this because we're doing a service.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.240
You're just here to use this as a sex operation.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.240
You could have that rule about anything.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.240
It's like a gas station.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.240
If you're one of these people that gets hard on when you pump gas,

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.240
take it down the fucking road.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.240
We'd like you to refill your car here.

01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.240
But you don't make the guy at the 76 station look at your dick.

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.240
No, I'm agreeing with you and saying,

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.240
yeah, that's an understandable rule at all businesses,

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.240
especially places that do go near your wiener.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:16.240
Okay, well, Kelly, do you have any books to plug or anything?

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.240
No, I'm just...

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.240
This is actually the first day of our honeymoon.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:26.240
Oh.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.240
What's your husband's name?

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.240
Trey.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240
Trey?

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.240
What are his pubes like?

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240
Short.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.240
Short?

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.240
Do you assist or is he taking care of business on his own?

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240
He does it himself.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.240
At a boy.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240
At a boy.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.240
Are you guys...

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.240
Is it a delayed honeymoon or do you guys really just get married?

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240
No, it's a delayed honeymoon.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240
When did you get married?

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.240
Three years ago.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.240
But this is a sad reality.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.240
I went to work the day after I was married.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.240
We did.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.240
It was like, yeah, well, honeymoon and Christmas,

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.240
and you guys had to wait three years.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.240
We're going to Japan, so we had to save up.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.240
So fuck you.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.240
You guys came to LA as a waypoint, as a layover?

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.240
Yep, we got here at 5.30, and this was our first stop.

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.240
Did you plan that?

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240
Layover and then fly out here?

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240
Yeah.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.240
Wow, that's kudos to...

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.240
I couldn't manage that kind of schedule.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.240
That's it.

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.240
Oh yeah, we'll schedule and then we'll pop over to the show.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.240
That's crazy.

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:40.240
That's the kind of crazy that makes someone's nether regions totally sculpted and consumable

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.240
by the public.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:51.240
I'm just a savage, feral, shambling mound of...

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.240
Consumable?

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.240
I mean...

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.240
I know you meant visually, even.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.240
Yeah, no, I mean, like, you consume a season of House of Cards, like, you don't eat it.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.240
It's probably an unfortunate way to refer to it.

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240
I can't really win tonight.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.240
Except in one sense, which is that I was willing to occupy that position and in such...

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240
In such...

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.240
Shut up, you drunk fat idiot.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:25.240
Well, Kelly, thank you so much for being brave enough to share your private life with us

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.240
and congratulations to your husband.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.240
Thank you very much.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.240
Thank you.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240
I gotta go.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.240
Oh, he's gotta go.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.240
I gotta go.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240
Rob's...

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.240
Well, you gotta go, Rob.

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.240
I'm gonna go see Kate's show at the Pac Theater.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.240
Oh, nice.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240
Let's all go.

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.240
All right.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240
I bet they would.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240
I bet they'd follow you.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.240
You've taken over my show.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240
I'm not taking over.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.240
I wonder how many people would go if Rob just, like, tried to pipe pipe or some of this crowd.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240
I can't do a pipe-piper with noise.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.240
But, uh, but, hey man...

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240
Thank you, Rob Schrab.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.240
Rob Schrab, everybody.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:14.240
All the friendship be forgot the guest that we all love

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.240
In the arms of Schrab

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.240
In the arms of Schrab

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.240
In the arms of Schrab

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.240
It gets worse, it gets worse, it gets worse

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.240
Well, Internet...

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.240
You'll be letting me down if you don't put that shit together.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240
I want mashups.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240
I want music videos.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240
I want the whole thing.

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.240
Well, I bet you guys thought you saw me stumble into a strange type of snitch.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.240
Goddamnit.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.240
Dan, Dan, we're gonna take it again.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240
We'll take it again.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.240
Okay, guys, go to the silence.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240
Applauds on three.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240
One, two, three.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240
Applauds.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.400
Well, I bet you guys saw a haaaaaa...

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.620
We'll take it again.

01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:10.520
Well, I bet you guys thought you saw me stumble into a weird sniper's nest of random conversation

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.600
about my pubic hair.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.600
But it...

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:20.320
Which is also what we call your pubic hair, a sniper's nest.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.720
This is low hanging fruit.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.920
That's also what we call it.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:36.480
He's getting old ladies, he's getting old.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.880
But the truth is, I teed it all up, because it's all been a part of my master plan, because

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:48.520
I've got an ace up my sleeve, podcast wise, an expert on pubic management, Mr. DeMorge

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:58.520
Brown is here.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:05.240
Yes you are sir.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.240
Hello.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.160
And how are you?

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.440
I know I keep sexually harassing you every time you come at us.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:27.520
I think we're roughly the same age, because you're hitting this sexy whaler thing.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.320
The high rolled turtleneck and the patches, you're like a hot collegiate kind of thing

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320
going on.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320
Is it racist?

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.240
I want to take Polly Sy for me.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240
It's the Black Hemingway.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.240
Black Hemingway!

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.240
Black Hemingway!

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.000
Who is the Black, is there a Black Hemingway?

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Who is the Black Hemingway?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Do we have him?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
It's just you.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Flavor Flav, I think.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Flavor Flav?

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Yeah.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Black Whalers Sport.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Sorry.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
You just, if you want to take it.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.240
I'm just saying, just go to the Florida Keys, I'm sure you'll find somebody.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:07.000
Some guy who made a fortune in publishing, the Johnson publishing industry, Ebony Magazine,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.800
and he's down in the Florida Keys right now and he's just fishing off his millions.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:18.920
Jim Orange, tell us about your fubicare and the policies about it you have and what you

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.280
demand in others.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.560
Or you can say pass and we'll just move on.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:31.680
Well since I'm wearing this sweater I suppose I have to be frank.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.240
I take care of my business.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240
Alright.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.440
I manage it, yeah, of course, absolutely.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.400
No outside help though, no clinics.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.800
You manage it with?

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800
Shears.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800
Shears.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800
Finger shears.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800
The small scissors.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800
You cut it with scissors.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800
Scissors.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.800
And a razor.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800
But you know, I'm a runner.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.800
When you call scissors shears, really, by default?

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800
I was just fucking around.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800
Oh, okay.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.800
Shears are shears.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.000
You know, they have their own purpose and avenue in life.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.520
I am a runner and I run long distances when I'm really in a swing and so I have to because

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.680
there's a friction of it over time, like over the course of two or three weeks it just consists

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680
of running.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.320
It's just too much abrasion, friction, whatever.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320
That's it.

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.720
So I have to, and it's...

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.920
You know, we've had breast cancer survivors up here, but I'm really proud of us tonight.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:30.000
I think we're very brave because men, you need to check yourselves.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.760
Yeah, so okay, I'm afraid I'm going to, I keep getting these, I keep asking questions

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.960
like, just cut your pubic hair.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:44.320
I feel like I'm being bullied a little bit, but I'll put a pin in it because I'm going

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.320
to keep asking.

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.600
I think the very first thing Kelly said, I think is the most, like to the point, she

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.520
said, like, talk to the person that you're with, like ask your girlfriend.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520
Yeah, of course.

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520
Yeah, fine.

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520
No, I can't.

01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.800
Yeah, but what am I supposed to do?

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.800
Talk?

01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800
I can't.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.800
Or...

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.320
Do a will-I-am hologram of my girlfriend ago.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.320
Yeah.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.320
Mordegard, conjure her up.

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.320
Wait, what was I going to ask?

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.800
I was going to ask something, god damn it, fuck, shit, shit, such a fuck-up.

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.800
Or you just take the first step.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:22.800
You were talking about how brave we were being compared to women who survived cancer.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.000
Oh, well, how often?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
What are we talking about?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.360
Because like, I mean, you know, my fingernails, like, I'll be like, come on, again, with

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.360
you?

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.480
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.920
We don't need them to scratch and claw our way to survival anymore.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.320
I just wish you could just take a pill.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.320
I've said this before.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320
Yeah.

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320
They've got to make a pill, make her fingernails stop growing.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.920
We don't need them no more.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920
Yep.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.920
You should do if you drop a key.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.480
Or a coin or a credit card, you got to use your fingernails, you know, to use your fingernails

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480
for picking up shit.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.760
I ain't using no fingernail for that.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.760
They've got to make keys better.

01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.840
Put a little handle on them.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:33:59.840
We're primates.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.040
But the people that make the handles that go on keys are going to need fingernails to

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.960
create the tools and the molds necessary.

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.560
Are you son of a bitch?

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.320
Are you going to be so elitist that you want to create a superclass of people that don't

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:19.200
need fingernails and let the underclass have to have long fingernails to make your weird

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.560
key handles?

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.560
Yeah.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.600
You know, people wear glasses, we didn't just start killing people that couldn't see.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.840
We evolved our culture.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:36.720
Rob didn't wear his, he almost cut his dick off.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.720
Connective tissue.

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:42.640
Wait, what was I going to, god damn it, harm you?

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640
Cancer.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.640
Cancer.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.640
No, no, no.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.640
What?

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.640
You're like a saboteur.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.560
He wasn't talking about cancer.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.560
Fingernails.

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.560
Fingernail growth, pill.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.560
Fingernails growth, yeah.

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.560
Could there be a thing?

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.560
How often?

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560
How often?

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.960
Yeah, not that it would mean anything to me, but it was like, yeah, what is it, monthly,

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.960
weekly?

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.960
Probably once every couple months.

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:03.960
Oh, really?

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.920
It depends on how fast it grows, but I don't think it grows super fast or anything.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:08.920
Oh.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.920
Yeah.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.160
It's not like a daily routine.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:19.200
You heard my lover say, every seven days she goes to a sci-fi, like, laser clinic.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.400
Laser, that sounds dangerous.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.400
Does it grow?

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.400
Dangerous.

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.400
Like arm hair doesn't grow.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:32.240
I first moved here, one of my first famous sightings was SEAL, also known as SEAL Henry

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.240
SEAL.

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:39.560
And I told a bunch of people this, and one of my friends who was new, wait, what if the

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.400
story had nothing to do with pubic hair at all, and it's just like, Timur is just having

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.400
a stroke?

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.880
He just becomes the Floyd the Barber of our show.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880
Look it up, that's a reference.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.400
All right, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400
Leo Sayer, Floyd the Barber.

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.400
It's just Scottish with an afro, right?

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.400
Yeah.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.400
And no teeth.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.720
One of the friends I had from the Groundlings, I was telling him this story because I didn't

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.240
have many L.A. stories, so I was just saying, I just saw SEAL.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:11.280
He said, my friend or my roommate, I can't remember, works in a spa or salon, and SEAL

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.480
comes in and gets the full body wax, the entire body, like his whole body.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.560
He doesn't want any hair on his body.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.080
And she said it was once a week, I think.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.520
I would imagine, for me it would be.

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.520
He would have been in that area because that's where the spa was or something.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.920
That seems like an all or nothing thing, if you have any hair at all, it's no good.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920
That was for his place.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.800
I'm not saying I'm not willing to change, I mean, I'm just saying, when I look at my

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.560
body in the mirror, I'm like, holy fuck, man.

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560
Where would I start?

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.080
How would I know when I'm finished?

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.920
I can see how I don't look like guys on TV, you know, and I don't know if they're like

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.840
born different or if they do stuff, but I'm like, where would I fucking start, man?

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.120
I guess, you know what, I'd start on my shoulders, because I'm like, well, that's definitely

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.400
not what a cop looks like when he takes his shirt off, if he's going to fight terrorists.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.920
And I'm like, yeah, man, and I would do that for a while, I would like, I'd try to make

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:12.640
like a selfie stick for my, but then it was like, like, you go down and it's like, then

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.920
you look in the mirror and it's like, oh, it looks like you took a paintbrush with skin

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.400
on it and painted over a hair wall.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:24.400
I was like, where, how do I, I can't, short of bringing another horrified victim into

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.560
this process, what am I supposed to do?

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.880
I'm like, literally, I would like, I would like try to like, mew, mew.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.240
I don't, I don't, like, don't do that, like, if you get, that's, that's a slippery slide.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240
So don't do that.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.000
I look like Dan Hadea when I take my clothes off.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
I mean, I like, like, like, that's gotta be, I mean, like, I understand, oh, where she

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.360
puts her lips and what everything, but what, how about where she puts her eyes?

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.360
Jesus Christ.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.680
How about where she puts her integrity?

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.680
I'm like, she must put it somewhere safe.

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.240
I like, I think they're just better people, these ladies.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.040
I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to make sweeping generalizations about

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.000
like, they're not visually stimulated, but something is just stopping my girlfriend

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.720
from, from, from, from making decisions based on the reality.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.960
So she somehow was able to live in some never ending story or something where like, I look

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:20.000
like a hot dog or a Spider-Man or just a, just a, just a, just a memory for her childhood

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
maybe.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.040
It's like a big wad of cotton candy or a dove.

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.440
It's not, it's not about being, going through a full metamorphosis, it's about just a little

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.840
bit of, a little bit of groundskeeping.

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:41.320
Just, I mean, here's the thing, so like, like, so imagine, so I take off my shirt, so what

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.000
you're going to see, you guys have seen it, you know, Ron Jeremy territory, it's like

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.120
I'm wearing a black, hairy shirt.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.800
And then I'm like, and it doesn't stop at my waist because it, it doesn't know that

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:59.840
it's a black, hairy shirt, it keeps going down my thighs and everywhere.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.320
It's, for some reason, maybe because I wore socks for too long when I was a kid, but it

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.120
stops right at my ankles in a reverse hobbit thing.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.600
So I have these beautiful, supple, baby smooth, hairless feet.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.600
Do you know what a reverse hobbit is?

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.000
$20, same as in town.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.880
A reverse hobbit is a difficult situation which is, which regrets.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:33.440
So also, I'm just, I'm not saying I'm not going to do it, I'm not arguing about, I've

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.280
inspired tonight, I'm going to put steps, I'm going to have Steve schedule me a time

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280
to-

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.280
Leave Steve out of it!

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.280
Look, if he doesn't-

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.720
You're killing me, your therapist is already worried about it.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.160
But I'm just picturing this moment when I'm standing at the foot of the bed, and I'm like,

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:54.880
head to toe in this greasy, ursine fucking hair, I was like, like, like, like, and then

01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.760
just like, right at my crotch, this is, this is like, oh, Tom Cruise is here, and it's

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:07.320
just like, it's not, there's nothing for some hill down there anyway, it's like the Hollywood

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:10.320
sign where it's like, we're going to get rid of this litter and it'll be Hollywood, it's

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.080
like, there's no sign, you know?

01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:17.760
It's going to pop, man, it's going to be great, it's going to pop, it's going to draw the

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:20.800
eye right to it, you know?

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.400
No, it's not going to pop.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.320
No, I get scared, I thought you knew something, I didn't-

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.840
That's what you want, it's going to pop, baby, it's going to pop.

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.320
It's going to leap off the screen.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320
Yeah.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.920
Especially just during the on-grain on Tally for a second.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.680
Once you pop, you can't stop, sorry, I cut somebody off who was talking.

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.040
It's going to want to make you reach in, grab it.

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.440
All right, well, I mean, you know, look, it was uncontrollable, the show just became

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.440
about that.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.440
No, the show-

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.360
We were happier then when I was talking about Harvey Fierstein talking about Trump, like,

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:03.280
I mean, Dick Hare is warm, but that's our domain.

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.200
I was thinking that the word ur sign actually entered my head earlier today.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.880
When you were looking at me.

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:20.280
No, there was a bear doctor drawn on the wall of where we last shot, you were there.

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.280
That was a chair moving.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.280
There's no way that was a fart.

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.400
If it were a fart, then show's over.

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.520
Well, whose chair was it?

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.520
It was someone in the audience.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.360
Whose chair has that many mics on it?

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.240
I'm so sorry.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.280
You were using like a colloquialism.

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.080
There was a sound that was like, oh, and Jeff went.

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.400
So anyway, I'm sorry.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.120
There was a bear.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.840
When we walked to where we shot the last shot today, there was like a pharmacy and it had

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.000
a cartoon bear doctor on the wall.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.840
And for some reason the word ur sign entered my head and you just said it.

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:12.920
You look like you were accepting anything.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.200
That is a weird word to think of twice in a day.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.480
Yeah, when he said it.

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.200
Is there a word for when you, like the word, like you think of a word and then you start

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.200
hearing it all the time?

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.200
I do that all the time.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.000
Like read it and hear it at the same time.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Yeah.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.400
Like, oh, I haven't thought of the word, like porcine or whatever.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400
Yeah.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.000
Yeah, I read it and see it everywhere.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Yeah.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.240
Oh, I thought you meant when you hear it and read it at the same time.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.960
No, no, no, but like a word that you think, oh, it's a word.

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.960
I keep hearing that word.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.960
No, you always did.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.160
That's kind of confirmation bias on the level, isn't it?

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.160
Oh, damn.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:51.120
I mean, I don't think, I don't think so.

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120
Yeah.

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.880
It's just, you're just now noticing it.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.360
It's now on your radar.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.840
You've heard that mathematically the exact same amount of time as probably.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.840
Yeah.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.600
It's related in the Uber to here.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.560
For some reason thought of Weird Al Yankovic and right after that, the Eye of the Tiger

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:15.760
came on the radio and I could only hear the Weird Al, Rai or the Kaiser version of it.

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:16.920
I've never heard that one.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920
Rai or the Kaiser?

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.920
Yeah.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.920
It's on in 3D.

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.720
The ballad of a theme to Rocky 12 or something.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.720
So he's, he's, he's ordering a sandwich and he's like, what a deli man.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.560
You want the Rai or the Kaiser?

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.160
It's a Rubin tonight, we're going to put some sauerkraut and that's weird.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.960
Weird Al Yankovic is the Chuck Yeager of parody in that he broke the parody barrier by which

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:45.840
you can't tell if someone reads you a title of a song, whether it's a Weird Al Yankovic

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.960
song or a parody of a Weird Al Yankovic parody, like, like, like, how would you like write

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.920
a joke where you're like, oh, Weird Al Yankovic did this song?

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.840
It's like, how would you tell the joke from reality?

01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.660
It's like, well, you take a popular song and you turn it, make it about food and by any

01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.160
means necessary.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.160
That's what he really does.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.680
Were you thinking I was making that up?

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:12.200
No, no, I was just, I was marveling that if you had made it up, I wouldn't have been

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200
able to tell.

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.240
I can't believe there's a song called Rai, this, I don't only have a strong opinion.

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:23.240
Our friend Dino hates, hates Weird Al, like, really, really, truly hates him.

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.240
I don't have a strong opinion.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.120
I've met him once or twice, he's a lovely, lovely fellow, he's a good dude.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.160
But like, I don't, like, I don't, like, go out of my way to hear his stuff, but why

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.160
are the Kaiser?

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.160
I kind of like that one.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160
It's good.

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.160
It's one of the...

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.160
Do you know Alan Sherman?

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.160
Sure.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.160
Yeah.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.160
Like, he's, like, those are funny.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160
That's easy originally.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.560
Now, funny, I mean, I brought it up so it doesn't really count, but in the show today,

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:50.680
I was singing, you know, A Taste of Honey, he has one called A Waste of Money, and it's

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680
really funny.

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:57.360
Do we have, like, an instrumental track that's good enough, not a rap beat, but, like, just

01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.880
anything where, Jeff, I'll sing a song, like, a straight up the middle one, and then you

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.880
do the parody of it.

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:08.080
Wait, why do I have to do all the hard work?

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:16.600
Okay, let me see if I have something instrumental.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:25.400
This is real improv.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:28.120
Yeah.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.120
My song's the straight line.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.400
And I had to do the weird out version of it.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:36.320
You are my sweetie.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.680
You are the sweetest thing I've ever seen today.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.920
You are my sweetie.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.720
And you are the best thing in the world.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.920
I love my sweetie girl.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.960
All right, all right, I got it, I got it.

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.640
I weird alify that.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640
Yeah.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.640
All right.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:14.320
There you go.

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.720
I love big ziti.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.000
It's my favorite pasta in the world.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.400
It's a thick tubular pasta.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.400
You can put sauce.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.600
I love big ziti.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.080
It's a great side dish with some meat or maybe some fish.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.600
Also, a squeeze of your titty.

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.120
All right, now, I'm going to do one.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.280
I'm going to do one.

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.280
Clearly.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:51.200
You guys are applauding inverse show ending dynamics.

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:57.760
Yeah, tip that Hindenburg's nose cone toward the ground.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:03.320
I don't want to thrust it upon you, but let's keep it going.

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.920
Let's pass the button out.

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:07.800
Demorige, you straight line this one.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.320
Andrew, you weird alify.

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.920
No, no, no, I didn't sign up for anything like that.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.280
If you don't have it, you're allowed to say pass and one of us.

01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:23.080
Whatever the procedure is, that's what I'm doing.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.080
All right, Demorige, you can sing a straight song.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:35.560
That might actually be a real song.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:41.960
I like to go outside and look at the sun and look at the stars.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.440
That means I go out in the day and the night.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.120
I'm never inside.

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:50.000
I'm a monster man.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.240
That's a good song.

01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.240
Wait, no.

01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.080
Can I change the rules?

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.240
I want to know more second act of monster man.

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:15.800
What we know about him so far is he goes out in the daytime and the night time, which

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.040
we have every right to do.

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:26.000
He has a different relationship with the moon and the sun.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
He's a monster man.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.400
That was one of the most amazing fucking things I've ever.

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.320
I was just hitting the turtle in the head.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.480
Gary Newman song, it was really good.

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.640
There wasn't a single fumfer, but it was when you look at the lyrics, you're like, what

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.640
the fuck?

01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:50.360
I like to go out and look at the sun and look at the sun and look at the day and the night.

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.360
I also am a monster man.

01:48:52.360 --> 01:49:00.200
You know what I'm going to call myself a monster man?

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:07.640
The greatest hits of Frank Sinatra, Junior Junior.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.440
That song doesn't deserve to be paradise.

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.920
That's too good on its own.

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.120
It's a very casual confessional.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:21.760
I mean, I got so many questions about monster man, it seemed like he just, he knows what

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.760
he likes.

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:27.600
He likes walks in the daytime and the night time.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600
This is hubris, but let me try it.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.600
I'm convinced that I can do it.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.800
I'm going to give it the same track because I'm limited here.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.640
Well, yeah, that's I'm doing his parody.

01:49:40.640 --> 01:50:08.400
I like to go with the bun and when I see the cars, I go by, I'm a lobster can.

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:15.400
The larger juggers that I thought I could do it, I thought it would just happen.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.400
And I got greedy.

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.080
I was off the hook and I was like, well, come on, in all due respect, I'd like to give

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.080
that a shot.

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.080
They were going to move on.

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.080
And I was like, come on.

01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.080
I was like, you forgot something.

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.080
So you had, you thought of lobster can only.

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.080
No, I didn't.

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.080
I swear.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.080
No, I did not.

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.080
I did not.

01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.080
That's not fair.

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.080
Made a second.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.080
Two verses of gibberish.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.080
How did you get it?

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:42.360
I thought you were having a lobster can.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:45.240
I'll tell you, I will show my work.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.760
I'll tell you exactly what I thought when the pressure was on and I was listening to

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.240
Demorge before everything gave way to holy shit.

01:50:51.240 --> 01:51:00.320
This is a toe tapper and we have a new Harry Connick Jr. emerging.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:05.680
I was like, uh, I thought I was like, well, he said, I like to go in the sun and I was

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:09.840
like, well, that should be a bun because that's edible.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:15.720
And then I, and then, and then I, I did, I was like the enigma machine.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:22.480
You guys won't they say Hyal Hitler and all the messages to do it.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:25.960
Translates everything into food for a weird album.

01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:31.240
I thought, I thought, I thought bun and I thought can, I didn't know how to connect

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.240
him.

01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240
Lobster came to me.

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.240
That's good.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.680
Like fucking Joan of Arc style and that's actually probably went through me.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.680
Dance, dance shit.

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:41.680
Lobster.

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.680
Dan from the top.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680
From the top.

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680
I want to hear the song.

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.680
Lobster can.

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.680
Now you have a, you had a moment.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680
Are you ready?

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.680
Okay.

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680
Well, no.

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:56.360
Hey, everybody out there, it's champagne time.

01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:01.280
Grab your dance partner and we're doing something called the style dance.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:07.760
I like to go in the bun and when I don't have the fun, I like to go in the car.

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:13.280
I have so many things to eat, but I don't know what to do with my lobster can.

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:20.360
A lobster can, it's a can, pull a lobster as fast as you can.

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:27.200
Why would you eat a lobster if it was so unfresh and had to come in a can?

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:33.600
I want to go with the park and when it's after dark, I see the elephant man.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:40.160
I go and tug on his trunk and when I'm drunk, I need a lobster can.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:45.760
Oh, seafood, salty as can be, I want to definitely off, this is not matching the thing.

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.760
It's perfect.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760
It was fantastic.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:51.920
But it's not, it wasn't a parody.

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.480
Spencer, you want to give it a world?

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.720
You want to be straight man or punch line man?

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:58.720
I don't know.

01:52:58.720 --> 01:52:59.720
Whatever you want.

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.720
I'll do whatever anyone wants me to do.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:02.720
What do you think, Harmon?

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:07.120
Where has Spencer best served to be the one that sets it up for somebody or the one that

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.120
brings it home?

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.920
I think he, honestly.

01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:15.200
I think because you're a logician, you know, you're a, you're a, let's give him a straight

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:16.200
one.

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:17.200
Andrew?

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.200
What?

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:19.200
I'm still out.

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.920
No, you're terrified right now.

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:23.360
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.920
Let's, Jeff, come on, Jeff, come on.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.160
You, Spencer does the straight line.

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.160
I just realized, you look like kind of like sexy young Bogdanovich.

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:32.160
You ever get that?

01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.160
Jeff, that's awful.

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:34.160
That's awful.

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:35.160
No.

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:36.160
That's not true.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.160
I said sexy and young.

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.160
That's not true.

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:40.160
No, no, no, no.

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:45.880
You look like a sexy young, you already use elephant man.

01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.560
He's a lobster king.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:54.280
That's exactly, like fucking, there never was a sexy young Peter Bogdanovich.

01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:55.680
There is now, it's you.

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.680
What?

01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.920
I mean that as a comedy.

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.520
I'm saying you're attractive gentleman.

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:02.320
More attractive than the current Peter Bogdanovich.

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:07.720
No, I'm saying sexy young pre last picture show, you know, Cybill Shepherd fucking.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:12.520

He had the big and still the cravat always always do with the cravat. Yeah. Yeah, I know he's a terrible person

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:23.000
I'm not saying you're like him. He married Dorothy Stratton's sister

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:30.820
After she was murdered. Have you seen star 80? Oh shit? Really? Yeah. No. Wow. Mm-hmm. Okay, so he's okay

01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:35.320
I just wanted to besmirch Peter Bogdanovich. That was my one goal for tonight

01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:43.600
No, he famous. I mean that's Laura's that he you know, it's like his his his I don't want to spread it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, his wife. I wasn't gonna like flank him and attack him from all

01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:31.740
Your story is more. I don't know. I don't know which one's more incredible. That's all I only have one

01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:34.380
Peter Bogdanovich, if you're out there, we'd love to have you on the show

Sleepy man is a catch-all boogeyman. He's gonna do things to you bad
