I like that.\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:54.000\nI walked off the set of Great Minds wearing this. This isn't mine.\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:56.000\nThis is Wardrobe?\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:57.000\nYeah.\n\n00:57.000 --> 00:59.000\nI'm probably still wearing makeup, too.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:01.000\nWhat do I mean, probably? I am still wearing makeup.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:05.000\nAre we allowed to know what this character is about?\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nI play Dan Harmon.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nYou play you, but like...\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:13.000\nOh, it's just finished shooting with Sarah Silverman as Betsy Ross.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:19.000\nYesterday was Ron Funches as Edie Amin.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:22.000\nAnd he's, I mean, well, Sarah's fantastic.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:26.000\nI can sing her praises lots, but Ron's new to our family.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:31.000\nMy life, I knew he was adorable and cuddly and giggly,\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nand we worked with him on a Harmon quest,\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:37.000\nbut yesterday, playing Edie Amin,\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:43.000\nhe revealed a depth of dramatic chops that was like stunning.\n\n01:43.000 --> 01:45.000\nSo I'm really looking forward. I think that episode's going to be great.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:48.000\nHe's like a great dramatic actor.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:50.000\nAnd I'm obviously a terrible comedy writer\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:56.000\nif you'll find out he's a great dramatic actor in my comedy show.\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:59.000\nOkay, so here's some thoughts that I had.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:01.000\nSo I find this hard to believe.\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:04.000\nSo I have not, in this podcast,\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:08.000\nif I talked about the Uber Rape Data leak...\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:11.000\nOkay, it seems like I would.\n\n02:11.000 --> 02:13.000\nFirst of all, if you're a company,\n\n02:13.000 --> 02:17.000\njust strategically, don't have rape data.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:21.000\nBut sometimes, apparently, it's if you're going to...\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:23.000\nI was going to...\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:26.000\nYeah, it's a big company.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:28.000\nIt's been growing very quickly,\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:30.000\nand they have a customer service database,\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.000\nand there was kind of a, I don't know, semi-whistleblower,\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\na customer service person who...\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:44.000\nThey leaked images, screenshots of the Uber customer service database\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:48.000\nwith examples of things that you would type in and how many results you'd get.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:52.000\nSo if you type in the word rape, you get 5,583, something like that.\n\n02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\nI think it's as many feet as there are in a mile.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:58.000\nThat's my mnemonic device.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:02.000\nOver three years, but Uber released a rebuttal,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\nwhich just...\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\nThere's no good way to rebut this,\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:10.000\nand they did not find the good way.\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:14.000\nThey said, that is so misleading.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:21.000\nWhat if the driver or passenger is named Jason Rape?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nThat's the example that they said.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:28.000\nWhat they said is some drivers or users might have that word in their last name,\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:36.000\nand the two examples they used in this order were like Jason Rape or Don Draper.\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:38.000\nThey should have started with Don Draper.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:42.000\nYou should have started and finished with Don Draper.\n\n03:42.000 --> 03:46.000\nWhy did you create this Marvel villain?\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:51.000\nI don't care if he exists and is driving for Uber to bury that lead.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.000\nDon Draper, the guy that thought of Don Draper in the Uber PR war room,\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:04.000\npromote that guy and send him home early because you're done with that plank of your debate.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:08.000\nDon't then go, yeah, Jason Rape.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:14.000\nI would have started with Don Draper, then Alexander the Grape.\n\n04:14.000 --> 04:15.000\nThe other pop flavor.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:17.000\nWell, this is the other thing they say,\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nnot to mention colloquialisms in a complaint,\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:23.000\nsomeone might say, you raped my wallet.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:24.000\nAre you making that up?\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:25.000\nThat's a real one.\n\n04:25.000 --> 04:26.000\nI'm not making that up.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:27.000\nThat was Uber's rebuttal.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nThey're just saying, hey, this is something...\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:33.000\nLook, it's not always...\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:36.000\nAnd they said, that's over three years.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:38.000\nAlso, by the way, the screenshots go,\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:41.000\nI don't think these defenses hold up for the phrase sexual assault,\n\n04:41.000 --> 04:43.000\nwhich was also typed in and had thousands and thousands of...\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:45.000\nAnyways, all right.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:47.000\nIf you're a company, I mean, hey, I'm no Donald Trump.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:49.000\nI don't have a book on how to run a business.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.000\nI'm just saying, don't have rape data.\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\nJust consider that, consider the existence of it at all to be a crisis.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nDeal with it very quickly.\n\n04:57.000 --> 05:00.000\nDo you think the person that came up with the name Don Draper\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:03.000\nfrom Mad Men thought of like Don D. Raper?\n\n05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\nWho knows?\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:09.000\nBut the other end of that spectrum is like,\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:13.000\nas we said at the end of the Cordury episode,\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:18.000\nour friend, the Uber driver, Abed, seems to me,\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:21.000\nI don't want to speculate too widely or too quickly,\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\nbut it just sort of sounds like he's the victim\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nof some kind of crazy entrapment sting operation,\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:32.000\nwhich must surely start from something,\n\n05:32.000 --> 05:35.000\nas much as we want to vilify Uber in the press,\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.000\nprobably because they target the press,\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:40.000\nalso because of the rape data.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\nBut also on the other side of that, it's like,\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.000\nwell, where are we coming from?\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.000\nWe're coming from this crazy system where\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:51.000\ncities are in charge of medallions and all that crap.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:53.000\nBut thanks to Spencer, Uber,\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nI'm sorry, Abed met his goal, like Lickety Split.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:00.000\nI didn't even have time to tweak.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:02.000\nYeah.\n\n06:02.000 --> 06:06.000\nIt's just from people who probably watched the live stream\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:09.000\nand people who knew about it just that day.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nI saw your Facebook post about that,\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:16.000\nand I went on to do it, and you had not met the goal\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:18.000\nwhen I was putting information in,\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:20.000\nand by the end of it, it was way over.\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nThat's how fast it was coming in, it was really great.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:25.000\nThat's a very cool of you, Spencer, to take that on.\n\n06:25.000 --> 06:28.000\nI wasn't thinking, no, it's not me, it's, you know.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nNo, I'm saying like, it absolutely was you.\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:32.000\nWho is it, what?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nIt's the kindness of all the people who donated.\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:37.000\nOh, fuck those people.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:41.000\nNo, but he means like, you made it easy for them to do it.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nYeah, I opened a door so kindness can pour through\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:46.000\nand bathe Abed in compassion.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.000\nYeah, that's nothing.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nI wouldn't have thought to do it.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:53.000\nI didn't think about it.\n\n06:53.000 --> 06:55.000\nI was so happy listening to the episode,\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:57.000\nbecause that happened, and then Rob Corddry,\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:00.000\nwe find out that he is in love with everybody.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.000\nHe was sad, and it totally wasn't here.\n\n07:03.000 --> 07:05.000\nThat made me so happy.\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nAlright, so, is there a way to turn off comments on Instagram,\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nand if so, would you?\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:14.000\nYou could delete comments.\n\n07:14.000 --> 07:16.000\nI don't want to delete no comments.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.000\nThat's like reading a book.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.000\nWho hurt your feelings, what was it?\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.000\nNo, I just, nobody did.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.000\nI'm not a photographer.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:28.000\nI'm not into, I don't paint with light.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:30.000\nI just...\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:36.000\nClearly from that sentence, you paint with words.\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.000\nCorrect.\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:40.000\nYes.\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:43.000\nPhotographers don't even know they're allowed to say that about themselves.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:46.000\nThey're too busy painting with light.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:50.000\nLess are known, but more valid saying about me.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:55.000\nMy words are worth a thousand pictures.\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:57.000\nBut each of them.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:02.000\nSo, if I take a picture, it's worth...\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:04.000\nWhat's a thousand times a thousand?\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:05.000\nTen.\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:07.000\nNo, you just said...\n\n08:07.000 --> 08:09.000\nYour picture would be worth it with one word.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.000\nOh, no, divided by a thousand?\n\n08:11.000 --> 08:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n08:13.000 --> 08:15.000\nWe'll be right back.\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.000\nGoldbond powder.\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:20.000\nNo, it's absolutely not.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.000\nI'm not Kim Kardashian, so I don't...\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nThere's people who I'm sure...\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nDon't say yourself short again.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:32.000\nShe'll post a picture of herself sleeping or waking up,\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.000\nor be like, I'm

28:42.000\nover to a different side of that.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nI think\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nit's more like\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nwell,\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:50.000\nthat party\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:52.000\nthat lady said on that panel thing\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nhe was listening to this show\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nand it almost was like\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nshe stumbled into saying something\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nthat you're not even supposed to say.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:02.000\nSomeone can tell me, I'll get the name wrong.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nIt was a panel of Republicans\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:06.000\nthat were basically talking about the Trump problem.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nIt's one of the female Republican senators\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:10.000\nwho has a lot of media quotes these days\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.000\nbut she said like Trump is forcing\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:14.000\nthe Republican party to\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:16.000\nexamine its core beliefs\n\n29:16.000 --> 29:18.000\nand that's something we definitely don't want to have happen.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.000\nLike\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nthey're talking about examination of their core beliefs\n\n29:22.000 --> 29:24.000\nlike it's the China syndrome.\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nWhich is, I think that is a beautiful thing\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nbecause it's like, I don't know\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.000\nhow much scrutiny the Democratic\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.000\nparty would hold up.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nI don't know any political gigantic party\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nthat represents, like nothing\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nthat big would hold up to any scrutiny\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nin terms of core beliefs but my god.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nI mean,\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nthere's a lesser of evils or\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nyou know, shit stinks more than piss.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.000\nI don't know what to say.\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:50.000\nBut\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nit is funny because he's like\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nthis mordred that was born out of this\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nlike weird slime that drips out of the machine\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nthat they've been cranking on\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nand the machine is really built on dishonesty\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nbecause you can't be\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\na financial elitist\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nand expect a majority vote.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nSo you have to do all these weird gears\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:10.000\nand Rube Goldberg kind of contraptions\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:12.000\nthat link financial elitism\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.000\nto homophobia\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nwhich doesn't make any\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:18.000\nsense. First of all, gay people\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.000\nare rich beyond belief.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:22.000\nWhatever. Let's forget it.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nLet's just talk to our guest.

--> 49:58.000\nBecause I have an autoimmune skin disorder,\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:00.000\nand it's really\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nfucking bad down there.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nSo in order to apply the fucking\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nmedication,\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nyou gotta be smooth.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nYou gotta be smooth.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:12.000\nWhat are the

50:20.000\nIt sucks.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:22.000\nThat's why I take those fucking...\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nthose pills that knock me out every week.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:26.000\nI thought I was

50:42.000\nI'm honestly not sure\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:44.000\nprecisely which area we're talking about.\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:46.000\nThe balls.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:48.000\nOh, you mean the area down there?\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nYeah.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nWell, I can't answer that because I haven't gone down there...\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nDo you do some little\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\npubic, you know, gardening?\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nNo, I don't.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nYou don't trim, not at all?\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nNo.\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:04.000\nI guess...\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.000\nI guess the answer to either\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nwould have been no, but I didn't know\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:10.000\nif you meant, like, butthole maintenance.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:12.000\nOh.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nBecause that was, at one point,\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:16.000\nsomeone was talking about that.\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:18.000\nDefinitely him.\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:20.000\nRob, Rob, I don't want to\n\n51:20.000 --> 51:22.000\nput words in his mouth, but Rob...\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nRob, I think it was in his\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.000\nthirties,\n\n51:26.000 --> 51:28.000\nstarted realizing\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nthat...\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nYou know where this is going.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nI have no idea.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nYou started realizing that you're, as you put it,\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nyou had an awakening...\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nOh, okay, yeah, now where you're going.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nYeah.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nI think it was a little, it had to be\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:46.000\nearlier than 30.\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:48.000\nIt had to be earlier than 30.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:50.000\nI just remember at a certain point you started becoming obsessed with how dirty your asshole was.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nYes.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nNo, no, no, that was before we loved Milwaukee,\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nso it was like 26.\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\n24, 26, yeah.\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nIt was crazy that people accept\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.000\nthat much shit in them\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nand on them.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.000\nIf you got feces on your arm\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nand just took a piece of paper and were like,\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nfine, I'm going about\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nmy day now.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:14.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:16.000\nWiping your ass is a private thing.\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:18.000\nYou don't see it,\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nin detail,\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nin movies, or they don't show you a cartoon\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\non Saturday\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nmorning or anything,\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nyour parents just don't want to deal with it\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nand it's just yours to find out.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nAnd if, you know,\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:34.000\nthank God I was in the improv comedy\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:36.000\nscene back in\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nthe 90s because\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nI never would have found out.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nI never would have found out\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nif I wouldn't have been constantly\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nshowing my balls and ass\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nand dick to my friends.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:50.000\nI would have never have known\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:52.000\nthat\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:54.000\nyou're supposed to clean it and it made so much\n\n52:54.000 --> 52:56.000\nsense.\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.000\nMade so much sense, there was a click\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.000\nthat happened in my brain\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:02.000\nthat happened and now\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:04.000\nbeautiful.\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:06.000\nIt's so...\n\n53:06.000 --> 53:08.000\nIt's so good.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nIt's so...\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\nIt's like...\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\nSurgeons,\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:16.000\nsurgeons call up\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:18.000\nI wouldn't call myself a foodie, but\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nit's...\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:22.000\nIt's like the same thing.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:24.000\nI'm a foodie.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nYeah.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:28.000\nVery important to me.\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nAt what point\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nRob became Icarus and flew too close to the sun?\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nYeah, for sure with his\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nbutthole stuff because he scalded his\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:38.000\nanus.\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nA quest for cleanliness that turns\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:42.000\nreally into more\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:44.000\na higher level\n\n53:44.000 --> 53:46.000\nof\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nwhat do you call it?\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nScepticity? Is that a word?\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\nWell no, it's just like\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nif grossness is your concern\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:56.000\nnothing's grosser than breaching\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nthe...\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nBecause the thing is\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.000\nour alimentary canal technically is outside\n\n54:02.000 --> 54:04.000\nour body.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:06.000\nThat shape the torus, it's like a donut.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nThat's like\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:10.000\nhow multicellular organisms formed and that's\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:12.000\nwhy then they turned into worms. I know I've been through this\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\non this podcast before, but it's like\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nthe reason why worms,\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nthat's the earliest kind of multicellular\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:20.000\nthing and it's like what's happening\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nis it's like a donut that's extruded\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nthat's still outside the body\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nstuff that goes in our mouth and eventually\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\ncomes out our butt. All it is is\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nrubbing up against the outside\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nof a collective of cells.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nThe way that cells eat, they rub up against a thing\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nand so when you eat a donut, the donut\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nyou're just sending it into the part of\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nyour body that you rub up against the outside\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nworld. So that's why\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nit's really dangerous when you...\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nI was just imagining myself in a highway\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nstop for the last\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\n30 seconds.\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nYou're like a guy walking by and listening to\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:54.000\nmy podcast. Or Mike, just while\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nyou were going in that, I was like, I'm, he lost\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:58.000\nme. I'm gonna fall over.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.000\nBut I say, like\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nthat's why it's really dangerous like septic shock\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.000\nand stuff. It's like when there's are perforated\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nyou know, Crohn's disease, anything that involves\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nthat barrier between\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nwhat's going on in that canal and what's going\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\non inside your body where there's blood. If you get\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:14.000\npoop in your blood, so I'm saying\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nthis guy brinches butt so much\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:18.000\nyou know, that's, that's, that's grosser than having\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\npoop in your butt. I don't want to talk about it anymore.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nLike\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nOh, Bean. What, what do\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nwe, we've got a lot of\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\ndudes up here. You know, what, what do the\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nwomen think? Let's\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nby applause a little bit of\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\ntrimming. What do you think? Anybody\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.000\nbuy a little bit of trimming? Are you\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nasking the women here if\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nguys should do that? Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:42.000\nYou appreciate some trimming.

the fraternity made this.\n\n01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.760\nBut you went to Cornell?\n\n01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.600\nYes.\n\n01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.440\nThat's where Carl Sagan went.\n\n01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.320\nYes, and Steve's dead.\n\n01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.160\nNo, shit.\n\n01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.000\nThat's true.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000\nAnd we had the same major.\n\n01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:54.840\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.680\nWhich was what?\n\n01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.560\nIndustrial and labor relations.\n\n01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.520\nI L.R. school.\n\n01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.360\nYeah.\n\n01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.720\nWhich is dead, like...\n\n01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.120\nWhat were his pubes like?\n\n01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.160\nMy therapist told me in my last session\n\n01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.320\nthat she's worried about Steve Levy.\n\n01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.160\nShe should be.\n\n01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.360\nShe's never spoken to him.\n\n01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.440\nI've never had a conversation with him.\n\n01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.800\nShe based it on a voicemail, or a succession of voicemails.\n\n01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.080\nI only left one.\n\n01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.640\nHe sounds tired.\n\n01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.880\nAre you working?\n\n01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.040\nAre you guys busy?\n\n01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.840\nYeah, I guess.\n\n01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.920\nI think she made me think that I'm killing Steve.\n\n01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.920\nThat's not important.\n\n01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.560\nBut I...\n\n01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560\nIt's pretty important.\n\n01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560\nSteve?\n\n01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.560\nIt's very important.\n\n01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560\nSteve?\n\n01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560\nYeah.\n\n01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560\nIs Dan killing him?\n\n01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.560\nNo.\n\n01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560\nI mean, we're just working real hard.\n\n01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560\nThat's how you die.\n\n01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.200\nIt's all based on what you tell her.\n\n01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.960\nHe's not also giving his side of the story.\n\n01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.600\nNo, but she was seriously just going like,\n\n01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.600\nOh, boy, he sounds like he's worn down.\n\n01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.600\nThat's what...\n\n01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600\nI mean, it wasn't like about...\n\n01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.600\nI was like, I don't go in there and tell stories about how hard it is to make Steve\n\n01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600\nleave me miserable.\n\n01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600\nSo I need therapy.\n\n01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.600\nYou don't make me miserable.\n\n01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.600\nWe were...\n\n01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.840\nPlease don't kill me.\n\n01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.960\nWe're working seven days a week.\n\n01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960\nSeven days.\n\n01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960\nIt'll be over soon, buddy.\n\n01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960\nI promise you.\n\n01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.960\nNo, it won't be over, Steve.\n\n01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960\nIt'll be months.\n\n01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960\nThis is the rest of your life.\n\n01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960\nYeah, it's good.\n\n01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960\nI'm going to be working for him soon.\n\n01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960\nI'm trying to move.\n\n01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960\nHe's saying that's what...\n\n01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960\nIt's not just me.\n\n01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960\nSpencer, too.\n\n01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960\nIt's working real hard.\n\n01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960\nYeah, we're working real hard.\n\n01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960\nIt's working so hard.\n\n01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960\nIt's working.\n\n01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960\nTeam Harmon.\n\n01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960\nAll right.\n\n01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:40.720\nSteve, as an example of your sacrifice, because I do feel it's such a sausage party up here,\n\n01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.280\nand obviously what we need to talk about is the pubic hair and the buttholes and the\n\n01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.280\nballs.\n\n01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.780\nWe have to.\n\n01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:53.240\nWe need a woman up here or someone that presents us such...\n\n01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240\nCha-ching.\n\n01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.520\nAnd there's only so many chairs and microphones.\n\n01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520\nI get it.\n\n01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:05.800\nSo could you go and pull the car around and give it just a light buff, like not a waxing.\n\n01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800\nYou don't have to get waxed.\n\n01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.440\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.720\nAnd then warm it up like five minutes before I come out.\n\n01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:18.240\nYou know I would if you had a car.\n\n01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.240\nIt's 9-11.\n\n01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.240\nAll right.\n\n01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.240\nSteve Levy, everybody.\n\n01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240\nSteve Levy.\n\n01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.760\nWhat's that?\n\n01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.240\nSteve, our thoughts and prayers go to your weird pubic situation.\n\n01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:39.920\nHis GoFundMe is GoFundMe at Steve's pubes.\n\n01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920\nRight?\n\n01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920\nYes.\n\n01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.840\nHe left it very cryptic, a lot to wonder about.\n\n01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.840\nYeah.\n\n01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.240\nWell, that's part of his allure.\n\n01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.240\nYeah.\n\n01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.920\nDo you think I'm a good person, Andrew?\n\n01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.920\nNo.\n\n01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.920\nNo.\n\n01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920\nOh, you were talking to him.\n\n01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.240\nI'm trying to get fresh eyes on something that you guys already have in mind.\n\n01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240\nRight, right, right.\n\n01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.240\nYeah, we do.\n\n01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.240\nYou've been working with me for a couple episodes.\n\n01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240\nYeah.\n\n01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240\nTwo-pan thing.\n\n01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:13.240\nI just feel like if I say yes, you're going to say see.\n\n01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.240\nI've been kind of mean to you a couple of times.\n\n01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240\nNo.\n\n01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240\nWell, yeah, but...\n\n01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.240\nGet used to it.\n\n01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.240\nIt gets worse.\n\n01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.240\nThe closer you get, it gets worse the closer you are to him.\n\n01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.240\nThe more you reach out, the more he'll hit you and difficulty you down.\n\n01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.240\nIt gets worse.\n\n01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240\nGet worse.\n\n01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240\nGet worse.\n\n01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.240\nHave an exit plan.\n\n01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:55.240\nHave enough in the bank that you can leave and walk out at any time.\n\n01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.240\nJust have an exit plan. It gets worse. It gets worse.\n\n01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.240\nIt gets worse! Worse!\n\n01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.240\nIt gets worse!\n\n01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:09.240\nNot only do I need, I demand somebody put that to a beat and some music.\n\n01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.240\nI want that to be my ringtone, my alarm clock, everywhere.\n\n01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.240\nWell, I don't know that it could be put to a beat.\n\n01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.240\nThat's why you need me. I always provided the rhythm.\n\n01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.240\nHe was the lyrics and I was the beat.\n\n01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.240\nYou are the sun, I am the moon.\n\n01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.240\nWhat were you going to say? Here's the thing, to get specific.\n\n01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:41.240\nI'm acting in this show. There has to be a script when I show up.\n\n01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:46.240\nSometimes there's jokes. If I don't know how to do the thing,\n\n01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.240\nI'll do this thing where I caught myself and realized what I was doing.\n\n01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:55.240\nI don't know how to deliver this line because I'm not really an actor.\n\n01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.240\nI get nervous and go, I don't know how to do this.\n\n01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240\nI'm doing this wrong and I can't remember it.\n\n01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.240\nThen I go, it must be poorly written, the line.\n\n01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.240\nThat's when I'm questioning the line.\n\n01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.240\nCan we beat this?\n\n01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.240\nI've experienced worse.\n\n01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.240\nHe worked at Conan.\n\n01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.240\nI'm not talking about Conan himself.\n\n01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240\nHe seems really nice.\n\n01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.240\nHe's like a nice guy to work for.\n\n01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.240\nYou've experienced worries in terms of writer on writer cruelty.\n\n01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:37.240\nOr like cruel overlord.\n\n01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:44.240\nThat's not what I'm saying you are.\n\n01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.240\nWhen I started knowing what I thought I knew about you,\n\n01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:55.240\nat some point he's going to explode at me over something.\n\n01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.240\nIt never happened week after week.\n\n01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.240\nOne or two little things.\n\n01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:10.240\nI wish this thing exploded.\n\n01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.240\nIt makes me sound like...\n\n01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.240\nBut not based on who you actually are.\n\n01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.240\nNo, I'm talking about the legend of me.\n\n01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.240\nI'm fine with it circulating that I'm always hard to work for.\n\n01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240\nIt's that one thing.\n\n01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.240\nThat sounds like such a pretentious thing where you're throwing a water bottle\n\n01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.240\nand you're screaming about something.\n\n01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240\nI don't really do...\n\n01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.240\nBut I do something probably worse.\n\n01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:43.240\nI start manic obsessing and then I'm saying rude things.\n\n01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:57.240\nIt's like because you have a...\n\n01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.240\nI'm sorry about him by the way.\n\n01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.240\nIt's like everybody goes like bring Rob back.\n\n01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.240\nKids love Rob and it's like it hurts but I bring him back for them.\n\n01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.240\nAnd then he's doing worse things than I'm accused of doing.\n\n01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.240\nI feel like Andrew is giving you the same response that you got about should you shave your pubes.\n\n01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.240\nHe's being very diplomatic like Cody was.\n\n01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:25.240\nHe's saying like I'd be fine if you trimmed your personality.\n\n01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.240\nYou don't have to because I'm a professional.\n\n01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240\nI don't fuck around.\n\n01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.240\nI laser my...\n\n01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.240\nI have been with people with more pubes than you but that person was a gorilla.\n\n01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.240\nAnyway is that what you...\n\n01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:50.240\nYeah so it was like kind of I was dropped into it and I was like okay now like edit this into something Dan's going to love and go.\n\n01:11:50.240 --> 01:12:01.240\nAnd then he's going to come in and have zero involvement for like five days and on the sixth day come in and judge it.\n\n01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.240\nBut then I stay until it's perfect.\n\n01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.240\nYeah and it's been fine.\n\n01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.240\nI'm sorry to disappoint your bloodthirsty audience.\n\n01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240\nNo, no.\n\n01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240\nIt's been fine.\n\n01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240\nIt's been fine.\n\n01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240\nIt's been fine.\n\n01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.240\nIt's been fine.\n\n01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.240\nIt's been okay.\n\n01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.240\nIt's fine.\n\n01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.240\nNo that aspect has been fine.\n\n01:12:21.240 -->

really more for her comfort.\n\n01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.240\nRight.\n\n01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240\nOkay.\n\n01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240\nSo she'll be the judge of that.\n\n01:15:49.240 -->

and...\n\n01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240\nOkay.\n\n01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.240\nThat's what got me into trouble.\n\n01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.240\nThat, because I can see that.\n\n01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.240\nSorry, Kelly,\n\n01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.240\nI thought I'd slow you down\n\n01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240\nbecause it's like...\n\n01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.240\nEvery word is worth a thousand pictures here.\n\n01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.240\nThe shaft needs to be free and clear.\n\n01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.240\nI could interpret that as a lot of different images.\n\n01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240\nShe's saying,\n\n01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.240\nget the hair off the shaft of your dick.\n\n01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.240\nOkay, even that though,\n\n01:16:49.240 -->

fine.\n\n01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.240\nWhen you look at my dick,\n\n01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.240\nif I'm laying down and you look down at me naked\n\n01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.240\nfrom a helicopter,\n\n01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.240\nis there just a circle of baldness around the...\n\n01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.240\nAnd then there's like a fryer,\n\n01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:20.240\nlike a fryer's haircut kind of thing going in a circle around.\n\n01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.240\nLike there's like a blast radius of...\n\n01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.240\nThe shaft needs to be free and clear.\n\n01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.240\nDo you mean at the base\n\n01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.240\nor do you mean like the encroaching kind of like on the...\n\n01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.240\nThere shouldn't be hair on it, right?\n\n01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.240\nThere should be no hair on it.\n\n01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.240\nYeah.\n\n01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.240\nAnd where her lips might touch,\n\n01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240\nkeep that clear.\n\n01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.240\nYeah, you don't want to get the hair in your teeth.\n\n01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.240\nIt's gross.\n\n01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.240\nI don't want somebody who is different from me freaking out,\n\n01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.240\nbut I didn't think these are places where there could be hair.\n\n01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.240\nLike it's touching and that affecting her.\n\n01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.240\nDo you have like a big 70s natural like bush down there?\n\n01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.240\nDo you have like a big old satch?\n\n01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.240\nI mean, it sounds like this mail\n\n01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.240\nor I get every year from the fire department\n\n01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.240\nabout brush clearance.\n\n01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:21.240\nBut Kelly's gotten specific about tooth areas now.\n\n01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.240\nShe's just getting started.\n\n01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.240\nShe's working her way down.\n\n01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.240\nWell, I just want to take it slow.\n\n01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.240\nShe's talking about that.\n\n01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.240\nShe's saying clear the shaft,\n\n01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.240\nget any hairs off the shaft, right?\n\n01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.240\nYes.\n\n01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240\nThen...\n\n01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240\nHow could there be hairs on the shaft?\n\n01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.240\nSometimes hairs on the shaft just accept it.\n\n01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.240\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.240\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.240\nI know what you're talking

sportscaster.\n\n01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.240\nIt's got a headset on the tip and like a toupee.\n\n01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.240\nI'm like, oh, well, see,\n\n01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:28.240\nno wonder you guys thought I was weird for not doing anything.\n\n01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.240\nSo, Kelly, let's keep moving along.\n\n01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.240\nSo, shaft brain clear, then next stage, what?\n\n01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.240\nAgain, her preference,\n\n01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.240\nbecause if she's doing stuff with your balls,\n\n01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.240\nI would keep it trimmed down.\n\n01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.240\nKeep it classy.\n\n01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.240\nHave you named this imaginary third party\n\n01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.240\nwhat she would like?\n\n01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.240\nShe's saying that...\n\n01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:54.240\nEve.\n\n01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.240\nThe customer is always right.\n\n01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.240\nExactly.\n\n01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.240\nThat goes without saying, and that's why...\n\n01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.240\nI'm trying to actually liberate,\n\n01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.240\nbecause I don't want her to have to be an ambassador of anything.\n\n01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.240\nI wanted to have representation up here,\n\n01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.240\nbut she shouldn't...\n\n01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.240\nYou know, what if she...\n\n01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.240\nThen somebody's going to tweet at her,\n\n01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240\nlike, you got it, right?\n\n01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240\nShe's an individual.\n\n01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.240\nI just wanted to hear what her preferences are,\n\n01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240\nso we could just...\n\n01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.240\nBecause I know I'm going to go talk to my girlfriend,\n\n01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240\nand I'll work it out with her,\n\n01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.240\nbut I'm just curious what we have you up here.\n\n01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240\nWhat the terminology...\n\n01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240\nHow would...\n\n01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240\nWhat...\n\n01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.240\nJust mow the lawn, man.\n\n01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.240\nIf you had a lawn and you lived in a nice neighborhood,\n\n01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.240\nyou would be like,\n\n01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.240\noh, shit, the grass is getting a little long.\n\n01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240\nI'm going to...\n\n01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.240\nI feel like you guys are mad at me\n\n01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.240\nfor not knowing how to trim my dick hair.\n\n01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.240\nIt's just a simple concept, is all.\n\n01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.240\nIt's a simple concept.\n\n01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.240\nYes.\n\n01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.240\nYou make the hair shorter than it is.\n\n01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.240\nI love you, Spencer.\n\n01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.240\nWith your glasses on.\n\n01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.240\nPreferably with glasses on.\n\n01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.240\nYes.\n\n01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.240\nProbably with a magnifying mirror, too.\n\n01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240\nYeah, it's helpful.\n\n01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240\nBe safe.\n\n01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.240\nKelly, do you get the full nine,\n\n01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.240\nlike the Brazilian, the whole waxy,\n\n01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.240\nthe whole front-to-back wax thing?\n\n01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240\nNo.\n\n01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.240\nHave you ever tried it?\n\n01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.240\nNo.\n\n01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.240\nMe?\n\n01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240\nMe?\n\n01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.240\nThat would be amazing.\n\n01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240\nI was just like, I don't do shit.\n\n01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.240\nAre you kidding me?\n\n01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.240\nYes.\n\n01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.240\nThey would carry you out on their shoulders.\n\n01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.240\nThey'd be like, wow, I don't agree with her,\n\n01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.240\nbut that was amazing.\n\n01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.240\nKelly looks like Leo Sayer down there.\n\n01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.240\nOh, boy, no one got that reference.\n\n01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.240\nGoogle Leo Sayer,\n\n01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.240\nand you'll be very happy about it.\n\n01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:46.240\nDo women, to what extent is outside help fundamental\n\n01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.240\nto this whole thing?\n\n01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.240\nAnd to what extent?\n\n01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.240\nDo it yourself.\n\n01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.240\nWould you guys stop pissing and whining at me?\n\n01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.240\nIt's such a ridiculous thing\n\n01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.240\nwhen someone is putting themselves down this low.\n\n01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240\nI know.\n\n01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.240\nYou're saying, should you ask for outside assistance,\n\n01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.240\nor should you do it yourself?\n\n01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.240\nNo, I'm asking a question about a curiosity\n\n01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240\nto the women's side of the fence,\n\n01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.240\nbecause I've heard the things about like,\n\n01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.240\noh, I'm going to get lasered,\n\n01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240\nI'm going to do these things,\n\n01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.240\nand I'm curious about the amount of maintenance\n\n01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.240\nthat we currently consider to be fundamental,\n\n01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.240\nlike or default, whatever you would call it,\n\n01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.240\nlike kind of like a cultural average or whatever.\n\n01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.240\nHow much of that involves third parties\n\n01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.240\nfor women and how much for men?\n\n01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.240\nBecause when you're thinking about your maintenance,\n\n01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.240\nit's never occurred to you to pay someone to do it.\n\n01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.240\nYou're thinking about things you do yourself.\n\n01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.240\nRight, well, yeah.\n\n01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.240\nBut it's very possible that a woman\n\n01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.240\ngoes somewhere and pays someone to do that for her.\n\n01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.240\nYou're seeing what I'm seeing.\n\n01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.240\nI think so.\n\n01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240\nDon't you think that's an interesting thing?\n\n01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.240\nThere's no indication of that from the audience.\n\n01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.240\nWell, maybe they're leaning in.\n\n01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.240\nThey're like, wait a minute.\n\n01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.240\nI don't know.\n\n01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.240\nAnd who knows that that might be like,\n\n01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.240\noh, yeah, because that's how we like it.\n\n01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.240\nAnd we were in control.\n\n01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.240\nBut it's also like, do men go to places\n\n01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.240\nand get it done like a lot?\n\n01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.240\nYeah, you can.\n\n01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.240\nDon't use Nair.\n\n01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240\nYes, that is true.\n\n01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240\nDon't use Nair.\n\n01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.240\nThat's not for down there.\n\n01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.240\nDo you have a bad experience with Nair?\n\n01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.240\nI did.\n\n01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.240\nWhat happened?\n\n01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.240\nIt burned like a mother mother.\n\n01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.240\nBecause Nair is like acid that goes down into your follicles\n\n01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.240\nand burns out the root, right?\n\n01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:36.240\nAnd for some reason, your penis is more sensitive to acid\n\n01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.240\nthan your shoulders.\n\n01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.240\nWhere are you supposed to use Nair?\n\n01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.240\nI've talked to women, some of them I've dated\n\n01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240\nand some of them I've just friends that we've talked about this before.\n\n01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.240\nAnd they're feeling as like guys sometimes demand\n\n01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.240\nthat they want the woman to be Brazilian waxed\n\n01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.240\nlike all the way across the board.\n\n01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.240\nAnd I think it's fair for the woman to say,\n\n01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.240\nthen you fucking do it too.\n\n01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.240\nLike you go in there and have somebody put some hot ass wax on your balls\n\n01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.240\nand some stranger rip it off you.\n\n01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.240\nAnd there's a chick that she goes to a place,\n\n01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.240\nI said, do guys go in and do it?\n\n01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.240\nShe said, yeah, but it has to be a referral.\n\n01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.240\nBecause you can't just go in like, hey, I want you to do it.\n\n01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:16.240\nI'm just a regular person coming in here,\n\n01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.240\npaying customer.\n\n01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.240\nI think there's guys that love to go in there\n\n01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.240\nand it's like a cheap diamond atrix basically.\n\n01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:27.240\nAnd to them that's important, like the intent?\n\n01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:31.240\nNo, no, no, there's a million ways to be turned on by weird things.\n\n01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.240\nThey don't want...\n\n01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.240\nNo, no, the woman that run these...\n\n01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.240\nOh, because he'd have an erection and he'd be an assault.\n\n01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.240\nWe do this because we're doing a service.\n\n01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.240\nYou're just here to use this as a sex operation.\n\n01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.240\nYou could have that rule about anything.\n\n01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.240\nIt's like a gas station.\n\n01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.240\nIf you're one of these people that gets hard on when you pump gas,\n\n01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.240\ntake it down the fucking road.\n\n01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.240\nWe'd like you to refill your car here.\n\n01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:02.240\nBut you don't make the guy at the 76 station look at your dick.\n\n01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.240\nNo, I'm agreeing with you and saying,\n\n01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.240\nyeah, that's an understandable rule at all businesses,\n\n01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.240\nespecially places that do go near your wiener.\n\n01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:16.240\nOkay, well, Kelly, do you have any books to plug or anything?\n\n01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.240\nNo, I'm just...\n\n01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.240\nThis is actually the first day of our honeymoon.\n\n01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:26.240\nOh.\n\n01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.240\nWhat's your husband's name?\n\n01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.240\nTrey.\n\n01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240\nTrey?\n\n01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.240\nWhat are his pubes like?\n\n01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240\nShort.\n\n01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.240\nShort?\n\n01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:38.240\nDo you assist or is he taking care of business on his own?\n\n01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240\nHe does it himself.\n\n01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.240\nAt a boy.\n\n01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240\nAt a boy.\n\n01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.240\nAre you guys...\n\n01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.240\nIs it a delayed honeymoon or do you guys really just get married?\n\n01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240\nNo, it's a delayed honeymoon.\n\n01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240\nWhen did you get married?\n\n01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.240\nThree years ago.\n\n01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.240\nBut this is a sad reality.\n\n01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.240\nI went to work the day after I was married.\n\n01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.240\nWe did.\n\n01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.240\nIt was like, yeah, well, honeymoon and Christmas,\n\n01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.240\nand you guys had to wait three years.\n\n01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.240\nWe're going to Japan, so we had to save up.\n\n01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.240\nSo fuck you.\n\n01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.240\nYou guys came to LA as a waypoint, as a layover?\n\n01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.240\nYep, we got here at 5.30, and this was our first stop.\n\n01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.240\nDid you plan that?\n\n01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240\nLayover and then fly out here?\n\n01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240\nYeah.\n\n01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.240\nWow, that's kudos to...\n\n01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.240\nI couldn't manage that kind of schedule.\n\n01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.240\nThat's it.\n\n01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.240\nOh yeah, we'll schedule and then we'll pop over to the show.\n\n01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.240\nThat's crazy.\n\n01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:40.240\nThat's the kind of crazy that makes someone's nether regions totally sculpted and consumable\n\n01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:42.240\nby the public.\n\n01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:51.240\nI'm just a savage, feral, shambling mound of...\n\n01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.240\nConsumable?\n\n01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.240\nI mean...\n\n01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.240\nI know you meant visually, even.\n\n01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.240\nYeah, no, I mean, like, you consume a season of House of Cards, like, you don't eat it.\n\n01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.240\nIt's probably an unfortunate way to refer to it.\n\n01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240\nI can't really win tonight.\n\n01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.240\nExcept in one sense, which is that I was willing to occupy that position and in such...\n\n01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240\nIn such...\n\n01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.240\nShut up, you drunk fat idiot.\n\n01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:25.240\nWell, Kelly, thank you so much for being brave enough to share your private life with us\n\n01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.240\nand congratulations to your husband.\n\n01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.240\nThank you very much.\n\n01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.240\nThank you.\n\n01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240\nI gotta go.\n\n01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:32.240\nOh, he's gotta go.\n\n01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.240\nI gotta go.\n\n01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240\nRob's...\n\n01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.240\nWell, you gotta go, Rob.\n\n01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.240\nI'm gonna go see Kate's show at the Pac Theater.\n\n01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.240\nOh, nice.\n\n01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.240\nLet's all go.\n\n01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.240\nAll right.\n\n01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240\nI bet they would.\n\n01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.240\nI bet they'd follow you.\n\n01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.240\nYou've taken over my show.\n\n01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240\nI'm not taking over.\n\n01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.240\nI wonder how many people would go if Rob just, like, tried to pipe pipe or some of this crowd.\n\n01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240\nI can't do a pipe-piper with noise.\n\n01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.240\nBut, uh, but, hey man...\n\n01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240\nThank you, Rob Schrab.\n\n01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.240\nRob Schrab, everybody.\n\n01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:14.240\nAll the friendship be forgot the guest that we all love\n\n01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.240\nIn the arms of Schrab\n\n01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.240\nIn the arms of Schrab\n\n01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.240\nIn the arms of Schrab\n\n01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:29.240\nIt gets worse, it gets worse, it gets worse\n\n01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:31.240\nWell, Internet...\n\n01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.240\nYou'll be letting me down if you don't put that shit together.\n\n01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.240\nI want mashups.\n\n01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:38.240\nI want music videos.\n\n01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.240\nI want the whole thing.\n\n01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:44.240\nWell, I bet you guys thought you saw me stumble into a strange type of snitch.\n\n01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.240\nGoddamnit.\n\n01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.240\nDan, Dan, we're gonna take it again.\n\n01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240\nWe'll take it again.\n\n01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:52.240\nOkay, guys, go to the silence.\n\n01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240\nApplauds on three.\n\n01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240\nOne, two, three.\n\n01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240\nApplauds.\n\n01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.400\nWell, I bet you guys saw a haaaaaa...\n\n01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.620\nWe'll take it again.\n\n01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:10.520\nWell, I bet you guys thought you saw me stumble into a weird sniper's nest of random conversation\n\n01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.600\nabout my pubic hair.\n\n01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.600\nBut it...\n\n01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:20.320\nWhich is also what we call your pubic hair, a sniper's nest.\n\n01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:25.720\nThis is low hanging fruit.\n\n01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.920\nThat's also what we call it.\n\n01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:36.480\nHe's getting old ladies, he's getting old.\n\n01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.880\nBut the truth is, I teed it all up, because it's all been a part of my master plan, because\n\n01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:48.520\nI've got an ace up my sleeve, podcast wise, an expert on pubic management, Mr. DeMorge\n\n01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:58.520\nBrown is here.\n\n01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:05.240\nYes you are sir.\n\n01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:06.240\nHello.\n\n01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.160\nAnd how are you?\n\n01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.440\nI know I keep sexually harassing you every time you come at us.\n\n01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:27.520\nI think we're roughly the same age, because you're hitting this sexy whaler thing.\n\n01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.320\nThe high rolled turtleneck and the patches, you're like a hot collegiate kind of thing\n\n01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:33.320\ngoing on.\n\n01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320\nIs it racist?\n\n01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.240\nI want to take Polly Sy for me.\n\n01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240\nIt's the Black Hemingway.\n\n01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.240\nBlack Hemingway!\n\n01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.240\nBlack Hemingway!\n\n01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.000\nWho is the Black, is there a Black Hemingway?\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nWho is the Black Hemingway?\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nDo we have him?\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nIt's just you.\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nFlavor Flav, I think.\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nFlavor Flav?\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nBlack Whalers Sport.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nSorry.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nYou just, if you want to take it.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.240\nI'm just saying, just go to the Florida Keys, I'm sure you'll find somebody.\n\n01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:07.000\nSome guy who made a fortune in publishing, the Johnson publishing industry, Ebony Magazine,\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.800\nand he's down in the Florida Keys right now and he's just fishing off his millions.\n\n01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:18.920\nJim Orange, tell us about your fubicare and the policies about it you have and what you\n\n01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:21.280\ndemand in others.\n\n01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.560\nOr you can say pass and we'll just move on.\n\n01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:31.680\nWell since I'm wearing this sweater I suppose I have to be frank.\n\n01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.240\nI take care of my business.\n\n01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240\nAlright.\n\n01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.440\nI manage it, yeah, of course, absolutely.\n\n01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.400\nNo outside help though, no clinics.\n\n01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.280\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:41.800\nYou manage it with?\n\n01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800\nShears.\n\n01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800\nShears.\n\n01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.800\nFinger shears.\n\n01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.800\nThe small scissors.\n\n01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800\nYou cut it with scissors.\n\n01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800\nScissors.\n\n01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:48.800\nAnd a razor.\n\n01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.800\nBut you know, I'm a runner.\n\n01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.800\nWhen you call scissors shears, really, by default?\n\n01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800\nI was just fucking around.\n\n01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800\nOh, okay.\n\n01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.800\nShears are shears.\n\n01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.000\nYou know, they have their own purpose and avenue in life.\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.520\nI am a runner and I run long distances when I'm really in a swing and so I have to because\n\n01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.680\nthere's a friction of it over time, like over the course of two or three weeks it just consists\n\n01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680\nof running.\n\n01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.320\nIt's just too much abrasion, friction, whatever.\n\n01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320\nThat's it.\n\n01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.720\nSo I have to, and it's...\n\n01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.920\nYou know, we've had breast cancer survivors up here, but I'm really proud of us tonight.\n\n01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:30.000\nI think we're very brave because men, you need to check yourselves.\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.760\nYeah, so okay, I'm afraid I'm going to, I keep getting these, I keep asking questions\n\n01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.960\nlike, just cut your pubic hair.\n\n01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:44.320\nI feel like I'm being bullied a little bit, but I'll put a pin in it because I'm going\n\n01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.320\nto keep asking.\n\n01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.600\nI think the very first thing Kelly said, I think is the most, like to the point, she\n\n01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.520\nsaid, like, talk to the person that you're with, like ask your girlfriend.\n\n01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:53.520\nYeah, of course.\n\n01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.520\nYeah, fine.\n\n01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520\nNo, I can't.\n\n01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.800\nYeah, but what am I supposed to do?\n\n01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.800\nTalk?\n\n01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800\nI can't.\n\n01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.800\nOr...\n\n01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.320\nDo a will-I-am hologram of my girlfriend ago.\n\n01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.320\nYeah.\n\n01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.320\nMordegard, conjure her up.\n\n01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:12.320\nWait, what was I going to ask?\n\n01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.800\nI was going to ask something, god damn it, fuck, shit, shit, such a fuck-up.\n\n01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.800\nOr you just take the first step.\n\n01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:22.800\nYou were talking about how brave we were being compared to women who survived cancer.\n\n01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.000\nOh, well, how often?\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.360\nBecause like, I mean, you know, my fingernails, like, I'll be like, come on, again, with\n\n01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.360\nyou?\n\n01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.480\nYeah, I know what you mean.\n\n01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.920\nWe don't need them to scratch and claw our way to survival anymore.\n\n01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.320\nI just wish you could just take a pill.\n\n01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.320\nI've said this before.\n\n01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320\nYeah.\n\n01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320\nThey've got to make a pill, make her fingernails stop growing.\n\n01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.920\nWe don't need them no more.\n\n01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920\nYep.\n\n01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.920\nYou should do if you drop a key.\n\n01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.480\nOr a coin or a credit card, you got to use your fingernails, you know, to use your fingernails\n\n01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.480\nfor picking up shit.\n\n01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.760\nI ain't using no fingernail for that.\n\n01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.760\nThey've got to make keys better.\n\n01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.840\nPut a little handle on them.\n\n01:33:58.840 --> 01:33:59.840\nWe're primates.\n\n01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.040\nBut the people that make the handles that go on keys are going to need fingernails to\n\n01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.960\ncreate the tools and the molds necessary.\n\n01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:09.560\nAre you son of a bitch?\n\n01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:13.320\nAre you going to be so elitist that you want to create a superclass of people that don't\n\n01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:19.200\nneed fingernails and let the underclass have to have long fingernails to make your weird\n\n01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:20.560\nkey handles?\n\n01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.560\nYeah.\n\n01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.600\nYou know, people wear glasses, we didn't just start killing people that couldn't see.\n\n01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.840\nWe evolved our culture.\n\n01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:36.720\nRob didn't wear his, he almost cut his dick off.\n\n01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.720\nConnective tissue.\n\n01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:42.640\nWait, what was I going to, god damn it, harm you?\n\n01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.640\nCancer.\n\n01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.640\nCancer.\n\n01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.640\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.640\nWhat?\n\n01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.640\nYou're like a saboteur.\n\n01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.560\nHe wasn't talking about cancer.\n\n01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.560\nFingernails.\n\n01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.560\nFingernail growth, pill.\n\n01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.560\nFingernails growth, yeah.\n\n01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.560\nCould there be a thing?\n\n01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.560\nHow often?\n\n01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560\nHow often?\n\n01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.960\nYeah, not that it would mean anything to me, but it was like, yeah, what is it, monthly,\n\n01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.960\nweekly?\n\n01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.960\nProbably once every couple months.\n\n01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:03.960\nOh, really?\n\n01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.920\nIt depends on how fast it grows, but I don't think it grows super fast or anything.\n\n01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:08.920\nOh.\n\n01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.920\nYeah.\n\n01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.160\nIt's not like a daily routine.\n\n01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:19.200\nYou heard my lover say, every seven days she goes to a sci-fi, like, laser clinic.\n\n01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.400\nLaser, that sounds dangerous.\n\n01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.400\nDoes it grow?\n\n01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.400\nDangerous.\n\n01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.400\nLike arm hair doesn't grow.\n\n01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:32.240\nI first moved here, one of my first famous sightings was SEAL, also known as SEAL Henry\n\n01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.240\nSEAL.\n\n01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:39.560\nAnd I told a bunch of people this, and one of my friends who was new, wait, what if the\n\n01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.400\nstory had nothing to do with pubic hair at all, and it's just like, Timur is just having\n\n01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.400\na stroke?\n\n01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.880\nHe just becomes the Floyd the Barber of our show.\n\n01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880\nLook it up, that's a reference.\n\n01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.400\nAll right, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.\n\n01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400\nLeo Sayer, Floyd the Barber.\n\n01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.400\nIt's just Scottish with an afro, right?\n\n01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.400\nYeah.\n\n01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.400\nAnd no teeth.\n\n01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.720\nOne of the friends I had from the Groundlings, I was telling him this story because I didn't\n\n01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.240\nhave many L.A. stories, so I was just saying, I just saw SEAL.\n\n01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:11.280\nHe said, my friend or my roommate, I can't remember, works in a spa or salon, and SEAL\n\n01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.480\ncomes in and gets the full body wax, the entire body, like his whole body.\n\n01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.560\nHe doesn't want any hair on his body.\n\n01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.080\nAnd she said it was once a week, I think.\n\n01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.520\nI would imagine, for me it would be.\n\n01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.520\nHe would have been in that area because that's where the spa was or something.\n\n01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:32.920\nThat seems like an all or nothing thing, if you have any hair at all, it's no good.\n\n01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:33.920\nThat was for his place.\n\n01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.800\nI'm not saying I'm not willing to change, I mean, I'm just saying, when I look at my\n\n01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:43.560\nbody in the mirror, I'm like, holy fuck, man.\n\n01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.560\nWhere would I start?\n\n01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:46.080\nHow would I know when I'm finished?\n\n01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.920\nI can see how I don't look like guys on TV, you know, and I don't know if they're like\n\n01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.840\nborn different or if they do stuff, but I'm like, where would I fucking start, man?\n\n01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.120\nI guess, you know what, I'd start on my shoulders, because I'm like, well, that's definitely\n\n01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.400\nnot what a cop looks like when he takes his shirt off, if he's going to fight terrorists.\n\n01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.920\nAnd I'm like, yeah, man, and I would do that for a while, I would like, I'd try to make\n\n01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:12.640\nlike a selfie stick for my, but then it was like, like, you go down and it's like, then\n\n01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.920\nyou look in the mirror and it's like, oh, it looks like you took a paintbrush with skin\n\n01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.400\non it and painted over a hair wall.\n\n01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:24.400\nI was like, where, how do I, I can't, short of bringing another horrified victim into\n\n01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.560\nthis process, what am I supposed to do?\n\n01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.880\nI'm like, literally, I would like, I would like try to like, mew, mew.\n\n01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.240\nI don't, I don't, like, don't do that, like, if you get, that's, that's a slippery slide.\n\n01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240\nSo don't do that.\n\n01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.000\nI look like Dan Hadea when I take my clothes off.\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000\nI mean, I like, like, like, that's gotta be, I mean, like, I understand, oh, where she\n\n01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.360\nputs her lips and what everything, but what, how about where she puts her eyes?\n\n01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.360\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.680\nHow about where she puts her integrity?\n\n01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.680\nI'm like, she must put it somewhere safe.\n\n01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:54.240\nI like, I think they're just better people, these ladies.\n\n01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.040\nI don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to make sweeping generalizations about\n\n01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.000\nlike, they're not visually stimulated, but something is just stopping my girlfriend\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:06.720\nfrom, from, from, from making decisions based on the reality.\n\n01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.960\nSo she somehow was able to live in some never ending story or something where like, I look\n\n01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:20.000\nlike a hot dog or a Spider-Man or just a, just a, just a, just a memory for her childhood\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nmaybe.\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.040\nIt's like a big wad of cotton candy or a dove.\n\n01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.440\nIt's not, it's not about being, going through a full metamorphosis, it's about just a little\n\n01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.840\nbit of, a little bit of groundskeeping.\n\n01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:41.320\nJust, I mean, here's the thing, so like, like, so imagine, so I take off my shirt, so what\n\n01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:46.000\nyou're going to see, you guys have seen it, you know, Ron Jeremy territory, it's like\n\n01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.120\nI'm wearing a black, hairy shirt.\n\n01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.800\nAnd then I'm like, and it doesn't stop at my waist because it, it doesn't know that\n\n01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:59.840\nit's a black, hairy shirt, it keeps going down my thighs and everywhere.\n\n01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.320\nIt's, for some reason, maybe because I wore socks for too long when I was a kid, but it\n\n01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.120\nstops right at my ankles in a reverse hobbit thing.\n\n01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:13.600\nSo I have these beautiful, supple, baby smooth, hairless feet.\n\n01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.600\nDo you know what a reverse hobbit is?\n\n01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.000\n$20, same as in town.\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.880\nA reverse hobbit is a difficult situation which is, which regrets.\n\n01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:33.440\nSo also, I'm just, I'm not saying I'm not going to do it, I'm not arguing about, I've\n\n01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.280\ninspired tonight, I'm going to put steps, I'm going to have Steve schedule me a time\n\n01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:38.280\nto-\n\n01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.280\nLeave Steve out of it!\n\n01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.280\nLook, if he doesn't-\n\n01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.720\nYou're killing me, your therapist is already worried about it.\n\n01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.160\nBut I'm just picturing this moment when I'm standing at the foot of the bed, and I'm like,\n\n01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:54.880\nhead to toe in this greasy, ursine fucking hair, I was like, like, like, like, and then\n\n01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:01.760\njust like, right at my crotch, this is, this is like, oh, Tom Cruise is here, and it's\n\n01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:07.320\njust like, it's not, there's nothing for some hill down there anyway, it's like the Hollywood\n\n01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:10.320\nsign where it's like, we're going to get rid of this litter and it'll be Hollywood, it's\n\n01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.080\nlike, there's no sign, you know?\n\n01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:17.760\nIt's going to pop, man, it's going to be great, it's going to pop, it's going to draw the\n\n01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:20.800\neye right to it, you know?\n\n01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:25.400\nNo, it's not going to pop.\n\n01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.320\nNo, I get scared, I thought you knew something, I didn't-\n\n01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.840\nThat's what you want, it's going to pop, baby, it's going to pop.\n\n01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.320\nIt's going to leap off the screen.\n\n01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.320\nYeah.\n\n01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.920\nEspecially just during the on-grain on Tally for a second.\n\n01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:43.680\nOnce you pop, you can't stop, sorry, I cut somebody off who was talking.\n\n01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.040\nIt's going to want to make you reach in, grab it.\n\n01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:52.440\nAll right, well, I mean, you know, look, it was uncontrollable, the show just became\n\n01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.440\nabout that.\n\n01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.440\nNo, the show-\n\n01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.360\nWe were happier then when I was talking about Harvey Fierstein talking about Trump, like,\n\n01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:03.280\nI mean, Dick Hare is warm, but that's our domain.\n\n01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:08.200\nI was thinking that the word ur sign actually entered my head earlier today.\n\n01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.880\nWhen you were looking at me.\n\n01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:20.280\nNo, there was a bear doctor drawn on the wall of where we last shot, you were there.\n\n01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.280\nThat was a chair moving.\n\n01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.280\nThere's no way that was a fart.\n\n01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:28.400\nIf it were a fart, then show's over.\n\n01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:31.520\nWell, whose chair was it?\n\n01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.520\nIt was someone in the audience.\n\n01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.360\nWhose chair has that many mics on it?\n\n01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.240\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.280\nYou were using like a colloquialism.\n\n01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.320\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.080\nThere was a sound that was like, oh, and Jeff went.\n\n01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.400\nSo anyway, I'm sorry.\n\n01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.120\nThere was a bear.\n\n01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.840\nWhen we walked to where we shot the last shot today, there was like a pharmacy and it had\n\n01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.000\na cartoon bear doctor on the wall.\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.840\nAnd for some reason the word ur sign entered my head and you just said it.\n\n01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:12.920\nYou look like you were accepting anything.\n\n01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.200\nThat is a weird word to think of twice in a day.\n\n01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.480\nYeah, when he said it.\n\n01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.200\nIs there a word for when you, like the word, like you think of a word and then you start\n\n01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.200\nhearing it all the time?\n\n01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.200\nI do that all the time.\n\n01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.000\nLike read it and hear it at the same time.\n\n01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.400\nLike, oh, I haven't thought of the word, like porcine or whatever.\n\n01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400\nYeah.\n\n01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:35.000\nYeah, I read it and see it everywhere.\n\n01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000\nYeah.\n\n01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.240\nOh, I thought you meant when you hear it and read it at the same time.\n\n01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.960\nNo, no, no, but like a word that you think, oh, it's a word.\n\n01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:41.960\nI keep hearing that word.\n\n01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.960\nNo, you always did.\n\n01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.160\nThat's kind of confirmation bias on the level, isn't it?\n\n01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.160\nOh, damn.\n\n01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:51.120\nI mean, I don't think, I don't think so.\n\n01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.120\nYeah.\n\n01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.880\nIt's just, you're just now noticing it.\n\n01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.360\nIt's now on your radar.\n\n01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.840\nYou've heard that mathematically the exact same amount of time as probably.\n\n01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.840\nYeah.\n\n01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.600\nIt's related in the Uber to here.\n\n01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.560\nFor some reason thought of Weird Al Yankovic and right after that, the Eye of the Tiger\n\n01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:15.760\ncame on the radio and I could only hear the Weird Al, Rai or the Kaiser version of it.\n\n01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:16.920\nI've never heard that one.\n\n01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:17.920\nRai or the Kaiser?\n\n01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.920\nYeah.\n\n01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.920\nIt's on in 3D.\n\n01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.720\nThe ballad of a theme to Rocky 12 or something.\n\n01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.720\nSo he's, he's, he's ordering a sandwich and he's like, what a deli man.\n\n01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.560\nYou want the Rai or the Kaiser?\n\n01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:33.160\nIt's a Rubin tonight, we're going to put some sauerkraut and that's weird.\n\n01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.960\nWeird Al Yankovic is the Chuck Yeager of parody in that he broke the parody barrier by which\n\n01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:45.840\nyou can't tell if someone reads you a title of a song, whether it's a Weird Al Yankovic\n\n01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:52.960\nsong or a parody of a Weird Al Yankovic parody, like, like, like, how would you like write\n\n01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.920\na joke where you're like, oh, Weird Al Yankovic did this song?\n\n01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:59.840\nIt's like, how would you tell the joke from reality?\n\n01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.660\nIt's like, well, you take a popular song and you turn it, make it about food and by any\n\n01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.160\nmeans necessary.\n\n01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.160\nThat's what he really does.\n\n01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.680\nWere you thinking I was making that up?\n\n01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:12.200\nNo, no, I was just, I was marveling that if you had made it up, I wouldn't have been\n\n01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200\nable to tell.\n\n01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:17.240\nI can't believe there's a song called Rai, this, I don't only have a strong opinion.\n\n01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:23.240\nOur friend Dino hates, hates Weird Al, like, really, really, truly hates him.\n\n01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.240\nI don't have a strong opinion.\n\n01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.120\nI've met him once or twice, he's a lovely, lovely fellow, he's a good dude.\n\n01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.160\nBut like, I don't, like, I don't, like, go out of my way to hear his stuff, but why\n\n01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.160\nare the Kaiser?\n\n01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.160\nI kind of like that one.\n\n01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160\nIt's good.\n\n01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.160\nIt's one of the...\n\n01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:37.160\nDo you know Alan Sherman?\n\n01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.160\nSure.\n\n01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:39.160\nYeah.\n\n01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.160\nLike, he's, like, those are funny.\n\n01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160\nThat's easy originally.\n\n01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.560\nNow, funny, I mean, I brought it up so it doesn't really count, but in the show today,\n\n01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:50.680\nI was singing, you know, A Taste of Honey, he has one called A Waste of Money, and it's\n\n01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680\nreally funny.\n\n01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:57.360\nDo we have, like, an instrumental track that's good enough, not a rap beat, but, like, just\n\n01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.880\nanything where, Jeff, I'll sing a song, like, a straight up the middle one, and then you\n\n01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.880\ndo the parody of it.\n\n01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:08.080\nWait, why do I have to do all the hard work?\n\n01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:16.600\nOkay, let me see if I have something instrumental.\n\n01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:25.400\nThis is real improv.\n\n01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:28.120\nYeah.\n\n01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.120\nMy song's the straight line.\n\n01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.400\nAnd I had to do the weird out version of it.\n\n01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:36.320\nYou are my sweetie.\n\n01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.680\nYou are the sweetest thing I've ever seen today.\n\n01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.920\nYou are my sweetie.\n\n01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:46.720\nAnd you are the best thing in the world.\n\n01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.920\nI love my sweetie girl.\n\n01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:53.960\nAll right, all right, I got it, I got it.\n\n01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.640\nI weird alify that.\n\n01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640\nYeah.\n\n01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.640\nAll right.\n\n01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:14.320\nThere you go.\n\n01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.720\nI love big ziti.\n\n01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.000\nIt's my favorite pasta in the world.\n\n01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.400\nIt's a thick tubular pasta.\n\n01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.400\nYou can put sauce.\n\n01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.600\nI love big ziti.\n\n01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.080\nIt's a great side dish with some meat or maybe some fish.\n\n01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.600\nAlso, a squeeze of your titty.\n\n01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.120\nAll right, now, I'm going to do one.\n\n01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.280\nI'm going to do one.\n\n01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:38.280\nClearly.\n\n01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:51.200\nYou guys are applauding inverse show ending dynamics.\n\n01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:57.760\nYeah, tip that Hindenburg's nose cone toward the ground.\n\n01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:03.320\nI don't want to thrust it upon you, but let's keep it going.\n\n01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.920\nLet's pass the button out.\n\n01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:07.800\nDemorige, you straight line this one.\n\n01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.320\nAndrew, you weird alify.\n\n01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.920\nNo, no, no, I didn't sign up for anything like that.\n\n01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:17.280\nIf you don't have it, you're allowed to say pass and one of us.\n\n01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:23.080\nWhatever the procedure is, that's what I'm doing.\n\n01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.080\nAll right, Demorige, you can sing a straight song.\n\n01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:35.560\nThat might actually be a real song.\n\n01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:41.960\nI like to go outside and look at the sun and look at the stars.\n\n01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.440\nThat means I go out in the day and the night.\n\n01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.120\nI'm never inside.\n\n01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:50.000\nI'm a monster man.\n\n01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.240\nThat's a good song.\n\n01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.240\nWait, no.\n\n01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:00.080\nCan I change the rules?\n\n01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.240\nI want to know more second act of monster man.\n\n01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:15.800\nWhat we know about him so far is he goes out in the daytime and the night time, which\n\n01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.040\nwe have every right to do.\n\n01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:26.000\nHe has a different relationship with the moon and the sun.\n\n01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000\nHe's a monster man.\n\n01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.400\nThat was one of the most amazing fucking things I've ever.\n\n01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.320\nI was just hitting the turtle in the head.\n\n01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.480\nGary Newman song, it was really good.\n\n01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.640\nThere wasn't a single fumfer, but it was when you look at the lyrics, you're like, what\n\n01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.640\nthe fuck?\n\n01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:50.360\nI like to go out and look at the sun and look at the sun and look at the day and the night.\n\n01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.360\nI also am a monster man.\n\n01:48:52.360 --> 01:49:00.200\nYou know what I'm going to call myself a monster man?\n\n01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:07.640\nThe greatest hits of Frank Sinatra, Junior Junior.\n\n01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.440\nThat song doesn't deserve to be paradise.\n\n01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:11.920\nThat's too good on its own.\n\n01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.120\nIt's a very casual confessional.\n\n01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:21.760\nI mean, I got so many questions about monster man, it seemed like he just, he knows what\n\n01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.760\nhe likes.\n\n01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:27.600\nHe likes walks in the daytime and the night time.\n\n01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600\nThis is hubris, but let me try it.\n\n01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.600\nI'm convinced that I can do it.\n\n01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.800\nI'm going to give it the same track because I'm limited here.\n\n01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.640\nWell, yeah, that's I'm doing his parody.\n\n01:49:40.640 --> 01:50:08.400\nI like to go with the bun and when I see the cars, I go by, I'm a lobster can.\n\n01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:15.400\nThe larger juggers that I thought I could do it, I thought it would just happen.\n\n01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.400\nAnd I got greedy.\n\n01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:21.080\nI was off the hook and I was like, well, come on, in all due respect, I'd like to give\n\n01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.080\nthat a shot.\n\n01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.080\nThey were going to move on.\n\n01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.080\nAnd I was like, come on.\n\n01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.080\nI was like, you forgot something.\n\n01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.080\nSo you had, you thought of lobster can only.\n\n01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.080\nNo, I didn't.\n\n01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.080\nI swear.\n\n01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.080\nNo, I did not.\n\n01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.080\nI did not.\n\n01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.080\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.080\nMade a second.\n\n01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.080\nTwo verses of gibberish.\n\n01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.080\nHow did you get it?\n\n01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:42.360\nI thought you were having a lobster can.\n\n01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:45.240\nI'll tell you, I will show my work.\n\n01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.760\nI'll tell you exactly what I thought when the pressure was on and I was listening to\n\n01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:51.240\nDemorge before everything gave way to holy shit.\n\n01:50:51.240 --> 01:51:00.320\nThis is a toe tapper and we have a new Harry Connick Jr. emerging.\n\n01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:05.680\nI was like, uh, I thought I was like, well, he said, I like to go in the sun and I was\n\n01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:09.840\nlike, well, that should be a bun because that's edible.\n\n01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:15.720\nAnd then I, and then, and then I, I did, I was like the enigma machine.\n\n01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:22.480\nYou guys won't they say Hyal Hitler and all the messages to do it.\n\n01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:25.960\nTranslates everything into food for a weird album.\n\n01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:31.240\nI thought, I thought, I thought bun and I thought can, I didn't know how to connect\n\n01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:32.240\nhim.\n\n01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240\nLobster came to me.\n\n01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.240\nThat's good.\n\n01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.680\nLike fucking Joan of Arc style and that's actually probably went through me.\n\n01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.680\nDance, dance shit.\n\n01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:41.680\nLobster.\n\n01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.680\nDan from the top.\n\n01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:43.680\nFrom the top.\n\n01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:44.680\nI want to hear the song.\n\n01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.680\nLobster can.\n\n01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.680\nNow you have a, you had a moment.\n\n01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:47.680\nAre you ready?\n\n01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.680\nOkay.\n\n01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:49.680\nWell, no.\n\n01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:56.360\nHey, everybody out there, it's champagne time.\n\n01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:01.280\nGrab your dance partner and we're doing something called the style dance.\n\n01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:07.760\nI like to go in the bun and when I don't have the fun, I like to go in the car.\n\n01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:13.280\nI have so many things to eat, but I don't know what to do with my lobster can.\n\n01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:20.360\nA lobster can, it's a can, pull a lobster as fast as you can.\n\n01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:27.200\nWhy would you eat a lobster if it was so unfresh and had to come in a can?\n\n01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:33.600\nI want to go with the park and when it's after dark, I see the elephant man.\n\n01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:40.160\nI go and tug on his trunk and when I'm drunk, I need a lobster can.\n\n01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:45.760\nOh, seafood, salty as can be, I want to definitely off, this is not matching the thing.\n\n01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:46.760\nIt's perfect.\n\n01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:47.760\nIt was fantastic.\n\n01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:51.920\nBut it's not, it wasn't a parody.\n\n01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.480\nSpencer, you want to give it a world?\n\n01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.720\nYou want to be straight man or punch line man?\n\n01:52:57.720 -->

think, Harmon?\n\n01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:07.120\nWhere has Spencer best served to be the one that sets it up for somebody or the one that\n\n01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.120\nbrings it home?\n\n01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.920\nI think he, honestly.\n\n01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:15.200\nI think because you're a logician, you know, you're a, you're a, let's give him a
