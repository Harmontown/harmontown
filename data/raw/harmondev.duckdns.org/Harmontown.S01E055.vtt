that.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:14.000\nIf Darwin's...\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:17.000\nBill feels really bad, Bill, it's not funny\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:19.000\nif we eat the food and it's delicious,\n\n16:19.000

does.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:47.000\nIt's almost like there's a reason for it.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nThere was a moment when all of them were\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:51.000\ngoing, oh should I be ashamed of myself\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nbecause I didn't get up this morning\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:56.000\nand go like, what food am I going to bring\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:57.000\nto Harmontown?\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nThen you gave them the pleasure of going like,\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:03.000\noh good, there's boundaries for a reason.\n\n17:03.000 --> 17:08.000\nYeah, you made them feel great.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nThey had a whole arc in like five minutes\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nof like, I'm not that good.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:14.000\nOh no, I'm okay.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nBill sucks.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nYou're awesome, Bill.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nHe's a culinary Goldberg.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:26.000\nHe's like Hulk, like everything I touch,\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nI crush in my hand.\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:32.000\nOkay, so speaking of what's right and what's wrong\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nand where the mass is and how do you organize\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\ncommunities and let's go on the moon\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:41.000\nand live them in peace, I want to bring\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:45.000\nour web guru, Shahruz out here.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nWait, Guru might be racist because he says that.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:50.000\nIt wasn't racist until you pointed it out.\n\n17:50.000 --> 17:53.000\nIf you just said web guru,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:58.000\nif you said web fakir, sure.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:02.000\nThe web mystic.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nWhat a guru.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:10.000\nHe's Indian.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:16.000\nYou're right, me pointing it out made it so racist.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:19.000\nWait, what are you, Shahruz?\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nWait, you're Pakistani?\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nOh, you're okay.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:29.000\nDo the handshake, do the handshake.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nWhoa!\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:35.000\nThey're just like us.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nSo, Shahruz is our web genius\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nand I just found out by the way I want to go on record,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nthat means I'm the opposite of racist, right?\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nBecause I'm totally colorblind,\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:49.000\nlike I don't know, right?\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\nYeah, except you then caught yourself\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:54.000\nand then you became slightly racist.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:57.000\nListen, if I'm the guy who gets to say\n\n18:57.000 --> 19:00.000\npeople are racist or not, you're not racist.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:10.000\nBut I'm not that guy.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nAll right, Shahruz, regardless of his heritage,\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:18.000\nis a computer genius intimidatingly so\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:23.000\nand he does a lot of pro bono computer work\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:26.000\nand he did this thing for Harmontown a long time ago\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:28.000\nthat I'd never taken advantage of\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:30.000\nand I keep reminding myself to try it.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:32.000\nAnyways, I said to him,\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:35.000\nI want to be able to do this thing with the internet\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:39.000\nand people's cell phones.\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:42.000\nBecause I could say, for instance, I could go,\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.000\nhey, who jerked off today?\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:48.000\nBuy applause and then like, the people that...\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:54.000\nAdam Goldberg clapping to the surprise of no one.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:56.000\nThe people that applaud aren't,\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.000\nthey may or may not be all the people that jerked off\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:01.000\nbut what's more obvious is that they're the people\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:03.000\nwho don't mind everyone knowing\n\n20:03.000 --> 20:05.000\nand it's too much like,\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nthere's too much Heisenberg principle happening\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:10.000\nin measurement, you know?\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:15.000\nWe have this new technology available to us.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nEvery once in a while you're kind of curious,\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nwhat percentage of you really feel this way or that way?\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:24.000\nIf there was an anonymous way to very quickly do these polls\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:27.000\nand I said that to Shahruz and he whipped up this thing\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:32.000\nthat creates this geo-fence around the room that we're in.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.000\nWhoa, really? That's amazing.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nI mean, not physically.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nNot an idiot, Shahruz.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:43.000\nSorry, I guess it's just not as amazing.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nNo, it is amazing because it's the things that are...\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:49.000\nif the phones are within a certain diameter,\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:52.000\nthen they're in the...\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:55.000\nThat seems very impressive.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nOkay, thank you, sorry.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:58.000\nBy the way, you are exactly...\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:02.000\nif my mom squints when she looks at me, she sees you.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:05.000\nYou are what my mom wanted me to be.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:07.000\nI thought you were just being really racist.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nIn her dreams, I'm Shahruz.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.000\nThat's what her plan for you was?\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:16.000\nYeah, I started computer science.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:18.000\nOh, Kumail, come to my bed.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nOkay, let me amander.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:24.000\nGo to computer camp. Go to America.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:28.000\nI like that the magical, mystical gesture she's making, too.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:32.000\nGo, powerful lack of failure.\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:36.000\nBy the Pakistani God of Pulrap,\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:39.000\nI command you, go to the United States\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:42.000\nand learn computers for my family.\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nAnd then you came and look at you.\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:47.000\nAnd yeah, I was like, fuck that.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:51.000\nI like Game of Thrones.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nBut you were saying...\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:57.000\nand so you can do polls with this program?\n\n21:57.000 --> 22:00.000\nYeah, so the problem is that we have to think of something,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:06.000\nlike you can set up these things very easily.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nI did a test run of it and it's incredibly easy,\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:10.000\nbut I can't multitask.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:15.000\nWhat we can do is we can think of any kind of multiple-choice question.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:16.000\nYeah.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nAnd then we can punch it in\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:22.000\nand then we can give them this URL that they can access on their phones.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:27.000\nAnd they can all go to it and they can very easily vote.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:29.000\nAnd there's a time window.\n\n22:29.000 --> 22:32.000\nAnd after that time window, it'll send all the results to any e-mail address\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:35.000\nthat he specifies with like a pie chart and everything.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nOh, wow.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:42.000\nOkay, how about let's do people think you've been racist tonight?\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:46.000\nOr there could be one where you're not racist,\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:48.000\none where you don't want to be racist,\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nbut hey, we're all human,\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:53.000\nand then one that's like, yeah.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:56.000\nRight, specifically though, that I've been racist tonight.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:57.000\nYeah, what do you think?\n\n22:57.000 --> 22:58.000\nI mean, you have just spitballing.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nWell, I mean, the easy answer is yes,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:03.000\nbecause the modern definition of racism is acknowledgement of race.\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nI mean, I just did your mom reaching out and doing that.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nLike she was some kind of gypsy from thinner.\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nYeah.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:12.000\nI mean, yeah, I'm racist.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nWe don't need a poll for that.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:16.000\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\n23:16.000 --> 23:19.000\nYeah, the voice was fun too.\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:23.000\nBut what about the real definition of racism?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:26.000\nThe reason we're obsessed with it is because it's an actual crap.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:28.000\nLike, am I actually racist?\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nYeah.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:35.000\nLike, am I so obsessed with race\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:38.000\nthat I actually can't like...\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:40.000\nLike when you said web guru,\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\na normal person would not have thought it,\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:44.000\nbut you think about that so much\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:47.000\nthat you may associate it guru to Indian,\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:49.000\nwhich he is not.\n\n23:49.000 --> 23:51.000\nIn my defense, I'm a verbal thinker.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:56.000\nSo what I did is I said shrews are web guru\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nand that's what tripped.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nI was like, shrews are web guru?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:03.000\nAnd I went like, oops, that sounded bad to me.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nYeah, sure.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nNo, I understand.\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nOkay, so do you want that to be the question?\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nAm I racist?\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nYeah, what do you think?\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nOr we could do something totally like...\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nLet's just take it for a test run.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:15.000\nYeah, that way, because if we sit here...\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:18.000\nYeah, let's take that for a test run and then we can...\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:21.000\nSo just is Dan racist?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nWell, I can.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:25.000\nYeah, is Dan racist is the question.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:28.000\nAnd then what are the possible answers?\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.000\nYes and no, obviously.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:31.000\nAnd then what?\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.000\nThird.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nMaybe?\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nWell, let's do more than maybe that.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:38.000\nLike, he desperately doesn't want to be,\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:43.000\nbut unintentionally, he has some barriers.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nHow many characters?\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nIt's unlimited, but I just want to point out\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:51.000\nthat Adam Goldberg just texted me yes.\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:55.000\nWhy do you have Adam Goldberg's phone number?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nHe doesn't have Adam Goldberg.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:59.000\nAdam Goldberg has his.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:04.000\nAdam Goldberg gets your phone number.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:06.000\nI've been over this before.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:09.000\nHe has techniques.\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:12.000\nOkay, so this is just a test run.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:13.000\nYeah, just do the...\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:14.000\nI racist yes or no.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:15.000\nDon't even give him a third option.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nLike a one minute time limit?\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nYou make it two.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nOkay, and what's the URL?\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:26.000\nSo it's tentpole, T-E-N-T-P-O-L-L dot it.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:30.000\nSo tentpole, but pole like a gallop pole.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:33.000\nJust even the play on dot IT.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:35.000\nThis is the most clever thing I've ever come up with in my life.\n\n25:35.000 --> 25:37.000\nI've just never done anything this good.\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:39.000\nDot, dot, dot, dot, dot IT.\n\n25:39.000 --> 25:42.000\nTap here to find nearby poles.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nYeah, so everybody just hit tap to find nearby poles.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:48.000\nAnd then if it asks you for location permission, hit yes.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:51.000\nAnd then you just put your mailing address in there\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:54.000\nand you may receive some material about a time share\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nI want to tell you about.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nNo.\n\n25:58.000 --> 25:59.000\nIt's not working.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:02.000\nIt worked for me.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nNo, no, no, just do it.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:06.000\nNo, no, no, guys, just do it.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:09.000\nDid it ask you for permissions?\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:11.000\nYeah, it is. It's there.\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:14.000\nNo, let me just hit a pole but not answer one.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:16.000\nWeird.\n\n26:16.000 --> 26:18.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:21.000\nHere, take that lady's phone.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nThis is like a nightmare for me right now.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:35.000\nYeah, Bill and Cheruz both had their comeuppance for trying to be very nice.\n\n26:35.000 --> 26:40.000\nYeah, Cheruz's tentpole had e-fungus on it.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.000\nNo, no, no, it worked for me.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:51.000\nYou know it's a good podcast when somebody on microphone says,\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nI'm going to go into your settings.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nOkay, so the results are in.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:02.000\nAll right, is Dan racist?\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nYes, 14 votes, no 15 votes.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nYeah!\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:09.000\nWell, it says need more data, 20 votes.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nYeah, you left the 30 votes.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:13.000\nWhoa, that was a good number of people.\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:18.000\nOnly the vocal minority, from them it made it seem like it was not working.\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nIt turns out they're the vocal minority.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nAnd fuck minorities.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:26.000\nAll right, can I redo my answer?\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.000\nI don't think we need more data anymore.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nYou got your data.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.000\nThat's your reward for needing it.\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\nAll right, well, let's thank Cheruz for it.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:42.000\nWell, thank you Cheruz.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:47.000\nCheruz the Snake Charming Guru.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:49.000\nThat's India, that's India.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:56.000\nHe did genuinely float away on a flying carpet, though.\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.000\nWell, there's a place in France where naked ladies dance.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:02.000\nYeah, that's the lyrics to that song.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:05.000\nIt's the Egyptian national anthem, actually.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nIt's been the number one hit in Pakistan for 30 years.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:12.000\nWe have pyramids and we used to have a Nile,\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:18.000\nbut the snakes ate us and the sand's been here a while.\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:24.000\nNow we have a dictator, nothing to sing about with that.\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:27.000\nThat's how the song dies.\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.000\nHuman rights violations are real.\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:32.000\nWhat if you went to China and you went to a baseball game\n\n28:32.000 --> 28:36.000\nand you had never been to China and you just had a baseball game\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:39.000\nand they said, please rise for the national anthem\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:43.000\nand you stood up and I went...\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:49.000\nThe guy with the gong gets it started.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nYou would be the only guy in all of China going,\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nwhat is racist?\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nAnd everyone would be like, what?\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:56.000\nThis is the best song.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nWhy are you an asshole?\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nThis is the best song we've ever heard.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:02.000\nYou were telling me something about Iron Man and the Chinese.\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:04.000\nThat's an interesting...\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:05.000\nSomebody told me.\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nYeah, I saw it somewhere, but I didn't read it.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\nIron Man 3.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nI believe that...\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:13.000\nI mean, it's long, but even when I moved to LA in the 90s,\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:17.000\nit was already the case that at least 60% of all these big movies,\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\ntheir box office comes from overseas.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nI mean, we've long been living in the age\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:27.000\nof we think that we're like this Monroe Doctrine culture,\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:30.000\nlike giving out entertainment to foreign markets.\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.000\nSure.\n\n29:31.000 --> 29:34.000\nAnd in some respect, that's true because they still just want to see\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:36.000\nRobert Downey Jr. fly around in a row.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:38.000\nYeah, nobody's watching Lollywood movies.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nThat's the Pakistani film industry.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nRight.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nBut I mean, now China's emerging.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:48.000\nIt's like this giant market to the point where they remade Red Dawn\n\n29:48.000 --> 29:51.000\nand originally it was like the Chinese invaded America\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:54.000\nand then they had to go back in and they're still using computers\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:56.000\nto change everything to Korean.\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.000\nDid you know about that?\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.000\nNo.\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.000\nWow.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.000\nWell, Red Dawn's out now.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:04.000\nWe can watch it now and look at it.\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:05.000\nThat's what happened.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:07.000\nThat's why Red Dawn took so long.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:11.000\nI heard that King Kong vs. Godzilla had different endings.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.000\nIn Japan, Godzilla wins in here.\n\n30:14.000 --> 30:16.000\nWait, I thought you were doing a bit.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nNo.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nI think that's real.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nDo you mean the old school ones?\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nDean Devlin bothered to make a thing of it.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\nDean Devlin did not give a shit about.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:32.000\nYeah, so what I heard is that Iron Man 3 had like four minutes\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:36.000\nof Chinese, extra Chinese bonus footage in it\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:38.000\nwhere Tony Stark says like,\n\n30:38.000 --> 30:40.000\nwe got to warn the world about this threat.\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:44.000\nAnd then like there's a scene where he, in the Chinese release\n\n30:44.000 --> 30:47.000\nwhere he goes to China and is like,\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:51.000\nand that's why we got all band together against this octopus monster,\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:52.000\nwhatever the thing is.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nAnd then he's like, I love China!\n\n30:55.000 --> 31:00.000\nAnd the article that was printed about it\n\n31:00.000 --> 31:07.000\nhad the angle that the Chinese audiences had kind of rejected it critically.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:11.000\nThey were as into it as you would be if it was the other way around.\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:14.000\nLike if we loved Chinese movies, which some of us do,\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:18.000\nbut I mean if China was just the place that made blockbuster movies\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.000\nand shipped them over here and we went to see Iron Man 3\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:25.000\ninstead of like lead paint if they focused on movies.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:28.000\nIf they paused to say, America rocks!\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:31.000\nWhether we agreed or not would be like, dumb.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.000\nYeah.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:35.000\nWell, Doctor Who, which I really, really love,\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.000\nthere's a whole, now it's getting popular here,\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.000\nthere's a season where they will shot some in American,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nhe's literally wearing a cowboy hat and stuff.\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:47.000\nAnd for me, even though I'm sort of an honorary American,\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:52.000\nit really, really bugged me that they were clearly making such a transparent effort\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nto like woo American audiences.\n\n31:54.000 --> 31:55.000\nIn what?\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.000\nDoctor Who.\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.000\nOh.\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:01.000\nHe wears a cowboy hat and he's in like Yuta and stuff.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\nAnd this is exactly what you were saying.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:06.000\nI think what people don't like about it is with the comedian\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:08.000\nwho's just talking about what they think they want to hear\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:10.000\nversus what they really want to talk about.\n\n32:10.000 --> 32:11.000\nYes, absolutely.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nI think it's the exact same principle.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:13.000\nYeah, entertainment is voyeurism.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:16.000\nI don't know why we feel compelled to, I mean for God's sakes,\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:20.000\nlike we, I mean, like, that's the thing about reference humor too.\n\n32:20.000 --> 32:24.000\nLike, I guess it makes sense that you remake the office\n\n32:24.000 --> 32:27.000\nand then you're going to go through and you're going to change the references.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nFine.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nBut like, we go too far with it.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:33.000\nOr we go like, oh, no one wants to watch ugly people on TV.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nYou know, it's like, of course we do.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nYeah, I mean that's when I start.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nWe're ugly.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nWho else do we want to watch on TV?\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nMost of us are ugly.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:42.000\nYeah.\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:46.000\nI've really gotten into these like European crime shows,\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:50.000\nlike from Sweden and Denmark and stuff and what's so weird about it.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nI was like, what's so different?\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nBecause they're amazing shows.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:56.000\nBut also they don't have shows where nobody's attractive on the whole show.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:57.000\nYeah.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nAnd then a lot of anal.\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nAnd a lot of anal.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:04.000\nLike way more Swedish detective shows.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nLike it's a little weird.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:10.000\nBecause I would say most network TV had almost no anal.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:11.000\nYeah.\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:12.000\nAnd these guys.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nThat's a big difference.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nI mean, we're really uptight about that.\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:16.000\nYeah.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.000\nThose guys are assholes loose.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nHave you seen Swedish Colombo?\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nYeah.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:26.000\nAnd you know Colombo was originally Swedish, right?\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nIt was an adaptation.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nIs that right?\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:33.000\nThe original Swedish Colombo, the reason why Peter Falk would pretend to start to leave\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nand then he'd come back in.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:38.000\nThat was all originally like an anal sex thing.\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:41.000\nBecause he's like, oh, just one more anal.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nThat's what the original quote was.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nYeah, he would pull it out.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nBut I mean, I don't want to get graphic about it.\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nBut it became Americanized.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nIt became like he's just in a raincoat and he's just leaving the scene and coming back\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nin for another question.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:54.000\nBut in the Swedish Colombo, it was...\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:57.000\nPeter Falk was very, very anti that.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nHe always thought it was selling out.\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:03.000\nAnd he really was like, there should be the same amount of anal.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nYeah.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd he got in a huge fight with John Landis about that.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:12.000\nAnd in the fist fight, that's how he lost an eye.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nPeter Falk.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:14.000\nYeah, that's true.\n\n34:14.000 --> 34:15.000\nJohn Landis...\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nJohn Landis...\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:17.000\nGo ahead.\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:18.000\nSorry, go ahead.\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:19.000\nGo ahead.\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:20.000\nSorry.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nGive and take.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nGive and take.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nNo, no.\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nJohn Landis actually went back on set and was like, fuck it.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:28.000\nI'm just going to do the helicopter scene.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:31.000\nAnd he was so...\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:35.000\nIt's funny when you're sometimes like you could just see what the other person is thinking.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nWell, yeah, we connect the dots.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:42.000\nJohn Landis is here tonight, by the way, and happy that we're still connecting that dot.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nBy the way, I know John Landis.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nI did an episode of television with him.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:47.000\nYeah?\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:48.000\nWhat did you do?\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nFranklin and Bash, did you do an episode?\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nI did actually do Franklin and Bash.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:56.000\nAnd we shoot in Santa Clarita, which is about 30 miles north of...\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:59.000\nIt's just, you know, it's by like six flags, whatever.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:02.000\nAnd there was one day where we were shooting and he said...\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:06.000\nCharlie Chaplin shot modern times in Santa Clarita.\n\n35:06.000 --> 35:09.000\nNow I'm shooting fucking Franklin and Bash.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:10.000\nWait, no.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nAre you joking?\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nJohn Landis shot Franklin and Bash and said that?\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:16.000\nYeah, that's what he said while it was a long day.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nThree more hours.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nSurrounded by people who are on team Franklin and Bash.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nFranklin and Bash were there.\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:29.000\nAnd Franklin was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nBecause he's a dick, right?\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nAnd Bash was like, fuck this guy.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:37.000\nBecause Bash is like the John Lennon of Franklin and Bash.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:40.000\nIt was just such a weird moment for everyone.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:43.000\nBecause even there was also John Landis being like,\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nI'm doing Franklin and Bash now.\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:48.000\nAnd also just you look at like, you know,\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:52.000\nall the grand scheme of entertainment that people have made.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:55.000\nAnd, you know, it's just a weird...\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:58.000\nGod damn it, there was a...\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nNever mind.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:00.000\nWhat?\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:02.000\nNo, no, I can't.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:03.000\nYeah, no, it's not.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nAnd it's just Caddy who cares.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nI don't want to talk shit about people.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nBecause like how many times have I had an encounter\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nwith somebody and they're telling some story.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nI don't want to be represented by some random encounter\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.000\nby a bad person.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nYeah, everyone has a bad day.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nSome people have many...\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:21.000\nHarrison Ford fucking raped my mom.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:24.000\nThat's a bad day for two people.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:28.000\nAlthough your mom got a great story out of it.\n\n36:28.000 --> 36:31.000\nIf I showed you like what my mom wears\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nlike on an average day.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:36.000\nIt just says fuck me Indiana on it?\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:38.000\nHarrison Ford.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:41.000\nLike, like, yeah.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:46.000\nGet off of my plane and into my pussy.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:47.000\nIt says...\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nIt doesn't even make sense.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:50.000\nI said, mom, it doesn't make sense.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:51.000\nIs it your plane?\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:52.000\nYeah, I

I don't want to get out of home.\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\nBut, but, but, and then I always assumed\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nthat because he was like an icon of,\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nfor all I knew, he had like a, you know,\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:51.000\nhe didn't even have a Russian accent.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:53.000\nWell, but, I mean, he is Russian\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:55.000\nand nobody is really interesting, but Smirnov\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:57.000\nis not his real name and he did take\n\n41:57.000 --> 41:59.000\nthat because of the vodka\n\n41:59.000 --> 42:01.000\nwhere he was like, oh, they'll like this.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nThey'll like this vodka. They'll associate.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nSo he changed his name to Smirnov.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:07.000\nYeah, and Yakov sounds like Jakov.\n\n42:07.000 --> 42:09.000\nI assume they're both fake names.\n\n42:09.000 --> 42:11.000\nHe's the fucking Jakov vodka guy.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:13.000\nWait, are you saying that any part of that\n\n42:13.000 --> 42:15.000\nname is real? I think Yakov might be real.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:17.000\nI'm not sure, but I know Smirnov is not\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nand he took it from the vodka.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nAgain, what we thought the Chinese would like,\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:23.000\nhe took it to us and it fucking worked.\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.000\nInteresting.\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.000\nAnd by interesting, I mean the opposite.\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:33.000\nIn America, interesting things bore you.\n\n42:37.000 --> 42:39.000\nBut I actually feel better\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:41.000\nthinking that he actually,\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:43.000\nOh yeah, he knew what he was doing.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:45.000\nThat he's a big patriot because when I heard\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:47.000\nlike, oh, he's huge in Branson,\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:49.000\nI always, I assume every entertainer\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:51.000\nis like a liberal and a cosmopolitan,\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:53.000\nlike not a

his biopic\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:05.000\nis him and Branson going like,\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nwhy didn't they make this place sooner?\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nWell, I mean, he's a god that there's him\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nand there's another guy who I think is,\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:13.000\nhe's Asian, Japanese or Chinese, something\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nwho, he makes like millions of dollars\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:17.000\nand he has this, his whole family,\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nhe's got a white wife and they have a whole family\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nwhere they like, play the national anthem\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:23.000\non violins and stuff like that.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nLike, so it's sort of the place where\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nother, where immigrants go to like\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\ncompletely pander and sell out.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nThat's where I'll end up.\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nIt brings you back to a simpler time.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nYeah, where it was like, other countries were like,\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:39.000\nlike, it was like going to the zoo.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:41.000\nYeah,

experience.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:03.000\nThat's a terrible ratio.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:04.000\nYeah.\n\n46:04.000 --> 46:06.000\nKirkland's signature.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nOne in every six.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:11.000\nWe'll talk back to you.\n\n46:11.000 --> 46:12.000\nDo you want to try this?\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:14.000\nDan, these are the raw...\n\n46:14.000 --> 46:15.000\nI can't...\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.000\nCarbs, that stuff will kill you.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:22.000\nI'll stick to the hairy meat.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:25.000\nIt looks like somebody dipped all of these in cotton candy.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:27.000\nThat's how much...\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:35.000\nIt looks like the Goldbloom Body Snatchers movie.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:36.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n46:36.000 --> 46:38.000\nThe 70s Body Snatchers movie.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:39.000\nYeah.\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:41.000\nThey have the little tendrils of it.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:44.000\nAlright, let's...\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:53.000\nErin McGathy, can you come out?\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nBill, I think it's real sweet that you brought that.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.000\nOf course it's sweet.\n\n46:57.000 --> 47:00.000\nAnd it's not his fault that one bag was bad.\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:01.000\nHoney, I'm sorry.\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\nThat sounded so condescending.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nHoney, we would talk about it all night.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:07.000\nListen, honey, I would have said that to a guy, too.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:08.000\nBut this is a different...\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:09.000\nThis was a different...\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:10.000\nTwo different bags.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:13.000\nBut I'm guessing that the company that he got that from,\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:17.000\nit's a real family organization.\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:20.000\nAnd sometimes things slip through the cracks.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nI'm going to eat all the rest of it.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:25.000\nWell, the other end of the spectrum is that photo\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:28.000\nthat was circulating on the internet where the guy found\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:32.000\na 1989 McDonald's cheeseburger in his coat pocket.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nIt had not.\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:36.000\nAnd it looked just like it does on the menu.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nWho's supposed to go bad?\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:42.000\nThis is what's supposed to happen to food.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nIf it has life in it, yeah.\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:47.000\nThe other life is supposed to want to eat it.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.000\nI mean, even if it was all covered in mold,\n\n47:49.000 --> 47:51.000\nthe sentiment is still really...\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:52.000\nOh, of course.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:53.000\nNo, Bill...\n\n47:53.000 --> 47:54.000\nNo, really.\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:56.000\nI'm the person who brings unsolicited cakes.\n\n47:56.000 --> 48:01.000\nYeah, it's totally A for effort, F for fungus.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:07.000\nI think we were very...\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:09.000\nI think we went very easy out of it.\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:13.000\nAnd Bill, I hope you don't mind me outing you.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:15.000\nBill was tearing up as we were sitting,\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:17.000\nand Dustin and I were watching him tear up.\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:19.000\nYou weren't tearing up, were you?\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:20.000\nBill?\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.000\nWere you really tearing up?\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:24.000\nOh, Bill, this is wonderful.\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:27.000\nYou've made the podcast better.\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nYou've made the podcast.\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:34.000\nIf he brought food to actually provide sustenance and joy\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:37.000\nfor other people, then it would be fair to assume\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:40.000\nhis worst nightmare would be that it was in fact disgusting.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:42.000\nAnd I totally relate to that.\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:44.000\nThat that would make me tear up, too.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:46.000\nEspecially if it was something that you really love,\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:49.000\nthis specific beef jerky that you had shipped in.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:51.000\nBut, I mean, I feel...\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nI mean, it all comes out in the wash.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:55.000\nIt's all karmically balanced, because that's, I mean...\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.000\nBut everything's fine.\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:58.000\nYeah, it's awesome.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.000\nAnd you should be able to laugh at it.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:01.000\nWe're all...\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:02.000\nYay!\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nYeah, we've all been talking about this jerky,\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nand it's been awesome.\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:09.000\nI mean, the jerky could not have tasted as good\n\n49:09.000 --> 49:12.000\nas making fun about it feels.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nAnd also, as I've said before,\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nwhen I was on the playground and people would pick on me,\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:19.000\nI would never cry.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:21.000\nLike, no matter how hard anyone hit me,\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:23.000\nno matter how many showers they told me to take,\n\n49:23.000 --> 49:27.000\nthe thing that would make me burst into tears\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nwas the fucking good-natured guy coming up and going,\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:31.000\ncome on, leave him alone!\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:33.000\nMaybe he doesn't want to take showers!\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:36.000\nAnd then I'd be like, who would take your teammates?\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:38.000\nWho would kill myself?\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.000\nWell, I didn't come up and say, like,\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nhey, man, maybe he likes fungus.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nMaybe he wanted everyone to eat some fungus.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nThat's not what I said.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:47.000\nI wasn't...\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:49.000\nMaybe someone stick up for Aaron.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nI'm attacking her too much.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:52.000\nBill, are you...\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:53.000\nBill, are...\n\n49:53.000 --> 49:54.000\nHow you doing?\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.000\nI'm okay.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.000\nI'm all right.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:57.000\nAll right!\n\n49:57.000 --> 49:59.000\nI don't know what I thought was gonna happen.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:01.000\nBill's awesome.\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:02.000\nWhatever.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:05.000\nWell, it was great.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:07.000\nHe's gonna go home tonight.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:09.000\nOpen a window to his snowy front yard,\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:11.000\nput a puck crown on,\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:14.000\na crown of twigs,\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nand then go into his father's den.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:18.000\nWe watched that right before we came here.\n\n50:18.000 --> 50:21.000\nOr he could just eat one of his turkeys.\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:27.000\nBill, you're not allowed to cry another tear\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:29.000\nuntil someone dies.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:31.000\nBill, we're all okay,\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:33.000\nbut the question was absolutely wonderful.\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:35.000\nAlso, I don't know if I washed my hands\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:37.000\nwhen I made that cake.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:38.000\nWho knows?\n\n50:38.000 --> 50:40.000\nHe saved the last bag for himself.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nHe saved the last bag for himself, he said.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.000\nThat's fine.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:46.000\nBill, our job is to make sure you do not eat it.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nI don't know why they're so crazy about guns.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nIn Texas, I mean, when one piece of meat\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\ncould take out a whole audience.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:56.000\nIt's like, Jesus,\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:58.000\nwe can still defend ourselves against the enemy,\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:00.000\nobviously, if that's what the concern is.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.000\nBut yeah, you don't need background checks\n\n51:02.000 --> 51:03.000\nfor this jerky.\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:06.000\nIf anyone could take anything away from this podcast,\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nnever put yourself out there.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nNever.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nNever be generous, never put yourself out there.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.000\nI think the message is,\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\ndon't push yourself out there\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:17.000\nif you have fungus goods.\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:21.000\nI mean, meat is a real limb.\n\n51:23.000 --> 51:25.000\nIt's an actual limb, of course.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:26.000\nNo.\n\n51:28.000 --> 51:30.000\nWe're not bullying Bill.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.000\nNo, we're not.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:34.000\nWe think it's wonderful that he did this.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nIt's wonderful.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.000\nThis is a stage full of people who are very bullied\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:40.000\nwho are trying to un-bully.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:43.000\nYeah, it's like, well, I was grapple with that stuff.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:47.000\nWhen you say don't put yourself out there,\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:50.000\nsarcastically, I feel very strongly about that.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:52.000\nWhenever people come up and talk and share things and stuff,\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:54.000\nI always want to make sure that we don't do\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.000\nthe Jay Lenoey kind of like,\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:58.000\noh, well, someone's talking,\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:00.000\nso if they use a T instead of an S,\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:03.000\nwe're going to fucking throw a parade for the letter T.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:06.000\nI mean, I know we're jumping on the fucking fungus on the beef,\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:10.000\nbut there's another rule of entertainment and conversation\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nwhich is go where the heat is.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:18.000\nWe all know that Bill didn't make fungus grow.\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nHe's not God.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:23.000\nWe're not going to talk about it any sport.\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:25.000\nI mean, more.\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:31.000\nI'm so happy you talked about the Christian Bale.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:34.000\nI really think this jerky is growing on me.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:41.000\nI genuinely, Bill, nothing but love.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:43.000\nThis is awesome.\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:45.000\nI think this is great.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:47.000\nHow much less interesting would it have been\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:49.000\nif this was just like really good jerky?\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:51.000\nI think it's awesome that it has fungus in it.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nThe real villain is this man\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nwho presented the moldy jerky.\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:57.000\nI'm just kidding, please don't go that way.\n\n52:57.000 --> 52:59.000\nNo, come on.\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nThat took guts.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.000\nHis car's going to explode in the parking lot.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:05.000\nHe's the whistleblower.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nIt takes balls.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:09.000\nHe was in a room full of pleasure\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.000\nand he had to hold up a rabbit's foot and go,\n\n53:11.000 --> 53:13.000\nwell, just so you know,\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.000\nthis one's reproductively viable,\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:21.000\nwhich is why you can see the white.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:25.000\nWhich in France would probably cost a million dollars.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:29.000\nHey, the fungus was inside us the whole time.\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:31.000\nAll right, let's start playing.\n\n53:31.000 --> 53:33.000\nI wasn't able to be here a couple of weeks ago\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nand Duncan Trussell played my character.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:39.000\nAnd I on purpose did not\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\ncatch myself up on what happened\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nto Christopher.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.000\nSo I don't know.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.000\nI basically blacked out for\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.000\nChristopher blacked out for a week\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:51.000\nand now I want to find out what\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.000\nwhat happened.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:55.000\nThat makes sense. I mean, that's natural.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:57.000\nAll right, so should we do the music?\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:59.000\nWell, we need somebody to play Jeff's character.\n\n53:59.000 --> 54:01.000\nShould we have to?\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nBill, you want to play Jeff's character?\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:05.000\nBill!\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:09.000\nBill is playing Jeff's character.\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:11.000\nI'll give it a shot. Do I have a character sheet?\n\n54:11.000 --> 54:13.000\nYeah, you want to pass these out.\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:16.000\nIs this the D&D music that's happening?\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:18.000\nOn the previous episode,\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:21.000\nour heroes, this is too moody.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:24.000\nWe're still lost in a shadow plane\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:26.000\nafter killing Breffi, the Spirey.\n\n54:26.000 --> 54:28.000\nIt's Dustin Marshall on...\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.000\nIs this? Oh, on DJ.\n\n54:30.000 --> 54:32.000\nThat's cool.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:34.000\nBreffi, the spirey denizen of the dark.\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:36.000\nTo the north, behind the dark pillars,\n\n54:36.000 --> 54:38.000\nstood an imposing and flickering fence.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nAnd to the south, the sound of beating hooves\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:42.000\nwas once again audible.\n\n54:42.000 --> 54:44.000\nSwiftly following the sound of hooves\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:46.000\nwas none other than Tylenol with Codeine,\n\n54:46.000 --> 54:48.000\nthe unicorn.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.000\nAnd with him, terrible news.\n\n54:50.000 --> 54:52.000\nTylenol's force had been raised to the ground\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:55.000\nby deviant creatures from another dimension.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:57.000\nAs it dawned on Sharpie that his errant fireballs\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.000\nmay have decimated the commie force,\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:01.000\nhe was quick to admit his error\n\n55:01.000 --> 55:04.000\nand Codeine quicker to forgive the transgression.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.000\nAt the same time, Chris de Burgh,\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.000\nwho had been feeling out of sorts\n\n55:08.000 --> 55:10.000\nduring the last combat,\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:13.000\nspoke nonsense and carved strange prophecies\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\ninto his own arm.\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:18.000\nAnd requested he be impaled upon Tylenol\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.000\nwith Codeine's one horn.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:22.000\nConfused and likely disturbed\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nby the sudden masochistic bend,\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:26.000\nthe party investigated the gate\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:28.000\nand set off a trap.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:30.000\nChris and Quirk were pinned by shadowy bindings.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:32.000\nSharpie leapt over a massive shadow gate\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.000\nand deactivated the trap,\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:37.000\nfreeing his friends, but the victory was short-lived.\n\n55:37.000 --> 55:39.000\nA party of shadows with bladed limbs\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.000\npoured from the darkness behind the gate\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:43.000\nand a great combat ensued.\n\n55:43.000 --> 55:46.000\nSo, so great.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:50.000\nOur heroes managed to cut down two of the foes,\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:52.000\nbut four remain.\n\n55:52.000 --> 55:54.000\nOh, we stopped right in the middle of the fight.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.000\nYeah, it was a pretty intense fight.\n\n55:56.000 --> 55:58.000\nWasn't there a moment, maybe this was just facetious\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:01.000\nand didn't actually happen, but where Chris de Burgh,\n\n56:01.000 --> 56:03.000\nJeff and Chris de Burgh were fucking\n\n56:03.000 --> 56:05.000\nand I was jerking off on them and rapping.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:07.000\nThat was probably just to end the show.\n\n56:07.000 --> 56:09.000\nWait, what?\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.000\nIs that canon?\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:15.000\nI had to ask myself that as I reviewed the episode.\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:18.000\nIt wasn't canon specifically because...\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:20.000\nIf we did that, we'd all be dead.\n\n56:20.000 --> 56:23.000\nYeah, because you stopped time to go into rap,\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:25.000\nwhich halted combat time\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\nand either your heads would all have been\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:30.000\nsliced to pieces in the ensuing dance number,\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:32.000\nor it didn't happen.\n\n56:32.000 --> 56:35.000\nSo... Okay, I have a couple questions.\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:37.000\nSure.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:41.000\nYou feel a pain in your stomach and your right arm.\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:45.000\nOkay, my first question.\n\n56:45.000 --> 56:48.000\nWhen you say impaled on the unicorn,\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:50.000\nwhat does that mean?\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:52.000\nSexual. What did I do?\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:54.000\nNo, no, um, yeah, so...\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:56.000\nOkay, so at some point...\n\n56:56.000 --> 56:58.000\nOh, guys, I just came too.\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:00.000\nWhat's this with the unicorn?\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:03.000\nYour arm and still bleeding on your flesh\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:06.000\nis scrawled the scars of your dagger.\n\n57:06.000 --> 57:09.000\nThey say, how can you have a video game podcast\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:12.000\nand not play Starcraft 2?\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:17.000\nThese words are meaningless.\n\n57:17.000 --> 57:19.000\nYeah.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:21.000\nIt's hibijibi stuff.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:23.000\nAlso, you had sex with Quirk.\n\n57:23.000 --> 57:25.000\nThat didn't happen, though.\n\n57:25.000 --> 57:27.000\nWhat about the unicorn? What did I do?\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.000\nYou cut it into your arm\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.000\nand invited the unicorn to stab you with his horn,\n\n57:31.000 --> 57:33.000\nwhich he did with great vigor\n\n57:33.000 --> 57:36.000\nand dealt to you about 11 damage, I believe.\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:39.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:42.000\nYou should be lucky to cut off his fingers\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.000\nbecause he was gunning for that for a while.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:46.000\nI gave him a healing potion.\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:50.000\nHis mom died. Quirk hands you a potion.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:53.000\nOh, my God. Did she really?\n\n57:53.000 --> 57:55.000\nYeah. You didn't know that?\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:57.000\nNo.\n\n57:57.000 --> 57:59.000\nYou didn't? I don't know.\n\n57:59.000 --> 58:01.000\nHe sounded like he got a new surfboard or something.\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.000\nI don't know why I assumed you knew Duncan.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:06.000\nWhat sucks now is that I'm the asshole\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:10.000\nfor being upset that he would act out.\n\n58:10.000 --> 58:13.000\nI don't know what I would do if my mom passed away.\n\n58:13.000 --> 58:17.000\nI would probably have Duncan's character impaled by the unicorn.\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:20.000\nI think one thing's for sure.\n\n58:20.000 --> 58:23.000\nWe should fight these Shadowmasters and kill them.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:26.000\nWe gotta fuck Jeff. Let's go.\n\n58:26.000 --> 58:29.000\nOh, yes. Sorry, Bill.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:32.000\nBell, I know that we have followed that.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:34.000\nBecause he's fucked everything.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:37.000\nAnd marbles around.\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:39.000\nAnd did he have sex with marbles already?\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:40.000\nNo, that never happened.\n\n58:40.000 --> 58:42.000\nAll right, well, let's kill these Shadow Creatures\n\n58:42.000 --> 58:45.000\nand then we'll all run a train on Jeff.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:48.000\nI'm going to put it at the Shadow Creatures' turn.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nThere's four of them left. Two of them were cut down,\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:52.000\nI believe, by the blade of Quirk.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:56.000\nSo one of them is actually trying to strangle Quirk\n\n58:56.000 --> 59:00.000\nwith his limb as this smoky gas that's choking him down.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:01.000\nThat's you, Bill.\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:02.000\nYeah.\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:03.000\nYou're Quirk.\n\n59:03.000 --> 59:04.000\nYou're Quirk.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:07.000\nAll right, the rest of the shadows rear back\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nand their limbs turn into smoke\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:12.000\nand they flow towards you with an amazing speed.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:16.000\nYou can try to dodge, but you fail miserably.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:18.000\nThat is two of you do.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:21.000\nHowever, Chris de Burgh manages to jump out of the way\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:22.000\nwith the smoke.\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:24.000\nThe rest of you, you feel the smoke.\n\n59:24.000 --> 59:26.000\nIt hits you right in the face and it's all black\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:27.000\nand you can't see for a moment.\n\n59:27.000 --> 59:29.000\nAnd then it forces itself down your throat\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.000\nand you feel yourself coughing and choking on smoke\n\n59:31.000 --> 59:35.000\nbecause you're in a terrible fire.\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.000\nNo damage, though.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.000\nI'm going to use my talking dagger\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.000\nand try to cut one of the tentacles for my neck.\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nThis is smoke, it's not tentacles.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:45.000\nI'm still going to try to cut at it.\n\n59:45.000 --> 59:48.000\nOkay, go for it.\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:50.000\nAll right, you successfully strike the smoke.\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:54.000\nHowever, being smoke, it is instantly parted and reformed.\n\n59:54.000 --> 59:59.000\nI feel like it gave you a clue that that was not going to work.\n\n59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000\nIt's a talking dagger.\n\n01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000\nThat's what his character would do, probably.\n\n01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nI cough.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000\nYeah, you do.\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000\nThat's a given.\n\n01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000\nDo you want to try and expel this from your lungs?\n\n01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000\nYes.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000\nOkay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000\nYeah, I cough and I run backwards really quickly.\n\n01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000\nAttempting to both to fade\n\n01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nand void your lungs of the terrible gas within.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nYou manage to choke back a bit.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000\nYou're gaining a bit of breath.\n\n01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000\nYour head grows a bit clearer,\n\n01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nbut still trying to invade.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000\nChoke, yeah.\n\n01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nIt says you don't have smoke bombs.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nDoes that mean bombs that would hurt smoke?\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000\nThey only blow up smoke.\n\n01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nNo, no, for like diversions and whatnot.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000\nMaybe a dance party would start or something.\n\n01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nI can't help but notice on my character sheet,\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000\nbecause over the weeks,\n\n01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nthese things get soaked with wine and vodka,\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000\nand you've had to create character sheets.\n\n01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000\nEach time you do an English teacher,\n\n01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000\nyou kind of circle things and put exclamation points.\n\n01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nI circled the soul of growth,\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000\nbecause that's the most powerful artifact\n\n01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nthat you guys have encountered so far.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nAnd I circled your temporary stats,\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000\nbecause you lost strength and constitution\n\n01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000\nwhen your shadows ran away.\n\n01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000\nI thought that was relevant.\n\n01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000\nBut you're letting me know\n\n01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000\nthat the soul of growth is important here.\n\n01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000\nNo, it's not.\n\n01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000\nI will let you know it's not important in this area of the town.\n\n01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nI just circled it,\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nbecause it's literally the most powerful object\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000\nyou guys have encountered so far.\n\n01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nSharpie?\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000\nI think it's your turn.\n\n01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000\nI'll walk that back.\n\n01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nIt might be useful.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000\nIs it my turn?\n\n01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nAnd as I recall,\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000\nI was limited to level one and two spells.\n\n01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000\nYeah, you're still on a three, level three ones.\n\n01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000\nLevel three ones?\n\n01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nI can still cast?\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nNo, you're out of them.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000\nOh, I'm out of them.\n\n01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000\nAll right.\n\n01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000\nI should eat more often.\n\n01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nMe too, brother.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nWell, Goldberg brought you some chips.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000\nYeah, in a milky way.\n\n01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nYeah, but by the time I start eating that,\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000\nit'll be done.\n\n01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nAnd then who knows how long it'll take\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000\nfor the nutrients to absorb.\n\n01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nIf you eat, you feel not hungry right away.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nPretty much how food works.\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nNo.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nI will categorically deny that there is like a time\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nthat it takes for your brain to register\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000\nthat you're full and satiated.\n\n01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nBut you're full, but like if you're thirsty,\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000\nyou drink water, you're great immediately.\n\n01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000\nYeah, yeah, sure.\n\n01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000\nYeah, for thirst, definitely.\n\n01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000\nI feel like the same principle, but...\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nIt's really not.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000\nYou do...\n\n01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nYou do you, Spencer.\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nI do me.\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nAll right, fuck it.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nScorching ray.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nI mean, I don't have anything clever to do.\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000\nWaving your hands in a magical manner.\n\n01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nYou fire off a couple bolts of fire\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000\ntowards the shadow.\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nPrestigeige to my scorchum!\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000\nIt strikes one directly in the...\n\n01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000\nthe right arm, the right blade arm.\n\n01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000\nOh, nice.\n\n01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nThat happens.\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nThat's not really relevant.\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000\nBut dealing...\n\n01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000\neverybody shut up.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000\nTwelve damage.\n\n01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nYou know, we weren't saying anything.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nI know.\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nThat was a joke.\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000\nGod needs a snack.\n\n01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000\nYeah, the master needs a snack.\n\n01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nDid somebody get...\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000\ngot a bag of animal crackers?\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000\nDealing twelve damage.\n\n01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000\nIt staggers back a couple of steps\n\n01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000\nand you can see his smoky arm\n\n01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nkind of flutter a bit.\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000\nLike, keeps on keeping on.\n\n01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nOkay.\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nI...\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000\nWait, I haven't done anything yet.\n\n01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000\nHe asked a question,\n\n01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000\nbut he hasn't actually taken an action.\n\n01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nCan I use acid?\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000\nWill that help?\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000\nI have vials of acid.\n\n01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000\nSo, yeah, if you pour that on something,\n\n01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nit could, like, burn away at it\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000\nand potentially cause damage.\n\n01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nAll right, well, I sort of take a vial of acid\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000\nand I throw it at one of the...\n\n01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000\nthe guy that he was...\n\n01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000\nthat he hit.\n\n01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000\nThat's a strategic move, definitely.\n\n01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nYeah, you strike him.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nRearing back,\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nyou whip your hand forward\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nand fling the half-open vial of acid.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nIt smacks the guy directly in the face\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000\nand shatters on impact\n\n01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nand you see caustic green liquid fizzle\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000\nand burn on the being surface\n\n01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000\ndealing four damage.\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000\nThat's barely anything.\n\n01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000\nYou know, Bill got lampooned\n\n01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nfor attacking it with a knife.\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nWhat's more logical about attacking smoke with an acid?\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nWell, but he attacked just the smoke.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nI threw it at the source of the smoke,\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000\nwhich is some sort of physical being.\n\n01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000\nOh, he just found out I'm not listening.\n\n01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nThere's a physical being.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000\nThere's some beings.\n\n01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000\nI thought there were shadow dudes.\n\n01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000\nWhose turn is that?\n\n01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000\nI mean, it's the shadow monster's turn, yeah.\n\n01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nSo you can feel this choking kind of...\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000\nkind of gaining a hold over you.\n\n01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000\nYou kind of...\n\n01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000\nyour limbs are getting kind of numb\n\n01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nand your mind's going a bit dim,\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000\nlike you might lose consciousness pretty soon.\n\n01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000\nI would say that's the three of you\n\n01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000\nagain, not you, because you're dodged, yeah.\n\n01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000\nOkay.\n\n01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000\nHowever, two of the guys seeing that you haven't been,\n\n01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000\nyou know, affected by this,\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000\ncharged towards you and sliced at you with their bladed limbs.\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000\nI use my uncanny dodge.\n\n01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000\nYou might think that.\n\n01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000\nUncannily, you managed to dodge one of the blows,\n\n01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000\nbut the other strikes you directly in the right thigh.\n\n01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nSpecifically.\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000\nDealing seven damage.\n\n01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000\nOkay, we're gonna fuck it up.\n\n01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nPutting it at Quark's turn.\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000\nGuys, we don't...\n\n01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000\nI don't know what to do.\n\n01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nLike, how do we kill these guys?\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000\nSometimes the game's a lot more, like, simpler.\n\n01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000\nYou know, you just do the same thing over and over.\n\n01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000\nAm I in a position where I can try to cleave with Farsword?\n\n01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000\nThe Farsword's used up, you can cleave, though.\n\n01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000\nAlright, try to cleave.\n\n01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000\nDefinitely.\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000\nYeah.\n\n01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000\nGo for it.\n\n01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000\nYeah, go for it.\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000\nYeah, that's not bad.\n\n01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000\nOkay, yeah.\n\n01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000\nWhipping out your sword,\n\n01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000\nyou slice directly through the damaged shadow creature,\n\n01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nand you manage to deal...\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000\nOh, wow, that's pretty good.\n\n01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000\n14 damage, felling the guy in a single strike.\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000\nYeah!\n\n01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000\nYour sword carries through\n\n01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000\nand hits the next guy directly\n\n01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000\nwhere it would be a rib on a normal person,\n\n01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000\nbut he's a shadow guy.\n\n01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000\nDealing a further 17 damage.\n\n01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000\nYeah!\n\n01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000\nWhoa!\n\n01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000\nBut, but...\n\n01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000\nHe brought bad meat.\n\n01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000\nTemper your applause.\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000\nIn real life, he is killing us slowly.\n\n01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000\nHe has dealt us 17 damage.\n\n01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000\nThis fortitude saves not optional.\n\n01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000\nWas that a smoked rib?\n\n01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nWhat? Yeah.\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000\nAlright, yeah!\n\n01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000\nWait, I didn't get...\n\n01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nI didn't hear it.\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000\nAlright.\n\n01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000\nAlright, so that was good.\n\n01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nSo now there's three left.\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000\nYeah, so there's three left\n\n01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000\nputting in a more rainstorm.\n\n01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000\nOkay, so there are shadows,\n\n01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000\nbut they're also smoke,\n\n01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000\nand the shadows are going into our throats,\n\n01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nbut we can sometimes cut them as swords\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000\nand sometimes not.\n\n01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000\nYou can cut smoke with a sword,\n\n01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000\nbut it doesn't have any effect on the smoke.\n\n01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nThat's what happened.\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000\nThere are physical beings\n\n01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nwhose limbs are transmuting to smoke\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000\nor some sort of gash.\n\n01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000\nSo go for the sword side, I would say.\n\n01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000\nSo I can either treat the sword to the symptom.\n\n01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000\nAlright.\n\n01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000\nI take out three arrows!\n\n01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000\nThree arrows.\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000\nYou tie them to your feet.\n\n01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000\nAnd I take a nap.\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000\nIs it possible to fire three arrows\n\n01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000\nwhile also guzzling some water?\n\n01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000\nNo.\n\n01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000\nYou can guzzle some water\n\n01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000\nand then fire three arrows.\n\n01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000\nNo, wait, you can't.\n\n01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nDon't go for the water,\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000\njust do the arrows, I would say.\n\n01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000\nEither way.\n\n01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000\nWell, because of smoke,\n\n01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nDan's looking at me\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000\nconfusedly.\n\n01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000\nSmoke.\n\n01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000\nSmoke makes you thirsty?\n\n01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000\nWell, I mean,\n\n01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000\nI've tried to like push out the smoke with fire.\n\n01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000\nI can't put fire in,\n\n01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nor with water.\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000\nI can't put fire in my throat.\n\n01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000\nOr just choking in the water.\n\n01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000\nI'm killing the guy in the front row, apparently.\n\n01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000\nI'm not going to trust you.\n\n01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000\nYou chose to wear that shirt tonight.\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000\nOh, that's a joke.\n\n01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nIt's a fine shirt.\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000\nIt's a very specific color.\n\n01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000\nGod damn it, guys.\n\n01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000\nI didn't mean it.\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000\nI didn't mean it.\n\n01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000\nI'm a big fan.\n\n01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000\nJust as long as we don't punish anyone\n\n01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000\nfor putting themselves out there.\n\n01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000\nLet's just fucking seek and destroy\n\n01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000\nanyone who wore a shirt tonight.\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000\nHey, nice head.\n\n01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000\nWhat'd your mom fuck up?\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000\nYeah, who'd your mom

01:14:31.000\nexcept instead of having like a whip handle,\n\n01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000\nyou'd whip it around and throw it\n\n01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nand hope to ensnare your foes with the legs.\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000\nIt won't hurt them.\n\n01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000\nIt'll hurt a little bit if you hit them,\n\n01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000\nnot much.\n\n01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000\nIt's mostly an attempt to trip.\n\n01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000\nOkay.\n\n01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000\nAll right.\n\n01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000\nWell, what I do is\n\n01:14:45.000

01:15:01.000\nAlso tie the red cap poison to that.\n\n01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000\nAnd I tie another thing of acid.\n\n01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000\nI should do that.\n\n01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000\nI put on my goggles at night\n\n01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nbecause those goggles of night\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000\nand all of that,\n\n01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nI just kind of throw it.\n\n01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nAll the good stuff.\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000\nAlso one of my shoes because, you know,\n\n01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nbecause no regrets,

01:15:35.000\nnon-aerodynamic objects actually\n\n01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000\npulls it off its course,\n\n01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nkind of falls a bit short.\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000\nJust sitting on the ground.\n\n01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000\nI go back and get my shoe.\n\n01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nI tied it all together.\n\n01:15:56.000 -->

the back, dealing a mere two damage.\n\n01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000\nOkay.\n\n01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000\nYeah.\n\n01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000\nYou got your shoe back though.\n\n01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000\nThat's cool.\n\n01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000\nHey, this could have gone a lot worse.\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000\nHow close am I?\n\n01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nYou are in melee range with these dudes.\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000\nI'm going to try to kick one back\n\n01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000\nand power attack another.\n\n01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000\nOkay.\n\n01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000\nOkay.\n\n01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000\nSo, it's kind of tricky to pull these two moves\n\n01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000\noff at the same time,\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000\nso I'm going to give you a penalty on the kick\n\n01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000\nbecause you're going to put more effort into the attack\n\n01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000\nprobably.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nJock alert.\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nPenalty on the kick.\n\n01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nThese are physical actions.\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000\nSomebody give this guy a P-Bone.\n\n01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000\nA Papst.\n\n01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000\nA Papst.\n\n01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000\nYou can't even pretend to talk Jock.\n\n01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000\nNah, real football home run there.\n\n01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nGo ahead.\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nSo, what happens after he does all that?\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nI don't even know anymore.\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000\nNo.\n\n01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nOkay.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nSo, you try to kick the guy,\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nbut his semi-solid form actually kind of morphs around it\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000\nand your foot kind of just gets stuck a little bit.\n\n01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nIt's not good.\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nIt's not comfortable, not feeling good.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nThis off-balance nature throws off your attack\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nand you swing a bit wide,\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000\ncatching one on the tip of his head.\n\n01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000\nIt doesn't hit him very hard,\n\n01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000\nbut you manage to nick him just a skosh.\n\n01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000\nDealing about six damage.\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000\nSix damage.\n\n01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nBro, I don't think you needed the kick.\n\n01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000\nI think that's what fucked us.\n\n01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000\nBut that's okay.\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000\nI threw all my belongings.\n\n01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000\nThrowing a garbage pile of stuff didn't help us.\n\n01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000\nGuys, we should all take a second and drink some P-bones.\n\n01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000\nAaron is asleep.\n\n01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000\nWe're just dying of the two of you are pickering about your high kicks.\n\n01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000\nWell, it's you.\n\n01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000\nIt's you, Sharpie.\n\n01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nCan I do anything?\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000\nYou have one more action before you lose consciousness.\n\n01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI have one more action.\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000\nI'm real sick.\n\n01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000\nYou're out.\n\n01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nAll right.\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000\nSorry.\n\n01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000\nOne more action.\n\n01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000\nI take this very seriously.\n\n01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000\nYou should.\n\n01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000\nMy final action.\n\n01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000\nYou might die.\n\n01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000\nI hope I don't.\n\n01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000\nMy final action is going to define me as a person.\n\n01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000\nThis is going to be your legacy.\n\n01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000\nWould you like to ask the audience?\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000\nI want to, can I do a lifeline?\n\n01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000\nYeah, go for it.\n\n01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000\nMy final action.\n\n01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000\nWho are you pointing at, Goldberg?\n\n01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000\nI agree, sir.\n\n01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000\nWhat about the guy that...\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000\nHe knows.\n\n01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000\nHe knows.\n\n01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000\nHe knows.\n\n01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000\nIs there anybody in the audience that really knows what they would do with their final...\n\n01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000\nAll right.\n\n01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000\nThat first hand up there.\n\n01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000\nSome entire badger?\n\n01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nSome entire badger.\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000\nIs that level three or is that...\n\n01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000\nI'll trust Adam.\n\n01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000\nWhy would you go with badger as opposed to...\n\n01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000\nBecause those are hilarious.\n\n01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000\nNo, I mean...\n\n01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000\nThey're really effective combatants.\n\n01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000\nAll right, all right.\n\n01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nForget it.\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000\nAnother word.\n\n01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000\nHis answer is he just cast a fucking combat spell.\n\n01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000\nI just wanted to make sure...\n\n01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000\nOh, it is level three, you guys.\n\n01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000\nSorry.\n\n01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nSorry to rain on everyone's parade.\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000\nLevel three spell.\n\n01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nAll right.\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000\nI'm gonna...\n\n01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000\nI know this is gonna seem repetitive.\n\n01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000\nYeah.\n\n01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000\nBut I got good results last time.\n\n01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000\nI'm gonna pull out...\n\n01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nOne of the shards.\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000\nOne of those crystal shards.\n\n01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000\nNot the Soul of Growth, but one of those shards that we were...\n\n01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nOkay.\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000\nWhat, we could do it in count.\n\n01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000\nIs that the Soul of Growth you're pulling out?\n\n01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nThis is one of the shards.\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000\nOkay.\n\n01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000\nWell, let's tell them.\n\n01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000\nThis is the shard of the unknown.\n\n01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000\nAnd words?\n\n01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000\nNothing.\n\n01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000\nNothing happened.\n\n01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000\nAll right, can I summon a badger?\n\n01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000\nIt's a level three spell.\n\n01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000\nYou're out of those.\n\n01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000\nAll right, well, it's the smoke.\n\n01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000\nAll right, look, Scorching Ray.\n\n01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nAll right.\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000\nCasting your arms in a magical manner.\n\n01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000\nYou fire off a couple bolts of fire.\n\n01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000\nYeah, that sounds good.\n\n01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nYeah, it does.\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000\nThat's good stuff.\n\n01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000\nThat's what my character says to you.\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000\nThat was good stuff.\n\n01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nDealing 18 damage and failing.\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000\nBadass.\n\n01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000\nSo you just leave it to me.\n\n01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000\nOne of the remaining creatures had exertion, however, was all it took.\n\n01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000\nYou feel yourself drift off and fall to the floor unconscious.\n\n01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000\nSo are there only two left now?\n\n01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000\nThere are only two left.\n\n01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000\nAnd there are only two left of you raising the stakes.\n\n01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000\nAll right, well, let's finish this battle real quick.\n\n01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000\nIs it their turn now?\n\n01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000\nYeah, so they actually, now that one of them has dropped dead\n\n01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000\nand the other two of you guys are, so it's like two on two, right?\n\n01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nThey kind of square off and they just charge towards you.\n\n01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000\nYou can see their limbs and their underbodies kind of turn into\n\n01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000\nthe smoky thing and they kind of turn into spectral forms\n\n01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000\nas they charge towards you and they actually just blast straight through you\n\n01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nand you feel a violent chill go through your body.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nYeah, violent indeed.\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000\nYou take nine damage.\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000\nYou feel your insides just feel as if they've been frozen solid somehow\n\n01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000\nand you double over in pain.\n\n01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000\nThat happens.\n\n01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000\nYou got P-boned.\n\n01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000\nFuck.\n\n01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000\nAll right, well.\n\n01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000\nThat is what getting P-boned is like.\n\n01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:23.000\nI untie all the things that I've tied up into a useless ball.\n\n01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nAnd so I'm pretty close to them, right?\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000\nYep.\n\n01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nI take a...\n\n01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000\nJust do something normal.\n\n01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000\nI don't have weapon at them.\n\n01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000\nBro, I got no weapons.\n\n01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000\nI'm haunting you like Ben Kenobi.\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000\nIs the wire saw something I can use against them?\n\n01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000\nYou have weapons, dude.\n\n01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nWire saw.\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nYou're like that one globetrotter from the globetrotter cartoon\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000\nthat would pull things out of his hair.\n\n01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000\nI love his afro, yeah.\n\n01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nI'll use a...\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nI use a telephone.\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000\nYou'll use a what now?\n\n01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000\nI use a telephone too.\n\n01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nCall an Uber and get out of here.\n\n01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000\nOkay, I use the bow.\n\n01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000\nI use the bow and it says I have times three critical.\n\n01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000\nYeah, that means if you critical hit, it's super effective.\n\n01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000\nAttack bonus plus nine.\n\n01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000\nDamage is in the hundreds.\n\n01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000\nAttack bonus plus nine is helpful to me, actually.\n\n01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nAll right, let's do it.\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000\nSo I rolled the attack and apparently you've hit.\n\n01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000\nSo firing an arrow from your short bow,\n\n01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000\nyou strike one of the remaining foes directly in his...\n\n01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000\nWhy directly every time?\n\n01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nWhy?\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000\nChest.\n\n01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000\nDealing six damage.\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nPlus nine.\n\n01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000\nPlus nine is your to hit.\n\n01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000\nThe damage is just the 1D...\n\n01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000\nI have 10, it might be 1D8.\n\n01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000\nLet's move past it.\n\n01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000\nYeah, putting in a quark stern.\n\n01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000\nCan I believe again?\n\n01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000\nWhat's on?\n\n01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000\nCan we believe again?\n\n01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000\nYeah, let's do that.\n\n01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000\nYeah, work last time, right?\n\n01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000\nAll right.\n\n01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000\nIt didn't work so well this time.\n\n01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000\nPulling...\n\n01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000\nIt didn't work last time.\n\n01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000\nHe put his foot through the guy and then neck the head.\n\n01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000\nI'm getting so mixed up, you guys.\n\n01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000\nThis is crazy.\n\n01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000\nWhat?\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nIf he flanks, then you can backstab him and end this fight and be awesome.\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000\nWell, yeah, but he's the flanking one.\n\n01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000\nHe doesn't get sneak attack damage.\n\n01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000\nYeah, that's true.\n\n01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nOkay.\n\n01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000\nYeah, you guys.\n\n01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000\nAnyway, so he doesn't hit is what I'm trying to say.\n\n01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000\nWith your great sword, you swing a bit, you know, you swing a bit,\n\n01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000\nbut you know, they just flew through you and you're all iced up inside.\n\n01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nSo that's tough.\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000\nYou don't hit.\n\n01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000\nIt happens.\n\n01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nOkay, is it their turn again?\n\n01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000\nYeah, it is.\n\n01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000\nSo fucked.\n\n01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nWe're fucked.\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000\nWe're so fucked.\n\n01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000\nWhat's going to happen?\n\n01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nAre you only able to dream?\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000\nYeah, do you want to dream?\n\n01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000\nWell, I mean, because we're unconscious.\n\n01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nYeah, that's why I'm asking if you want to dream.\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000\nOh, boy.\n\n01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000\nI dream of a cloud that's made out of horse fur.\n\n01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000\nAnd I take off all of my clothes and I cover myself in lotion\n\n01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000\nand I tumble across the horse fur and Fiona Apple's playing in the background\n\n01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nand pizzas come down from the sky and they fall on my face,\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nbut there are no calories.\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000\nAnd then also I defeat the enemy, I guess.\n\n01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nThat's my dream.\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000\nThat's a pretty good dream.\n\n01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nYeah, so the shadowy beings, both of their limbs.\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000\nWhat about my dream?\n\n01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000\nYeah, go for a dream.\n\n01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000\nYeah.\n\n01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000\nI have a dream that races get along.\n\n01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000\nHigh-roaded.\n\n01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000\nAny time you guys want to go back to that poll.\n\n01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000\nI have a dream that me and LimeShirt are signing the deal in a house together.\n\n01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000\nWhen in reality, you just won't let it go.\n\n01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000\nWhat's your name, Limey?\n\n01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000\nNone of this is making it better.\n\n01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000\nYeah.\n\n01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000\nAll of this is making it worse.\n\n01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000\nThis is like the bad touch of conversations.\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000\nIn my dream, Phil and I are creating...\n\n01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000\nYou had your dream.\n\n01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000\nYou rolled around in horse lotion.\n\n01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000\nI solved racism.\n\n01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000\nYou don't get to...\n\n01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000\nPhil and I self-hunger.\n\n01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nAlso, we built a dollhouse together.\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000\nThat's your second dream.\n\n01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000\nThird dream.\n\n01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000\nThere's one dream per turn, you guys.\n\n01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nI'm going to have to be firm on this.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000\nSpencer, how are we going to defeat these guys?\n\n01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000\nIs it going to take a second?\n\n01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nWell, I mean, I don't know.\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000\nNo, no, no, we're going to see this through.\n\n01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000\nI think we're about to die.\n\n01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000\nLet's hope so.\n\n01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000\nIs it their turn?\n\n01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000\nWhoa.\n\n01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000\nI don't get why that got a reaction.\n\n01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000\nBecause you seem grumpy.\n\n01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000\nBecause we're fucking hateful assholes.\n\n01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000\nWhat?\n\n01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nCan we cliff-hang it?\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000\nNo, we can't cliff-hang it.\n\n01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000\nYou guys are asleep.\n\n01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nIs their turn, right?\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000\nBoth of their limbs have turned into smoke at this point.\n\n01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000\nThey went through you, iced your insides.\n\n01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nYou twisted around, failed some attacks.\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000\nThat happened.\n\n01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000\nBoth of their limbs turned into smoke.\n\n01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000\nThey just fly directly towards you.\n\n01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000\nIt's like they're strangling you.\n\n01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000\nYou can actually feel your throats being throttled\n\n01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000\nas the smoke is invading your senses.\n\n01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000\nYeah, it's not good.\n\n01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nSo a moment ago, he had this whole growth out.\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nYeah, they lost consciousness.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000\nIt's like he's clutching it in his hand.\n\n01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nRight now, you can't move too much.\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000\nYou're being strangled.\n\n01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000\nYou're being exertion to move around.\n\n01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000\nI sneak behind one.\n\n01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000\nI'm going to lose consciousness.\n\n01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000\nIt's got its hands around your throat.\n\n01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000\nNot me, right?\n\n01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000\nYeah, both of you.\n\n01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000\nYeah, they squared off one each.\n\n01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nYeah, they're both taking on each of you guys.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000\nWell, I kind of stab his guy.\n\n01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nLike, I do this kind of thing.\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nOkay.\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000\nAll right.\n\n01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nLike, you know, because I can't reach my guy,\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000\nI kind of like...\n\n01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nHey, I'll get your guy.\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000\nThat makes sense to me.\n\n01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000\nSo yeah, you do that.\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000\nYou stab him just a bit, dealing six damage.\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nJust a bit.\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000\nShit, we're dying.\n\n01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nShit!\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nShit!\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000\nNot this game.\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nYou could die.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nWe're going to die tonight.\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000\nQuark!\n\n01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nWhat you got, baby?\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000\nQuark!\n\n01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nWe're going to die!\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nIf I don't think I can actually grab the soul of growth,\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nI'm going to try to cleave again.\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nOkay.\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nSo, yeah, yeah, cleaving again.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nCool move, man.\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nOh.\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nI dig it.\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000\nUh-oh.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nHe knows something we don't know.\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000\nI don't like that.\n\n01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nSo those are Spencer's maniacally laughing.\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nOh, yeah, it's happening.\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000\nSo being strangled, actually, as it happens,\n\n01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nimpacts your accuracy, and you swing wildly,\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000\ntrying to cleave through both of these beings in one,\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nbut it's not happening.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000\nIt's not happening.\n\n01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nIt just doesn't happen.\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nThat's quite a buildup for not happening.\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000\nHe's just us dying.\n\n01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nYour grip loosens on the sword as it drops from your hands\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nand you fall to your knees.\n\n01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nOh, God.\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000\nI, um...\n\n01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nAre on the verge of unconsciousness.\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nI, uh, take this opportunity to, uh...\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nSo he, did he fuck me last night or no?\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000\nNo, he didn't.\n\n01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nOkay.\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nI think we have time for that.\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000\nWhy wasn't that anyone's dream?\n\n01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nI, uh, I put my, uh, soft penis inside him.\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nAnd have it grow.\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nLike the fungus is growing inside of me right now.\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nSummoning the last vestiges of your will to your mighty member.\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nNo.\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nI have a poison dagger.\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nOkay.\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nI like that better.\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nOkay.\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:04.000\nI take my poison dagger and I stab the bad guys.\n\n01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nYou miss.\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000\nI think we're all dying.\n\n01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nHow do I miss?\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nBecause, again, as it happens, when you're being strangled\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000\nand smoke's going down your throat and you're coughing and stuff\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nand wheezing and not breathing,\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nyou know, combat sort of gets harder.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nIt's just a thing.\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000\nIt's like, you know...\n\n01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nSurely we would have gotten you a sandwich.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nBut it didn't happen, did it?\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000\nI'm sitting here with a bag of chips and a Milky Way bar.\n\n01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nMurdering us.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nJust laying waste to dungeons and drifts.\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nWhat's it?\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nLike, like, like...\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nGo ahead.\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nCommit.\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nYou guys all lose consciousness.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nYou can't see anything.\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nWe all do.\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000\nCan my last move to be to put the bag of holding over one of these guys' heads?\n\n01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nYou could definitely try.\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nYeah, Bill.\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nOh, my God.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000\nBill, what if you murdered us?\n\n01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nI mean, do it.\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nDo it.\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nSo, over who's head again?\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nI want to smoke you guys.\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nI want to smoke you guys.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000\nWith your last dying...\n\n01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nNope.\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nDoesn't happen.\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000\nOh, no.\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nSorry.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nSorry, Bill.\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nSorry, Bill.\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000\nBill, your funness is growing on over this game.\n\n01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nSo we all go unconscious.\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nYeah, you're all unconscious.\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nThat's the place where we should...\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nUntil you regain it in the future.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000\nOr die.\n\n01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nOr die.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nIn the past.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000\nThat's like a logical answer.\n\n01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nThis is the fuck of a cliffhanger.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000\nThat's it.\n\n01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nHe and he.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000\nThanks, Bill.\n\n01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nThank you, Bill.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nThank you, Bill.\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nWell, what have we learned tonight, Camille?\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nDon't put yourself out there.\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nUnless you're fungus.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nUnless you're fungus.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nIn which case, go for it.\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nThe big winner tonight is fungus.\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nSeems like...\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nLike, you can die in D&D.\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nYou can get your ass kicked.\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nWhat happened?\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nAre we gonna...\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nThis is very upsetting.\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nI'm genuinely a little shaken.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000\nI'm genuinely shaken.\n\n01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nThat's what makes it a good game.\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nWe might all die.\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nAnd then what happens?\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nTo create new characters.\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nStart over?\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nLike a bunch of pussies.\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000\nHave you died in D&D before?\n\n01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nA million times.\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nApparently, someone was telling me about this documentary.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nWas it you, Spencer?\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nThis documentary about this dungeon master who got pissed off and they had this game\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nthat they'd been playing for years, like Five Guys.\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nDo you know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nYeah, it was me.\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nSorry.\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nAnd he got angry, he was having a shitty day, and he ended up killing all those people.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nAnd they all got really upset at him.\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nAnd then the documentary is set years later where this guy is going back to reconnect\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000\nwith all the people who he killed in the D&D game.\n\n01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nSo, Spencer, I'm sorry, even that you can't do in the documentary because it's already\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000\nhappened.\n\n01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nAll right.\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nI'll get through.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nWell, usually when Jeff's here, this is the point in the show where we don't know how\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nto end it.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nAll right.\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000\nI will keep the tradition alive.\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nSo, when was the last time you cried?\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nI can't remember when the last time I cried is.\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000\nProbably I watched probably some sad movie or something.\n\n01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nOkay.\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000\nWhy did I?\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nProbably cried.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000\nProbably watched.\n\n01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nMust have been some documentary.\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nProbably cried during some documentary.\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nThere's some rough ones out there.\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000\nThere's this one called, and I only name it so that you never watch it.\n\n01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nIt's called Dear Zachary, you know what I'm talking about?\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000\nDo not.\n\n01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nIf you haven't seen it, do not watch it.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nI'm genuinely saying, because Emily and I got into a lot of like real crime docs and\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nwe just watched them over and over.\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nAnd this was just one of them.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nIt should come with a fucking warning.\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\nLike, oh, do not watch this one.\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000\nThat's all.\n\n01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nThe movie should be called Do Not Watch This.\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000\nBecause it's a bunch of them about people wrongly imprisoned and then escaping and then\n\n01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nthis one is like too much.\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nSo, yeah.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nMan.\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nWell, I can only think that we've got to.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nDo the song?\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nDo the song?\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nThere's a song?\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nWell, don't you do a song about the whole show?\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nYeah, hit it.\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nWhat do you got in the booth?\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nYeah.\n\n01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nI feel like we learned a lot.\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nNow, usually they play a rap beat that does not end the show.\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nUsually it just goes into a terrible rap.\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nI'm ready for that.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000\nAnd then the show just has to end in spite of me trying to end it with a rap.\n\n01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000\nThis is going to be the first night where the rap is catastrophically brilliant.\n\n01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nIt just ends the show.\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000\nThose two words don't go together.\n\n01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000\nAll right.\n\n01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nYo.\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000\nLime shirt doesn't matter that you're in here.\n\n01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nFuck your mama without fear.\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nThat's stupid.\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nWho cares?\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nThis just seems...\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nSomething about that felt like really...\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nI wonder what it was.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nYou take the guy who's already been chat on and then talk about how you fucked his mom.\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nNow, without fear or regret.\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nYeah.\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000\nJust doesn't.\n\n01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nAll right.\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000\nAll right.\n\n01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nTopic, let me give me a topic.\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nFungus.\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nFungus.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nAll right, fine.\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000\nWe've discussed fungus.\n\n01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nOne more try.\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nOne more try.\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nRacism.\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nFungus.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nThe fungus of racism.\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000\nAnd softball.\n\n01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nYo.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nYo.\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nYo.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000\nYo.\n\n01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nYo.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nLittle mushrooms grow up in the air.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000\nSpores threaten.\n\n01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nThey don't care.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nThey got to go from one location to another.\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nThey fuck your daddy and they fuck your mother.\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nThey go from a piece of bread to some meat.\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nDon't care if they go down the street.\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nThey're mushrooms that spread through the air.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nThis...\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nIt doesn't work.\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nOkay.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nAll right.\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nHow do you end the show?\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nHow do you end a fucking show?\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000\nI was so into that rap.\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000\nYou have no idea.\n\n01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nI forgot there were people here.\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nI forgot.\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000\nI was comp-trolling.\n\n01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nI was these mushrooms fucking that guy's mom and dad.\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000\nYou got to figure out a way to end the show.\n\n01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nWell, no.\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nI think you just have to commit to the thing.\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nI feel like the rap is really good.\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nAnd I think you get to that moment where you think about it too much.\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nI feel like you have to just go with it and not quit and just keep going.\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nAnd at the end of the rap, it's going to be a beautiful piece.\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nHow do you know when the rap is over if it's made up?\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nAll right.\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nYou're right.\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000\nI'm full of shit.\n\n01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nIt's over when it feels like...\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nWell, can we make out?\n\n01:37:13.000
