00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Here ye, here ye!

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
The Senko de Mayo edition of Hormontown is in session!

00:15.000 --> 00:25.000
Please welcome the Mayor of Hormontown, Dan Harmon!

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Thank ye! Guest Comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani!

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Wow!

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Anybody come here to see Jeff Davis tonight?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Haha! Y'all's got fucked!

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Just wanted to make sure. You brought him something?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Oh, what did you bring him?

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Herpes. He can't get it twice.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Yeah, he's got it. No, you can't look that handsome and not have herpes.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Did you just have super cookies?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
For you in podcast land, experiencing this only through audio,

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
a guy who looks, I would describe as a sleepy Scott Thompson from Kids in the Hall

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
in an Oxford shirt, sitting by himself with a satchel between his legs,

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
said, I brought Jeff something and unzipped the satchel and pulled out a sealed bag of super cookies.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
There's probably vegan cookies, right?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Right, right. And it's because I also brought meat.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You also brought meat?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Oh, you didn't want him to be left out.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Okay, he's saying I also brought meat.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Sarah, what's your name?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
But what's that?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Bill.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Bill? Would you like to come up here? I mean, you brought meat.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
Wait, what's this? What's the back story on the meat?

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
We're about to find out. I mean, that's why, yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, okay.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
This is one of these people that I don't want to keep repeating what he's saying in the front row.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
What's funny is Bill looked at me like, come on, you know what the meat's about.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
No, nobody knows.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
All right, go ahead, Bill.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay, so have you ever had a food that you were like, oh my God, this is so awesome, I have to share it?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, all right, well, look, I shared it with you.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
You're like a great pitchman already.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
No, no, no, no, no, really.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
No, shared it with everybody.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Just look at infomercials, isn't it?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
No, shared it with your friends.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, have you ever cut an onion?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It's beef jerky.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Smoked teriyaki beef jerky.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It's in a bag.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Where is this from? Tell us what this is.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Texas.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Okay, you flew that back from Texas?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
No, it was shipped here.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
It's packaged a lot like you would imagine C4.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Or just poisoned beef jerky.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
All right, all right, all right. See, I knew somebody would say that.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
My dad used to serve me a lot of beef jerky.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
It really does look like poison.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come on.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
If you look at the ingredients, there's no poison on the label.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
If you're poisoning something, you're not going to scratch poison on the label.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
But also, if you notice in the package, there's also little floss things for your teeth, right?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
So if you're going to die, you better like have clean teeth.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, you brought us floss, too, because beef jerky.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
No, I'm sorry, Bill, where are you from?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Plainville, Wisconsin?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
A lot of different places.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Ed Geen's hometown?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I've actually lived a lot of different places.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
What's that?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I've lived a lot of different places.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I grew up in Indiana.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Okay.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
I moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, then moved to Australia, then moved to Vancouver, Canada, then to Texas.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Now I'm not here.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Where in Australia?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Brisbane.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
All right, story check.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Brisbane, Queensland.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
If you said Melbourne.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Seems legit.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:54.000
All right, instead of starting from the beginning and going forward, let's start from tonight where you show up with a satchel full of meat and step slightly backward.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I was out there waiting in line.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Right, okay, a little backward from that.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
To the point where you decide to come to the show with a satchel full of meat.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Why?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Tell us about...

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
One thing is that you're very excited about this jerky, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
You said if you had a crew...

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, yeah, but I didn't need to come up on stage to share it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Right, you just brought it because it's so good.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
And it's from...

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
And I was really concerned that you'd go, oh, that's very nice, but did you bring enough for the rest of the class?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I actually do have a couple more bags.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Oh, my God.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Most of our curiosity ended at...

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah!

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
There's two in there.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Dude, okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
There's two in there if you could open it up.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Dude, explain it to people.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
He is throwing out sacks and sacks of beef jerky.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So much beef jerky.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
There's two in there.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Just in Ziploc bags, too.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Like...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
No, no, no.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Once it retakes, that's how it's packaged.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
That's how it's packaged?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
I can reach the headlines tomorrow.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
It's packaged in little brown paper bags with packing tape.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Creator of community dies along with 30 of his biggest fans.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Wouldn't that be crazy?

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Like, that would be such a crazy, like, weird...

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
All of a sudden, the word meltdown would be like 9-11 or Boston, you know?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Like, I'm just like...

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
There's this weird thing that happened for those 15 years.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Everyone would go like, oh, man, I had a meltdown thing.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
That guy, the beef jerky.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Jeff is going to become a holy man.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
David Letterman would be making jokes about it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Like, references to it.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
No, Jay Leno would.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Leno would have the dancing beef jerkies.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, thank you.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you, Bill, for your mysterious jerky.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Thank you, Bill.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Are you going to try it, then?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Not just right now.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I mean, it's...

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
You know what?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
It would take so long to open the package.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
And if it wouldn't take so long to open the package,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
then maybe I'll never eat it.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It's sort of a...

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Somebody just came up with an open bag question.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
What flavor is that, sir?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Is that the teriyaki?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Does it say hot?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh, can I try it?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
But how much sugar is it?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
A lot of beef jerky has a lot of sugar in it.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
People don't know that.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It is one of...

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
It is one of the ingredients of sugar.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Oh, it's really good.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Can you throw me one, mister?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I'll catch it. Just throw it.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
All right.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
That was a terrible throw.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Thank you.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Thank you.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Is it weird or is it perfectly normal that everyone's first thought?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
It's human flesh. It's poison.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You know, like, whenever...

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I don't think we're weird.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Weird is the guy who brought tons of beef jerky.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
All right, so somebody in the audience is offering up...

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
has cultures of fungus growing on it.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Is this all fungus? I would not eat any of that.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Bill, how could you?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
One of the... Bill's holding his head in shame.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Bill, you didn't make this, right?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
He just brought it.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's very, very good. Thank you.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Thank you so much.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Texas, Steve.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
All right, dried beef from Texas,

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
shipped in a plastic bag.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Some air got into one of them.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
And life found a way.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
As Dr. Ian Malcolm would say.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
He would warn you about that.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
This one has a little bit of it, too, on there.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And I fucking took a bite of it.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Bill?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I bit into it thinking it would be cool if we all died

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
or if it turned out to be people.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
But the boring, sadder, more realistic thing

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
is that we'd all just, like, spend the next three days

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
shitting and puking.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, Jay Leno's not doing jokes about that.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, no one's going to care about that.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
That's like, we would just have a bachelor party

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
gone awry.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We just have three shitty days.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
All right, pulling up my Evernote note, note app.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh, so, okay.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
So I wanted to ask you something as a new comptroller.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Like, this is the kind of question I would ask Jeff.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
No, no, I'm a hypochondriac,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
so now I feel like I ate fungus and...

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Well, you should feel like it because you did.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I was sitting...

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I've been sitting in my bed playing a lot of Minecraft

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
on my laptop.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
I got a new souped-up MacBook

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
and I've been playing a lot of Minecraft.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm totally distracted by the thought of, like, just...

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
I can feel it growing inside me.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Inside is something of a giant spider web right now.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
I was listening to the people next door outside my window.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
They were having some kind of party in the backyard.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And they were having a lot of fun.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You know, there's a distinctive sound to an outdoor party.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Everyone's having a good time.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
And I was sitting in bed playing Minecraft on my laptop.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And I didn't feel left out,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
but I was happy that they were having a party.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And I started to think, you know,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
I should just have people come over to my house

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
and have a party in the backyard,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
but not invite myself,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
and I could just sit and play Minecraft.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Okay, is that...

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
agoraphobia, or is that just...

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
I know it's a tough evite to craft.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
I've heard stories of, like,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
you're out in LA and everybody works for somebody,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
somebody's an assistant to so-and-so.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I've heard stories about Eddie Murphy,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
that he would have these big parties.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
He has these big parties.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Post-Pluto Nash Eddie Murphy has these parties.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Where, just like, because he's Eddie Murphy,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
he could just invite a million people

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
and he has people, like, throw a party.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
And he kind of, like, hangs back

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
and he'll make an appearance on a balcony

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and kind of wave to people like a pope.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And then, like, there'll be a certain point

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
where everybody gets kicked out,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
but up until then, they're just partying at Eddie Murphy's house.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But they're not partying with Eddie Murphy.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I actually like that idea,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
because I do like going to parties,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
but I can also understand, like, some days,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I'm like, I just want a party to happen, like, around me.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I want to hear it, but I don't want to participate in it.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
And it does sound like, if you're playing Minecraft

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
and people are having fun outside and it's your doing,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
you made all this fun happen.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I like listening to it.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
You know, I used to, and it reminded me that

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I used to sit backstage at the comedy tent in Milwaukee.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
What is the comedy tent?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It's Summer Fast. This is where I would meet,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
like, your various headliners would come through town.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You're Richard Lewis' and you're Louis Anderson's

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and you're John Stewart's and things,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
and you'd pick their brains.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
You're Bob Goldthwaite's, for instance.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
And, like, I remember I would sit backstage

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
and listen to the headliners entertain, like, 3,000 people,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and I would just, I just liked the sound of them

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
laughing and having a good time.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
But I didn't want to.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
It's weird because you'd think of me as a very narcissistic,

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
vain, control-freaky, ego-driven guy.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Like, I would, like, oh, I want to be the reason

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
why they're laughing.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Maybe I'm a better person than you think.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Maybe I just want people to be having a good time,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and maybe if you want something done right,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
you have to do it yourself.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Maybe you just explained narcissism.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I certainly just exemplified it.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
All right, well, I have a quick question

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
about Richard Lewis. You met him.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
What was he like?

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
He's really suave and he wears a lot of bright colors.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Like, he gets off stage and he's like,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
oh, get it off, get it off, this black turtleneck

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
this trench coat.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I can't, I honestly, I can't remember.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Like, most of those guys, it was like,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I should be a nuisance.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
I remember John Stuart being really cool,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
really nice, as you would imagine he would be.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That sticks out in my head.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I remember Bob Goldway being incredibly forthcoming

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
and talking to us. Tom Kenny, I remember

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
giving me a Schrab, like, advice that I still give

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
to young people creatively.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Oh, what is his advice?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Become the voice of SpongeBob?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Wait, wait, wait. And then just break it in.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
We asked him as a, you know, kind of a dipshit

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
hacky question, which is, what's your advice

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
for young comics? And he said,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
go through your set list and cross off

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
everything that didn't make you laugh out loud

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
by yourself when you were writing it.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
And we were like, but that's like our whole, oh.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
And there is like one thing out of your first

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
ten minutes that's going to be that one thing.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You know, you've got to ditch the other nine.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
And that's why Patton Oswalt is hysterical

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
after all these, you know, decades of going through

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
that he does that every time, you know.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Works that shit meticulously.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, because I definitely, because I've performed,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
you know, you perform in places where like Idaho

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
and stuff, where it's not, people aren't going to,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
you just assume people are going to be a certain way.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So I would go back to the jokes that don't make me

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
laugh, but that work in every room.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Right, everywhere. I mean, this will be, I'm saying,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
milk, but instead of milk, I'm saying poop.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah, I mean, I've heard people laugh at that

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
in that Piranha movie. Yeah, got poop, right.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, that concept of, this will make other people

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
laugh because it's the concept of comedy.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Instead of you going like, here's a thing

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
that I think is funny. It's a big mistake.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That's not what anybody would, no one's going

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
to buy a ticket to that. Even people who like

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
watching Tim Allen's thing, whatever it's called,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
man, man, man, man, man, man, man zone.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
Like, they feel like, you know, he's

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
speaking from the heart and making himself laugh.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Like, that's just, you know, they wouldn't want him

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
to like stop the, go like, everybody stop.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
What should man zone do next?

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
Tweet, tweet, manzone.com and let me know.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
And I'll do whatever you want, whatever you want.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
My mom would be like, fuck this guy.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
The whole, yeah, illusion is that you're just

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
sort of speaking up there and you're not really

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
speaking for the benefit of any person,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
but just for yourself. And that would kill that.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Although I would love if he did like once,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
you know what, fuck this, this is not who I am.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
I did, you know, I did cocaine really a lot

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
for like 15 years. Don't you want to hear about that?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I want to hear about that.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Or at least give yourself permission to do it, you know?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah, and yeah, like it would be, it's weird,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
like when you hear those outtakes and you go on

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
YouTube and you type in like Thundercats, you know,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
and you hear the guy, the Thundercats guy,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
going thunder, thunder, thunder, oh fuck.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
It's so funny, and that guy, the guy from

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
America's Funniest Videos, there's that real

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
of him going, coming up next in America's

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Funniest Shit Content, fuck it.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You know what, fuck this shit.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
I don't think there's anybody out there

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
that's actually like not incredibly profane.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Yeah, it's really weird.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
This television, this concept of standards

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
and practices, it's like, well I don't want my kid

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
to hear, actually it's not weird at all,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
it makes perfect sense, it's the cleanest

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
common denominator, it's like we all have

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
to suffer because someone's eight year old

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
kid might be watching.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Right, but that's it, I think eight is the age

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
where, I think at nine, you're saying

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
fuck so much already, hearing other people

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
say it, you're like, oh I'm normal,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
because I remember when I was nine I would

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
say fuck and then feel horribly guilty

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
because I hadn't really heard that many

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
people say it, but if my mom was also

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
saying fuck, I'd be like, alright this is

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
fucking cool, you know?

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
God, there's so much beef fungus growing

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
in my lungs, my head's going to come off

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
and turn into a spider.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Or maybe you get a superpower from this.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Maybe, probably a 1% chance at that.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
If Darwin's...

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Bill feels really bad, Bill, it's not funny

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
if we eat the food and it's delicious,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
it's funny if there's fungus on it

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
and luckily that's what happens, so

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
you contribute it to the well-being of the show.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
He should definitely, he should forgive himself

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
but at the same time, I mean he went out on a limb.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
No, he totally did.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Like everybody in the audience doesn't come

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
with a bag full of perishable food.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Almost nobody ever does.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
It's almost like there's a reason for it.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
There was a moment when all of them were

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
going, oh should I be ashamed of myself

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
because I didn't get up this morning

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
and go like, what food am I going to bring

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
to Harmontown?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Then you gave them the pleasure of going like,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
oh good, there's boundaries for a reason.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
Yeah, you made them feel great.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
They had a whole arc in like five minutes

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
of like, I'm not that good.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Oh no, I'm okay.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Bill sucks.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
You're awesome, Bill.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
He's a culinary Goldberg.

17:20.000 --> 17:26.000
He's like Hulk, like everything I touch,

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I crush in my hand.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Okay, so speaking of what's right and what's wrong

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
and where the mass is and how do you organize

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
communities and let's go on the moon

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
and live them in peace, I want to bring

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
our web guru, Shahruz out here.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Wait, Guru might be racist because he says that.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It wasn't racist until you pointed it out.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
If you just said web guru,

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
if you said web fakir, sure.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
The web mystic.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
What a guru.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
He's Indian.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
You're right, me pointing it out made it so racist.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Wait, what are you, Shahruz?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Wait, you're Pakistani?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Oh, you're okay.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I didn't know that.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Do the handshake, do the handshake.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Whoa!

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
They're just like us.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
So, Shahruz is our web genius

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and I just found out by the way I want to go on record,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
that means I'm the opposite of racist, right?

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Because I'm totally colorblind,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
like I don't know, right?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, except you then caught yourself

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
and then you became slightly racist.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Listen, if I'm the guy who gets to say

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
people are racist or not, you're not racist.

19:00.000 --> 19:10.000
But I'm not that guy.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
All right, Shahruz, regardless of his heritage,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
is a computer genius intimidatingly so

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
and he does a lot of pro bono computer work

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
and he did this thing for Harmontown a long time ago

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
that I'd never taken advantage of

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and I keep reminding myself to try it.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Anyways, I said to him,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I want to be able to do this thing with the internet

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
and people's cell phones.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Because I could say, for instance, I could go,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
hey, who jerked off today?

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Buy applause and then like, the people that...

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
Adam Goldberg clapping to the surprise of no one.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
The people that applaud aren't,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
they may or may not be all the people that jerked off

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
but what's more obvious is that they're the people

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
who don't mind everyone knowing

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
and it's too much like,

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
there's too much Heisenberg principle happening

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
in measurement, you know?

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
We have this new technology available to us.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Every once in a while you're kind of curious,

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
what percentage of you really feel this way or that way?

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
If there was an anonymous way to very quickly do these polls

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
and I said that to Shahruz and he whipped up this thing

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
that creates this geo-fence around the room that we're in.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Whoa, really? That's amazing.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I mean, not physically.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Not an idiot, Shahruz.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
Sorry, I guess it's just not as amazing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
No, it is amazing because it's the things that are...

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
if the phones are within a certain diameter,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
then they're in the...

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
That seems very impressive.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Okay, thank you, sorry.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
By the way, you are exactly...

20:58.000 --> 21:02.000
if my mom squints when she looks at me, she sees you.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
You are what my mom wanted me to be.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I thought you were just being really racist.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
No, no, no.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
In her dreams, I'm Shahruz.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
That's what her plan for you was?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, I started computer science.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Oh, Kumail, come to my bed.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Okay, let me amander.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
Go to computer camp. Go to America.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
I like that the magical, mystical gesture she's making, too.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Go, powerful lack of failure.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
By the Pakistani God of Pulrap,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I command you, go to the United States

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
and learn computers for my family.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And then you came and look at you.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
And yeah, I was like, fuck that.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
I like Game of Thrones.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
But you were saying...

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
and so you can do polls with this program?

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah, so the problem is that we have to think of something,

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
like you can set up these things very easily.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I did a test run of it and it's incredibly easy,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
but I can't multitask.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
What we can do is we can think of any kind of multiple-choice question.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And then we can punch it in

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
and then we can give them this URL that they can access on their phones.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
And they can all go to it and they can very easily vote.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And there's a time window.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
And after that time window, it'll send all the results to any e-mail address

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
that he specifies with like a pie chart and everything.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Oh, wow.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
Okay, how about let's do people think you've been racist tonight?

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Or there could be one where you're not racist,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
one where you don't want to be racist,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
but hey, we're all human,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
and then one that's like, yeah.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Right, specifically though, that I've been racist tonight.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, what do you think?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I mean, you have just spitballing.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Well, I mean, the easy answer is yes,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
because the modern definition of racism is acknowledgement of race.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I mean, I just did your mom reaching out and doing that.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Like she was some kind of gypsy from thinner.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I mean, yeah, I'm racist.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
We don't need a poll for that.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
All right, all right, all right.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
Yeah, the voice was fun too.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
But what about the real definition of racism?

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
The reason we're obsessed with it is because it's an actual crap.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Like, am I actually racist?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Yeah.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Like, am I so obsessed with race

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
that I actually can't like...

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Like when you said web guru,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
a normal person would not have thought it,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
but you think about that so much

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
that you may associate it guru to Indian,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
which he is not.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
In my defense, I'm a verbal thinker.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
So what I did is I said shrews are web guru

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
and that's what tripped.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I was like, shrews are web guru?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
And I went like, oops, that sounded bad to me.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Yeah, sure.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
No, I understand.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Okay, so do you want that to be the question?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Am I racist?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah, what do you think?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Or we could do something totally like...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Let's just take it for a test run.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, that way, because if we sit here...

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah, let's take that for a test run and then we can...

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
So just is Dan racist?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Well, I can.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah, is Dan racist is the question.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
And then what are the possible answers?

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Yes and no, obviously.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
And then what?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Third.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Maybe?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Well, let's do more than maybe that.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Like, he desperately doesn't want to be,

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
but unintentionally, he has some barriers.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
How many characters?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It's unlimited, but I just want to point out

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
that Adam Goldberg just texted me yes.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
Why do you have Adam Goldberg's phone number?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
He doesn't have Adam Goldberg.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Adam Goldberg has his.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.000
Adam Goldberg gets your phone number.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I've been over this before.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
He has techniques.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay, so this is just a test run.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Yeah, just do the...

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
I racist yes or no.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Don't even give him a third option.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Like a one minute time limit?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
You make it two.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Okay, and what's the URL?

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
So it's tentpole, T-E-N-T-P-O-L-L dot it.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
So tentpole, but pole like a gallop pole.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Just even the play on dot IT.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
This is the most clever thing I've ever come up with in my life.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I've just never done anything this good.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot IT.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Tap here to find nearby poles.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah, so everybody just hit tap to find nearby poles.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
And then if it asks you for location permission, hit yes.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And then you just put your mailing address in there

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
and you may receive some material about a time share

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I want to tell you about.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
No.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
It's not working.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
It worked for me.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
No, no, no, just do it.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
No, no, no, guys, just do it.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Did it ask you for permissions?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah, it is. It's there.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
No, let me just hit a pole but not answer one.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Weird.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
It doesn't matter.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Here, take that lady's phone.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
This is like a nightmare for me right now.

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah, Bill and Cheruz both had their comeuppance for trying to be very nice.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, Cheruz's tentpole had e-fungus on it.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
No, no, no, it worked for me.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
You know it's a good podcast when somebody on microphone says,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm going to go into your settings.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Okay, so the results are in.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
All right, is Dan racist?

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Yes, 14 votes, no 15 votes.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Yeah!

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Well, it says need more data, 20 votes.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Yeah, you left the 30 votes.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Whoa, that was a good number of people.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
Only the vocal minority, from them it made it seem like it was not working.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It turns out they're the vocal minority.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
And fuck minorities.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
All right, can I redo my answer?

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I don't think we need more data anymore.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
You got your data.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
That's your reward for needing it.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
All right, well, let's thank Cheruz for it.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Well, thank you Cheruz.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
Cheruz the Snake Charming Guru.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
That's India, that's India.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
He did genuinely float away on a flying carpet, though.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Well, there's a place in France where naked ladies dance.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, that's the lyrics to that song.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
It's the Egyptian national anthem, actually.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
It's been the number one hit in Pakistan for 30 years.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
We have pyramids and we used to have a Nile,

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
but the snakes ate us and the sand's been here a while.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
Now we have a dictator, nothing to sing about with that.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
That's how the song dies.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Human rights violations are real.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
What if you went to China and you went to a baseball game

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
and you had never been to China and you just had a baseball game

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
and they said, please rise for the national anthem

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
and you stood up and I went...

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
The guy with the gong gets it started.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
You would be the only guy in all of China going,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
what is racist?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And everyone would be like, what?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
This is the best song.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Why are you an asshole?

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
This is the best song we've ever heard.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
You were telling me something about Iron Man and the Chinese.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
That's an interesting...

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Somebody told me.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Yeah, I saw it somewhere, but I didn't read it.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Iron Man 3.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I believe that...

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
I mean, it's long, but even when I moved to LA in the 90s,

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
it was already the case that at least 60% of all these big movies,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
their box office comes from overseas.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I mean, we've long been living in the age

29:21.000 --> 29:27.000
of we think that we're like this Monroe Doctrine culture,

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
like giving out entertainment to foreign markets.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Sure.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
And in some respect, that's true because they still just want to see

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Robert Downey Jr. fly around in a row.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah, nobody's watching Lollywood movies.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
That's the Pakistani film industry.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Right.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But I mean, now China's emerging.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
It's like this giant market to the point where they remade Red Dawn

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
and originally it was like the Chinese invaded America

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
and then they had to go back in and they're still using computers

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
to change everything to Korean.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Did you know about that?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
No.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Wow.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Well, Red Dawn's out now.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
We can watch it now and look at it.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
That's what happened.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That's why Red Dawn took so long.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
I heard that King Kong vs. Godzilla had different endings.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
In Japan, Godzilla wins in here.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Wait, I thought you were doing a bit.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
No.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
I think that's real.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Do you mean the old school ones?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Dean Devlin bothered to make a thing of it.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Dean Devlin did not give a shit about.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah, so what I heard is that Iron Man 3 had like four minutes

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
of Chinese, extra Chinese bonus footage in it

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
where Tony Stark says like,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
we got to warn the world about this threat.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
And then like there's a scene where he, in the Chinese release

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
where he goes to China and is like,

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
and that's why we got all band together against this octopus monster,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
whatever the thing is.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
And then he's like, I love China!

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
And the article that was printed about it

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
had the angle that the Chinese audiences had kind of rejected it critically.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
They were as into it as you would be if it was the other way around.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Like if we loved Chinese movies, which some of us do,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
but I mean if China was just the place that made blockbuster movies

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
and shipped them over here and we went to see Iron Man 3

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
instead of like lead paint if they focused on movies.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
If they paused to say, America rocks!

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Whether we agreed or not would be like, dumb.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
Well, Doctor Who, which I really, really love,

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
there's a whole, now it's getting popular here,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
there's a season where they will shot some in American,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
he's literally wearing a cowboy hat and stuff.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
And for me, even though I'm sort of an honorary American,

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
it really, really bugged me that they were clearly making such a transparent effort

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
to like woo American audiences.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
In what?

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Doctor Who.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Oh.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
He wears a cowboy hat and he's in like Yuta and stuff.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And this is exactly what you were saying.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
I think what people don't like about it is with the comedian

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
who's just talking about what they think they want to hear

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
versus what they really want to talk about.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Yes, absolutely.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I think it's the exact same principle.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Yeah, entertainment is voyeurism.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I don't know why we feel compelled to, I mean for God's sakes,

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
like we, I mean, like, that's the thing about reference humor too.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
Like, I guess it makes sense that you remake the office

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
and then you're going to go through and you're going to change the references.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Fine.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But like, we go too far with it.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Or we go like, oh, no one wants to watch ugly people on TV.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
You know, it's like, of course we do.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Yeah, I mean that's when I start.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
We're ugly.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Who else do we want to watch on TV?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Most of us are ugly.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
I've really gotten into these like European crime shows,

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
like from Sweden and Denmark and stuff and what's so weird about it.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I was like, what's so different?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Because they're amazing shows.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
But also they don't have shows where nobody's attractive on the whole show.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
And then a lot of anal.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And a lot of anal.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
Like way more Swedish detective shows.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Like it's a little weird.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Because I would say most network TV had almost no anal.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
Yeah.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
And these guys.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
That's a big difference.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
I mean, we're really uptight about that.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Those guys are assholes loose.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Have you seen Swedish Colombo?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
That's crazy.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
And you know Colombo was originally Swedish, right?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
It was an adaptation.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Is that right?

33:28.000 --> 33:33.000
The original Swedish Colombo, the reason why Peter Falk would pretend to start to leave

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
and then he'd come back in.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
That was all originally like an anal sex thing.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Because he's like, oh, just one more anal.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
That's what the original quote was.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah, he would pull it out.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
But I mean, I don't want to get graphic about it.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
But it became Americanized.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
It became like he's just in a raincoat and he's just leaving the scene and coming back

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
in for another question.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
But in the Swedish Colombo, it was...

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
Peter Falk was very, very anti that.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
He always thought it was selling out.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
And he really was like, there should be the same amount of anal.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And he got in a huge fight with John Landis about that.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.000
And in the fist fight, that's how he lost an eye.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Peter Falk.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Yeah, that's true.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
John Landis...

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
John Landis...

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Go ahead.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Sorry, go ahead.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Go ahead.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Sorry.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Give and take.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Give and take.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
No, no.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
John Landis actually went back on set and was like, fuck it.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
I'm just going to do the helicopter scene.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
And he was so...

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
It's funny when you're sometimes like you could just see what the other person is thinking.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Well, yeah, we connect the dots.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
John Landis is here tonight, by the way, and happy that we're still connecting that dot.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
By the way, I know John Landis.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I did an episode of television with him.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah?

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
What did you do?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Franklin and Bash, did you do an episode?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I did actually do Franklin and Bash.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
And we shoot in Santa Clarita, which is about 30 miles north of...

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
It's just, you know, it's by like six flags, whatever.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
And there was one day where we were shooting and he said...

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Charlie Chaplin shot modern times in Santa Clarita.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Now I'm shooting fucking Franklin and Bash.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Wait, no.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Are you joking?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
John Landis shot Franklin and Bash and said that?

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah, that's what he said while it was a long day.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Three more hours.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Surrounded by people who are on team Franklin and Bash.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Franklin and Bash were there.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
And Franklin was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Because he's a dick, right?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
And Bash was like, fuck this guy.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Because Bash is like the John Lennon of Franklin and Bash.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
It was just such a weird moment for everyone.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Because even there was also John Landis being like,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I'm doing Franklin and Bash now.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
And also just you look at like, you know,

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
all the grand scheme of entertainment that people have made.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
And, you know, it's just a weird...

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
God damn it, there was a...

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Never mind.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
What?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
No, no, I can't.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Yeah, no, it's not.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
And it's just Caddy who cares.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I don't want to talk shit about people.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Because like how many times have I had an encounter

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
with somebody and they're telling some story.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I don't want to be represented by some random encounter

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
by a bad person.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, everyone has a bad day.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Some people have many...

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Harrison Ford fucking raped my mom.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
That's a bad day for two people.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
Although your mom got a great story out of it.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
If I showed you like what my mom wears

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
like on an average day.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
It just says fuck me Indiana on it?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Harrison Ford.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Like, like, yeah.

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
Get off of my plane and into my pussy.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
It says...

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
It doesn't even make sense.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
I said, mom, it doesn't make sense.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Is it your plane?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Yeah, I didn't...

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Are you the president?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And she's like, oh, should I make another shirt?

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
I'm like, stop it.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Yeah.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Talk to dad.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
You change the locks, you don't communicate.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
And there's Netflix now.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
You can watch more movies.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Like, you don't even know this person.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah, he's got a lot of movies.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And if you ever run into him, which he ended up doing,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
you're going to get raped.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
That's what Harrison Ford does.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
And the judge, as he did, is going to let him go.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Because he's going to say, look what you are wearing.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And it's not going to be like a sexist thing

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
because what you are wearing is a sandwich board.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
That's like, please fuck me.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
And you know, black people shouldn't be allowed to vote.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
I just, huh, if you see things in this voice

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
and you don't open your mouth all the way,

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I think women are inferior.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
That's how...

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I just, you know, Shrews comes out here.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
He's got a cobra and a basket.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
He's fine with that.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
He's writing a magic carpet around.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
This is, okay, we might have to take this out, too.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Emily's mom?

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
I feel like Emily's mom.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
If she doesn't know that 9-11 wasn't inside your oven.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
But she, like, whispers three words.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Like, whenever she says them, she doesn't say,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
like, she'll be like, the three words are like,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
he has cancer.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
She whispers cancer.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
He has depression.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
And the word Jewish.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
All incurable.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
She's just, she's not,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
she's not saying, like, they're bad people.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
She just knows that they can't do, you know,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
like, nothing they can do about it.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
He's very nice.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You know, very nice.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
All right.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Oh, god damn it.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
Okay, it's 9 o'clock, so we're going to roll into other duties.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
I know, duties.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
The, Aaron made a cake, as usual.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
Does it have fungus on it?

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
She just baked it. There's no fungus.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Why don't we give the cake,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
should we give the cake to Bill?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Because he...

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
There you go, Bill.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
It's a cake that says,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
go Marbles, go.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
She made her monkey in frosting.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
So that's your cake, Bill.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
It's our way.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
It's a teachable moment to you.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
This is how you give people food.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Poison them.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
See how it has no fungus on it, Bill?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Maybe write that down.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Just don't mail that cake to Texas.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
And say, it's okay.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Wrap it up in packing tape.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Put it in a backpack.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Take it to the Yakov Smirnoff show and just give it to him.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I'm assuming he's big in Austin.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Yakov, by the way,

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I got really obsessed with Yakov.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
You know, he has his whole therapy now.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
He does a...

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
He's like a therapist now.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
And it's called smile therapy or happy therapy

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
or something, which is about

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
willing yourself to be happy.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
And that's what he does.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I can't imagine.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
He also doesn't...

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I can't imagine he'd be the one to come up with this.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
You'd have to convince yourself.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
You have to convince yourself you're happy.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Sometimes you just gotta look at the world

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
and flip it.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
He also got, like,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
begging to... He's like super patriot

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
and he really got into 9-11 and most people don't know this.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
He had this banner.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
He's an artist. He makes paintings.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
He had this banner made.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
It's a banner that hung from

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
across ground zero.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
And it's like Statue of Liberty with, like, a heart and stuff.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
And it's got some

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
phrase on it that's like...

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It's Soviet Union.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
No, I wanted it to be in Russia.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
9-11 never forgets about you.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Right.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
But it's just something about, like,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
my heart is broken or some stupid

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
bullshit tendering thing.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
So

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
wait, well that's weird

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
because he's big in Branson, Missouri.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
It's like a little, you know,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Dollywood and kind of like,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
and I always wondered, like,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
was that just because

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
what begets what? What chicken laid what egg?

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Maybe his

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
ideology is really actually

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I'm sure it is, but you convinced yourself.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I always assumed that he was like this guy in the 80s

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
who was like, when we were fighting Russia

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
he was the step and fetch

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
it of Russians, you know.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
He would come out and go, I'm Russian

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
but I don't like it so much.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
You know, and we would go,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
that makes us feel better about buying

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
credit cards and shoes and stuff.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
And, you know, buy credit cards.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
You buy them with a shoe. I don't want to get out of home.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But, but, but, and then I always assumed

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
that because he was like an icon of,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
for all I knew, he had like a, you know,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
he didn't even have a Russian accent.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Well, but, I mean, he is Russian

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
and nobody is really interesting, but Smirnov

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
is not his real name and he did take

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
that because of the vodka

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
where he was like, oh, they'll like this.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
They'll like this vodka. They'll associate.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
So he changed his name to Smirnov.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Yeah, and Yakov sounds like Jakov.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I assume they're both fake names.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
He's the fucking Jakov vodka guy.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Wait, are you saying that any part of that

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
name is real? I think Yakov might be real.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
I'm not sure, but I know Smirnov is not

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
and he took it from the vodka.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Again, what we thought the Chinese would like,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
he took it to us and it fucking worked.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Interesting.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And by interesting, I mean the opposite.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
In America, interesting things bore you.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But I actually feel better

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
thinking that he actually,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Oh yeah, he knew what he was doing.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
That he's a big patriot because when I heard

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
like, oh, he's huge in Branson,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I always, I assume every entertainer

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
is like a liberal and a cosmopolitan,

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
like not a redstater.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
No, some of the bad ones are redstaters.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
It comforts me to think that he's actually

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
like the third act of his biopic

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
is him and Branson going like,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
why didn't they make this place sooner?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Well, I mean, he's a god that there's him

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
and there's another guy who I think is,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
he's Asian, Japanese or Chinese, something

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
who, he makes like millions of dollars

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
and he has this, his whole family,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
he's got a white wife and they have a whole family

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
where they like, play the national anthem

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
on violins and stuff like that.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Like, so it's sort of the place where

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
other, where immigrants go to like

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
completely pander and sell out.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
That's where I'll end up.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
It brings you back to a simpler time.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Yeah, where it was like, other countries were like,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
like, it was like going to the zoo.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Yeah, exactly.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Because you only saw the one face.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
You're like, oh yeah, lines are lazy.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
That's where they broke out and said, fucking us.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Yeah.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Having all these weird babies.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Weird babies?

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Weird.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Beige, almond-eyed, super golfers.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Everything, everything just,

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
these colors don't run my ass.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
They ran together, brother.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
In Russia, these runs don't color.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Seriously, fucks.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
All in your backyard, you're going to wind up radio.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
It's over.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
And it's over because of races.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Almond-eyed super golfers

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
is the name of this episode.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Almond-eyed super golfers.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
All right.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
All right, let's speed it along.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Let's get Spencer out here and...

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Spencer!

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Thank you.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
What up?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
What up, Spence?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Not much, man.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Nice, calm trolling.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Thank you.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
You're eating the cookies?

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
I want to try the cookies.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I guess they are sealed.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Yeah, these...

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Oh, you think he's just like a fungus guy.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Who gives people fungus.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
Well, I mean, poison me once, right?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And you won't have to poison me twice.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Poison me once.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
I mean, just for the listeners at home,

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
like the piece of...

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
One of our audience members held up a piece of beef jerky

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
as we all finished half-eating the first bite.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
And there's so much mold on one of them,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
mildew, whatever it is.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It looks like a rabbit's foot.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
It has a coat of white, beautiful fur.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Yeah, I feel like we should name it.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
That happens, though.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
This is good luck.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
It's such bad luck.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah, I think it had...

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
participated in the poll.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
And then the one I have has a little bit on it, too.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
That happens, though.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Kirkland's signature brand teriyaki beef jerky

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
will also manifest that on occasion.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I'd say one in every six bags.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
One in every six?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
In my experience.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
That's a terrible ratio.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Yeah.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Kirkland's signature.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
One in every six.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
We'll talk back to you.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Do you want to try this?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Dan, these are the raw...

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
I can't...

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Carbs, that stuff will kill you.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I'll stick to the hairy meat.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
It looks like somebody dipped all of these in cotton candy.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
That's how much...

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
It looks like the Goldbloom Body Snatchers movie.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Oh, yeah.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
The 70s Body Snatchers movie.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Yeah.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
They have the little tendrils of it.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
Alright, let's...

46:44.000 --> 46:53.000
Erin McGathy, can you come out?

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
Bill, I think it's real sweet that you brought that.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Of course it's sweet.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
And it's not his fault that one bag was bad.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Honey, I'm sorry.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
That sounded so condescending.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Honey, we would talk about it all night.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Listen, honey, I would have said that to a guy, too.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
But this is a different...

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
This was a different...

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Two different bags.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
But I'm guessing that the company that he got that from,

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
it's a real family organization.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
And sometimes things slip through the cracks.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I'm going to eat all the rest of it.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, the other end of the spectrum is that photo

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
that was circulating on the internet where the guy found

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
a 1989 McDonald's cheeseburger in his coat pocket.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
It had not.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
And it looked just like it does on the menu.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Who's supposed to go bad?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
This is what's supposed to happen to food.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
If it has life in it, yeah.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
The other life is supposed to want to eat it.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I mean, even if it was all covered in mold,

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
the sentiment is still really...

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Oh, of course.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
No, Bill...

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
No, really.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I'm the person who brings unsolicited cakes.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
Yeah, it's totally A for effort, F for fungus.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I think we were very...

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I think we went very easy out of it.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
And Bill, I hope you don't mind me outing you.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Bill was tearing up as we were sitting,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
and Dustin and I were watching him tear up.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You weren't tearing up, were you?

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Bill?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Were you really tearing up?

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
Oh, Bill, this is wonderful.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
You've made the podcast better.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
You've made the podcast.

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
If he brought food to actually provide sustenance and joy

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
for other people, then it would be fair to assume

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
his worst nightmare would be that it was in fact disgusting.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And I totally relate to that.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
That that would make me tear up, too.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Especially if it was something that you really love,

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
this specific beef jerky that you had shipped in.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
But, I mean, I feel...

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I mean, it all comes out in the wash.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
It's all karmically balanced, because that's, I mean...

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
But everything's fine.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
And you should be able to laugh at it.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
We're all...

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Yay!

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Yeah, we've all been talking about this jerky,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
and it's been awesome.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
I mean, the jerky could not have tasted as good

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
as making fun about it feels.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
And also, as I've said before,

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
when I was on the playground and people would pick on me,

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
I would never cry.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Like, no matter how hard anyone hit me,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
no matter how many showers they told me to take,

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
the thing that would make me burst into tears

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
was the fucking good-natured guy coming up and going,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
come on, leave him alone!

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Maybe he doesn't want to take showers!

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
And then I'd be like, who would take your teammates?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Who would kill myself?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Well, I didn't come up and say, like,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
hey, man, maybe he likes fungus.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Maybe he wanted everyone to eat some fungus.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
That's not what I said.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
I wasn't...

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Maybe someone stick up for Aaron.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I'm attacking her too much.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Bill, are you...

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Bill, are...

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
How you doing?

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
I'm okay.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
I'm all right.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
All right!

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I don't know what I thought was gonna happen.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Bill's awesome.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Whatever.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Well, it was great.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
He's gonna go home tonight.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Open a window to his snowy front yard,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
put a puck crown on,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
a crown of twigs,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and then go into his father's den.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
We watched that right before we came here.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Or he could just eat one of his turkeys.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Bill, you're not allowed to cry another tear

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
until someone dies.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Bill, we're all okay,

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
but the question was absolutely wonderful.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Also, I don't know if I washed my hands

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
when I made that cake.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Who knows?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
He saved the last bag for himself.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
He saved the last bag for himself, he said.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
That's fine.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Bill, our job is to make sure you do not eat it.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
I don't know why they're so crazy about guns.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
In Texas, I mean, when one piece of meat

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
could take out a whole audience.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
It's like, Jesus,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
we can still defend ourselves against the enemy,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
obviously, if that's what the concern is.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
But yeah, you don't need background checks

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
for this jerky.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
If anyone could take anything away from this podcast,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
never put yourself out there.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Never.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Never be generous, never put yourself out there.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I think the message is,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
don't push yourself out there

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
if you have fungus goods.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
I mean, meat is a real limb.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
It's an actual limb, of course.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
No.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
We're not bullying Bill.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
No, we're not.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
We think it's wonderful that he did this.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
It's wonderful.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
This is a stage full of people who are very bullied

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
who are trying to un-bully.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Yeah, it's like, well, I was grapple with that stuff.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
When you say don't put yourself out there,

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
sarcastically, I feel very strongly about that.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Whenever people come up and talk and share things and stuff,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I always want to make sure that we don't do

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
the Jay Lenoey kind of like,

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
oh, well, someone's talking,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
so if they use a T instead of an S,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
we're going to fucking throw a parade for the letter T.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
I mean, I know we're jumping on the fucking fungus on the beef,

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
but there's another rule of entertainment and conversation

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
which is go where the heat is.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
We all know that Bill didn't make fungus grow.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
He's not God.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
We're not going to talk about it any sport.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I mean, more.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I'm so happy you talked about the Christian Bale.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I really think this jerky is growing on me.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
I genuinely, Bill, nothing but love.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
This is awesome.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I think this is great.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
How much less interesting would it have been

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
if this was just like really good jerky?

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I think it's awesome that it has fungus in it.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
The real villain is this man

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
who presented the moldy jerky.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I'm just kidding, please don't go that way.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
No, come on.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
That took guts.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
His car's going to explode in the parking lot.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
He's the whistleblower.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
It takes balls.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
He was in a room full of pleasure

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
and he had to hold up a rabbit's foot and go,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
well, just so you know,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
this one's reproductively viable,

53:15.000 --> 53:21.000
which is why you can see the white.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Which in France would probably cost a million dollars.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
Hey, the fungus was inside us the whole time.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
All right, let's start playing.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I wasn't able to be here a couple of weeks ago

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
and Duncan Trussell played my character.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
And I on purpose did not

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
catch myself up on what happened

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
to Christopher.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
So I don't know.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I basically blacked out for

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Christopher blacked out for a week

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
and now I want to find out what

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
what happened.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
That makes sense. I mean, that's natural.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
All right, so should we do the music?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Well, we need somebody to play Jeff's character.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Should we have to?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Bill, you want to play Jeff's character?

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Bill!

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Bill is playing Jeff's character.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I'll give it a shot. Do I have a character sheet?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Yeah, you want to pass these out.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Is this the D&D music that's happening?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
On the previous episode,

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
our heroes, this is too moody.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
We're still lost in a shadow plane

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
after killing Breffi, the Spirey.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
It's Dustin Marshall on...

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Is this? Oh, on DJ.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
That's cool.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Breffi, the spirey denizen of the dark.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
To the north, behind the dark pillars,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
stood an imposing and flickering fence.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
And to the south, the sound of beating hooves

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
was once again audible.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Swiftly following the sound of hooves

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
was none other than Tylenol with Codeine,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
the unicorn.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
And with him, terrible news.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Tylenol's force had been raised to the ground

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
by deviant creatures from another dimension.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
As it dawned on Sharpie that his errant fireballs

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
may have decimated the commie force,

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
he was quick to admit his error

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
and Codeine quicker to forgive the transgression.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
At the same time, Chris de Burgh,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
who had been feeling out of sorts

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
during the last combat,

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
spoke nonsense and carved strange prophecies

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
into his own arm.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
And requested he be impaled upon Tylenol

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
with Codeine's one horn.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Confused and likely disturbed

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
by the sudden masochistic bend,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
the party investigated the gate

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
and set off a trap.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Chris and Quirk were pinned by shadowy bindings.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Sharpie leapt over a massive shadow gate

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and deactivated the trap,

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
freeing his friends, but the victory was short-lived.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
A party of shadows with bladed limbs

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
poured from the darkness behind the gate

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
and a great combat ensued.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
So, so great.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
Our heroes managed to cut down two of the foes,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
but four remain.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Oh, we stopped right in the middle of the fight.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Yeah, it was a pretty intense fight.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Wasn't there a moment, maybe this was just facetious

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
and didn't actually happen, but where Chris de Burgh,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Jeff and Chris de Burgh were fucking

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
and I was jerking off on them and rapping.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
That was probably just to end the show.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Wait, what?

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Is that canon?

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
I had to ask myself that as I reviewed the episode.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
It wasn't canon specifically because...

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
If we did that, we'd all be dead.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
Yeah, because you stopped time to go into rap,

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
which halted combat time

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
and either your heads would all have been

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
sliced to pieces in the ensuing dance number,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
or it didn't happen.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
So... Okay, I have a couple questions.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Sure.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
You feel a pain in your stomach and your right arm.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
Okay, my first question.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
When you say impaled on the unicorn,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
what does that mean?

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Sexual. What did I do?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
No, no, um, yeah, so...

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Okay, so at some point...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Oh, guys, I just came too.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
What's this with the unicorn?

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Your arm and still bleeding on your flesh

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
is scrawled the scars of your dagger.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
They say, how can you have a video game podcast

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
and not play Starcraft 2?

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
These words are meaningless.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
It's hibijibi stuff.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Also, you had sex with Quirk.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
That didn't happen, though.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
What about the unicorn? What did I do?

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
You cut it into your arm

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
and invited the unicorn to stab you with his horn,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
which he did with great vigor

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
and dealt to you about 11 damage, I believe.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
What the fuck?

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
You should be lucky to cut off his fingers

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
because he was gunning for that for a while.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I gave him a healing potion.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
His mom died. Quirk hands you a potion.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
Oh, my God. Did she really?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Yeah. You didn't know that?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
No.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
You didn't? I don't know.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
He sounded like he got a new surfboard or something.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I don't know why I assumed you knew Duncan.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
What sucks now is that I'm the asshole

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
for being upset that he would act out.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
I don't know what I would do if my mom passed away.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
I would probably have Duncan's character impaled by the unicorn.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
I think one thing's for sure.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
We should fight these Shadowmasters and kill them.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
We gotta fuck Jeff. Let's go.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Oh, yes. Sorry, Bill.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Bell, I know that we have followed that.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Because he's fucked everything.

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
And marbles around.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And did he have sex with marbles already?

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
No, that never happened.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
All right, well, let's kill these Shadow Creatures

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
and then we'll all run a train on Jeff.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
I'm going to put it at the Shadow Creatures' turn.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
There's four of them left. Two of them were cut down,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I believe, by the blade of Quirk.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
So one of them is actually trying to strangle Quirk

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
with his limb as this smoky gas that's choking him down.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
That's you, Bill.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Yeah.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
You're Quirk.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
You're Quirk.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
All right, the rest of the shadows rear back

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
and their limbs turn into smoke

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
and they flow towards you with an amazing speed.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
You can try to dodge, but you fail miserably.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
That is two of you do.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
However, Chris de Burgh manages to jump out of the way

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
with the smoke.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
The rest of you, you feel the smoke.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
It hits you right in the face and it's all black

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
and you can't see for a moment.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
And then it forces itself down your throat

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
and you feel yourself coughing and choking on smoke

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
because you're in a terrible fire.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
No damage, though.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I'm going to use my talking dagger

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
and try to cut one of the tentacles for my neck.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
This is smoke, it's not tentacles.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
I'm still going to try to cut at it.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
Okay, go for it.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
All right, you successfully strike the smoke.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
However, being smoke, it is instantly parted and reformed.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
I feel like it gave you a clue that that was not going to work.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It's a talking dagger.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
That's what his character would do, probably.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I cough.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah, you do.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That's a given.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Do you want to try and expel this from your lungs?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Yes.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yeah, I cough and I run backwards really quickly.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Attempting to both to fade

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and void your lungs of the terrible gas within.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
You manage to choke back a bit.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
You're gaining a bit of breath.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Your head grows a bit clearer,

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
but still trying to invade.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Choke, yeah.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
It says you don't have smoke bombs.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Does that mean bombs that would hurt smoke?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
They only blow up smoke.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
No, no, for like diversions and whatnot.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Maybe a dance party would start or something.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I can't help but notice on my character sheet,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
because over the weeks,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
these things get soaked with wine and vodka,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and you've had to create character sheets.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Each time you do an English teacher,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
you kind of circle things and put exclamation points.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Oh, yeah.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I circled the soul of growth,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
because that's the most powerful artifact

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
that you guys have encountered so far.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And I circled your temporary stats,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
because you lost strength and constitution

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
when your shadows ran away.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I thought that was relevant.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
But you're letting me know

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
that the soul of growth is important here.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
No, it's not.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I will let you know it's not important in this area of the town.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Oh, thank you.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I just circled it,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
because it's literally the most powerful object

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
you guys have encountered so far.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Sharpie?

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I think it's your turn.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I'll walk that back.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It might be useful.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Is it my turn?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And as I recall,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I was limited to level one and two spells.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Yeah, you're still on a three, level three ones.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Level three ones?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I can still cast?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
No, you're out of them.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I'm sorry.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Oh, I'm out of them.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Okay.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
All right.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I should eat more often.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Me too, brother.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Well, Goldberg brought you some chips.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah, in a milky way.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Yeah, but by the time I start eating that,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
it'll be done.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And then who knows how long it'll take

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
for the nutrients to absorb.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
If you eat, you feel not hungry right away.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Pretty much how food works.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
No.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I will categorically deny that there is like a time

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
that it takes for your brain to register

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
that you're full and satiated.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
But you're full, but like if you're thirsty,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
you drink water, you're great immediately.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah, for thirst, definitely.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I feel like the same principle, but...

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
It's really not.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
You do...

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
You do you, Spencer.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I do me.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
All right, fuck it.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Scorching ray.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I mean, I don't have anything clever to do.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Waving your hands in a magical manner.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
You fire off a couple bolts of fire

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
towards the shadow.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Prestigeige to my scorchum!

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It strikes one directly in the...

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
the right arm, the right blade arm.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Oh, nice.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
That happens.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That's not really relevant.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
But dealing...

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
everybody shut up.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Twelve damage.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You know, we weren't saying anything.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I know.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
That was a joke.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
God needs a snack.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Yeah, the master needs a snack.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Did somebody get...

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
got a bag of animal crackers?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Dealing twelve damage.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It staggers back a couple of steps

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and you can see his smoky arm

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
kind of flutter a bit.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Like, keeps on keeping on.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Okay.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I...

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Wait, I haven't done anything yet.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
He asked a question,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
but he hasn't actually taken an action.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Can I use acid?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Will that help?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I have vials of acid.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So, yeah, if you pour that on something,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
it could, like, burn away at it

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and potentially cause damage.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
All right, well, I sort of take a vial of acid

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
and I throw it at one of the...

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
the guy that he was...

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
that he hit.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That's a strategic move, definitely.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, you strike him.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Rearing back,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
you whip your hand forward

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
and fling the half-open vial of acid.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It smacks the guy directly in the face

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and shatters on impact

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
and you see caustic green liquid fizzle

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and burn on the being surface

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
dealing four damage.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That's barely anything.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
You know, Bill got lampooned

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
for attacking it with a knife.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
What's more logical about attacking smoke with an acid?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Well, but he attacked just the smoke.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I threw it at the source of the smoke,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
which is some sort of physical being.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Oh, he just found out I'm not listening.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
There's a physical being.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
There's some beings.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I thought there were shadow dudes.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Whose turn is that?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I mean, it's the shadow monster's turn, yeah.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
So you can feel this choking kind of...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
kind of gaining a hold over you.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You kind of...

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
your limbs are getting kind of numb

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
and your mind's going a bit dim,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
like you might lose consciousness pretty soon.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I would say that's the three of you

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
again, not you, because you're dodged, yeah.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Okay.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
However, two of the guys seeing that you haven't been,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
you know, affected by this,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
charged towards you and sliced at you with their bladed limbs.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I use my uncanny dodge.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You might think that.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Uncannily, you managed to dodge one of the blows,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
but the other strikes you directly in the right thigh.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Specifically.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Dealing seven damage.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Okay, we're gonna fuck it up.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Putting it at Quark's turn.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Guys, we don't...

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I don't know what to do.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Like, how do we kill these guys?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Sometimes the game's a lot more, like, simpler.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You know, you just do the same thing over and over.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Am I in a position where I can try to cleave with Farsword?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
The Farsword's used up, you can cleave, though.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Alright, try to cleave.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Definitely.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Yeah.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Go for it.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Yeah, go for it.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah, that's not bad.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Okay, yeah.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Whipping out your sword,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
you slice directly through the damaged shadow creature,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and you manage to deal...

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Oh, wow, that's pretty good.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
14 damage, felling the guy in a single strike.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah!

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Your sword carries through

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
and hits the next guy directly

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
where it would be a rib on a normal person,

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
but he's a shadow guy.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Dealing a further 17 damage.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Yeah!

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Whoa!

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But, but...

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
He brought bad meat.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Temper your applause.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
In real life, he is killing us slowly.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
He has dealt us 17 damage.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
This fortitude saves not optional.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Was that a smoked rib?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
What? Yeah.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Alright, yeah!

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Wait, I didn't get...

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I didn't hear it.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Alright.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Alright, so that was good.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So now there's three left.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yeah, so there's three left

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
putting in a more rainstorm.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Okay, so there are shadows,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
but they're also smoke,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and the shadows are going into our throats,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but we can sometimes cut them as swords

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
and sometimes not.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You can cut smoke with a sword,

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
but it doesn't have any effect on the smoke.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
That's what happened.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
There are physical beings

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
whose limbs are transmuting to smoke

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
or some sort of gash.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So go for the sword side, I would say.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So I can either treat the sword to the symptom.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Alright.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I take out three arrows!

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Three arrows.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
You tie them to your feet.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And I take a nap.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Is it possible to fire three arrows

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
while also guzzling some water?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
No.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You can guzzle some water

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and then fire three arrows.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Oh, okay.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
No, wait, you can't.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I'm sorry.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Don't go for the water,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
just do the arrows, I would say.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Either way.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Well, because of smoke,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Dan's looking at me

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
confusedly.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Smoke.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Smoke makes you thirsty?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Well, I mean,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I've tried to like push out the smoke with fire.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I can't put fire in,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
or with water.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I can't put fire in my throat.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Or just choking in the water.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I'm killing the guy in the front row, apparently.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I'm not going to trust you.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
You chose to wear that shirt tonight.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Oh, that's a joke.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
It's a fine shirt.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
It's a very specific color.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
God damn it, guys.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I didn't mean it.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I didn't mean it.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'm a big fan.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Just as long as we don't punish anyone

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
for putting themselves out there.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Let's just fucking seek and destroy

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
anyone who wore a shirt tonight.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Hey, nice head.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
What'd your mom fuck up?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Yeah, who'd your mom fuck,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
General Ugly?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I'm defensive.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Hey, how do you know when you're finished

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
with your face?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
There's something gross growing on your neck.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Oh, sorry, it's your face.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
In my defense, I was saying

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
what I wanted to do,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
and he was acting like I was killing him

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
by throwing his arms up in the air

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and being really upset,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
so I was a little defensive.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Well, shoot your three arrows.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Right?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
That's what we were doing?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yeah.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Back to the ending.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm assuming that's what happened,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
and I already rolled the dice.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
But really, your shirt's fine.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
He's not even looking at me.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
We have to let it go.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I'll let it go.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I'll let it go.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I was trying to be your friend.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Let it go!

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Let it go!

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Two of the arrows missed their mark,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
but one plants itself directly

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
into the right, no, left hand.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
She makes fun of his shirt.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Of the smoke monster.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I'm so sorry.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Dealing six damage.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Six damage?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah, six damage.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Who cares anymore?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Are you okay?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Do you want some cake?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Are you gonna be here next week?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
He gave me the cake.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I did! No, you did the cake!

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Oh, my God!

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
You can have some cake.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Will you be here next week?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Dude, you can have some cake.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
What's your favorite thing in the world?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I think we should give him the starving guy.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I don't want to take the boys.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
All right, okay.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Aaron, are you saying you look like you like some cake?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
This is why we should have left it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Yeah, Sharpie, let's go.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I can't wait to have half self-catches

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
of children with you.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Half?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I know.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That's the joke.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
They don't have a chance.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
They're gonna come out of your uterus

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
and go like,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
What am I?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Did I do it wrong?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
They're just gonna hang themselves

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
with their umbilical cord.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I'm so sorry I cried.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I'm so sorry I cried.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I know this is where I'm supposed to be,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
and I cried, and I'm so sorry.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Was the pregnancy okay?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Were you bleeding irregularly?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
They don't have this pussy behind me.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Just kidding.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I know.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Is that a bad joke?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I don't know.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I'm so fat.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Take a look at this pussy behind me.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I want to get Aaron pregnant

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and the delivery room,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
the kid's gonna shoot out of her vagina

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
and start googling itself.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And then apologize for it

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
for the rest of its life.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Apologize for it

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
and then ask if it's okay,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
and then apologize for it again.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Sharp beats your turn.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I hold up the Soul of Growth.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And I go,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Holding the Soul of Growth aloft,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
it is caught with the azure light

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
that shifts into a more

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
emeraldish-greenish-yellowish light.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Shadows!

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I know you!

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
For a second,

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
you can see what actually looks like light

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
for the first time in the shadow plane.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The rays are cast upon your body

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
and you feel yourselves becoming stronger

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
and more able to carry on.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You all gain

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
16 health points of health

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
right back to your life totals.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah!

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
That's what I said,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
like maybe relevant.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Oh.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yeah.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
All right.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
So is it me now?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
That would be Smoke Monster's turn.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
There's three of them left, right?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Nope, just two.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
That's true, yep.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yeah, there's two of them left.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
You can trick God.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
I know there's three.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
There's three.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I rolled three attacks,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
so I mean, they're happening.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Okay.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
All right, so Sharpie,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
that last like expulsion of air

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
kind of like took the last of your air

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
and the rest of the smoke kind of invades your lungs.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You're really on the ropes.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
You think you might have a couple more breaths

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
before you lose consciousness,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
just from this breathing sort of thing.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Mulraine, in fact, does lose consciousness,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
so only kumail and...

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Who's kumail?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Experience points.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
So I'm okay?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah, you know, yeah.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Chris de Burgh is not affected by the smoke.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Quark has actually managed to cough

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
some of the smoke out

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
and has shaken it off for the most part.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Okay.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
So it's just me and you, but...

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Well, he's still barely conscious.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Okay.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
So this is my last puff

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
to say something cute and Pixar-ish,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
like a little help.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
All right.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Something that kids can giggle at,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
but parents can be like,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
this is edgy.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Yeah.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Get tricky with it!

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Got pain?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Got pain?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Got pain?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
All right.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I take...

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
What's a bowler?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Is that like a cat on nine tails?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It's kind of like that,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
except instead of having like a whip handle,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
you'd whip it around and throw it

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and hope to ensnare your foes with the legs.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
It won't hurt them.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
It'll hurt a little bit if you hit them,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
not much.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
It's mostly an attempt to trip.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Okay.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
All right.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Well, what I do is

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I tie a wire saw to one of the bolos

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and then I just fucking...

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Don't look at me like that.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Also tie the red cap poison to that.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And I tie another thing of acid.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I should do that.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I put on my goggles at night

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
because those goggles of night

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
and all of that,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I just kind of throw it.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
All the good stuff.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Also one of my shoes because, you know,

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
because no regrets, right?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Yolo.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
So you throw it,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
but the added weight of all these

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
non-aerodynamic objects actually

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
pulls it off its course,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
kind of falls a bit short.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Just sitting on the ground.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I go back and get my shoe.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I tied it all together.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That's what had happened.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Yeah, I know.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It's funny.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Attempting to retrieve your shoe,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
you attract the ire of one of the blade monster things.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Man, I can't win for losing.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It slashes you in the...

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I was going to say the right thigh again.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
That doesn't even make sense.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
On the back, dealing a mere two damage.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Okay.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Yeah.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You got your shoe back though.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That's cool.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Hey, this could have gone a lot worse.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
How close am I?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
You are in melee range with these dudes.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I'm going to try to kick one back

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and power attack another.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Okay.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Okay.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So, it's kind of tricky to pull these two moves

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
off at the same time,

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
so I'm going to give you a penalty on the kick

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
because you're going to put more effort into the attack

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
probably.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Jock alert.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Penalty on the kick.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
These are physical actions.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Somebody give this guy a P-Bone.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
A Papst.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
A Papst.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You can't even pretend to talk Jock.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Nah, real football home run there.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Go ahead.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So, what happens after he does all that?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I don't even know anymore.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
No.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Okay.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
So, you try to kick the guy,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
but his semi-solid form actually kind of morphs around it

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
and your foot kind of just gets stuck a little bit.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's not good.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's not comfortable, not feeling good.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
This off-balance nature throws off your attack

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and you swing a bit wide,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
catching one on the tip of his head.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
It doesn't hit him very hard,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
but you manage to nick him just a skosh.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Dealing about six damage.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Six damage.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Bro, I don't think you needed the kick.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I think that's what fucked us.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
But that's okay.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I threw all my belongings.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Throwing a garbage pile of stuff didn't help us.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
No, no, no.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Guys, we should all take a second and drink some P-bones.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Aaron is asleep.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
We're just dying of the two of you are pickering about your high kicks.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Well, it's you.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
It's you, Sharpie.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Can I do anything?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
You have one more action before you lose consciousness.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I have one more action.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'm real sick.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
You're out.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
All right.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Sorry.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
One more action.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I take this very seriously.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
You should.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
My final action.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
You might die.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I hope I don't.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000
My final action is going to define me as a person.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
This is going to be your legacy.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Would you like to ask the audience?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I want to, can I do a lifeline?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Yeah, go for it.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
My final action.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Who are you pointing at, Goldberg?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I agree, sir.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
What about the guy that...

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
He knows.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
He knows.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I don't know.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
He knows.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Is there anybody in the audience that really knows what they would do with their final...

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
All right.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That first hand up there.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Some entire badger?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Some entire badger.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Is that level three or is that...

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I'll trust Adam.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Why would you go with badger as opposed to...

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Because those are hilarious.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
No, I mean...

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
They're really effective combatants.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Don't get me wrong.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
All right, all right.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Forget it.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Another word.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
His answer is he just cast a fucking combat spell.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I just wanted to make sure...

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Oh, it is level three, you guys.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Sorry.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Sorry to rain on everyone's parade.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Level three spell.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
All right.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I'm gonna...

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I know this is gonna seem repetitive.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Yeah.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
But I got good results last time.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I'm gonna pull out...

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
One of the shards.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
One of those crystal shards.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Not the Soul of Growth, but one of those shards that we were...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Okay.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
What, we could do it in count.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Is that the Soul of Growth you're pulling out?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
No, no, no.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
This is one of the shards.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Okay.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Well, let's tell them.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
This is the shard of the unknown.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And words?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Nothing.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Nothing happened.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
All right, can I summon a badger?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It's a level three spell.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
You're out of those.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Oh, shit.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
All right, well, it's the smoke.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
All right, look, Scorching Ray.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
All right.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Casting your arms in a magical manner.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
You fire off a couple bolts of fire.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Yeah, it does.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
That's good stuff.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
That's what my character says to you.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
That was good stuff.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Dealing 18 damage and failing.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Badass.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
So you just leave it to me.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000
One of the remaining creatures had exertion, however, was all it took.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
You feel yourself drift off and fall to the floor unconscious.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
So are there only two left now?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
There are only two left.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And there are only two left of you raising the stakes.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
All right, well, let's finish this battle real quick.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Is it their turn now?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Yeah, so they actually, now that one of them has dropped dead

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
and the other two of you guys are, so it's like two on two, right?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
They kind of square off and they just charge towards you.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
You can see their limbs and their underbodies kind of turn into

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
the smoky thing and they kind of turn into spectral forms

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
as they charge towards you and they actually just blast straight through you

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and you feel a violent chill go through your body.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Yeah, violent indeed.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
You take nine damage.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You feel your insides just feel as if they've been frozen solid somehow

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
and you double over in pain.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
That happens.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You got P-boned.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Fuck.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
All right, well.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That is what getting P-boned is like.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I untie all the things that I've tied up into a useless ball.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
And so I'm pretty close to them, right?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Yep.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I take a...

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Just do something normal.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I don't have weapon at them.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Bro, I got no weapons.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I'm haunting you like Ben Kenobi.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Is the wire saw something I can use against them?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
You have weapons, dude.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Wire saw.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You're like that one globetrotter from the globetrotter cartoon

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
that would pull things out of his hair.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I love his afro, yeah.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I'll use a...

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I use a telephone.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
You'll use a what now?

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I use a telephone too.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Call an Uber and get out of here.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Okay, I use the bow.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I use the bow and it says I have times three critical.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Yeah, that means if you critical hit, it's super effective.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Attack bonus plus nine.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Damage is in the hundreds.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Attack bonus plus nine is helpful to me, actually.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
All right, let's do it.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
So I rolled the attack and apparently you've hit.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So firing an arrow from your short bow,

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
you strike one of the remaining foes directly in his...

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Why directly every time?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Why?

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Chest.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Dealing six damage.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Plus nine.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Plus nine is your to hit.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
The damage is just the 1D...

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I have 10, it might be 1D8.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Okay, all right.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Let's move past it.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Yeah, putting in a quark stern.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Can I believe again?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
What's on?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Can we believe again?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Yeah, let's do that.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Yeah, work last time, right?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
All right.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
It didn't work so well this time.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Pulling...

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
It didn't work last time.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
He put his foot through the guy and then neck the head.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I'm getting so mixed up, you guys.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
This is crazy.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
What?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
If he flanks, then you can backstab him and end this fight and be awesome.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Well, yeah, but he's the flanking one.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
He doesn't get sneak attack damage.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Okay.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Yeah, you guys.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Anyway, so he doesn't hit is what I'm trying to say.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
With your great sword, you swing a bit, you know, you swing a bit,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
but you know, they just flew through you and you're all iced up inside.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So that's tough.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
You don't hit.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
It happens.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I'm sorry.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Okay, is it their turn again?

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Yeah, it is.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So fucked.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
We're fucked.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
We're so fucked.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
What's going to happen?

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Are you only able to dream?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Yeah, do you want to dream?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Well, I mean, because we're unconscious.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Yeah, that's why I'm asking if you want to dream.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Oh, boy.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I dream of a cloud that's made out of horse fur.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And I take off all of my clothes and I cover myself in lotion

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000
and I tumble across the horse fur and Fiona Apple's playing in the background

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
and pizzas come down from the sky and they fall on my face,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
but there are no calories.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And then also I defeat the enemy, I guess.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Yeah.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's my dream.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
That's a pretty good dream.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Yeah, so the shadowy beings, both of their limbs.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
What about my dream?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Yeah, go for a dream.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Yeah.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I have a dream that races get along.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
High-roaded.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Any time you guys want to go back to that poll.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
I have a dream that me and LimeShirt are signing the deal in a house together.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000
When in reality, you just won't let it go.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
What's your name, Limey?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
None of this is making it better.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
All of this is making it worse.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
This is like the bad touch of conversations.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I'm sorry.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
In my dream, Phil and I are creating...

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
You had your dream.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You rolled around in horse lotion.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I solved racism.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
You don't get to...

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Phil and I self-hunger.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Also, we built a dollhouse together.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
That's your second dream.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Third dream.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
There's one dream per turn, you guys.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I'm going to have to be firm on this.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Spencer, how are we going to defeat these guys?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Is it going to take a second?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
No, no, no, we're going to see this through.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I think we're about to die.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Let's hope so.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Is it their turn?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Whoa.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I don't get why that got a reaction.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Because you seem grumpy.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Because we're fucking hateful assholes.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
What?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Can we cliff-hang it?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
No, we can't cliff-hang it.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
You guys are asleep.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Is their turn, right?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Both of their limbs have turned into smoke at this point.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
They went through you, iced your insides.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
You twisted around, failed some attacks.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That happened.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Both of their limbs turned into smoke.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
They just fly directly towards you.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It's like they're strangling you.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
You can actually feel your throats being throttled

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
as the smoke is invading your senses.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Yeah, it's not good.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
So a moment ago, he had this whole growth out.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Yeah, they lost consciousness.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It's like he's clutching it in his hand.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Right now, you can't move too much.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
You're being strangled.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
You're being exertion to move around.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I sneak behind one.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I'm going to lose consciousness.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
It's got its hands around your throat.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Not me, right?

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Yeah, both of you.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Yeah, they squared off one each.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Yeah, they're both taking on each of you guys.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Well, I kind of stab his guy.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Like, I do this kind of thing.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Okay.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
All right.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Like, you know, because I can't reach my guy,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I kind of like...

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Hey, I'll get your guy.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
That makes sense to me.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
So yeah, you do that.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
You stab him just a bit, dealing six damage.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Just a bit.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Shit, we're dying.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Shit!

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Shit!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Not this game.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000
You could die.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Oh, fuck.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
All right, all right, all right.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
We're going to die tonight.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Quark!

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
What you got, baby?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Quark!

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
We're going to die!

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
If I don't think I can actually grab the soul of growth,

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I'm going to try to cleave again.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Okay.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So, yeah, yeah, cleaving again.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Cool move, man.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Oh.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I dig it.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Uh-oh.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
He knows something we don't know.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
I don't like that.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
So those are Spencer's maniacally laughing.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Oh, yeah, it's happening.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
So being strangled, actually, as it happens,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
impacts your accuracy, and you swing wildly,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
trying to cleave through both of these beings in one,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
but it's not happening.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
It's not happening.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
It just doesn't happen.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
That's quite a buildup for not happening.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
He's just us dying.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Your grip loosens on the sword as it drops from your hands

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
and you fall to your knees.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Oh, God.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I, um...

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Are on the verge of unconsciousness.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I, uh, take this opportunity to, uh...

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
So he, did he fuck me last night or no?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
No, he didn't.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Okay.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I think we have time for that.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Why wasn't that anyone's dream?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I, uh, I put my, uh, soft penis inside him.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And have it grow.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Like the fungus is growing inside of me right now.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Summoning the last vestiges of your will to your mighty member.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
No.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I have a poison dagger.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Okay.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I like that better.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Okay.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I take my poison dagger and I stab the bad guys.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
You miss.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Oh, my God.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I think we're all dying.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
What's gonna happen?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
How do I miss?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Because, again, as it happens, when you're being strangled

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
and smoke's going down your throat and you're coughing and stuff

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and wheezing and not breathing,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
you know, combat sort of gets harder.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It's just a thing.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's like, you know...

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Surely we would have gotten you a sandwich.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
But it didn't happen, did it?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I'm sitting here with a bag of chips and a Milky Way bar.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Murdering us.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Yeah.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Just laying waste to dungeons and drifts.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
What's it?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Like, like, like...

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Go ahead.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Commit.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
You guys all lose consciousness.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000
You can't see anything.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
We all do.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Yeah.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Can my last move to be to put the bag of holding over one of these guys' heads?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Yeah.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
You could definitely try.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Yeah, Bill.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Oh, my God.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Oh, my God.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Bill, what if you murdered us?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I mean, do it.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Do it.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
So, over who's head again?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I'm sorry.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I want to smoke you guys.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
All right.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
I want to smoke you guys.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
With your last dying...

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Nope.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Doesn't happen.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Oh, no.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Sorry.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Sorry, Bill.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Sorry, Bill.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Bill, your funness is growing on over this game.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
So we all go unconscious.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Yeah, you're all unconscious.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
All right.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
That's the place where we should...

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Until you regain it in the future.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Or die.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Or die.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
All right.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
In the past.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
That's like a logical answer.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
This is the fuck of a cliffhanger.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
All right.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
All right.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
That's it.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
He and he.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Thanks, Bill.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Thank you, Bill.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Thank you, Bill.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
All right.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Well, what have we learned tonight, Camille?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Don't put yourself out there.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Unless you're fungus.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Unless you're fungus.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
In which case, go for it.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
The big winner tonight is fungus.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Yeah.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Seems like...

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Like, you can die in D&D.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You can get your ass kicked.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
What happened?

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Are we gonna...

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
This is very upsetting.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I'm genuinely a little shaken.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I'm genuinely shaken.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
That's what makes it a good game.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
We might all die.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And then what happens?

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
To create new characters.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Start over?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Like a bunch of pussies.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Have you died in D&D before?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Yeah.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
A million times.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Apparently, someone was telling me about this documentary.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Was it you, Spencer?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.000
This documentary about this dungeon master who got pissed off and they had this game

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
that they'd been playing for years, like Five Guys.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Yeah, it was me.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Sorry.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And he got angry, he was having a shitty day, and he ended up killing all those people.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
And they all got really upset at him.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And then the documentary is set years later where this guy is going back to reconnect

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
with all the people who he killed in the D&D game.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.000
So, Spencer, I'm sorry, even that you can't do in the documentary because it's already

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
happened.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
All right.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
I'll get through.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Well, usually when Jeff's here, this is the point in the show where we don't know how

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
to end it.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
All right.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I will keep the tradition alive.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.000
So, when was the last time you cried?

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I can't remember when the last time I cried is.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Probably I watched probably some sad movie or something.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Okay.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Why did I?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Probably cried.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Probably watched.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Must have been some documentary.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Probably cried during some documentary.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Yeah.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
There's some rough ones out there.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000
There's this one called, and I only name it so that you never watch it.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
It's called Dear Zachary, you know what I'm talking about?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Do not.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
If you haven't seen it, do not watch it.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I'm genuinely saying, because Emily and I got into a lot of like real crime docs and

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
we just watched them over and over.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And this was just one of them.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
It should come with a fucking warning.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Like, oh, do not watch this one.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000
That's all.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
The movie should be called Do Not Watch This.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Because it's a bunch of them about people wrongly imprisoned and then escaping and then

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
this one is like too much.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So, yeah.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Man.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
All right.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Well, I can only think that we've got to.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Do the song?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Do the song?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
There's a song?

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Well, don't you do a song about the whole show?

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Yeah, hit it.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Yeah.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
What do you got in the booth?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
All right.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Yeah.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
All right.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
I feel like we learned a lot.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Now, usually they play a rap beat that does not end the show.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Usually it just goes into a terrible rap.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I'm ready for that.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
And then the show just has to end in spite of me trying to end it with a rap.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000
This is going to be the first night where the rap is catastrophically brilliant.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
It just ends the show.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Those two words don't go together.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
All right.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Yo.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yo.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Yo.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Yo.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yo.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Yo.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Yo.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Lime shirt doesn't matter that you're in here.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Fuck your mama without fear.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
That's stupid.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Who cares?

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
This just seems...

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Something about that felt like really...

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I wonder what it was.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
You take the guy who's already been chat on and then talk about how you fucked his mom.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Now, without fear or regret.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Yeah.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I don't know.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Just doesn't.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
All right.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
All right.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Topic, let me give me a topic.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Fungus.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Fungus.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
All right, fine.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
We've discussed fungus.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
One more try.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
One more try.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Racism.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Fungus.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
The fungus of racism.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And softball.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Yo.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Yo.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Yo.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Yo.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Yo.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Little mushrooms grow up in the air.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Spores threaten.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
They don't care.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000
They got to go from one location to another.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
They fuck your daddy and they fuck your mother.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000
They go from a piece of bread to some meat.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Don't care if they go down the street.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
They're mushrooms that spread through the air.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
This...

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It doesn't work.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Okay.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
All right.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
How do you end the show?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
How do you end a fucking show?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I was so into that rap.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You have no idea.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I forgot there were people here.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I forgot.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I was comp-trolling.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I was these mushrooms fucking that guy's mom and dad.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
You got to figure out a way to end the show.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Well, no.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I think you just have to commit to the thing.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I feel like the rap is really good.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And I think you get to that moment where you think about it too much.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I feel like you have to just go with it and not quit and just keep going.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
And at the end of the rap, it's going to be a beautiful piece.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
How do you know when the rap is over if it's made up?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
All right.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
You're right.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
I'm full of shit.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It's over when it feels like...

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Well, can we make out?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Okay.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Here's the thing.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I'll go a certain number of rhymes and then you do a Vincent Price bridge where you just

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
talk.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Okay.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
All right.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Did I hear that crazy Middle Eastern racist beat?

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
All right.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It's a crazy Middle Eastern rap.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
You pointed me and I'll just talk.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Boys to men used to and stuff.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Where I was like, all right, go.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
This will be a politically poignant rap.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I'll rap.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And then when I point at you, then you'll just talk about whatever.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
You just being in it will make it profound.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
All right.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Okay.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Yeah.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
See?

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Point at me.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Point at me.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Yo.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Yo.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Middle East.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Yo.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yo.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Going down the avenue.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Wait.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Shit.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Hold on.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Sorry.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I didn't hear the beat.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Yo.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Yo.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Middle East rap.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Middle East rap.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Whoa.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Crazy things going on in a place that's

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
on regularly in the Middle East.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
You got to beat the beast with the missiles.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Got the foreign policy.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Oh, shit.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Look at you and me not getting along with country to country.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
She fell in love with me.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Nothing to do with it.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Pakistan going to go through with it.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Can I use your airspace?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Can I use your land?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Fuck your mama with the back of my hand.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I put my fist in her pussy and I felt her ovaries.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Sorry.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Keep getting off topic.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Fuck your mama so far.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Got tropic.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Gave her malaria.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Fuck your mama so hard.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
She got hysteria.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Had to pull out everything inside.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Opened her up so she was wide walk into her and said,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
look at this.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Put some curtains over here.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
We could really do this.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Put a coffee table there.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Go to Ikea.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Just act like we don't care.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Put some Feng Shui and have a mirror there.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
This is bad luck if you come up to the south stair.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
People come in and they can smoke on the patio.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
It's not a joke.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Decorating your mama's pussy.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Re-decorating your mama's pussy.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Re-decorating your mama's pussy.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
It's a metaphor for US policy.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I guess what we're trying to say is shit's bad in the Middle East

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
and all you can do is distract yourself by fucking somebody's mother

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000
or going to Ikea or eating jerky with fungus on it

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
or that kind of stuff.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
You genuinely feel there's no real way to fix that.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Part of the world.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
So all you can do is listen to this rap.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Yo, yo, yo.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Tama hot missile.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Cruise missile.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Dandelion missile.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Tahiti.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Falafel.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
But your mama.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Falafel.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Falafel.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Tahiti.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Falafel.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Falafel.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Falafel.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Kedafel.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Falafel.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Kedafel.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Egypt.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
North Korea.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Ah, shit.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:51.000
All right, well, think about it.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Hormone Town!

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Thank you so much for coming.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Dan Hormone.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Really think about it.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Thank you.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Thank you, Nick and Camille.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Guestcraft, Charlie.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Thank you, Spencer.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Thank you.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Thank you, Zach and Dustin in the audio.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Moe, Fappapap.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Who else do we have to thank?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Danielle and...

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
I think that's the fourth time that Falafel and Kedafel have been rhymed.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So take that home with you.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
All right, well yeah, go home and Wikipedia the Middle East

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and really think about what I told you tonight.
