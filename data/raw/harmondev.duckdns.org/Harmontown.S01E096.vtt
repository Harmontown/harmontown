00:00.000 --> 00:19.080
Hello one and all, welcome once again to the Meltdown Comics Theater of Nerd Melty Towns.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.600
From Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.

00:23.600 --> 00:35.020
Once you please keep those applause going and welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,

00:35.020 --> 00:37.020
Dan Harmon.

00:37.020 --> 00:40.020
Thank you.

00:40.020 --> 00:46.020
Thanks for coming out.

00:46.020 --> 00:51.020
Why so many people?

00:51.020 --> 00:53.020
It's like a record crowd, I think.

00:53.020 --> 00:57.020
I don't know if we've ever, maybe it's just because there's lighting back there or something.

00:57.020 --> 00:58.020
It's a big crowd.

00:58.020 --> 00:59.020
Yeah.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.020
Alright, let's give them what they're worth.

01:01.020 --> 01:07.020
Let's make sure they walk out of here going, I spent $10 and got $20 worth.

01:07.020 --> 01:10.020
How do we make sure that happens?

01:10.020 --> 01:12.020
We just fuck them.

01:12.020 --> 01:17.020
Alright, line up on the right.

01:17.020 --> 01:20.020
Alright, so a couple things.

01:20.020 --> 01:24.020
I just want to, I mean, we had our charity event here today.

01:24.020 --> 01:30.020
We had the 826LA charity event.

01:30.020 --> 01:34.020
And as far as I understand it, it's a good charity.

01:34.020 --> 01:36.020
I'm told.

01:36.020 --> 01:46.020
I'm assuming I'm not going to find out that it's like a charity that goes to fund windowless white vans.

01:46.020 --> 01:51.020
From what I hear, it sounds like exactly my kind of charity.

01:51.020 --> 01:55.020
Because I've always said, I mean, yes, there's hungry people.

01:55.020 --> 01:56.020
Yes, there's poor people.

01:56.020 --> 02:00.020
Yes, there's people with horrible diseases battling them all the time.

02:00.020 --> 02:15.020
There's a million, billion, trillion, zillion ways to try in vain to spread your money if you have a penny to spare around the planet to try to make the planet a better place to try to break the cycle of agony.

02:15.020 --> 02:21.020
However, in my tiny little bubble of existence, I have always been asked this question.

02:21.020 --> 02:27.020
Why are your writing staffs always a bunch of white dudes from Harvard?

02:27.020 --> 02:33.020
And the answer is always because that's the big pile of scripts that piles up.

02:33.020 --> 02:38.020
And the answer to that, why is that big pile of scripts from white dudes from Harvard?

02:38.020 --> 02:50.020
The answer is because those people have support systems, those people are willing and able to spend 15 years pursuing the agonizing field of writing while their parents support them.

02:50.020 --> 02:54.020
And thanks because their parents told them it's possible for you to be a writer, et cetera, et cetera.

02:54.020 --> 03:00.020
It all trickles back to this idea that when you're in sixth grade, did anyone ever come to you?

03:00.020 --> 03:04.020
Did anyone ever come to your public school and tell you you could be a writer?

03:04.020 --> 03:06.020
You can do something creative.

03:06.020 --> 03:11.020
You were allowed while you're thinking of being a princess, while you're thinking of being an astronaut.

03:11.020 --> 03:17.020
Have you ever considered the possibility that writer is an occupation and that that doesn't happen?

03:17.020 --> 03:27.020
Now, I don't think that if you tell sixth graders the world over that they should be writers that they're going to then wander into a world where they're totally supported.

03:27.020 --> 03:37.020
But I do think that not enough of them are being told that there's not enough creative activation in the grade school era of your uprising.

03:37.020 --> 03:40.020
As far as I understand about 826, that's what they're doing.

03:40.020 --> 03:47.020
They're injecting themselves into that part of the genome and trying to change something there.

03:47.020 --> 03:51.020
Saying to 11-year-old kids, write something, create something.

03:51.020 --> 03:54.020
They break the cycle there.

03:54.020 --> 04:00.020
So we raised just tons of money today for them, and hopefully that'll go to something good.

04:00.020 --> 04:03.020
But look them up, Google it, and actually, you know what?

04:03.020 --> 04:08.020
I shouldn't have babbled about it because we have people here from it, and I wanted to ask them personally if I'm right about that.

04:08.020 --> 04:11.020
They're going to come up and say, no, that's not true.

04:11.020 --> 04:14.020
We've been working on biofuel.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.020
You got it all wrong.

04:16.020 --> 04:24.020
Did you have a teacher, Dan, like the first teacher or somebody that supported your writing as a kid, or are your brain as a child?

04:24.020 --> 04:26.020
You know, I did.

04:26.020 --> 04:34.020
I grew up in the 70s in Milwaukee, and every time I expressed an interest in reading and writing, there was somebody,

04:34.020 --> 04:39.020
whether it was my mom or some well-meaning teacher, there was somebody that said,

04:39.020 --> 04:46.020
holy fuck, they always responded that way.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.020
I don't know why you guys are laughing at that.

04:48.020 --> 04:53.020
I'm saying that is a thing that doesn't happen for everybody, and it may very well be.

04:53.020 --> 05:01.020
As far as I know, that may be why I ended up being halfway decent at what I do.

05:01.020 --> 05:04.020
It may be just hypnosis.

05:04.020 --> 05:10.020
But there's a story you might have told before in Harmontown about you being, like, you were separated and went into that little room.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.020
Yeah.

05:12.020 --> 05:20.020
In the 70s, it was still okay to, like, grab kids that showed an interest in stuff, and you yanked them out of general pop,

05:20.020 --> 05:24.020
and you threw them into a closet, and you said, okay, how smart are you?

05:24.020 --> 05:25.020
Show us.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.020
And they still did that with me back then.

05:28.020 --> 05:35.020
And I was, like, a weirdo, and they cranked me up, and then they threw me back in when Reagan got elected.

05:35.020 --> 05:38.020
And then I was like, ah, stop, why are you hitting me?

05:38.020 --> 05:42.020
No, it was, yeah, it was tracking.

05:42.020 --> 05:50.020
There's a sinister side to it and a humanitarian side to it.

05:50.020 --> 05:56.020
I think that the bottom line is, like, kids, you can't farm them.

05:56.020 --> 05:58.020
You cannot form education.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.020
It doesn't work.

05:59.020 --> 06:10.020
You have to, like, every single tiny little human brain is a, the whole thing that's for sale with the human species is diversity.

06:10.020 --> 06:19.020
It's the idea that every little cranium contains not another kernel of popcorn, but in fact a potential Picasso.

06:19.020 --> 06:26.020
And it doesn't, that doesn't make it shameful if the thing that pops is a delightful garbage man.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.020
That's not shameful.

06:29.020 --> 06:32.020
What's shameful is treating them all the same.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.020
That's what's shameful.

06:34.020 --> 06:41.020
You have to regard every pre-Picasso brain as if it might be a Picasso.

06:41.020 --> 06:43.020
So Dan, are you pro-life?

06:43.020 --> 06:45.020
No, maybe not.

06:45.020 --> 06:48.020
Then it gets more complicated.

06:48.020 --> 06:53.020
Once the sperm hits the egg, fuck that thing, flush it down the toilet.

06:53.020 --> 06:57.020
But for God's sakes, once it's got a head, I don't know.

06:57.020 --> 07:08.020
Anyways, I roll into this stuff early because we, so why don't we, let's just bring up Tyler.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.020
Where's Tyler?

07:09.020 --> 07:10.020
Is he in the front row?

07:10.020 --> 07:11.020
There you are.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.020
Are you willing to come up?

07:12.020 --> 07:18.020
There you go, coming up.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.020
Grab a mic and have a seat.

07:22.020 --> 07:30.020
Did I get, what did I get wrong when I, Tyler is one of the, you were there at the beginning of 826, what became 826LA?

07:30.020 --> 07:32.020
You were there in San Francisco?

07:32.020 --> 07:33.020
Yes.

07:33.020 --> 07:38.020
Yeah, I was, I feel so old now thinking about this because I haven't had to think about it.

07:38.020 --> 07:44.020
12 years ago, right around now, I was the first, one of the first students at 826 Valencia.

07:44.020 --> 07:46.020
It was a clap, that was adorable.

07:46.020 --> 07:48.020
I don't know why I should get a clap, but.

07:48.020 --> 07:56.020
So you were one of the first students, does that mean you were one of the first beneficiaries of 826's existence?

07:56.020 --> 07:57.020
Yeah.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.020
Yes.

07:58.020 --> 08:03.020
Okay, so you were one of the founding members of this charity, you were one of the first kids that benefited from this.

08:03.020 --> 08:06.020
Yeah, yeah, and it was started by Dave Eggers at San Francisco.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.020
He's the author.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.020
Thank you.

08:09.020 --> 08:13.020
Yeah, he's a Pulitzer Prize finalist for Heartbreak and Work of Staggering Genius.

08:13.020 --> 08:20.020
He wrote the script for Where the Wild Things Are, the movie, done work with Spike Jonze, many things like that.

08:20.020 --> 08:26.020
But the guy that wrote the book, Where the Wild Things Are, he started a much better charity.

08:26.020 --> 08:32.020
It's more pure, it's more beloved.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.020
It's called 937.

08:34.020 --> 08:43.020
Not that we can measure these things, but yes, it's called 937 Earth.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.020
It's a higher number.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.020
Yeah.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.020
Earth.

08:47.020 --> 08:55.020
But yeah, I guess the biggest thing for anyone to take away, and I do know, because I was introduced by Harmontown just by finding it online,

08:55.020 --> 09:00.020
that there's so many people around the world listening to this right now, when they do listen to it in the future,

09:00.020 --> 09:04.020
that 826 is not just LA, it is not just San Francisco.

09:04.020 --> 09:06.020
It is eight cities in the U.S.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.020
They are always looking for volunteers.

09:08.020 --> 09:13.020
Just for 2012, 2013 year, they served 34,000 students.

09:13.020 --> 09:18.020
They had over 4,000 volunteers nationwide, but they are always looking for more.

09:18.020 --> 09:22.020
So it's not just your money, that they would always love your money, and if you ever want to spend that,

09:22.020 --> 09:28.020
each store across the nation has their own niche market that they like to sell things to.

09:28.020 --> 09:33.020
Here, if you happen to be a time traveler, their storefront is for time travelers.

09:33.020 --> 09:36.020
San Francisco is a pirate supply store.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.020
I believe Chicago is a robot supply store.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.020
New York is for superheroes.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.020
And I mean, at the root of it is tutoring, right?

09:45.020 --> 09:46.020
Yes.

09:46.020 --> 09:48.020
It is creative writing and tutoring.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.020
It's a thinking man's boy's center.

09:51.020 --> 09:56.020
When I was a kid, it was like, keep the kids off the street, try to keep them in a gang.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.020
There was like, what were those things called?

09:58.020 --> 10:00.020
YMCA's?

10:00.020 --> 10:02.020
Well, is it YMCA or?

10:02.020 --> 10:04.020
Boys Club.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.020
Boys Clubs, yeah.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.020
I was in a boys club as a kid.

10:07.020 --> 10:10.020
I don't know under what circumstances, but I do know.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.020
Desire.

10:12.020 --> 10:16.020
I was the connect for a champion.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.020
That's awesome.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.020
That's how low budget that boys club was.

10:19.020 --> 10:21.020
I don't sell you some short.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.020
I'm sure if it was global, you would still be.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.020
I'm sure you're really good at connect for it.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.020
No, but we didn't play rugby.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
We played connect for.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.020
No, but I bet you're really good at connect for it.

10:32.020 --> 10:36.020
Oh, there's two things I'm great at.

10:36.020 --> 10:37.020
Connect three.

10:37.020 --> 10:41.020
Connect four.

10:41.020 --> 10:44.020
I will challenge anybody to connect four or boggle.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.020
I will beat you.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.020
I will beat you at boggle.

10:48.020 --> 10:51.020
I believe you.

10:51.020 --> 10:54.020
I have you.

10:54.020 --> 10:58.020
No, also, that said, Dan, I will tell you right now.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.020
Here's the couple that I'm bad at.

11:00.020 --> 11:03.020
I'm terrible at foosball and ping pong.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.020
I can see that.

11:04.020 --> 11:09.020
Just based on tonight, you're terrible at bragging.

11:09.020 --> 11:20.020
Oh, I haven't begun to brag yet.

11:20.020 --> 11:22.020
No, you're getting better than that.

11:22.020 --> 11:25.020
Tyler, it's just me or Tyler, little Jason Zidekis.

11:25.020 --> 11:27.020
Do you see this?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.020
It's a little bit.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.020
I don't know if that's a compliment.

11:31.020 --> 11:32.020
Oh, it is.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.020
Oh, yeah.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.020
He's dating Olivia Wilde.

11:35.020 --> 11:39.020
All right, so you were a little fella and you,

11:39.020 --> 11:42.020
how did you encounter 826?

11:42.020 --> 11:44.020
Like, you were where?

11:44.020 --> 11:49.020
I was in the East Bay and I read Dave's book.

11:49.020 --> 11:54.020
And it did quite a lot for me in terms of his honesty.

11:54.020 --> 11:58.020
And what I found so amazing about today is that two of my favorite things came together

11:58.020 --> 12:03.020
and that I think you and Dave actually share the same host mentality of pure honesty.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.020
But I'm better than him.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.020
Yes.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.020
I'm assuming.

12:06.020 --> 12:07.020
Of course.

12:07.020 --> 12:08.020
Okay, all right.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.020
It's not important.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.020
I don't know.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.020
I mean, through his scales.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.020
You're assuming.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.020
Yeah.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.020
And yeah, I just signed for a class online.

12:16.020 --> 12:19.020
I took a summer course with him for, I think, 12 weeks.

12:19.020 --> 12:21.020
And yeah, it was an amazing experience.

12:21.020 --> 12:25.020
Dave in contact and it's helped me for the last decade.

12:25.020 --> 12:29.020
So since the last decade, I mean, thousands of students have been helped

12:29.020 --> 12:35.020
reading, writing, tutoring, some famous celebrities help out kids that they don't need to.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.020
You know, they're not paid to do so.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.020
Spike Jonze helps out a lot.

12:38.020 --> 12:41.020
Nina Ve and many, many people in the writing circles.

12:41.020 --> 12:47.020
If you go in there and tutor a kid, like my biggest dream is like to do something that I felt like I could,

12:47.020 --> 12:52.020
you know, I want to feel good about myself.

12:52.020 --> 12:57.020
And yet I don't want to talk to people.

12:57.020 --> 12:59.020
I don't want to go near people.

12:59.020 --> 13:05.020
I don't want to help a kid.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.020
Not really.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.020
Not in a physical sense.

13:10.020 --> 13:13.020
The kids like, I need help.

13:13.020 --> 13:16.020
Checkbook.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.020
I want to.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.020
I want to.

13:19.020 --> 13:22.020
You want to not help a kid.

13:22.020 --> 13:23.020
I don't want to.

13:23.020 --> 13:31.020
What I don't want to do is tell the kid, like, is help a kid that would be me at 11, 12.

13:31.020 --> 13:36.020
Like, the kid that would be me would be like, fuck you, old piece of shit.

13:36.020 --> 13:41.020
Like, why am I, I want to go play my Commodore 64 at home.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.020
And I'm sure that's not still a problem.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.020
No.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.020
I'm sure they've grown beyond that.

13:46.020 --> 13:49.020
We've solved the Commodore 64 problem.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.020
Thank God.

13:51.020 --> 13:54.020
Is there an archetypal kid that you would want to help?

13:54.020 --> 13:56.020
Like, if you could imagine the kind of kid that you would.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.020
It's the kid.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.020
It's me.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.020
But it's the same kid that would be hard to help.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.020
This dirty face little piece of shit.

14:02.020 --> 14:06.020
Anybody, let alone anybody that was telling him what to do.

14:06.020 --> 14:11.020
I grew up, like, hating adults, not wanting anybody to tell me what to do.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.020
I needed somebody to.

14:13.020 --> 14:20.020
I valued very much my parents when telling me my mom was unconditionally supportive of

14:20.020 --> 14:21.020
me creatively.

14:21.020 --> 14:27.020
Like, if I did anything, my mom was like, holy shit, that's amazing that you're doing that.

14:27.020 --> 14:31.020
I don't think that's something a lot of people have.

14:31.020 --> 14:36.020
But at school, if somebody told me what to do, like, fuck you.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.020
Like karate chop.

14:37.020 --> 14:40.020
Like, every mental karate chop ever.

14:40.020 --> 14:46.020
Anyway, so what have you, since you were a beneficiary of this, have you become a benefactor of

14:46.020 --> 14:52.020
it, aside from the fact that you came to the sale today and spend untold millions?

14:52.020 --> 14:57.020
Oh yes, it wasn't noted, but you're welcome for all the cake.

14:57.020 --> 15:01.020
Have you become active in the...

15:01.020 --> 15:06.020
Sadly, I moved away from the country for a couple years, and even now I don't live

15:06.020 --> 15:07.020
nearby.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.020
You went to Russia, didn't you?

15:08.020 --> 15:12.020
Because you got taught to be a communist by this horrible socialist organization.

15:12.020 --> 15:16.020
I went to the first world, the second world, and now I'm in the third world, technically.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.020
So that's what happens.

15:17.020 --> 15:21.020
But no, no, even for what you were noting, if you don't necessarily want to be in front

15:21.020 --> 15:25.020
of a child and tell them what to do, I mean, the thing that...

15:25.020 --> 15:26.020
I can understand it.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.020
It's a very odd situation.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.020
They're frightening people, children.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.020
Oh yeah.

15:31.020 --> 15:36.020
I mean, the thing that actually inspired me the most is that on the walls, at least in

15:36.020 --> 15:42.020
San Francisco, writers would donate their first, second, and third versions of scripts

15:42.020 --> 15:48.020
or books, and you would see famous names like Coppola on his script, and he would just

15:48.020 --> 15:52.020
axe out huge portions of it, and it was supposed to instill in kids this idea that even some

15:52.020 --> 15:55.020
of these luminaries do not get it right.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.020
You were always working.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.020
That's cool.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.020
It doesn't matter what your name is.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.020
And I never met any of these people.

15:59.020 --> 16:03.020
You could just walk up and see someone's name that you knew, and you realized that it's

16:03.020 --> 16:05.020
not always right the first time.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.020
Yeah, yeah.

16:06.020 --> 16:07.020
I would love to...

16:07.020 --> 16:08.020
Yeah.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.020
God damn it.

16:09.020 --> 16:13.020
As long as I don't have to touch them or look them in the eye, I will...

16:13.020 --> 16:15.020
Why are you afraid of children?

16:15.020 --> 16:17.020
I can't do it.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.020
Kids don't like me.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.020
Some kids like me...

16:20.020 --> 16:22.020
Do you know that?

16:22.020 --> 16:26.020
It's really touch and go with me.

16:26.020 --> 16:32.020
Dino's kid, when she was a little larva...

16:32.020 --> 16:33.020
Toddler.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.020
I could...

16:35.020 --> 16:36.020
I would go like...

16:36.020 --> 16:37.020
I would go like...

16:37.020 --> 16:41.020
Mr. Flappy Arms, Mr. Flappy Arms, and she'd be like...

16:41.020 --> 16:45.020
She loved it.

16:45.020 --> 16:49.020
And now she's like 15 or something, and she's got the cell phone, and she's just rolling

16:49.020 --> 16:52.020
her eyes, and I can't even...

16:52.020 --> 16:56.020
You're afraid of 13-year-old Dino's daughter right now?

16:56.020 --> 16:59.020
Kids who are really actually cognitively active.

16:59.020 --> 17:05.020
But why is a kid more or less frightening than an adult?

17:05.020 --> 17:08.020
Because they're able to judge me.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.020
Well, adults are too, right?

17:10.020 --> 17:12.020
Well, yeah.

17:12.020 --> 17:15.020
But adults are co-opted by me financially.

17:15.020 --> 17:19.020
I own all of them.

17:19.020 --> 17:21.020
Most kids don't have a filter.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.020
So you're afraid of children because you don't own them yet?

17:24.020 --> 17:25.020
Correct.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.020
Yes.

17:26.020 --> 17:29.020
Like, Willy Wonka works for me.

17:29.020 --> 17:33.020
The girl that turns into a blueberry, she's still got something over me because she doesn't

17:33.020 --> 17:36.020
understand finance yet.

17:36.020 --> 17:39.020
I'm figuring this out at the same time as you are.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.020
I guess that's what it is.

17:40.020 --> 17:44.020
I think we're going to agree that we haven't figured that we're not yet.

17:44.020 --> 17:46.020
I skipped a step.

17:46.020 --> 17:50.020
I skipped being good at football and went right to owning things.

17:50.020 --> 17:53.020
But we've talked about the fact that you're not good with...

17:53.020 --> 17:57.020
You're not comfortable around strangers or other people for that matter,

17:57.020 --> 18:01.020
but are children more frightening than adults?

18:01.020 --> 18:02.020
Teenage children.

18:02.020 --> 18:03.020
Yeah.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.020
I don't think there's anybody in this room that's like,

18:05.020 --> 18:07.020
I love teenagers.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.020
Except in the most horrible sense.

18:10.020 --> 18:12.020
There's eight.

18:12.020 --> 18:15.020
That guy, that guy.

18:15.020 --> 18:20.020
But I mean, like, teenagers are, for a good reason.

18:20.020 --> 18:25.020
We send them to war and we worship them.

18:25.020 --> 18:29.020
And we are looking to them and they don't know anything.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.020
They're like this monolith of energy.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.020
Everything comes off of them.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.020
And they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

18:35.020 --> 18:39.020
Capitalism almost like really fucks them over in that sense.

18:39.020 --> 18:45.020
The baby boomers celebrate that day when the fucking Beatles played on Ed Sullivan or whatever.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.020
That's their big day.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.020
Bigger than the moon landing.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.020
You see more footage of the fucking Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan

18:51.020 --> 18:53.020
than you see of some yahoo landing on the moon.

18:53.020 --> 18:55.020
Fucking moon is a fucking thing.

18:55.020 --> 18:57.020
A rock far away.

18:57.020 --> 19:03.020
How many times like Robert Zemeckis thinks that the Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan is a bigger deal.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.020
Forrest Gump, if you read the book,

19:11.020 --> 19:14.020
it has a whole chapter where he goes to the moon, by the way.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.020
What?

19:15.020 --> 19:18.020
They took it out of the movie.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.020
No.

19:19.020 --> 19:22.020
Because it's not interesting to baby boomers.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.020
There's no book.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.020
They will mention it passing that they landed on the moon.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.020
There's no book.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.020
Forrest Gump is a fucking book.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.020
Are you kidding me?

19:28.020 --> 19:29.020
Is it a book?

19:29.020 --> 19:31.020
Somebody tell this asshole, Forrest Gump is a book.

19:31.020 --> 19:34.020
Forrest Gump is a book, motherfucker!

19:34.020 --> 19:37.020
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:37.020 --> 19:39.020
Yes, Forrest Gump was a book.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.020
And in the book, for-

19:41.020 --> 19:42.020
He goes to the moon?

19:42.020 --> 19:43.020
Yes.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.020
Forrest Gump-

19:44.020 --> 19:45.020
In the moon.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.020
In the Forrest Gump book.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.020
Forrest Gump is legitimately like down syndrome.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.020
No.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.020
What do you mean no?

19:54.020 --> 19:56.020
Three people said no.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.020
Well, okay.

19:58.020 --> 20:01.020
Forrest Gump is pretty much labeled as legitimately.

20:01.020 --> 20:06.020
It's pretty clear that he is like really low 90s IQ.

20:06.020 --> 20:11.020
Like he's like sub-Belushi.

20:11.020 --> 20:14.020
Like this.

20:14.020 --> 20:19.020
I don't know what the politically correct term is.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.020
Sub-Belushi.

20:20.020 --> 20:23.020
The book takes you through all of the interesting shit.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.020
He throws his medal, the congressional medal, the thing.

20:26.020 --> 20:29.020
In the book, for instance, he takes his purple heart

20:29.020 --> 20:33.020
and he throws it on the steps of the Capitol building

20:33.020 --> 20:36.020
and he hits a senator in the head.

20:36.020 --> 20:40.020
That senator's name?

20:40.020 --> 20:42.020
Forrest Gump.

20:42.020 --> 20:46.020
I'm saying in the book, it's more inflammatory.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.020
It's more passionate.

20:47.020 --> 20:50.020
It's like Cormac McCarthy, like the version of Forrest Gump.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.020
Did you read this book?

20:51.020 --> 20:52.020
Yes, I did.

20:52.020 --> 20:53.020
I thought you didn't read books.

20:53.020 --> 20:56.020
I know, but sometimes I just grab one and just leave through it.

20:56.020 --> 20:59.020
The one book you read was Forrest Gump.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.020
I'll page through them.

21:01.020 --> 21:03.020
I don't qualify it as reading.

21:03.020 --> 21:06.020
I just think, okay.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.020
I read Forrest Gump.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.020
He goes into space in the book.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.020
I don't want to spend the whole podcast.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.020
I swear to God.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.020
Google it.

21:15.020 --> 21:16.020
He goes to space.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.020
Here's my point.

21:17.020 --> 21:20.020
The baby boomers who took over this planet

21:20.020 --> 21:23.020
and who are bulging it with garbage and corn syrup

21:23.020 --> 21:27.020
and fucking these narcissistic maniacs,

21:27.020 --> 21:29.020
these people who've destroyed everything

21:29.020 --> 21:32.020
and who are telling us that we should be honored to follow

21:32.020 --> 21:35.020
in their footsteps, they landed on the moon.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.020
They always tell us that.

21:36.020 --> 21:39.020
But what they're really, really proud of is like,

21:39.020 --> 21:40.020
fucking Ed Sullivan show.

21:40.020 --> 21:41.020
He loves you.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.020
Yeah.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.020
Yeah.

21:43.020 --> 21:44.020
Yeah.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.020
Garbage.

21:45.020 --> 21:47.020
Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage.

21:47.020 --> 21:51.020
I can't remember why we were on this topic.

21:51.020 --> 21:52.020
You hate teenagers.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.020
Yeah.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.020
We were trying to help the teenagers.

21:54.020 --> 21:55.020
Teenagers.

21:55.020 --> 21:56.020
Okay.

21:56.020 --> 22:01.020
The idea that teenagers are an entity.

22:01.020 --> 22:05.020
The idea that teenagers in spite of not being old enough

22:05.020 --> 22:07.020
to go to war, not being old enough to drink,

22:07.020 --> 22:09.020
not being old enough to drive a car,

22:09.020 --> 22:13.020
are somehow this center of capitalism.

22:13.020 --> 22:17.020
That is a baby boomer invention because they were that age

22:17.020 --> 22:19.020
when they became sentient.

22:19.020 --> 22:23.020
And we are living in the shadow of that fucking gross willow tree.

22:23.020 --> 22:26.020
And that results in all of us going on YouTube,

22:26.020 --> 22:31.020
48-year-old people telling Miley Cyrus that she's a slut

22:31.020 --> 22:32.020
in the comment section.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.020
Like, let her be a slut.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.020
What the fuck did she do wrong?

22:37.020 --> 22:38.020
She's a fucking teenager.

22:38.020 --> 22:40.020
Let her be a teenager either,

22:40.020 --> 22:42.020
and fucking Justin Bieber.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.020
I'm on his side.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.020
I'm still on his side.

22:45.020 --> 22:46.020
No.

22:46.020 --> 22:48.020
I'm still pro-Beber.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.020
No.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.020
Why are you pro-Beber?

22:50.020 --> 22:51.020
I'm a believer.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.020
He's a little douchebag.

22:52.020 --> 22:53.020
No.

22:53.020 --> 22:56.020
He doesn't have a right to be a douchebag or not.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.020
He's a fucking child.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.020
And it's capitalism.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.020
Capitalism that you hate.

23:00.020 --> 23:02.020
It's not Justin Bieber.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.020
It's capitalism.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.020
I've seen him on camera.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.020
He's that fucking little asshole.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.020
Capitalism.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.020
No.

23:07.020 --> 23:10.020
He would just be some kid at your fucking Thanksgiving.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.020
Not true.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.020
If he weren't for capitalism.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.020
Not true.

23:13.020 --> 23:16.020
He shouldn't give people that much money.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.020
He didn't earn it.

23:18.020 --> 23:21.020
He's a mousketeer.

23:21.020 --> 23:24.020
Just cut him off.

23:24.020 --> 23:26.020
Just tell him you danced enough.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.020
You did it.

23:27.020 --> 23:28.020
You're great.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.020
Give him a go-kart.

23:29.020 --> 23:33.020
Put a fucking cap on it.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.020
He gets his go-kart.

23:35.020 --> 23:37.020
He wouldn't have known.

23:37.020 --> 23:40.020
Everything you see him doing, he's saying to America,

23:40.020 --> 23:43.020
why did I get more than a go-kart?

23:43.020 --> 23:44.020
Why?

23:44.020 --> 23:48.020
Why is my go-kart $800,000?

23:48.020 --> 23:50.020
Why does it go so fast?

23:50.020 --> 23:52.020
Why can it kill people?

23:52.020 --> 23:56.020
Why are my Pop Rocks cocaine?

23:56.020 --> 23:59.020
It's your fault.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.020
You don't have a culture.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.020
You don't have a fucking religion.

24:03.020 --> 24:04.020
You are a garbage.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.020
You are capitalism.

24:05.020 --> 24:08.020
You have a fucking bedrock of money.

24:08.020 --> 24:12.020
And it says, in God we trust and the God is spelled with dollar signs,

24:12.020 --> 24:15.020
even though there's no S in it.

24:15.020 --> 24:20.020
None of you get to blame him for anything.

24:20.020 --> 24:24.020
You sit on the fucking internet jerking off with one hand

24:24.020 --> 24:27.020
and making fun of Justin Bieber with the other.

24:27.020 --> 24:29.020
You're not doing anything.

24:29.020 --> 24:31.020
He's a child.

24:31.020 --> 24:35.020
What would you do with a billion dollars?

24:35.020 --> 24:36.020
What would you do?

24:36.020 --> 24:37.020
He's 19, though.

24:37.020 --> 24:40.020
He's gorgeous.

24:40.020 --> 24:44.020
And he's a genius.

24:44.020 --> 24:47.020
I think you buried the lead on that one.

24:47.020 --> 24:51.020
Give a billion dollars to anybody in this room, including me.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.020
See how we handle it.

24:53.020 --> 24:56.020
This fucking poor Canadian schmuck.

24:56.020 --> 25:01.020
The behavior that we engage in,

25:01.020 --> 25:04.020
48-year-old housewives with eight cats on their shoulders

25:04.020 --> 25:08.020
sitting on their laptop with fucking stains on their sofa.

25:08.020 --> 25:14.020
Yeah, I need Justin Bieber's needs to understand his value system.

25:14.020 --> 25:18.020
The fuck are you talking about, you fucking idiot?

25:18.020 --> 25:22.020
The fuck do you think your taxes go to?

25:22.020 --> 25:26.020
Fucking focus your rage on something productive.

25:26.020 --> 25:29.020
Follow the money you retied.

25:29.020 --> 25:32.020
Shit, sorry.

25:35.020 --> 25:37.020
Edit it out. Edit it out.

25:37.020 --> 25:39.020
No, leave it.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.020
It stays.

25:40.020 --> 25:41.020
No, no, no.

25:41.020 --> 25:46.020
But it's interesting that Justin Bieber is the tipping point for your rage.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.020
It is. It is.

25:48.020 --> 25:53.020
Because I see him. They put him on TMZ and he's in that deposition.

25:53.020 --> 25:55.020
Yeah, but when he talks to you, he's all the way...

25:55.020 --> 25:57.020
I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.020
And they're like editing around.

25:59.020 --> 26:04.020
There's a dude that's like 53 years old sitting in an avid deck

26:04.020 --> 26:07.020
and setting in points and out points

26:07.020 --> 26:12.020
on a fucking Canadian teenager's deposition

26:12.020 --> 26:16.020
so that he can make $80 from TMZ,

26:16.020 --> 26:18.020
giving them clips of this kid.

26:18.020 --> 26:21.020
Are we fucking out of our mind?

26:21.020 --> 26:25.020
If you were a caveman, how would you react to that?

26:25.020 --> 26:28.020
How would you react to a tribe if you came over the hill

26:28.020 --> 26:31.020
and found them engaged in that behavior?

26:31.020 --> 26:33.020
You would eat them.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.020
You would take their water.

26:35.020 --> 26:38.020
You would take everything they had.

26:38.020 --> 26:40.020
And you would never look back.

26:40.020 --> 26:43.020
You'd take their cave. You'd take their animals.

26:43.020 --> 26:46.020
You'd take everything. And you would never look back.

26:46.020 --> 26:50.020
Ever. You would erase their cave art.

26:50.020 --> 26:52.020
And you wouldn't feel bad.

26:52.020 --> 26:55.020
You'd be like, they didn't mean it.

26:55.020 --> 26:58.020
They did it wrong. They fucked up.

26:58.020 --> 27:03.020
They're idiots. They're a strain of our DNA that fucked up.

27:03.020 --> 27:06.020
They care too much about this kid.

27:06.020 --> 27:10.020
You gotta fucking respect your elders and love your children

27:10.020 --> 27:13.020
and further the species.

27:13.020 --> 27:16.020
We fucked up. We're dead.

27:16.020 --> 27:19.020
Anyways, so 8-2-6-LA.

27:28.020 --> 27:30.020
It's for the kids.

27:30.020 --> 27:32.020
And it's going to teach them how to write.

27:32.020 --> 27:36.020
So Dan, you wouldn't want to mentor a teenager, right?

27:36.020 --> 27:38.020
I would.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.020
The first thing I would do is send them down and say,

27:40.020 --> 27:42.020
look, according to NASA, we have 40 years left.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.020
I just read this on the internet.

27:44.020 --> 27:46.020
According to NASA, what?

27:46.020 --> 27:48.020
We've got 40 years left.

27:48.020 --> 27:50.020
On this planet. Now, I will say this.

27:50.020 --> 27:53.020
Conflict of interest with NASA.

27:53.020 --> 27:56.020
NASA released a report that said,

27:56.020 --> 27:59.020
can't live on this planet for more than 40 years.

27:59.020 --> 28:01.020
Based on population.

28:01.020 --> 28:04.020
This is a company that profits if we leave the planet.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.020
So I will say that.

28:06.020 --> 28:09.020
However, we did give them nothing to do.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.020
Think about their shit.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.020
Malthusian, like...

28:13.020 --> 28:16.020
It's ozone. It's a confluence of everything.

28:16.020 --> 28:22.020
It's ozone and it's tidal waves and pickles are getting bigger.

28:22.020 --> 28:25.020
Bees are turning into potatoes.

28:25.020 --> 28:28.020
I would say you and I at age 40 and you're 41.

28:28.020 --> 28:30.020
No, we nailed it.

28:30.020 --> 28:32.020
We're going to write that wave right into the beach.

28:32.020 --> 28:34.020
That's what I'm saying.

28:34.020 --> 28:37.020
When I heard that, I came over to the Rick and Morty register and they were like,

28:37.020 --> 28:40.020
do you hear it? NASA said we got 40 years left and I was like...

28:42.020 --> 28:44.020
I'm the bad guy in a ski movie.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.020
I nailed it.

28:48.020 --> 28:50.020
In my dreams, I'll make it to that.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.020
My kid will be 10.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.020
I'll be like, so long, Toby.

28:54.020 --> 28:56.020
You're done good.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.020
You're kids named Toby?

28:58.020 --> 29:00.020
Because you're a big Roots fan.

29:00.020 --> 29:02.020
It's better than Aaron's riffs.

29:02.020 --> 29:04.020
Saffron and fucking...

29:04.020 --> 29:06.020
Cormac.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.020
Cormac?

29:08.020 --> 29:10.020
For real?

29:10.020 --> 29:12.020
It's the new Hunter.

29:12.020 --> 29:14.020
We'll bring her out soon.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.020
Tyler?

29:16.020 --> 29:18.020
Tyler, would you shut the fuck up for three seconds?

29:18.020 --> 29:20.020
Sorry, sorry.

29:20.020 --> 29:22.020
I've just been rambling and going on and on and on.

29:22.020 --> 29:28.020
Tyler, what does a 28-year-old Harmontown fan that's listening in...

29:28.020 --> 29:30.020
Let's say Seattle.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.020
Because there's this LA tag on 826LA.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.020
We're doing things locally.

29:34.020 --> 29:36.020
What do they do?

29:40.020 --> 29:42.020
I'll tell you.

29:42.020 --> 29:46.020
Yeah, so anyone can go to 826national.org.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.020
It's 826national.org.

29:50.020 --> 29:54.020
And that website will tell you everything you can do for any city in the U.S. that has an 826.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.020
And they can volunteer their time.

29:56.020 --> 29:58.020
They can tutor kids ages 6 to 18.

29:58.020 --> 30:02.020
They can help with field trips.

30:02.020 --> 30:06.020
They can literally sit down and read a book with someone.

30:06.020 --> 30:08.020
It's all the things you don't want to do.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.020
Yeah, but an objective says...

30:10.020 --> 30:16.020
One of the coolest things is they bring kids into these field trips, into these local centers.

30:16.020 --> 30:24.020
And the kids get to write a book and they leave that day with a bound book that they wrote.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.020
Which is...

30:26.020 --> 30:28.020
Dan, I think...

30:28.020 --> 30:30.020
I don't think you can dismiss the power of that to a kid.

30:30.020 --> 30:32.020
I think you should do it.

30:32.020 --> 30:34.020
I'm not like being challenging you.

30:34.020 --> 30:36.020
I'm saying go face your fears.

30:36.020 --> 30:38.020
Pick an age from 6 to 18, you say?

30:38.020 --> 30:40.020
No, I will do it. I'm going to do it.

30:40.020 --> 30:42.020
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

30:44.020 --> 30:46.020
And I would say...

30:46.020 --> 30:50.020
I don't care what age group you pick or what kid you get.

30:50.020 --> 30:54.020
I would say that it will impact you in a good way. I guarantee it.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.020
I'll do whatever I can.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.020
I mean, I've been aching for...

30:58.020 --> 31:00.020
I need to be...

31:00.020 --> 31:02.020
Yeah, I don't know.

31:02.020 --> 31:06.020
Yes, I have that part of my soul that's been decaying.

31:06.020 --> 31:10.020
It's obviously where a limb is supposed to be growing and reaching out.

31:10.020 --> 31:14.020
And I hope you get like a 17-year-old girl who...

31:14.020 --> 31:16.020
Wow, okay.

31:18.020 --> 31:22.020
Who on site doesn't like the cut of your jib.

31:22.020 --> 31:26.020
That's a good six years on ABC this fall.

31:26.020 --> 31:28.020
That sounds amazing.

31:28.020 --> 31:32.020
All right, well, let's thank Tyler for coming up and representing 826.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.020
Thank you, sir.

31:42.020 --> 31:44.020
It's a beneficiary of that organization.

31:44.020 --> 31:48.020
And he came today and he bought a lot of shit to benefit that charity.

31:48.020 --> 31:52.020
Which may put people off. They're like, well, what are you, like some kind of insect hive?

31:52.020 --> 31:56.020
Do you just train people to...

31:56.020 --> 31:58.020
Are you like Scientologists?

31:58.020 --> 32:02.020
Oh, yeah, so you're a beneficiary of the charity and you put money back into the charity forever.

32:02.020 --> 32:06.020
He was one of the original kids and he got all kinds of cool swag today.

32:06.020 --> 32:08.020
How much money did you waste today?

32:08.020 --> 32:10.020
Can you say? Or is that bad?

32:10.020 --> 32:12.020
Well, lots and lots. I don't know.

32:12.020 --> 32:16.020
There was donations that came in just because we raised awareness of the charity.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.020
There was, we had a nice garage sale today.

32:18.020 --> 32:22.020
We're really, you know, 50 cents for this, for my Tootsie DVD.

32:22.020 --> 32:28.020
And there was also, I was walking around with a sign around my neck that Erin put around me.

32:28.020 --> 32:31.020
That said, $50 to do a shot with Dan Harmon.

32:31.020 --> 32:37.020
And some of these people took me up on that, I think.

32:37.020 --> 32:40.020
We raised, we raised, we raised quite a bit.

32:40.020 --> 32:45.020
It was good. It was a good day for them and us and America and God.

32:45.020 --> 32:48.020
And Hostess Twinkies.

32:48.020 --> 32:53.020
So, okay.

32:53.020 --> 33:02.020
So while I was, while I was, while I was at this event today, this garage sale,

33:02.020 --> 33:05.020
I don't usually pay attention to this stuff.

33:05.020 --> 33:08.020
But I walked around the room and I saw a thing on the table and I was like,

33:08.020 --> 33:17.020
oh, that's funny that Erin's got a book about Sinbad's advice on comedy.

33:17.020 --> 33:22.020
She had, she had a book that, she had a book that was like the comedy Bible advice from.

33:22.020 --> 33:31.020
It's a Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Reiser, George Carlin, George Wallace.

33:31.020 --> 33:39.020
I just like, like, rattle off. What's it?

33:39.020 --> 33:43.020
Comedy Insights. And the cover, it's just like this two column list of people.

33:43.020 --> 33:49.020
And I swear to God, every single person on that list is you can, you can let it go.

33:49.020 --> 33:53.020
And then just like right in the middle of it, it says Sinbad.

33:53.020 --> 33:56.020
And I, and I was like, that's kind of funny.

33:56.020 --> 34:00.020
It kind of makes Sinbad feel like a contest winner, like after all this time.

34:00.020 --> 34:05.020
I took a, took an Instagram picture of it and I was like, I was going to make this tweet where I'm like,

34:05.020 --> 34:09.020
I don't know, my tweet was going to be like, eh, fuck Sinbad.

34:09.020 --> 34:12.020
You know, let's just sum it up like that.

34:12.020 --> 34:14.020
And I went and sat over there, there was a chair there.

34:14.020 --> 34:17.020
It was one of my chairs that hadn't been sold yet.

34:17.020 --> 34:25.020
And I sat there in the chair and I started to engineer this Instagram slash tweet.

34:25.020 --> 34:33.020
And I was about to fire off and this wave came over me that we all call deja vu,

34:33.020 --> 34:39.020
which I wanted to talk about a little bit because I suddenly had this incredible sense.

34:39.020 --> 34:42.020
Sometimes you get deja vu where you're kind of standing in a kitchen and like,

34:42.020 --> 34:44.020
I get swear I had this conversation before.

34:44.020 --> 34:48.020
I had a huge one today. I had a deja vu that went on for like, like three minutes to seem like,

34:48.020 --> 34:50.020
like I get deja vu a lot.

34:50.020 --> 34:55.020
I was filled with like, like you get, you get little ones where you're like,

34:55.020 --> 35:03.020
eh, I feel like I've been in this kitchen talking to this hipster about the fact that the government's bullshit.

35:03.020 --> 35:05.020
Like, how do you know that that didn't happen already?

35:05.020 --> 35:07.020
I mean, you've been high for two weeks.

35:07.020 --> 35:09.020
Like, it probably did happen.

35:09.020 --> 35:16.020
I was sitting in this chair in this weird, like everything was so, such a freaky thing.

35:16.020 --> 35:23.020
The concept of deja vu, I'm not a spiritually, I'm a spiritual person.

35:23.020 --> 35:27.020
I believe in like, some kind of relationship with the unknown.

35:27.020 --> 35:29.020
I choose to personify the unknown.

35:29.020 --> 35:32.020
I choose to have a relationship with the things I don't understand.

35:32.020 --> 35:36.020
Otherwise, I'm going to go into a McDonald's with a machine gun.

35:36.020 --> 35:41.020
But that's something I choose and it doesn't, that has nothing to do with evidence.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.020
I'm not Fox Mulder.

35:43.020 --> 35:45.020
I choose precisely the opposite reason.

35:45.020 --> 35:50.020
We will use this particular episode of this podcast as evidence when you do kill people.

35:50.020 --> 35:52.020
Go ahead, I'll be dead.

35:52.020 --> 35:59.020
I mean, I guarantee you, when I kill all of you, I'm going to do it in a way that takes me out too.

35:59.020 --> 36:02.020
Thank you.

36:02.020 --> 36:06.020
I have more respect than my predecessors.

36:06.020 --> 36:08.020
Weird signature for it, but all right.

36:08.020 --> 36:13.020
They know, they're like, I want to be killed by a guy who has the balls to kill himself.

36:13.020 --> 36:16.020
I respect that.

36:16.020 --> 36:19.020
Too soon?

36:19.020 --> 36:21.020
Too close?

36:21.020 --> 36:23.020
Too far?

36:23.020 --> 36:25.020
Too...

36:25.020 --> 36:27.020
Possible?

36:27.020 --> 36:29.020
Too something.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.020
Too plausible.

36:31.020 --> 36:35.020
Speaking of two everything, Anatoly is wearing a Christmas wreath in his head.

36:35.020 --> 36:38.020
There's a young lady behind you.

36:38.020 --> 36:40.020
I guess she can see me.

36:40.020 --> 36:45.020
Like I said earlier, he's dressed as Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream for some reason.

36:45.020 --> 36:51.020
He's dressed as Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream in Dead Poets Society.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.020
The kid who killed himself.

36:53.020 --> 36:57.020
Oh, Neil! Oh, Neil! My boy!

36:57.020 --> 37:00.020
Can you fly, Bobby?

37:00.020 --> 37:05.020
Kurt Woodsmith, shout outs.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.020
All right, anyways.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.020
What was I talking about?

37:09.020 --> 37:11.020
I don't know. I'm not killing everybody.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.020
Deja vu.

37:13.020 --> 37:18.020
I wasn't going to drink, but I'm going to crack up in this Raphael's...

37:18.020 --> 37:20.020
I could have sworn to God.

37:20.020 --> 37:23.020
Okay, this is just like...

37:25.020 --> 37:34.020
I was filled with the sensation that if I had clicked send or tweaked or whatever the button says,

37:34.020 --> 37:38.020
okay, you gotcha.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.020
You gotcha.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.020
GoPro, whatever it says.

37:42.020 --> 37:44.020
Teddy Bear, I don't know what...

37:44.020 --> 37:47.020
Are you on a Samsung?

37:47.020 --> 37:50.020
You see Samsung?

37:50.020 --> 37:52.020
You gotcha Samsung, right?

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
You gotcha Samsung. That's what the button says.

37:54.020 --> 37:57.020
You gotcha.

37:57.020 --> 38:01.020
I was absolutely convinced that if I did it, I was going to die.

38:01.020 --> 38:04.020
And I didn't do it.

38:04.020 --> 38:08.020
There's no note. You don't have to clap.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.020
Because you're having deja vu?

38:10.020 --> 38:12.020
Because the deja vu was that convincing.

38:12.020 --> 38:18.020
I was actually that convinced that I was living in some weird nexus of time and space.

38:18.020 --> 38:22.020
And then part of my memory of sitting...

38:22.020 --> 38:25.020
I was sitting there, and I was looking this way,

38:25.020 --> 38:29.020
and I was looking at an image of a bunch of weird shit on a table.

38:29.020 --> 38:33.020
That was like a weird grad sale thing, and I was looking at a tweet that I was about to click send on.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.020
And I had this sudden sense...

38:35.020 --> 38:44.020
I had this memory of like a dream that I had when I was a kid of that image.

38:44.020 --> 38:47.020
Which I didn't understand at the time.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.020
Because obviously there was no...

38:49.020 --> 38:51.020
This space didn't exist.

38:51.020 --> 39:00.020
So I was remembering a memory that I remembered having when I was younger of this same space.

39:00.020 --> 39:04.020
But I also remembered not understanding what any of it meant.

39:04.020 --> 39:12.020
But I also remembered that I was about to click send on something on this device in my hand.

39:12.020 --> 39:18.020
Which in my memory didn't make any sense because it didn't exist in my childhood.

39:18.020 --> 39:22.020
But that when I clicked send, I was going to die.

39:22.020 --> 39:26.020
So I didn't click send.

39:26.020 --> 39:32.020
So the question is, is Sinbad's publicist God?

39:32.020 --> 39:37.020
Which would explain his presence on the cover of that book.

39:37.020 --> 39:40.020
I think Sinbad is a universal context.

39:40.020 --> 39:44.020
I used to have deja vu twice a day every day for a long time.

39:44.020 --> 39:46.020
And deja vu is the one that went on for a long, long time.

39:46.020 --> 39:50.020
I tried to look into it, and I've heard it explained that it's an iron deficiency.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.020
It's a...

39:52.020 --> 39:54.020
So I need to eat more iron?

39:54.020 --> 39:56.020
More spinach and shit.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.020
Spinach?

39:57.020 --> 40:05.020
Although spinach, the reason why people think spinach is iron heavy, it was a typo.

40:05.020 --> 40:09.020
It was supposed to be spinach.

40:09.020 --> 40:14.020
There was something like... I don't know what year it was, but there was something where...

40:14.020 --> 40:21.020
Early days of the FDA, but before that, they typed up how much iron spinach had in it.

40:21.020 --> 40:29.020
And there was a typo of a decimal point, and it made it seem like spinach had a zillions of iron.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.020
It doesn't.

40:30.020 --> 40:32.020
It doesn't have more iron than most green vegetables.

40:32.020 --> 40:38.020
It was just a typo and a thing, but that got lots of press, and that's why they ate lots of spinach.

40:38.020 --> 40:41.020
But back to my point.

40:41.020 --> 40:45.020
It was explained to me that deja vu is because I have so many of them.

40:45.020 --> 40:49.020
When I have them, I've been here, and I can predict the future.

40:49.020 --> 40:51.020
The guy is going to walk in.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.020
Oh, shit, there's the guy.

40:53.020 --> 40:57.020
You're seeing a guy walk in, but your synapses are firing twice.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.020
It's like a hiccup.

40:59.020 --> 41:01.020
So it feels like your brain is falling.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.020
But here's the fucking...

41:02.020 --> 41:08.020
But when the synapse fires the second time, it's sensing it for the first time, and the first time it happens,

41:08.020 --> 41:12.020
it's been stored as subconscious memory, which doesn't have a date stamp on it.

41:12.020 --> 41:13.020
That's the crate! That's it!

41:13.020 --> 41:15.020
That's what happened.

41:15.020 --> 41:18.020
It felt like I was eight years old and dreamt it.

41:18.020 --> 41:23.020
You're going into a drawer in your subconscious mind that has no date stamp.

41:23.020 --> 41:29.020
It's just this weird grab bag of stuff that it feels like a dream, a childhood memory.

41:29.020 --> 41:34.020
It happened a split second before, or a nanosecond.

41:34.020 --> 41:39.020
So your entire life is like your mom's rubber stamp collection.

41:39.020 --> 41:41.020
Tell me more about this.

41:43.020 --> 41:45.020
My mom collects rubber stamps.

41:45.020 --> 41:47.020
She's got a snowflake for Christmas.

41:47.020 --> 41:51.020
She can bring it out every Christmas, but if she chooses to, she can bring it out for Mother's Day.

41:51.020 --> 41:52.020
She doesn't give a fuck.

41:52.020 --> 41:54.020
It's whatever you dip into ink.

41:54.020 --> 41:56.020
It's just like fucking stamps.

41:56.020 --> 41:58.020
Your brain has stamps, and it just goes...

41:58.020 --> 42:02.020
You used a royal Wii on that one.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
Okay, my mom's crazy.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.020
It has a rubber stamp collection.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.020
I'm saying your brain is fucking...

42:08.020 --> 42:09.020
It's origami.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.020
It can fold in on itself.

42:11.020 --> 42:16.020
Our perception of reality is based on, oh, this happened, and then this happened.

42:16.020 --> 42:22.020
But we, in those fleeting moments, we can feel like something happened an indeterminate time ago.

42:22.020 --> 42:25.020
And if you killed somebody...

42:25.020 --> 42:27.020
Here we go again.

42:27.020 --> 42:33.020
If you killed somebody, and then someone came up behind you and hit you in the head with a shovel,

42:33.020 --> 42:37.020
and then you woke up in a hospital bed, and no one...

42:37.020 --> 42:41.020
Somehow the person you killed tumbled out a ditch, and they fell into a tar pit,

42:41.020 --> 42:46.020
and they sank, and they didn't have family, and no one cared.

42:46.020 --> 42:48.020
Let's just say...

42:48.020 --> 42:53.020
They were a babysitter that you got on Craigslist, and you looked into it,

42:53.020 --> 42:56.020
and no one knew she was at your house.

42:56.020 --> 42:59.020
And you were in the Lower Bray area, and it's filled with tar.

42:59.020 --> 43:02.020
No, I'm doing a bit on the side.

43:02.020 --> 43:04.020
Are you planning a murder?

43:04.020 --> 43:07.020
I'm saying theoretically, you hit someone in the head with a shovel,

43:07.020 --> 43:10.020
they tumbled down a pit, into a tar pit, they sink down.

43:10.020 --> 43:15.020
And you, at the same time, your friend comes up behind you and goes like...

43:15.020 --> 43:17.020
What are you doing?

43:17.020 --> 43:21.020
You're missing the party!

43:21.020 --> 43:28.020
And they've got such a static charge on their feet that when they touch your shoulder, you get amnesia.

43:28.020 --> 43:33.020
This is a theoretical construct for the purposes of an existential...

43:33.020 --> 43:37.020
Do you understand if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it?

43:37.020 --> 43:41.020
I'm saying one of these things.

43:41.020 --> 43:45.020
This is all in Forrest Gump's book, right?

43:45.020 --> 43:50.020
So you wake up in a hospital, you don't remember this person who fell into a tar pit.

43:50.020 --> 43:51.020
No one else does.

43:51.020 --> 43:52.020
That you killed.

43:52.020 --> 43:54.020
You never remember that you did it.

43:54.020 --> 43:56.020
Why? Because the guys...

43:56.020 --> 43:58.020
Because your brain stopped working.

43:58.020 --> 44:01.020
Because of the static amnesia.

44:01.020 --> 44:09.020
Do I really have to be such a sci-fi wizard that I have to construct a device, a helmet that comes over your head?

44:09.020 --> 44:16.020
I'm saying if you don't remember, and while you're not remembering, that person stops existing,

44:16.020 --> 44:22.020
so you don't remember yourself, so you wake up in a world where you killed this person,

44:22.020 --> 44:26.020
but you don't remember that you did it and no one ever knows that you did it.

44:26.020 --> 44:31.020
Did you just walk around, you're at the water cooler, like, hey, Gladys?

44:31.020 --> 44:33.020
Whoa, how about those Packers?

44:33.020 --> 44:34.020
Don't go there!

44:34.020 --> 44:36.020
And you're, like, getting mad, too?

44:36.020 --> 44:38.020
You would be getting mad about, like, someone would go,

44:38.020 --> 44:43.020
hey, did you hear Steve cheated on the billiards pool or whatever the fucking office,

44:43.020 --> 44:45.020
I don't know what these office people are talking about.

44:45.020 --> 44:47.020
You'd be like, he did what?

44:47.020 --> 44:49.020
He, whoa, that's not fucking cool.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.020
He shouldn't do that.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.020
Like, you'd be mad.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.020
I'm mad.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.020
I have no idea what's going on.

44:55.020 --> 44:58.020
It's just, this is the human condition.

44:58.020 --> 45:00.020
If you don't remember, where's this guy going?

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
He's going to take that bad of shit.

45:02.020 --> 45:03.020
Alright, that's fine.

45:03.020 --> 45:05.020
I don't mean to shame you, I'm not trying to shame you.

45:05.020 --> 45:07.020
I met this woman now, her name is Alice Flatterty.

45:07.020 --> 45:11.020
She's a famous, crazy doctor from Harvard.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.020
From made-up name world.

45:13.020 --> 45:15.020
Alice Flatterty.

45:15.020 --> 45:17.020
Alice Flatterty.

45:17.020 --> 45:19.020
You can look her up and she's a...

45:19.020 --> 45:21.020
Okay, let's all look her up.

45:21.020 --> 45:22.020
Alice Flatterty.

45:22.020 --> 45:25.020
Harvard, I think she's the chief chair of neurology there,

45:25.020 --> 45:26.020
and she teaches at Harvard.

45:26.020 --> 45:29.020
She's the head of neurology at Boston General, I think.

45:29.020 --> 45:32.020
And I met her and she's a little, like, tiny little gal,

45:32.020 --> 45:33.020
and she walks on the tip of her toes,

45:33.020 --> 45:35.020
and she's hyper-graphic, and she writes down

45:35.020 --> 45:37.020
everything she thinks about.

45:37.020 --> 45:40.020
Like, I've read about her, and I met her,

45:40.020 --> 45:42.020
and I said something about, like,

45:42.020 --> 45:45.020
I was telling some story, and she wrote it down on her arm,

45:45.020 --> 45:47.020
and I said, will you pull up your sleeve?

45:47.020 --> 45:49.020
And she was like, really?

45:49.020 --> 45:51.020
She pulled her sleeve up, and she had writing

45:51.020 --> 45:54.020
all up her arm, and she's hyper-graphic.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.020
She has crayons, like, a certain kind of crayon

45:56.020 --> 45:58.020
that she can write in the shower.

45:58.020 --> 46:01.020
Her shower in her place is nothing but writing,

46:01.020 --> 46:04.020
and her ceilings in her house,

46:04.020 --> 46:07.020
a bunch of bulletin boards hung, like, next to each other,

46:07.020 --> 46:09.020
so she can put, like, post-it notes on it

46:09.020 --> 46:11.020
to create more surface area.

46:11.020 --> 46:14.020
She's hyper-graphic, and she is a walking CAT scan,

46:14.020 --> 46:17.020
and she, like, can walk into a room full of people,

46:17.020 --> 46:20.020
and she can see something going on with people,

46:20.020 --> 46:23.020
and she was like, wait, did you ever go scuba diving?

46:23.020 --> 46:25.020
Well, yeah.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.020
Okay, you have temperature reversal.

46:27.020 --> 46:29.020
You touch a certain kind of coral,

46:29.020 --> 46:32.020
and she just reads people's minds and stuff like that,

46:32.020 --> 46:36.020
and I was telling a story about how I fainted once,

46:36.020 --> 46:39.020
and she goes, wait, she overheard me.

46:39.020 --> 46:41.020
I wasn't telling her, I was telling somebody else.

46:41.020 --> 46:43.020
She goes, you fainted once?

46:43.020 --> 46:45.020
Well, how old were you?

46:45.020 --> 46:47.020
I go 22 or 3?

46:47.020 --> 46:50.020
She goes, had you just peed?

46:57.020 --> 47:00.020
And I said, yeah, I had just peed.

47:00.020 --> 47:02.020
She goes, oh, thank God, and walked away.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.020
Thank God!

47:08.020 --> 47:10.020
She just left you with that.

47:10.020 --> 47:12.020
She's been emailing her ever since.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.020
What did you mean?

47:14.020 --> 47:17.020
Well, I did a pilot for a TV show that never aired

47:17.020 --> 47:19.020
for, I think, a TBS or something,

47:19.020 --> 47:22.020
and it was about her, about another crazy doctor,

47:22.020 --> 47:25.020
but she's for real, and she's wonderfully brilliant.

47:25.020 --> 47:29.020
There was an actor in a scene where I was playing a neurologist,

47:29.020 --> 47:32.020
and an actor was brought in on a gurney,

47:32.020 --> 47:35.020
and he had a brainstem herniation.

47:35.020 --> 47:38.020
He was a farmer, and this is based on a real thing,

47:38.020 --> 47:41.020
had touched a electrified fence,

47:41.020 --> 47:44.020
and had a pacemaker, and it gave him a brainstem herniation,

47:44.020 --> 47:46.020
whatever that is.

47:46.020 --> 47:49.020
And so she was there with a bunch of other cast crew,

47:49.020 --> 47:51.020
lighting people, doctors.

47:51.020 --> 47:53.020
They all got it?

47:53.020 --> 47:55.020
No, sorry.

47:55.020 --> 47:57.020
We're all in a hospital room, in a working hospital,

47:57.020 --> 47:59.020
where they shoot like Grey's Anatomy,

47:59.020 --> 48:01.020
which is next to a real hospital,

48:01.020 --> 48:04.020
and she was talking to this actor who's a really good,

48:04.020 --> 48:07.020
like maybe late 50s, early 60s actor,

48:07.020 --> 48:10.020
laying on a gurney, and she goes,

48:10.020 --> 48:12.020
okay, what would happen in this?

48:12.020 --> 48:15.020
You'd be on your back, and your back would be arched,

48:15.020 --> 48:17.020
and your toes would be pointed,

48:17.020 --> 48:19.020
like arched and pointed together,

48:19.020 --> 48:21.020
and your teeth would be gridded,

48:21.020 --> 48:23.020
and you'd be screaming gibberish.

48:23.020 --> 48:25.020
And so she goes, try that.

48:25.020 --> 48:27.020
And so the actor goes,

48:27.020 --> 48:29.020
and he does it, and she goes,

48:29.020 --> 48:31.020
oh, God, I want to cut your brain up.

48:31.020 --> 48:33.020
I don't want to fucking do this.

48:33.020 --> 48:35.020
She explained to me later on, she's like,

48:35.020 --> 48:37.020
neurologists are, we're not like therapists.

48:37.020 --> 48:39.020
We're werewolves.

48:39.020 --> 48:41.020
We want brains.

48:41.020 --> 48:43.020
Your brain is a crossword puzzle,

48:43.020 --> 48:45.020
and we just want to figure it out.

48:45.020 --> 48:47.020
She's like, your brain is so fascinating.

48:47.020 --> 48:49.020
She's like, Jeff, when you talk,

48:49.020 --> 48:51.020
and you do this with your hands,

48:51.020 --> 48:54.020
she goes, she would say, when you wake up in the morning,

48:54.020 --> 48:56.020
do you do this, this, this, this, this?

48:56.020 --> 48:58.020
Yeah, because the way you,

48:58.020 --> 49:00.020
everything you do with your hands,

49:00.020 --> 49:02.020
she can explain your whole life to you.

49:02.020 --> 49:04.020
It's really weird.

49:04.020 --> 49:06.020
So this actor turns back, and he's doing it perfectly.

49:06.020 --> 49:09.020
Like seizure, and what would happen is

49:09.020 --> 49:11.020
your back would go all the way up off the gurney,

49:11.020 --> 49:13.020
and your eyes would go straight down

49:13.020 --> 49:15.020
to where we couldn't even see your irises.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.020
It would just be white with your eyes looking straight down.

49:17.020 --> 49:19.020
So look down as far as you can.

49:19.020 --> 49:21.020
So the guy is doing it, I'm standing right next to him,

49:21.020 --> 49:23.020
because I'm in the scene, his eyes go straight down,

49:23.020 --> 49:25.020
but they're only like half, like,

49:25.020 --> 49:27.020
you can still see half of his iris.

49:27.020 --> 49:29.020
And she goes, no, no, look all the way down.

49:29.020 --> 49:31.020
Yeah, I can't even do it.

49:31.020 --> 49:34.020
I'm trying to do it, and I can't do it.

49:34.020 --> 49:36.020
Because you, and so this,

49:36.020 --> 49:39.020
she's like 4'11", you know,

49:39.020 --> 49:41.020
she's like, you can't look any further down than that.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.020
And the actor's like,

49:43.020 --> 49:45.020
I'm looking down as far as I can, she goes,

49:45.020 --> 49:48.020
and there's 25 people in the room.

49:48.020 --> 49:50.020
And she goes, you have seven weeks.

49:50.020 --> 49:53.020
Even weirder, even way weirder.

49:53.020 --> 49:55.020
She looks at him, and I'm sitting right next to her,

49:55.020 --> 49:57.020
and looking down at this actor on the gurney,

49:57.020 --> 49:59.020
and she goes, you can't look any further down than that?

49:59.020 --> 50:01.020
And he goes, I'm looking as far down as I can,

50:01.020 --> 50:04.020
and she goes, hmm.

50:04.020 --> 50:07.020
When you were, like, really little,

50:07.020 --> 50:10.020
maybe like four or five or six years old,

50:10.020 --> 50:12.020
somebody fell, and you were looking down at it,

50:12.020 --> 50:14.020
but you don't want to look down anymore.

50:14.020 --> 50:15.020
What would you remember that?

50:15.020 --> 50:18.020
And the guy goes, I have no idea what you're talking about.

50:22.020 --> 50:24.020
So this was a CW show.

50:24.020 --> 50:26.020
No, no.

50:26.020 --> 50:28.020
This was for real.

50:28.020 --> 50:30.020
It was for real.

50:30.020 --> 50:33.020
And also, some of the people in the room

50:33.020 --> 50:36.020
are actual medical, like, the people that are consultants

50:36.020 --> 50:38.020
that are there to make sure that you're doing it

50:38.020 --> 50:40.020
right in a hospital setting.

50:40.020 --> 50:42.020
And everybody goes fucking silent,

50:42.020 --> 50:45.020
and she goes, now look down, and his eyes go all the way down.

50:45.020 --> 50:48.020
And then she goes, I want to talk to you later about that.

50:48.020 --> 50:50.020
And everybody, like, all the fucking hair

50:50.020 --> 50:53.020
on the back of my neck stood up.

50:53.020 --> 50:55.020
And I talked to her later, and she goes,

50:55.020 --> 50:58.020
the brain is this thing that, if you touch it,

50:58.020 --> 51:00.020
it feels like toothpaste.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.020
It's this weird, massive goop in our heads.

51:02.020 --> 51:05.020
And we'll never understand it.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.020
But she can walk into it and go, like,

51:07.020 --> 51:10.020
you went scuba diving once.

51:10.020 --> 51:13.020
And we made a bad pilot.

51:13.020 --> 51:14.020
Yeah.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.020
She wasn't able to, like,

51:16.020 --> 51:19.020
your eyes are looking at the TV.

51:19.020 --> 51:20.020
What are you seeing?

51:20.020 --> 51:23.020
American Idol.

51:23.020 --> 51:25.020
They're able to look away.

51:25.020 --> 51:26.020
What are you watching?

51:26.020 --> 51:28.020
A weird crap with no explanation.

51:28.020 --> 51:30.020
I have to say, the code of this is amazing.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.020
We did this thing, and she's like,

51:32.020 --> 51:34.020
you guys are, like, you actors, you guys are so funny.

51:34.020 --> 51:36.020
It's like, you're the worst neurologist in the world.

51:36.020 --> 51:38.020
You are not doing it right.

51:38.020 --> 51:39.020
I was like, why?

51:39.020 --> 51:42.020
She said, because neurologists were bad with people.

51:42.020 --> 51:44.020
We only want to solve the puzzle of the human brain.

51:44.020 --> 51:47.020
We are not good with human interaction.

51:47.020 --> 51:49.020
But you guys, you come into a scene,

51:49.020 --> 51:51.020
and you touch the other actor who's going through this thing.

51:51.020 --> 51:53.020
You walk in, and you put your hand on the shoulder.

51:53.020 --> 51:54.020
You smile.

51:54.020 --> 51:57.020
And she's like, we know that you can reverse engineer

51:57.020 --> 51:58.020
happiness by smiling.

51:58.020 --> 52:01.020
You can actually tell people, like, raise your cheeks up,

52:01.020 --> 52:03.020
and it actually creates joy.

52:03.020 --> 52:06.020
You can reverse engineer happiness through faking smiles.

52:06.020 --> 52:08.020
She's like, we know that, but we're bad at it.

52:08.020 --> 52:10.020
So she wrote an article about how actors

52:10.020 --> 52:13.020
taught her to be a better neurologist.

52:13.020 --> 52:16.020
And so there's a picture of me in the Harvard Medical Journal.

52:16.020 --> 52:18.020
All right.

52:18.020 --> 52:21.020
Yes.

52:21.020 --> 52:24.020
Let's bring out my betrothed Erin McGathy.

52:24.020 --> 52:26.020
Hello.

52:34.020 --> 52:35.020
Hello.

52:35.020 --> 52:39.020
I wanted to bring you out because I feel like you helped out

52:39.020 --> 52:42.020
a little bit in today's charity.

52:42.020 --> 52:44.020
Dan, you did most of the lifting today.

52:44.020 --> 52:45.020
Yeah.

52:45.020 --> 52:48.020
I mean, I definitely, I was the reason why everything

52:48.020 --> 52:51.020
happened today.

52:51.020 --> 52:52.020
No, I'm kidding.

52:52.020 --> 52:56.020
Aaron is the absolutely the, I wish I could show everybody

52:56.020 --> 53:00.020
a slideshow of all the times Aaron tried to make me lift

53:00.020 --> 53:02.020
a finger for any of this.

53:02.020 --> 53:05.020
And I reminded her of the deal we had from the get go,

53:05.020 --> 53:08.020
which was you do whatever you want.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.020
I will show up on Sunday.

53:10.020 --> 53:14.020
But if at any point you asked me to do anything,

53:14.020 --> 53:18.020
I am going to yell at you and be mean to you.

53:18.020 --> 53:22.020
And I held to that because I'm a hero.

53:22.020 --> 53:24.020
No.

53:24.020 --> 53:27.020
You sell yourself short.

53:27.020 --> 53:28.020
You were great.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.020
You did a lot.

53:29.020 --> 53:32.020
May I share my favorite theory about deja vu,

53:32.020 --> 53:35.020
which I think is one of the more popular theories about why

53:35.020 --> 53:39.020
deja vu happens is that your brain is simply mistaking the

53:39.020 --> 53:42.020
present for the past, meaning that like there's something that

53:42.020 --> 53:44.020
goes wrong in your brain.

53:44.020 --> 53:47.020
And often like people experience deja vu before seizures.

53:47.020 --> 53:57.020
Did you just put the goucher on me?

53:57.020 --> 54:04.020
Can we all just watch Jeff with spoons in our pockets?

54:04.020 --> 54:05.020
I'm joking.

54:05.020 --> 54:07.020
It's all because people used to put spoons in people's

54:07.020 --> 54:09.020
mouths, seizures.

54:09.020 --> 54:12.020
Anyway, but the idea that your brain,

54:12.020 --> 54:14.020
it's just like a neurological misfire.

54:14.020 --> 54:16.020
The idea that your brain can actually be like,

54:16.020 --> 54:18.020
no, this happened before.

54:18.020 --> 54:21.020
But it's the idea that we have a condition in our brain that

54:21.020 --> 54:22.020
just says.

54:22.020 --> 54:23.020
Yeah.

54:23.020 --> 54:25.020
I think what Jeff was describing, it's sort of like the engine

54:25.020 --> 54:27.020
is kind of like, it's a backfire.

54:27.020 --> 54:29.020
Like when you're in, when your muffler goes,

54:29.020 --> 54:31.020
pop, it's because like something's happening with the

54:31.020 --> 54:34.020
pistons, your engine is going, that's the insane thing is

54:34.020 --> 54:38.020
that like your, our brains are designed to go down these

54:38.020 --> 54:45.020
railroad tracks that we are like, we take for granted,

54:45.020 --> 54:49.020
happen, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.

54:49.020 --> 54:53.020
Like, like, but there's absolutely no reason why a brain

54:53.020 --> 54:56.020
on a railroad track can't, for instance,

54:56.020 --> 54:59.020
just go backward.

54:59.020 --> 55:02.020
If for instance, the entire railroad track should go,

55:02.020 --> 55:04.020
should decide to fold in half.

55:04.020 --> 55:08.020
So something that has more power over the railroad than

55:08.020 --> 55:11.020
the people who built their little railroads.

55:11.020 --> 55:15.020
Like for instance, the God that created the entire planet,

55:15.020 --> 55:18.020
the entire, the force of gravity.

55:18.020 --> 55:24.020
It's so, to me, I've never had a deja vu that wasn't filled

55:24.020 --> 55:28.020
with an absolute like sense of dread.

55:28.020 --> 55:33.020
I didn't click send after the deja vu was over.

55:33.020 --> 55:38.020
I declined to click send on a Sinbad bashing Instagram

55:38.020 --> 55:44.020
because I was so convinced that I had, I had been about

55:44.020 --> 55:49.020
to click send on this Sinbad bashing that I was certain

55:49.020 --> 55:52.020
that when I clicked send, I was going to die.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.020
Iron deficiency.

55:53.020 --> 55:54.020
Iron deficiency.

55:54.020 --> 55:57.020
I just need to eat more Gerritol.

55:57.020 --> 56:03.020
Jeff, what was your friend's name? Alice?

56:03.020 --> 56:10.020
She's, she's, she's, she's a naysitter boots.

56:10.020 --> 56:14.020
I think your admiration of her is really beautiful.

56:14.020 --> 56:16.020
I also think it's really funny that you're just, sorry,

56:16.020 --> 56:18.020
I just spit on you on the toilet.

56:18.020 --> 56:21.020
I think you're like describing, describing her home walking

56:21.020 --> 56:23.020
in and there being things hanging everywhere.

56:23.020 --> 56:25.020
Well, this is just concerning.

56:25.020 --> 56:27.020
This is by her description.

56:27.020 --> 56:28.020
I've never been there.

56:28.020 --> 56:32.020
It's her description of it that she says that like this

56:32.020 --> 56:35.020
hypergraphia thing is called like where you write a lot.

56:35.020 --> 56:38.020
If you are a bad writer and you write everywhere and you write

56:38.020 --> 56:40.020
on every surface, they lock you up.

56:40.020 --> 56:44.020
If you're a good writer and you're hypergraphic,

56:44.020 --> 56:47.020
you're Chaucer, you're Dostoevsky.

56:47.020 --> 56:49.020
There's people that have been hypergraphic throughout

56:49.020 --> 56:51.020
the ages that they cannot stop writing.

56:51.020 --> 56:53.020
And there's a reason why we have these giant tomes by

56:53.020 --> 56:55.020
certain authors.

56:55.020 --> 56:59.020
And she said the greatest thing I ever did was marry a publisher.

56:59.020 --> 57:04.020
But she really does carry a certain kind of pen to write

57:04.020 --> 57:06.020
all the way up her wrists.

57:06.020 --> 57:11.020
But also she's like, she was hospitalized, I believe.

57:11.020 --> 57:12.020
Sucking.

57:12.020 --> 57:16.020
For like self, like she kind of like melted down and

57:16.020 --> 57:19.020
they said you can't like self diagnose yourself.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.020
We have to put you away for a while.

57:21.020 --> 57:22.020
Oh man.

57:22.020 --> 57:24.020
And she's like, no, I can do this.

57:24.020 --> 57:27.020
But she wouldn't sleep and she would build things.

57:27.020 --> 57:32.020
That's why I don't believe in psychiatry or psychology.

57:32.020 --> 57:33.020
Why?

57:33.020 --> 57:39.020
Because there's a disease you can diagnose called being awesome.

57:39.020 --> 57:45.020
They call it superiority complex is a diagnosable thing.

57:45.020 --> 57:50.020
You can go to a qualified doctor and you can tell them how

57:50.020 --> 57:53.020
you feel and they can tell you that you have a diagnosable

57:53.020 --> 57:56.020
thing called superiority complex.

57:56.020 --> 58:01.020
And I'm like, OK, that may be true for an inferior person.

58:01.020 --> 58:07.020
However, you may need to dig deeper than that, parasite.

58:07.020 --> 58:09.020
Actuality complex.

58:09.020 --> 58:11.020
Keep going.

58:11.020 --> 58:15.020
Yes, I have a complex about how superior I am.

58:15.020 --> 58:19.020
Superiority complex isn't superior enough a name for what I have.

58:19.020 --> 58:20.020
Yeah.

58:20.020 --> 58:28.020
But I'm being glib, but that's the failing of studying the mind.

58:28.020 --> 58:30.020
It's a fucking don't laugh.

58:30.020 --> 58:31.020
I mean, do laugh.

58:31.020 --> 58:34.020
I was laughing because you put the mind in quotes.

58:34.020 --> 58:38.020
Well, I'm saying like this idea that you can circumscribe intellect

58:38.020 --> 58:40.020
has this huge feeling.

58:40.020 --> 58:44.020
Everyone that we've ever, everyone that built the world that

58:44.020 --> 58:45.020
we're sitting in.

58:45.020 --> 58:51.020
We're sitting here under lights created by a guy that believed

58:51.020 --> 58:55.020
more than someone else that you could illuminate this room

58:55.020 --> 58:57.020
after sundown.

58:57.020 --> 59:02.020
Most importantly of all, we understand the universe we're

59:02.020 --> 59:06.020
living in because of a guy who didn't believe, unlike everyone

59:06.020 --> 59:10.020
else, that the reason light seems to travel the same speed no

59:10.020 --> 59:13.020
matter what point of departure it has isn't because there's

59:13.020 --> 59:16.020
some unseen jello we all live in called the ether.

59:16.020 --> 59:18.020
It's because E equals MC squared.

59:18.020 --> 59:20.020
That guy was out of his fucking mind.

59:20.020 --> 59:23.020
If Einstein had gone to a therapist, they would have told him

59:23.020 --> 59:26.020
so many times, knock it off.

59:26.020 --> 59:30.020
They would have said like, do you really think thinking that light

59:30.020 --> 59:33.020
is a variable is getting you anywhere?

59:33.020 --> 59:35.020
No, I guess not.

59:35.020 --> 59:38.020
Don't you think you should comb your hair and change your sweater

59:38.020 --> 59:41.020
and fucking go work at Ikea?

59:41.020 --> 59:43.020
Fuck, fuck, fuck therapist.

59:43.020 --> 59:46.020
And I'm not saying that anyone that has a problem with therapy

59:46.020 --> 59:47.020
is going to be Einstein.

59:47.020 --> 59:50.020
I'm just saying, fuck you therapy.

59:50.020 --> 59:52.020
You just hate change.

59:52.020 --> 59:53.020
I don't.

59:53.020 --> 59:55.020
Wait, I love change.

59:55.020 --> 59:56.020
What are you talking about?

59:56.020 --> 59:57.020
I hate change.

59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.020
Einstein loved change.

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.020
He was like, change everything all the time.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.020
He died going, I didn't change enough.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.020
But Stephen Hawking is like, I can't change enough.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.020
Like he's trying to change everything every day.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.020
He's like, oh, fuck my body.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:18.020
Only my eyeballs can move.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.020
I still want to prove how fucking retarded everything.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020
God damn it.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020
I said it again.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.020
Fucking it.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.020
You're especially always trying to soak up.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.020
You've come down pretty hard on retargeting.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.020
My sister's retarded.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.020
So fuck everybody.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.020
You can't keep cashing that chip in, man.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.020
I mean, I gotta try.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.020
I know I can't.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.020
You especially seem to always seek out positive things

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.020
to change about yourself.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.020
You just don't like therapists because they're not as smart as you

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.020
most of the time because most people aren't as smart.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.020
What more reason do you need?

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.020
No, I don't need any.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.020
I agree with you.

01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.020
I think that's a valid thing.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.020
I don't think it has anything to do with change.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.020
We have a hand shooting up and we like to respect us at Harmontown.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020
Why is your hand shooting up?

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.020
You want me to go for it?

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.020
Yeah, I do.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.020
Oh, whoa.

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.020
I've been seeing...

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020
Hello there.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.020
My name is Liz.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.020
Hello.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.020
I'm a big fan.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.020
We're in a safe place.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.020
I have been seeing a therapist for four years

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020
and he is much dumber than me.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.020
All right.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.020
I think what you're saying about therapists is something that's untrue.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.020
They don't try to make you act like a normal person.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.020
I think you're a little bit angry because you don't actually have Asperger's

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.020
and a therapist would tell you that.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.020
I don't believe that I have Asperger's.

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.020
I wouldn't fault anybody for telling me that.

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.020
Were you expecting a standing ovation for saying that?

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.020
Maybe it's not necessarily about someone being smarter than you,

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.020
but it's about...

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.020
I think it's...

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.020
I haven't found a great therapist

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.020
and I don't think it's because I can't find anyone smarter than me,

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.020
but I think you have to find someone that works with you.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020
Wait, wait.

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.020
I want to stick to the healthy core of what she's saying.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.020
You're a reasonably intelligent person

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.020
and you've been going to a therapist that you feel...

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.020
You can sense maybe...

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.020
Hopefully he's not listening or she...

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.020
You feel like maybe they're...

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.020
I've told him this before.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.020
They're dumber than you.

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.020
But you're achieving a benefit from meeting with this person.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020
So explain that.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020
How that's possible.

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.020
How you can go to a therapist that you think is dumber than you

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.020
and how that can benefit you.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:28.020
I have a health insurance from, I think, Anthem

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:32.020
and it covers Adderall Prescription for $5 a month.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.020
So you have a drug dealer.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.020
Yes.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.020
And he's done because he gives you drugs

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.020
and you don't need them.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.020
So that's great.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.020
That's what you're saying.

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.020
Technically I do need them.

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.020
I have ADHD.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.020
He won't diagnose it because he doesn't believe in diagnoses.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.020
I have a million and no questions.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.020
I have negative five questions.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.020
Yank the mic back like a fucking...

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.020
But thank you.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.020
Thank you.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:03.020
So yeah, Adderall's great.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020
Therapy's fine.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.020
Like everything where I...

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.020
I and I think Dan feels the same way recently.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:14.020
Like I think that realizing that arbitrary things,

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.020
like anything that makes you feel better,

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.020
giving...

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.020
Like deciding that a chair every time you see a chair every day

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.020
is going to remind you that humanity is important.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.020
Like it's whatever fucking works for you.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.020
Dan's not saying that therapy's bad.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.020
Yeah, I am.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020
No, for you.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.020
No, but you won't say definitively.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020
No, you don't.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.020
You don't think it is.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.020
I think for...

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.020
But I do think...

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.020
I think there's a fucking danger in it.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.020
I do.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.020
I agree.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:44.020
I think that the idea of therapy is founded by...

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.020
Like there is no such thing as a revolutionary therapist.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:52.020
There is no such thing as a person who sets up an office

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.020
in a mini mall and sits there with a clipboard

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.020
and waits for patients to come in

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020
and sign their health insurance forms

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.020
and can't wait to tell that person

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.020
that everything they thought walking in is bullshit

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.020
and they need to go out and fucking up.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.020
But when someone comes to you and says,

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.020
Dan, like, I have a therapist

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020
and I don't know if I'm an asshole,

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.020
but this person works for me,

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020
you don't say to them,

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020
that's not true.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.020
Like you're happy for people to do their own thing, right?

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020
Marriage.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.020
Right?

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.020
I mean, you're fine with people...

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.020
Yes, people who are already happy with the way things are going,

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.020
who are having weird speed bumps.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.020
I think that there's ways.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.020
We got another hand coming up from the middle of the crowd.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020
I don't know why.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020
I hope it's not...

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020
Just okay.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.020
I won't say what I hope it's not.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020
Hi.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020
Hello.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.020
I'm a big fan.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.020
All right. Well, thank you.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.020
I just want to say that I didn't go to therapy

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.020
for a really long time

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.020
and I started going and she's amazing

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.020
and it's not because she tells me a thing new,

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.020
it's because she supports the ideas I already have

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.020
and she's a fucking awesome feminist.

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.020
All right.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.020
Now tell her she's wrong.

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.020
Tell her her feelings are bad.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.020
Tell her her joy is wrong.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020
Okay, all right.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.020
Tell her she should buy a bottle of booze.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.020
No, I got...

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:23.020
Oh, I drink plenty.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.020
What's your...

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020
Are you willing to say your name?

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.020
Yeah, I'm Zoe.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020
Hi, everybody.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020
Hi.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.020
I did go...

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.020
Okay, all right.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.020
Here's where I come clean.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.020
I went to a therapist once who I think was awesome.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.020
Whoa!

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.020
Oh, shit!

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:50.020
And he was way too expensive, way too expensive.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.020
Like if I had...

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:55.020
My mental health would have cost me my home, my everything.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.020
I would have been under a bridge being like,

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:03.020
I get why this bridge deserves to be over me.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.020
I just fucking bailed because I got nervous

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.020
because he was not covered by Blue Cross or Blue Shield or anything.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.020
And I just bailed.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.020
He was Jungian, he told me...

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.020
I'm saying like, Zoe's saying like,

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.020
she's probably a feminist.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.020
She went to a therapist who's a feminist.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.020
It's like, in other words, to extrapolate that,

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.020
you went to a therapist who's actually so activated that,

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.020
yeah, you didn't feel like you were sitting in a strip mall

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.020
with somebody who was an agent of compromise.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:36.020
No, she challenges me, but if I tell her,

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.020
that's not how I feel.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.020
She totally...

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.020
She wants you to be who you are and how she is.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.020
Zoe actually doesn't have a mic right now.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.020
That's just how activated she is.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.020
She's booming out to it.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.020
Her sense of self-worth.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:52.020
I did go to a guy who was like this amazing guy

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:56.020
who was a Jungian guy who told me in her first session,

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.020
he said, go home.

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.020
It was all Jungian stuff and I'm into Campbell.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.020
So you love therapy.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.020
I like talking to this guy a little bit, kind of,

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.020
but it was like...

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.020
You got money, now go back to him, man.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.020
But I'm telling you, I could be mentally unhealthy

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.020
and drive it around on a Tesla.

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.020
This Jungian guy was Carl Jung.

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.020
Zoe, can you pass the mic to her?

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.020
I'm just saying, you should see my therapist.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.020
She's really supportive.

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.020
I may.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.020
Can we bring her to Harmontown?

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.020
Shelly Wilson, her name.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.020
EY.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.020
Just really quick.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.020
Really quick.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:43.020
You like talking to a person, but not the title therapist.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.020
You like talking to a person and relaying things

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.020
and actually having a conversation with someone

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.020
you feel has the credentials to talk to you.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:59.020
But the therapist, the title therapist is just like too...

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.020
It gives them the right to take money from you

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.020
and all this stuff for just talking to a person.

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.020
Right.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.020
You're saying that's how I feel.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:13.020
Well, from what I'm taking from what you're saying.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.020
Yes, that's how I feel.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.020
It's like a dentist, but for your brain.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020
It's not fair.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.020
There's a million bad dentists.

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020
They're like, oh, your teeth are fucked up.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.020
I'm going to drill here and drill there,

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.020
and it's like they're fucked up.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.020
They don't go to school.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.020
What they learn at school is how many teeth people have.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.020
They don't learn it when it takes to have a fucking bite.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.020
Yeah.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.020
I'm agreeing with you.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.020
But Zoe is saying like, you know, yeah.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.020
It's like a therapist were called expert life livers.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:47.020
You'd question everything about them,

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.020
but it's all different.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020
I mean, I figure I know.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.020
This has been a long time coming.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.020
I'm glad this size audience came here.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.020
I've always been waiting to be called out on this.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.020
I know I need to go back to therapy.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.020
I know that nobody needs therapy more than me.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.020
Someone who...

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020
One of your ex-girlfriends is in the back.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.020
It's cheering.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:16.020
Somebody cheer like they're at a Bon Jovi concert.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020
And I very much respect...

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.020
I'm not even sure, young lady, what was your name?

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.020
Michelle.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.020
Michelle.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.020
I'm not even sure if you're on my side or Zoe's side

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.020
or somewhere in between,

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.020
but I respect everybody who's saying like, look,

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.020
that takes bravery.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.020
It's a big throng where obviously all you'd have to do

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:37.020
to be on my side is go fuck therapy.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020
And yet there's...

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.020
All right, we have a hand up over here.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.020
Just become a town hall.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.020
She is a therapist.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.020
Come on down.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.020
Come on down.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.020
Come on down.

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.020
Are you willing to come out?

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:55.020
Expert life, liver, ombre, sweater, looking healthy.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.020
Are you okay coming up?

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.020
We don't bully people here.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.020
Do you take writer's bill of insurance?

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.020
Have you been to the show before?

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.020
Yes.

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.020
Okay.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020
So, you know, we never pick on people.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.020
No one's going to pick on you here.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.020
That'll protest too much.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.020
But it's okay.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.020
You said you got pushed up here,

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.020
but you're okay being up here.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.020
I'm okay being up here.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020
Okay.

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020
All right.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020
What's your name?

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.020
My name's Amber.

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.020
Dr. Amber.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.020
Dr. Amber.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020
All right.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.020
I just got licensed.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.020
This Friday on The CW.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.020
I'm so excited about the show.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.020
This has been a long time coming.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.020
I need to have my face rubbed in this section of the carpet.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.020
I've been talking a lot of shit a long time about therapy.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.020
I don't have a problem with what you've said.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:44.020
If I did, it would go a little something.

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.020
Therapists are professional helpers and like any doctor,

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.020
if you don't like the first one,

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.020
you find another one that you do like.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020
Right.

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.020
There are a lot of shitty therapists

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.020
and therapists that take advantage of people

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.020
or are egotistical themselves,

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.020
but I went to school for a long time

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.020
to learn techniques to help.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.020
And like Zoe's therapists and others,

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.020
some of them you find a good connection with someone

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.020
who's going to be real with you

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.020
and lead you to be a better you.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020
There's two things.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.020
Just in the short time that you talked,

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.020
I was like, I want to say this.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.020
I want to say that.

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:26.020
The...

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:31.020
I'm sorry, our time is up.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.020
I really hope, Amber, that you get some money out of this.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:39.020
When you go, I'll give her a pile of it.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.020
You have to give it to 826LA though.

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.020
But when people go to study teeth in dental school,

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:51.020
what they learn is that there's a certain amount of teeth

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.020
that they exist in an ideal condition

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.020
in a certain row and things like that.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.020
So the thing that scares me immediately

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.020
is the idea of the human mind

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.020
as an array of features

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.020
that's supposed to be arranged in a certain order.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:09.020
That's the first thing that scares guys in my profession.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.020
I'm not unique in that way.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:14.020
Every hack writer in the world wants to hold onto his specialness

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.020
and thinks that it's going to be taken away.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.020
And I tell 9 out of 10 of those people,

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.020
fuck you, you hack.

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.020
Stop using the fact that you did a rewrite

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.020
on The Pest with John Leguizamo

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.020
as an excuse to be mean to your girlfriend.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.020
Go to therapy. You're being an asshole.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.020
But me, that's a different matter.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.020
I really got something to protect over here.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.020
How do you respond to that idea

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:45.020
that other sciences are like a doctor goes,

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.020
okay, this is what a bone is supposed to do.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.020
This is what a tooth is supposed to do.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.020
This is what a liver is supposed to look like.

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.020
When you're dealing with the human mind,

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.020
not the brain, but the mind, the personality,

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.020
how do you guys, what do they teach you in...

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.020
In 144 characters.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.020
To account for the fact that some people actually

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.020
are supposed to be a little bit crazy.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.020
I think number one is we've had a lot of trouble

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.020
even being seen as a science.

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.020
And I'm a psychologist.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.020
Not a psychiatrist, right.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.020
I don't prescribe medication.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.020
I do talk therapy and those kind of interventions.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.020
So I see the human mind as messy.

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.020
It is not just black and white.

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:28.020
We're taught ways to get you to function better.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.020
What's your definition of it not functioning?

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.020
I don't want to cut you off.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.020
That's it.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.020
What's your definition?

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.020
What's happening, you guys?

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.020
If I...

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.020
What's your definition of it not functioning?

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.020
If somebody comes up to you, I would hope,

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.020
if somebody said to you,

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.020
I'm having fights with my girlfriend.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.020
I am going to marry her in November.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.020
This is totally hypothetical about that.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.020
He's asking for a friend.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.020
He said, I just...

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.020
How do you account for...

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.020
I want to ask you a million questions,

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.020
but I guess I'm supposed to pay for it.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020
Well, how many patients do you have?

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.020
What fields do they come from?

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.020
Where's your office?

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.020
How long have you been doing this?

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.020
I just finished my postdoc a couple months ago,

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.020
so I'm starting to work at the VA.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.020
I don't have a start date yet.

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.020
That's my new job.

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.020
You're working with veterans?

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.020
It'll be, yes.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.020
It's like a veteran hospital in West LA.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.020
But I was working at a private practice in Studio City,

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.020
and I saw kids and teens with autism and ADHD,

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.020
and I saw just regular adults,

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.020
and I worked at Kaiser for my internship,

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.020
where we saw, excuse me, everyone,

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.020
any walk of life psychosis to

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.020
I'm just having trouble with my fiance.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.020
So not to put you at a spot,

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.020
but if you could...

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.020
What is your definition of...

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.020
I don't even want to say an unhealthy mind.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.020
I want to say...

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:05.020
I would say if the people around you are worried,

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.020
and there's a consensus that

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.020
you could be doing better,

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.020
that would be indication number one.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.020
That's terrifying!

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.020
That's Donald Sutherland in Body Snatchers.

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.020
If there's a consensus that you could be...

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.020
You know how that sounds.

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:25.020
But it would also be, do you think you could be doing better?

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020
I mean, when someone comes into my office...

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.020
But what if I think I could be doing better

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.020
and everyone else thinks I could be doing better?

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.020
And what if I don't trust them?

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:37.020
Then I'd start thinking about certain diagnoses.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.020
Then you'd send me to a psychiatrist.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.020
But I would want to talk to those people

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.020
and spend more than just five minutes

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.020
in a strip mall with a clipboard.

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.020
I would spend a couple hours talking to you about

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.020
what's really going on, what are you worried about,

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:53.020
why are you concerned about coming to see me even?

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.020
What do you... I mean, you've already...

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.020
It's always... I'll answer your question,

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.020
although I'm not coming to see you.

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.020
I...

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.020
The last 11 therapists...

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.020
The last 11 times I've gone to a therapist

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.020
it's always been because it's make or break with the...

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.020
I'm always on the verge of, like,

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.020
I'm hurting somebody that I'm with.

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.020
I would say you've waited too long.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:24.020
I'm glad.

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:27.020
I'm waiting for my mic to turn into a bouquet of flowers.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.020
I just mean that if...

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.020
I think most people make the mistake of...

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.020
Waiting until...

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.020
It's a last resort.

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.020
I get that.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.020
And I'm not a couple's therapist, but...

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.020
She's not on your side, Erin.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.020
You're not listening to what she's really saying.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.020
Some people do, like, preemptive,

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.020
you know, marriage counseling or couples counseling.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:51.020
But that's, like, picking a scab, right?

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.020
It's like, you should have dealt with this

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.020
when it was bleeding.

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.020
No, no, no.

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.020
I think preemptive counseling is cool,

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.020
because...

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.020
I think it's super rad.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.020
It's totally Bieber.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.020
I mean, I'm really happy with our relationship right now,

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.020
but we do have a few communication issues,

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.020
so it would be nice to kind of work out a game plan

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.020
or just kind of have a...

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.020
This is one of the problems I would be coming to you with,

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.020
is that I have a fiance who tries to parlay any situation

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.020
and their political advantage.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020
I feel like...

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.020
That's not true.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.020
Somebody's storming the stage.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.020
Can you take that mic?

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.020
James, I'm coming humbly.

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.020
Well, go sit behind the table.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.020
I'm coming humbly.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.020
Or he's just gonna...

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.020
What's your name, sir?

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.020
James Lively.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.020
James Lively?

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.020
Fake name.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.020
I do fake name counseling.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.020
You can go with maybe a John Smith or a...

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.020
My name is Most Likely.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:09.020
My grandfather was a Hollywood writer.

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.020
No, no, no, crazy alcoholic, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.020
And I went to couples therapy.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.020
And I went to couples therapy.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.020
Why do you have a microphone in your hand right now?

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.020
I don't know.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.020
This undeserving douchebag that came up here,

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020
that's what I am.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.020
You have something to say about couples therapy.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.020
If we track back the conversation a little bit,

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.020
what's interesting,

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.020
if you go back to your comment about diagnosing people...

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.020
No.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.020
Diagnosing people who have a superiority complex.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.020
It's troubling because those people are like Darwinian geniuses.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.020
They're gonna take us all over, right?

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.020
They're like the technocratic,

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.020
like capitalistic geniuses.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.020
But what's interesting about therapy

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.020
is it's like a bunch of angst rid

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.020
and people who decided that human compassion

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.020
is actually more important.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.020
That's why they're diagnosing things like

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.020
superiority complex.

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.020
You expected an applause break that you did not get.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.020
No, no, no, no.

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.020
I thought you were kind of like...

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.020
No, no, no.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:13.020
As long as we're doing philosophy though,

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.020
you're a Socrates, you care enough

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.020
to listen to a rambling idiot like myself.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020
I'm not a Socrates guy.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.020
Mr. Lively, you came up to support couples therapy, right?

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020
No, no, no.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.020
No, it's interesting.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.020
Did I misunderstand?

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.020
No, it's interesting.

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.020
I missed the thesis.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.020
What's going on?

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.020
Yeah, I don't know that there's much of a thesis.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.020
Get the fuck out the stairs!

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.020
He has sent me back down.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:40.020
We can't all be on stage.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.020
But it is notable that there are so many people

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:48.020
that are shooting their hands up in support of therapy.

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.020
There's got to be a way for you to gracefully...

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.020
I have a way.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.020
Let's supplant James Lively.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.020
Thank you very much, James Lively.

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.020
Let's bring up Spencer Crittendale.

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.020
Is he here?

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.020
He's not here?

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.020
He's not here!

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.020
Don't tell James Lively that.

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.020
I was sitting here with a message for you.

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.020
Oh, shit.

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.020
Where's Spencer?

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.020
He would like to take the week off.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:17.020
Spencer has grown up.

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.020
He's like...

01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.020
Thank you, James.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.020
He's got his...

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.020
Thank you, James.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.020
Thank you.

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:24.020
I have no idea what happened, but thank you.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.020
Sorry, young lady.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.020
I didn't know...

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.020
Doctor Amber, we were making headway here.

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.020
I think we were making headway here.

01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.020
Doctor Amber, we were making headway here.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.020
She gave it to me.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.020
Oh, well, she's...

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.020
Yes.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.020
Hi, Dan.

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:42.020
Would you consider seeing somebody like Doctor Amber

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.020
or somebody in her ilk?

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.020
I don't know if I would...

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.020
If her name was Doctor Amber, I would...

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.020
I would feel too nervous that when I came home

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:54.020
and my fiancee asked me how it went with Doctor Amber,

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.020
I would be like,

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.020
Fine!

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.020
And it would be like...

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.020
I made lots of...

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.020
Yeah.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.020
Earlier, you said that Doctor Amber wasn't on my side.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.020
Yes, you were, right?

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.020
Amber, Amber, don't pick sides.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.020
Not in an on my side thing.

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:21.020
I mean, I think they're fine with us.

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.020
Everything's fine.

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.020
No, I know.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.020
We could have some tools.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.020
We could use some tools.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.020
Dan, let's just say, hypothetically,

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:33.020
you started going to sessions with Doctor Amber, let's say.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.020
But Erin started...

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.020
She comes back smelling like pina coladas.

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:43.020
But Erin started also seeing one of her other doctors...

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.020
Dr. Thor.

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:46.020
Dr. Thor.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.020
We meet in Asana.

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.020
That's where his office is, Dan.

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:52.020
I wanted to actually...

01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:55.020
I think Doctor Amber, I think that's a weird name

01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:57.020
to give a person who's a doctor.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:01.020
It sounds like a strip cheese is imminent.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.020
I think it's valuable that I am for the last...

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.020
At least a year and a half.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.020
Get those dollars out, gentlemen.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.020
Taking a shit on the profession of therapy in general.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.020
And I don't know.

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:18.020
I would like to hear out any perspective from that side.

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:22.020
We never have anybody up here who has the guts to say,

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.020
okay, I do that thing for a living and I'm not a piece of shit

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.020
and I don't...

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.020
I don't pray on people and I'm not an agent of compromise.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.020
I do just want people to feel good about themselves,

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.020
regardless of how crazy they are.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.020
That's the thing that I want to understand.

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.020
She likes you and appreciates you.

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.020
I like Doctor Amber.

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.020
I think you should go to Doctor Amber.

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:46.020
Amber, how many towns have you heard or have been to?

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.020
Oh, I listen regularly.

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.020
You should go to Doctor Amber!

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.020
What about where I go?

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.020
This is a larger, important issue.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.020
I have a follow-up question.

01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:00.020
Does something come to your mind?

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:04.020
I wouldn't ask you to diagnose Dan, but...

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.020
But you will in this moment.

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:11.020
But having heard, basically, Harmontown is nothing more

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:16.020
than just a huge soliloquy of what's going on with him.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.020
Is there any diagnosis that comes to mind?

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.020
You don't have an answer.

01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:27.020
I mean, honestly, I don't have an answer for that.

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.020
There isn't one that comes to mind.

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.020
Is that really your business diagnosis?

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:33.020
No, I shouldn't diagnose having just heard a podcast.

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.020
But also either...

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.020
Doctor Amber for life!

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.020
Maybe we'll all be stuck in Amber!

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.020
A psychologist doesn't diagnose, do they?

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.020
They don't prescribe anything.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.020
When you do diagnose, we use the DSM-5 now,

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:52.020
but that is by the American Psychiatric Association.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.020
They all sound like real things.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.020
They are real.

01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.020
But they're the ones that can push medication,

01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:01.020
and so if they come up with diagnoses,

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.020
more of you can qualify for those medications.

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:07.020
If I took insurance and you came to me

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.020
and I wanted to be reimbursed for helping you and everything,

01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.020
I would need to give you a diagnosis.

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.020
Kind of a conflict of interest.

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.020
It's a terrible system.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.020
Because you need to actually come up with a label

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.020
for a person who happens to just have a problem with the way the world is.

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.020
What a weird conflict of interest.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:31.020
That's not to say that you have wasted your life in your occupation

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.020
or that you're not a good person.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.020
But I will say that means I'm fucking right.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:39.020
That is fucking horse shit.

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.020
That's capitalism in action.

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.020
If you have a problem with the way the world works,

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:46.020
you're supposed to go to someone in a kiosk,

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:49.020
and they are beholden not to your condition,

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.020
not to your happiness,

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.020
and not even to the happiness of anyone around you,

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.020
but to the happiness of your fucking healthcare provider.

01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:01.020
They're beholden to corporations, definitions of mental health.

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:06.020
There is no such thing as mental health as defined by a corporation.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:11.020
A corporation defines normality as corporations being human beings

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.020
and having votes influencing society.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.020
That's insanity.

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:21.020
It's insanity that corporations have any power over anybody.

01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.020
That's automatically insane.

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.020
You wake up in an insane world.

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.020
You wake up in a world of psychosis.

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.020
So by definition, if you feel psychotic,

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:35.020
if you think rivers are red and the sky is purple,

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.020
you may possibly be sane.

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:42.020
You may be the only sane person in the world.

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.020
Taste the rainbow?

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.020
Fuck you, Skittles!

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.020
You can't taste a rainbow!

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.020
Pacing Dr. Hamburg.

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.020
Code red.

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.020
They will tell you that you can taste a rainbow.

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.020
Code rainbow.

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.020
And it's not your fault, but you are part of the beehive,

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.020
and that's why I don't do it.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:05.020
I don't do it. I won't taste the rainbow.

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.020
Do you have any pets, Dr. Amber?

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.020
I have two cats.

01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.020
Dolly and Jezi.

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.020
Dolly and Jezi.

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.020
Let's go to Dr. Amber.

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:20.020
I went to school not to learn what the diagnoses are,

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:25.020
but I went to school to learn how to help people who present with a certain problem.

01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:28.020
Lots of psychologists, lots of people are unhappy with the DSM,

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:31.020
if people know what that is, the big book of mental illness.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.020
There's huge controversy about it,

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.020
but I can still be a psychologist and throw some label on something,

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:40.020
but still treat the real issue.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.020
If you have something you want to work on, we work on that,

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.020
and I don't think too much about something I wrote on an insurance form.

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.020
But you have to write something.

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.020
If I take the insurance I have to, if I took cash, I'd say,

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.020
you're just troubled, let's just talk.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.020
How much cash would you take?

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.020
How much are you willing to get?

01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.020
Fucking too much for me to keep coming back.

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:03.020
If you happen to be a really smart fucking dude

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:05.020
who had a bunch of fucking problems,

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.020
I would go bankrupt trying to set my mind straight.

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:09.020
Maybe.

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.020
For sure.

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:14.020
I mean, most charge between $150 and $200 an hour.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.020
What?

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:21.020
The dude that was working on me was charging more than my rent a month.

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.020
It was like, I loved it.

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.020
He was great, but fucking whatever.

01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.020
Apparently, being mentally healthy means you can't live in this society,

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:34.020
which is what I thought walking in the door.

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.020
That's what makes me crazy.

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:43.020
If tomorrow seems weird, maybe it needs to keep seeming weird.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.020
I don't know.

01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:48.020
If you're talking to a fire hydrant, everybody drives by you

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.020
and pats their pockets as they walk by.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.020
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.020
You keep sliding the lever down from there.

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.020
It's like, I'm talking to a fire hydrant. I'm talking to a rainbow.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.020
I'm talking to a palm tree. I'm talking to children.

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.020
I'm talking to the concept of happiness.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.020
I'm talking to the TV industry.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:04.020
My dad worked in TV. I had a job.

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:06.020
Meanwhile, somebody else is like,

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:08.020
well, I might be talking to a fire hydrant,

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:09.020
but I got to be a dishwasher.

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:11.020
But my family doesn't have any money, so I'm out in the street

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.020
and wandering around, hitting myself in the head.

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:18.020
Some of those people are Habsburgs in the 17th century.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.020
It depends on the support system.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:21.020
It's fucking money.

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:23.020
Everybody's got chemical imbalances.

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.020
Everybody's got a blue drop of liquid in their brain

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.020
and a green drop of liquid,

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.020
and it's like a little balance in their head.

01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:34.020
Good news is no one's going to make you go to therapy.

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.020
I know nobody's going to make me go to therapy.

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.020
I'm trying to set the shit straight once and for all.

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.020
I'm shuffling off this mortal coil.

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.020
I'm done with this planet.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.020
I have done, I made it.

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:49.020
I fucking won.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:51.020
I don't need shit.

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:55.020
What I would like to do is look back on this monopoly game

01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:59.020
from wherever Beyond Go is and go,

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.020
fuck you, people.

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.020
What did you think was the point of the game?

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.020
It's called jail.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:05.020
How many years?

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:09.020
Because, I mean, the point of the game

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:11.020
is to have a certain amount of red hotels

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.020
and a certain amount of squares.

01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:14.020
I just want to understand,

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:16.020
what do I have to do to be a good person?

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.020
Because I want to have a kid.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.020
I want to have two kids.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.020
I want to spend the rest of my life.

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:26.020
I want to slowly crumble into a skeleton

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.020
and crumble into dust

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.020
and leave a kid behind me.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:34.020
You want to leave a kid behind a skeleton?

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:37.020
Yes, Jeff, that's called parenthood.

01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:41.020
You don't want to leave a kid in front of a skeleton.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:43.020
That's bad.

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:49.020
Dad, let's throw a baseball. Oh my God!

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.020
I'm sorry, you're stranded up here.

01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:55.020
Do you have any final words for your vocation?

01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.020
I think you seem like a really...

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.020
I love Dr. Hammer.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.020
Definitely a hero for coming up here.

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:02.020
I also like Dr. Hammer.

01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.020
Is there anything else?

01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:09.020
Dr. Hammer!

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.020
I feel like I have to give some sort of message.

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.020
Therapy is not for everyone,

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.020
but if you're interested,

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.020
try a few until you find one that works.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.020
You do hear people talk about it tonight,

01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.020
and it is just finding a connection with someone else.

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.020
If it's not a therapist,

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.020
your podcast is your therapy, I think.

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.020
Would you agree?

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:30.020
Okay, so stay up here for a second.

01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.020
Now you're trapped.

01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.020
Because this brings up a good point.

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.020
A dentist gets to say,

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.020
this is where your molar should be.

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:39.020
If your molar is in the front,

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.020
then there's something wrong,

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.020
and the dentist can say...

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:43.020
Why are the teeth thinking?

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.020
Because it's an easy analogy

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.020
to compare it to another science.

01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.020
Okay.

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.020
So with the mind,

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.020
as Amber is saying,

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.020
it's obviously more nuance than that.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.020
However, according to the insurance companies,

01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.020
it ain't.

01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:59.020
That's the problem.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.020
So what I'm saying to Amber is,

01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.020
in view of that,

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:05.020
and the fact that that's how it is,

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.020
is your suggestion to people

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:10.020
that, unlike a dentist,

01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:12.020
with therapy,

01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.020
it's beholden upon the consumer

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.020
to actually explore

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.020
as much as they would with a romantic relationship.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.020
You have to actually speed date.

01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.020
Totally.

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.020
If you go to your first therapist,

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.020
and you're happy,

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.020
you're fucking up, maybe.

01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:31.020
And you're not really talking to your dentist.

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.020
The way that you might...

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:36.020
And your teeth are set in order.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.020
By order of six million years of evolution,

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.020
whereas your brain is...

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:42.020
I'm saying, like,

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.020
so all of you out there

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.020
who are happy with your first therapist,

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.020
you're about as happy as people who married

01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.020
out of high school.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.020
Go fuck yourself.

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.020
Oh, well done!

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.020
Yeah.

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:53.020
Fuck you.

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:54.020
Fuck you.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.020
Fuck all of you.

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.020
Oh, well done!

01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.020
Enjoy your divorce!

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.020
Stacy and Steve.

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.020
Oh, you were so cute together, remember?

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.020
You fucked up!

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.020
What do you think the odds were?

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.020
Sorry, Zoe, you're raising your hand.

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:12.020
I have something to say.

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.020
Amber's like,

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:14.020
God damn it,

01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.020
what do I got to do to get out of here?

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.020
Act three.

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.020
So, my first therapist was the one who got...

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:23.020
helped me get out of my first unhappy marriage.

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.020
Okay, all right.

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.020
It's a good one.

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.020
I'm serious.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.020
All right, it's fine.

01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.020
Yeah.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.020
Well, when you put a human face on it,

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.020
okay, it's fine, Zoe.

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.020
But don't you think your second therapist

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.020
might have made you really mentally healthy?

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.020
To be fair, my therapist doesn't take insurance,

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.020
so she's not beholden to anyone.

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.020
I think you're a little jaded,

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.020
and people, if you need therapy,

01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.020
you should really pursue it.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.020
Don't listen to this guy.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.020
It's amazing.

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.020
I agree with that.

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.020
I agree with that.

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:55.020
Yeah, you don't want to listen to a fat-rich millionaire

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.020
who doesn't speak for...

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.020
Yeah, I agree with that.

01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.020
I'm also a millionaire.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:04.020
Well, okay, now, see, that doesn't...

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.020
It's not a competition, I'm saying.

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:07.020
I don't represent...

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.020
It was until it was.

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:11.020
A fat-rich millionaire with hair on his back.

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:12.020
All right, I was a proper...

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.020
I was a proper lost for a long time.

01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:15.020
I didn't believe in therapy,

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:18.020
and then I was so unhappy that I started going,

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.020
and it's incredible.

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:20.020
I...

01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:22.020
Everyone should do it if you want to.

01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.020
First therapist.

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.020
She's on her first therapist.

01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:25.020
She's amazing.

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.020
She's amazing.

01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.020
First therapist.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:29.020
Right out of high school.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:31.020
I'm 29 years old.

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:32.020
What time?

01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.020
I'm 29 years old.

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:34.020
29.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:35.020
I've only been going on tour for like a year.

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:37.020
Well, still, first therapist.

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.020
But seriously, it's someone who supports you

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.020
and cares about you,

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.020
and they're unbiased.

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:44.020
Not as much as your second therapist.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.020
I don't know, man.

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.020
So are you saying my second husband

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.020
is going to like me better than my first husband did?

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.020
Yes.

01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:55.020
I'm looking for...

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.020
I think my first joke would get a bigger laugh

01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.020
than the callback.

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:03.020
Don't be so mean to my first therapist.

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.020
She's really nice.

01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:07.020
I believe you.

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:08.020
I believe you, Zoe.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.020
I'm not...

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:15.020
No one's happy when they get married out of high school.

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.020
It's totally different.

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.020
It's two different things.

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.020
Therapy.

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.020
Zoe, I believe...

01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:26.020
No, Zoe, we...

01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:27.020
Zoe, I believe you.

01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.020
I'm just saying, go to therapy if you want to.

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:32.020
It's amazing.

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:33.020
Yes.

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.020
Don't get married, though.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.020
Never again!

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.020
I think that's perfect, though.

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.020
I mean, that's perfect.

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.020
But really, everyone should stick with their first therapist.

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.020
They don't have to, they go to...

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.020
No, no, that's fine.

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.020
That's the point, though.

01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.020
I'm not being cynical.

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.020
I'm not being an asshole.

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.020
No, no, no.

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.020
What that represents is the big pudding of...

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.020
You should think of therapy.

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.020
I'm saying, Amber, you agree that...

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.020
Because you're being like...

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.020
And I don't want to throw you under the bus,

01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:13.020
but you're saying in this world where you have to...

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:18.020
We should definitely all seek therapy, number one.

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.020
Number two, we should all be really picky.

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020
I don't think she said that.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.020
No, she didn't say that we should all seek therapy.

01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:26.020
Don't throw her under the bus at all.

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020
I don't understand.

01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.020
She's, this is Amber!

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.020
Alright, let's let Amber go, so we don't embarrass her anymore.

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.020
She did a good job.

01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.020
Amber's a hero.

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:38.020
Dr. Amber, get stuck in Amber today!

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.020
Thank you very much.

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.020
I hope we didn't embarrass her too much.

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.020
I thought she was...

01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.020
All Harmontown fans that come up on stage are fantastic.

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.020
But that was a tough, that was Daniel and the Lions done.

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.020
Dr. Amber, I think she acquitted herself quite nicely.

01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.020
No, absolutely.

01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.020
I also think it's kind of an interesting idea,

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:02.020
you meeting with a therapist who listens to the podcast,

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.020
because obviously they appreciate you in a certain way.

01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.020
I also think Zoe's standing up and being like,

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.020
oh my god, my fucking therapist is...

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.020
No, I think it's great to love your therapist.

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:17.020
It all mitigates the whole thing.

01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.020
I mean, all I do is stand up here and like,

01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.020
I don't want to be like some jagged, weird,

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.020
charcoal rock guy going, yeah, therapist,

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.020
bullshit, I'm going to cut you if you come near me.

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.020
Am I wrong?

01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:32.020
Aaron, you support the idea of dead getting therapy.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:38.020
You have too much in your head, like a weird,

01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.020
a weird microphone porn.

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.020
It's so funny that I can move them in a way

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.020
that makes it a total, like there's a total...

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:49.020
Practice makes perfect.

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:54.020
Special video bonus for that joke.

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.020
What if I felt some weird pressure to blow a mic

01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.020
because of the video?

01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:07.020
No, I mean, Dan's fired up.

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:08.020
I'm into that.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.020
Just in general?

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:15.020
No, I mean, speaking, there are passionate feelings

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.020
on the podcast.

01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.020
Answer the question.

01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:24.020
You know, I don't actually think that Dan needs therapy.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.020
You know why?

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.020
Because you told her to say that.

01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.020
No, because Turnabout's fair play.

01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.020
That's why.

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.020
Because for the same reason I love her,

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.020
and I'm going to marry her,

01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.020
because she don't want to go to her therapist.

01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.020
I also...

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.020
Because I have the same relationship with therapy,

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:43.020
but I also understand it.

01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.020
I can't let go of the other mic.

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.020
The last thing she needs is me coming home with you.

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.020
But I do want to do...

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:52.020
I would like to go to a couple's therapist

01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.020
so just so we can have tools.

01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.020
Just for tools!

01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.020
Erin, Erin, it's good news

01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.020
because I'm about to introduce a new segment.

01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.020
No!

01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.020
It's called Turnabout Therapy is Fair Play.

01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:07.020
You guys get to be the each other's therapist for a moment.

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.020
Oh, okay.

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.020
No, everyone hates it.

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.020
The audience rejected your bet.

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.020
The audience doesn't want it.

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.020
It sounds like a bad idea.

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.020
They rejected it based on the title.

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:26.020
May I reveal...

01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.020
NBC executive.

01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.020
May I reveal...

01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.020
They know a failure when they hear it.

01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:35.020
May I reveal a fantasy...

01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:37.020
A couple nights.

01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.020
I would like to reveal...

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.020
Do you have one more microphone?

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.020
May I reveal a fantasy...

01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.020
Someone else are they flaccid.

01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:53.020
Yes, they are, sir.

01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.020
Yes, they are.

01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:58.020
Don't tell her how to have a good...

01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.020
Because they respect me.

01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:03.020
They're flaccid because they respect you.

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:06.020
Because they're going to listen to me.

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.020
And I haven't spoken yet.

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:11.020
They're going to become a wrecked once I've said...

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:19.020
Erin subscribes to a really high-priced,

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.020
tedious brand of pornography

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:26.020
in which the woman is surrounded by flaccid penises.

01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:30.020
A woman is surrounded by flaccid penises.

01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:35.020
All the men are like...

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.020
She's too much, bro.

01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.020
I agree.

01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.020
I just can't get turned on.

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.020
She's so smart.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.020
I was going to come,

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.020
but she made a really good point just now.

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.020
And the point is me just rubbing my face

01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:51.020
against them like beaded curtains.

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:53.020
Okay, this is my fantasy.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.020
This is my fantasy.

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.020
My fantasy just came true.

01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.020
We only have a few minutes left.

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.020
We're going to keep this bullet train moving.

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.020
Dear Spencer is not here,

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:12.020
but I have always fantasized.

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.020
I mean, I...

01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:16.020
Wow, wow.

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.020
Wait a second.

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.020
I shouldn't be using the word fantasy.

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.020
I...

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:23.020
It's no secret.

01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:26.020
My beard gently nestles under your tits.

01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:31.020
Slowly walking up his heart behind you

01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.020
with polyhedral balls.

01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.020
He sticks a dice tower.

01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.020
What?

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:46.020
In my fantasy, Spencer has polyhedral balls.

01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:48.020
Yeah, that'd be neat.

01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:54.020
I am not a celebrated, excellent player of D&D.

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.020
But I have always fantasized

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:03.020
about maybe just Dungeon Mastering for a second.

01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:06.020
And...

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.020
Oh.

01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020
I don't know.

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020
I don't know.

01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.020
I don't know.

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.020
I don't know.

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.020
I don't know.

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.020
I don't know.

01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.020
Yeah.

01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:18.020
If I could just Dungeon...

01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.020
Like, just my own world,

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.020
I'll give you guys characters just out of my head

01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.020
and we can just...

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.020
and just let me do it for a second.

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.020
This could go horribly.

01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.020
I have no pickets either.

01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.020
I'm going to do it.

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.020
For no reason, she's moving to another microphone.

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.020
She has no dice.

01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020
She could have stayed right where she was.

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.020
No way.

01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:44.020
Hopped by Nature's Finish.

01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.020
If you could play the music

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:47.020
and I'll recap what happened last week.

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:52.020
Really quick, Jeff's character is a pillar head.

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:57.020
And Dan's character is Shania Twain.

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:06.020
I want to check in with Dr. Amber after this is done.

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.020
Eric, you ready?

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:10.020
Yeah.

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:12.020
But...

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.020
Last week on Arons and Dragons,

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.020
pillar head and Shania Twain were traveling

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:25.020
through a dark cave filled with amethyst rock

01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:30.020
and small boxes filled with presents.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.020
Shania Twain didn't know what to get

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:40.020
for her mother-in-law's birthday.

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:45.020
And pillar head was irritated by how much emphasis

01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:48.020
she was putting on her mother-in-law's birthday.

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:53.020
Also, a goblin named Nosferatu

01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:58.020
was following after him with bags of blood

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:00.020
that he was going to devour

01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.020
and then they were going to metabolize

01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:08.020
into flames of death.

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:14.020
Will Nosferatu catch up with Shania Twain

01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.020
and pillar head?

01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.020
Or will pillar head finally confess

01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:24.020
his love of pillars?

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:30.020
Who knows what will happen this week

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:34.020
on Arons and...

01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.020
Dragons!

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.020
Dragons!

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.020
Well, as a 17th level samurai,

01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:55.020
I take out my samurai sword,

01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:00.020
which has a plus 11 against Nosferatu.

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.020
Goblins.

01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:06.020
I do a lunging, dazzling display.

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.020
He's not in your visibility.

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:09.020
You don't see him.

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:10.020
He's falling behind you.

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.020
Right now, you're just looking for a present

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.020
for Shania Twain's mother-in-law.

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.020
Okay.

01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:22.020
I amend that and I do a dazzling shopping spree.

01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.020
All right.

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:33.020
You find an appropriate hat.

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:42.020
Shania, I have found the appropriate hat.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:46.020
My God, that's the hat that my ancestors swore

01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.020
I should hate.

01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:50.020
Yes, but this hat will be nothing

01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:55.020
without appropriate accoutrements.

01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:02.020
I inspect my surroundings in really, really granular detail.

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:07.020
You look around the cave to the right,

01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:16.020
you see what looks like a plasticized Harrison Ford

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:18.020
in Star Wars.

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:20.020
What?

01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:22.020
Someone had a stroke.

01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:29.020
You look and you see what looks like different gems

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.020
trapped beneath like an ice, but the ice is not cold.

01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:35.020
It looks like Harrison Ford?

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:37.020
Well, it's kind of similar to Star Wars

01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.020
where he's stuck in the thing.

01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.020
Carbonite?

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.020
Carbonite.

01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.020
Okay.

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:43.020
So there's gems frozen in a certain...

01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.020
There are gems and you see different shapes

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:49.020
and you also see tiny boxes to the right.

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:53.020
Shania Twain, use your ability to unfreeze gems.

01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.020
I'd just like to keep looking around for a second.

01:45:56.020 --> 01:45:57.020
I just want to keep looking.

01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.020
I saw that and I just keep looking.

01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:00.020
All right.

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:03.020
I'm turning my head really slowly and I'm taking in every detail.

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:07.020
You see in front of you a giant golden swan,

01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:09.020
mouth, beak, a gape,

01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:12.020
tongue out,

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:15.020
on the tongue.

01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:19.020
You see what look like hundreds of colored threads

01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.020
and they're floating, they're moving,

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:23.020
they're jumping up and down like they're alive.

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.020
Okay.

01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:25.020
Okay.

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:29.020
I detect magic.

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.020
There is magic there.

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:32.020
Okay.

01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.020
I approach the swan.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:39.020
The threads see, like, rise their heads

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.020
like they're snakes and they start hissing at you.

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:46.020
I sense motive.

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:53.020
You don't roll high enough.

01:46:53.020 --> 01:47:00.020
I grab the swan by the neck.

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.020
The swan's neck starts to move around and comes alive.

01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:13.020
Are you wish to find a gift?

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:14.020
Yes.

01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:15.020
Yes.

01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.020
I already have the perfect hat,

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.020
but I think it could use maybe a nice accent,

01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.020
like a brooch or something.

01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:24.020
I feel like you are being too cast.

01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:29.020
Do you know who I am?

01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.020
I'm sorry.

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:33.020
Come again?

01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:34.020
The answer is no.

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:35.020
The answer is no.

01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:36.020
I don't know who you are.

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:40.020
The swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:45.020
Does not repeat herself.

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:47.020
I'll try to have a snake.

01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:49.020
I let go of her neck.

01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:52.020
The swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:54.020
Durg-a-Durg.

01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:59.020
I am the swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:02.020
I push and I twain the side.

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.020
The swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.020
Does not repeat herself.

01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.020
I shake him up.

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.020
I'm taking a knee.

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.020
I'm the swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:13.020
Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.020
That's the last time I will repeat my name.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:18.020
As a rule, I don't repeat myself,

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.020
but I've made some exceptions.

01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:23.020
There will be no more made tonight.

01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:26.020
I am the swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:29.020
I will not repeat myself again.

01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:32.020
The swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.020
I swear to God, we meant new harm.

01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.020
I'm sorry I grabbed your neck by mistake.

01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:38.020
I cast flaming orb.

01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:40.020
Where do you shoot the orb?

01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.020
At the swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.020
Where? Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:46.020
Where do you shoot at?

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.020
Right at the swan's open beak mouth.

01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:51.020
Okay.

01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:56.020
You inflict two damage on the swan of Durg-a-Durg.

01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:00.020
He means no harm.

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:02.020
He means no harm.

01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:07.020
I was here to help you, but now I'm here to defeat you.

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:10.020
It's the swan of Durg-a-Durg's turn.

01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:17.020
The swan of Durg-a-Durg spits a poison egg

01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:25.020
and hits pillar head in the face

01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:28.020
and inflicts four damage.

01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:31.020
Okay.

01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.020
Poison egg? Egg damage.

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.020
Swan of Durg-a-Durg, I'm sorry.

01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.020
We're sorry.

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.020
We mistook you for something else.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:42.020
We have traveled long and hard.

01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:45.020
We have encountered many demons and denizens.

01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:49.020
You better be careful because you don't want to meet my master.

01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:53.020
No, we do not.

01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:57.020
We just want to hang out in a cave with you.

01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:59.020
We don't want any trouble.

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.020
I had a lot of nice gifts in my beak

01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:03.020
and now I will not share them with you.

01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:06.020
That's fine. We accept that punishment.

01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:08.020
But we have no quarrel with you, madam.

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.020
I swing my swag bag.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.020
God damn it.

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.020
I swing my swag bag of holding

01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:21.020
and I throw a bunch of CDs that were given to me.

01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:27.020
And I aim the CDs at Swan's Achilles' Tendons.

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.020
Alright.

01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:31.020
It does nothing because there are CDs.

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:33.020
It does nothing.

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.020
That happened.

01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.020
That happened. That happened.

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:40.020
But nothing happened.

01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:42.020
You got to work on that.

01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:46.020
I touch the Swans' waterfowl cheek.

01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:50.020
Yeah.

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:52.020
Yes.

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:55.020
Do you see me?

01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:59.020
Like, for me?

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.020
I do. I really do.

01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:05.020
People always see this monstrous snake swan,

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.020
but are you really looking at me?

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.020
I don't even know what you mean.

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:15.020
I see a beam of light when I look at you.

01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:20.020
I see who you are.

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.020
I see your playlist.

01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:24.020
I see your favorite color.

01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:28.020
I see all the things that your high school friends hated.

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:34.020
The swan-a-durg-a-durg disappears, falls to the ground,

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:38.020
and what you see in front of you is a beautiful young princess

01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:43.020
holding a pearl in her hand.

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:48.020
She looks like a Sigourney Weaver at 12.

01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:50.020
Oh, yeah.

01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:55.020
Thanks for qualifying that.

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:57.020
You saved me.

01:51:57.020 --> 01:52:05.020
12 or 13.

01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:12.020
There's a difference.

01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:17.020
12 in swan-lady years, which is 18 in human years.

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:24.020
I cast Dr. Ember.

01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:27.020
A swan-woman lady.

01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:29.020
I'm Durg-a-durg.

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.020
Durg-a-durg.

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.020
You saved me from this terrible spell.

01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:38.020
I've been existing as a terrible snake swan for a very long time,

01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:44.020
providing gifts for people that were seeking gifts for people that they didn't care about very much.

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:47.020
We are just here to fulfill our quest,

01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:51.020
and possibly, if it behooves you, buy you beer.

01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.020
Whatever you want.

01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:57.020
I'm afraid that the moment that I turn into a human princess

01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:00.020
is five moments before my death.

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:05.020
So here's my pearl, and she dies.

01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:10.020
Wow, we did it! We won!

01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.020
Thank you for coming to Homestead.

01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:13.020
To the block on the dock!

01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.020
Erin McAddie!

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.020
What a Dungeon Mistress!

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:23.020
Dungeon Mistress.

01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:26.020
Thank you, Erin.

01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:32.020
Also, James Lively.

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.020
Dr. Ember is Zoe Michelle.

01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:36.020
Zoe, thank you.

01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:44.020
I'm Jeff Davis, your Mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:49.020
Thank you for giving me an 826LA, and Google it and see what you can do for now, and whatever.

01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:54.020
Thanks for coming out in droves, and we'll see you next week.

01:53:54.020 --> 01:54:04.020
Thank you, guys.
