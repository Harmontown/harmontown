{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:19.080\nHello one and all, welcome once again to the Meltdown Comics Theater of Nerd Melty Towns.\n\n00:19.080 --> 00:23.600\nFrom Hollywood, California, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:23.600 --> 00:35.020\nOnce you please keep those applause going and welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,\n\n00:35.020 --> 00:37.020\nDan Harmon.\n\n00:37.020 --> 00:40.020\nThank you.\n\n00:40.020 --> 00:46.020\nThanks for coming out.\n\n00:46.020 --> 00:51.020\nWhy so many people?\n\n00:51.020 --> 00:53.020\nIt's like a record crowd, I think.\n\n00:53.020 --> 00:57.020\nI don't know if we've ever, maybe it's just because there's lighting back there or something.\n\n00:57.020 --> 00:58.020\nIt's a big crowd.\n\n00:58.020 --> 00:59.020\nYeah.\n\n00:59.020 --> 01:01.020\nAlright, let's give them what they're worth.\n\n01:01.020 --> 01:07.020\nLet's make sure they walk out of here going, I spent $10 and got $20 worth.\n\n01:07.020 --> 01:10.020\nHow do we make sure that happens?\n\n01:10.020 --> 01:12.020\nWe just fuck them.\n\n01:12.020 --> 01:17.020\nAlright, line up on the right.\n\n01:17.020 --> 01:20.020\nAlright, so a couple things.\n\n01:20.020 --> 01:24.020\nI just want to, I mean, we had our charity event here today.\n\n01:24.020 --> 01:30.020\nWe had the 826LA charity event.\n\n01:30.020 --> 01:34.020\nAnd as far as I understand it, it's a good charity.\n\n01:34.020 --> 01:36.020\nI'm told.\n\n01:36.020 --> 01:46.020\nI'm assuming I'm not going to find out that it's like a charity that goes to fund windowless white vans.\n\n01:46.020 --> 01:51.020\nFrom what I hear, it sounds like exactly my kind of charity.\n\n01:51.020 --> 01:55.020\nBecause I've always said, I mean, yes, there's hungry people.\n\n01:55.020 --> 01:56.020\nYes, there's poor people.\n\n01:56.020 --> 02:00.020\nYes, there's people with horrible diseases battling them all the time.\n\n02:00.020 --> 02:15.020\nThere's a million, billion, trillion, zillion ways to try in vain to spread your money if you have a penny to spare around the planet to try to make the planet a better place to try to break the cycle of agony.\n\n02:15.020 --> 02:21.020\nHowever, in my tiny little bubble of existence, I have always been asked this question.\n\n02:21.020 --> 02:27.020\nWhy are your writing staffs always a bunch of white dudes from Harvard?\n\n02:27.020 --> 02:33.020\nAnd the answer is always because that's the big pile of scripts that piles up.\n\n02:33.020 --> 02:38.020\nAnd the answer to that, why is that big pile of scripts from white dudes from Harvard?\n\n02:38.020 --> 02:50.020\nThe answer is because those people have support systems, those people are willing and able to spend 15 years pursuing the agonizing field of writing while their parents support them.\n\n02:50.020 --> 02:54.020\nAnd thanks because their parents told them it's possible for you to be a writer, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n02:54.020 --> 03:00.020\nIt all trickles back to this idea that when you're in sixth grade, did anyone ever come to you?\n\n03:00.020 --> 03:04.020\nDid anyone ever come to your public school and tell you you could be a writer?\n\n03:04.020 --> 03:06.020\nYou can do something creative.\n\n03:06.020 --> 03:11.020\nYou were allowed while you're thinking of being a princess, while you're thinking of being an astronaut.\n\n03:11.020 --> 03:17.020\nHave you ever considered the possibility that writer is an occupation and that that doesn't happen?\n\n03:17.020 --> 03:27.020\nNow, I don't think that if you tell sixth graders the world over that they should be writers that they're going to then wander into a world where they're totally supported.\n\n03:27.020 --> 03:37.020\nBut I do think that not enough of them are being told that there's not enough creative activation in the grade school era of your uprising.\n\n03:37.020 --> 03:40.020\nAs far as I understand about 826, that's what they're doing.\n\n03:40.020 --> 03:47.020\nThey're injecting themselves into that part of the genome and trying to change something there.\n\n03:47.020 --> 03:51.020\nSaying to 11-year-old kids, write something, create something.\n\n03:51.020 --> 03:54.020\nThey break the cycle there.\n\n03:54.020 --> 04:00.020\nSo we raised just tons of money today for them, and hopefully that'll go to something good.\n\n04:00.020 --> 04:03.020\nBut look them up, Google it, and actually, you know what?\n\n04:03.020 --> 04:08.020\nI shouldn't have babbled about it because we have people here from it, and I wanted to ask them personally if I'm right about that.\n\n04:08.020 --> 04:11.020\nThey're going to come up and say, no, that's not true.\n\n04:11.020 --> 04:14.020\nWe've been working on biofuel.\n\n04:14.020 --> 04:16.020\nYou got it all wrong.\n\n04:16.020 --> 04:24.020\nDid you have a teacher, Dan, like the first teacher or somebody that supported your writing as a kid, or are your brain as a child?\n\n04:24.020 --> 04:26.020\nYou know, I did.\n\n04:26.020 --> 04:34.020\nI grew up in the 70s in Milwaukee, and every time I expressed an interest in reading and writing, there was somebody,\n\n04:34.020 --> 04:39.020\nwhether it was my mom or some well-meaning teacher, there was somebody that said,\n\n04:39.020 --> 04:46.020\nholy fuck, they always responded that way.\n\n04:46.020 --> 04:48.020\nI don't know why you guys are laughing at that.\n\n04:48.020 --> 04:53.020\nI'm saying that is a thing that doesn't happen for everybody, and it may very well be.\n\n04:53.020 --> 05:01.020\nAs far as I know, that may be why I ended up being halfway decent at what I do.\n\n05:01.020 --> 05:04.020\nIt may be just hypnosis.\n\n05:04.020 --> 05:10.020\nBut there's a story you might have told before in Harmontown about you being, like, you were separated and went into that little room.\n\n05:10.020 --> 05:12.020\nYeah.\n\n05:12.020 --> 05:20.020\nIn the 70s, it was still okay to, like, grab kids that showed an interest in stuff, and you yanked them out of general pop,\n\n05:20.020 --> 05:24.020\nand you threw them into a closet, and you said, okay, how smart are you?\n\n05:24.020 --> 05:25.020\nShow us.\n\n05:25.020 --> 05:28.020\nAnd they still did that with me back then.\n\n05:28.020 --> 05:35.020\nAnd I was, like, a weirdo, and they cranked me up, and then they threw me back in when Reagan got elected.\n\n05:35.020 --> 05:38.020\nAnd then I was like, ah, stop, why are you hitting me?\n\n05:38.020 --> 05:42.020\nNo, it was, yeah, it was tracking.\n\n05:42.020 --> 05:50.020\nThere's a sinister side to it and a humanitarian side to it.\n\n05:50.020 --> 05:56.020\nI think that the bottom line is, like, kids, you can't farm them.\n\n05:56.020 --> 05:58.020\nYou cannot form education.\n\n05:58.020 --> 05:59.020\nIt doesn't work.\n\n05:59.020 --> 06:10.020\nYou have to, like, every single tiny little human brain is a, the whole thing that's for sale with the human species is diversity.\n\n06:10.020 --> 06:19.020\nIt's the idea that every little cranium contains not another kernel of popcorn, but in fact a potential Picasso.\n\n06:19.020 --> 06:26.020\nAnd it doesn't, that doesn't make it shameful if the thing that pops is a delightful garbage man.\n\n06:26.020 --> 06:29.020\nThat's not shameful.\n\n06:29.020 --> 06:32.020\nWhat's shameful is treating them all the same.\n\n06:32.020 --> 06:34.020\nThat's what's shameful.\n\n06:34.020 --> 06:41.020\nYou have to regard every pre-Picasso brain as if it might be a Picasso.\n\n06:41.020 --> 06:43.020\nSo Dan, are you pro-life?\n\n06:43.020 --> 06:45.020\nNo, maybe not.\n\n06:45.020 --> 06:48.020\nThen it gets more complicated.\n\n06:48.020 --> 06:53.020\nOnce the sperm hits the egg, fuck that thing, flush it down the toilet.\n\n06:53.020 --> 06:57.020\nBut for God's sakes, once it's got a head, I don't know.\n\n06:57.020 --> 07:08.020\nAnyways, I roll into this stuff early because we, so why don't we, let's just bring up Tyler.\n\n07:08.020 --> 07:09.020\nWhere's Tyler?\n\n07:09.020 --> 07:10.020\nIs he in the front row?\n\n07:10.020 --> 07:11.020\nThere you are.\n\n07:11.020 --> 07:12.020\nAre you willing to come up?\n\n07:12.020 --> 07:18.020\nThere you go, coming up.\n\n07:18.020 --> 07:22.020\nGrab a mic and have a seat.\n\n07:22.020 --> 07:30.020\nDid I get, what did I get wrong when I, Tyler is one of the, you were there at the beginning of 826, what became 826LA?\n\n07:30.020 --> 07:32.020\nYou were there in San Francisco?\n\n07:32.020 --> 07:33.020\nYes.\n\n07:33.020 --> 07:38.020\nYeah, I was, I feel so old now thinking about this because I haven't had to think about it.\n\n07:38.020 --> 07:44.020\n12 years ago, right around now, I was the first, one of the first students at 826 Valencia.\n\n07:44.020 --> 07:46.020\nIt was a clap, that was adorable.\n\n07:46.020 --> 07:48.020\nI don't know why I should get a clap, but.\n\n07:48.020 --> 07:56.020\nSo you were one of the first students, does that mean you were one of the first beneficiaries of 826's existence?\n\n07:56.020 --> 07:57.020\nYeah.\n\n07:57.020 --> 07:58.020\nYes.\n\n07:58.020 --> 08:03.020\nOkay, so you were one of the founding members of this charity, you were one of the first kids that benefited from this.\n\n08:03.020 --> 08:06.020\nYeah, yeah, and it was started by Dave Eggers at San Francisco.\n\n08:06.020 --> 08:08.020\nHe's the author.\n\n08:08.020 --> 08:09.020\nThank you.\n\n08:09.020 --> 08:13.020\nYeah, he's a Pulitzer Prize finalist for Heartbreak and Work of Staggering Genius.\n\n08:13.020 --> 08:20.020\nHe wrote the script for Where the Wild Things Are, the movie, done work with Spike Jonze, many things like that.\n\n08:20.020 --> 08:26.020\nBut the guy that wrote the book, Where the Wild Things Are, he started a much better charity.\n\n08:26.020 --> 08:32.020\nIt's more pure, it's more beloved.\n\n08:32.020 --> 08:34.020\nIt's called 937.\n\n08:34.020 --> 08:43.020\nNot that we can measure these things, but yes, it's called 937 Earth.\n\n08:43.020 --> 08:45.020\nIt's a higher number.\n\n08:45.020 --> 08:46.020\nYeah.\n\n08:46.020 --> 08:47.020\nEarth.\n\n08:47.020 --> 08:55.020\nBut yeah, I guess the biggest thing for anyone to take away, and I do know, because I was introduced by Harmontown just by finding it online,\n\n08:55.020 --> 09:00.020\nthat there's so many people around the world listening to this right now, when they do listen to it in the future,\n\n09:00.020 --> 09:04.020\nthat 826 is not just LA, it is not just San Francisco.\n\n09:04.020 --> 09:06.020\nIt is eight cities in the U.S.\n\n09:06.020 --> 09:08.020\nThey are always looking for volunteers.\n\n09:08.020 --> 09:13.020\nJust for 2012, 2013 year, they served 34,000 students.\n\n09:13.020 --> 09:18.020\nThey had over 4,000 volunteers nationwide, but they are always looking for more.\n\n09:18.020 --> 09:22.020\nSo it's not just your money, that they would always love your money, and if you ever want to spend that,\n\n09:22.020 --> 09:28.020\neach store across the nation has their own niche market that they like to sell things to.\n\n09:28.020 --> 09:33.020\nHere, if you happen to be a time traveler, their storefront is for time travelers.\n\n09:33.020 --> 09:36.020\nSan Francisco is a pirate supply store.\n\n09:36.020 --> 09:39.020\nI believe Chicago is a robot supply store.\n\n09:39.020 --> 09:41.020\nNew York is for superheroes.\n\n09:41.020 --> 09:45.020\nAnd I mean, at the root of it is tutoring, right?\n\n09:45.020 --> 09:46.020\nYes.\n\n09:46.020 --> 09:48.020\nIt is creative writing and tutoring.\n\n09:48.020 --> 09:51.020\nIt's a thinking man's boy's center.\n\n09:51.020 --> 09:56.020\nWhen I was a kid, it was like, keep the kids off the street, try to keep them in a gang.\n\n09:56.020 --> 09:58.020\nThere was like, what were those things called?\n\n09:58.020 --> 10:00.020\nYMCA's?\n\n10:00.020 --> 10:02.020\nWell, is it YMCA or?\n\n10:02.020 --> 10:04.020\nBoys Club.\n\n10:04.020 --> 10:05.020\nBoys Clubs, yeah.\n\n10:05.020 --> 10:07.020\nI was in a boys club as a kid.\n\n10:07.020 --> 10:10.020\nI don't know under what circumstances, but I do know.\n\n10:10.020 --> 10:12.020\nDesire.\n\n10:12.020 --> 10:16.020\nI was the connect for a champion.\n\n10:16.020 --> 10:17.020\nThat's awesome.\n\n10:17.020 --> 10:19.020\nThat's how low budget that boys club was.\n\n10:19.020 --> 10:21.020\nI don't sell you some short.\n\n10:21.020 --> 10:24.020\nI'm sure if it was global, you would still be.\n\n10:24.020 --> 10:26.020\nI'm sure you're really good at connect for it.\n\n10:26.020 --> 10:29.020\nNo, but we didn't play rugby.\n\n10:29.020 --> 10:30.020\nWe played connect for.\n\n10:30.020 --> 10:32.020\nNo, but I bet you're really good at connect for it.\n\n10:32.020 --> 10:36.020\nOh, there's two things I'm great at.\n\n10:36.020 --> 10:37.020\nConnect three.\n\n10:37.020 --> 10:41.020\nConnect four.\n\n10:41.020 --> 10:44.020\nI will challenge anybody to connect four or boggle.\n\n10:44.020 --> 10:45.020\nI will beat you.\n\n10:45.020 --> 10:48.020\nI will beat you at boggle.\n\n10:48.020 --> 10:51.020\nI believe you.\n\n10:51.020 --> 10:54.020\nI have you.\n\n10:54.020 --> 10:58.020\nNo, also, that said, Dan, I will tell you right now.\n\n10:58.020 --> 11:00.020\nHere's the couple that I'm bad at.\n\n11:00.020 --> 11:03.020\nI'm terrible at foosball and ping pong.\n\n11:03.020 --> 11:04.020\nI can see that.\n\n11:04.020 --> 11:09.020\nJust based on tonight, you're terrible at bragging.\n\n11:09.020 --> 11:20.020\nOh, I haven't begun to brag yet.\n\n11:20.020 --> 11:22.020\nNo, you're getting better than that.\n\n11:22.020 --> 11:25.020\nTyler, it's just me or Tyler, little Jason Zidekis.\n\n11:25.020 --> 11:27.020\nDo you see this?\n\n11:27.020 --> 11:29.020\nIt's a little bit.\n\n11:29.020 --> 11:31.020\nI don't know if that's a compliment.\n\n11:31.020 --> 11:32.020\nOh, it is.\n\n11:32.020 --> 11:33.020\nOh, yeah.\n\n11:33.020 --> 11:35.020\nHe's dating Olivia Wilde.\n\n11:35.020 --> 11:39.020\nAll right, so you were a little fella and you,\n\n11:39.020 --> 11:42.020\nhow did you encounter 826?\n\n11:42.020 --> 11:44.020\nLike, you were where?\n\n11:44.020 --> 11:49.020\nI was in the East Bay and I read Dave's book.\n\n11:49.020 --> 11:54.020\nAnd it did quite a lot for me in terms of his honesty.\n\n11:54.020 --> 11:58.020\nAnd what I found so amazing about today is that two of my favorite things came together\n\n11:58.020 --> 12:03.020\nand that I think you and Dave actually share the same host mentality of pure honesty.\n\n12:03.020 --> 12:04.020\nBut I'm better than him.\n\n12:04.020 --> 12:05.020\nYes.\n\n12:05.020 --> 12:06.020\nI'm assuming.\n\n12:06.020 --> 12:07.020\nOf course.\n\n12:07.020 --> 12:08.020\nOkay, all right.\n\n12:08.020 --> 12:09.020\nIt's not important.\n\n12:09.020 --> 12:10.020\nI don't know.\n\n12:10.020 --> 12:11.020\nI mean, through his scales.\n\n12:11.020 --> 12:12.020\nYou're assuming.\n\n12:12.020 --> 12:13.020\nYeah.\n\n12:13.020 --> 12:16.020\nAnd yeah, I just signed for a class online.\n\n12:16.020 --> 12:19.020\nI took a summer course with him for, I think, 12 weeks.\n\n12:19.020 --> 12:21.020\nAnd yeah, it was an amazing experience.\n\n12:21.020 --> 12:25.020\nDave in contact and it's helped me for the last decade.\n\n12:25.020 --> 12:29.020\nSo since the last decade, I mean, thousands of students have been helped\n\n12:29.020 --> 12:35.020\nreading, writing, tutoring, some famous celebrities help out kids that they don't need to.\n\n12:35.020 --> 12:36.020\nYou know, they're not paid to do so.\n\n12:36.020 --> 12:38.020\nSpike Jonze helps out a lot.\n\n12:38.020 --> 12:41.020\nNina Ve and many, many people in the writing circles.\n\n12:41.020 --> 12:47.020\nIf you go in there and tutor a kid, like my biggest dream is like to do something that I felt like I could,\n\n12:47.020 --> 12:52.020\nyou know, I want to feel good about myself.\n\n12:52.020 --> 12:57.020\nAnd yet I don't want to talk to people.\n\n12:57.020 --> 12:59.020\nI don't want to go near people.\n\n12:59.020 --> 13:05.020\nI don't want to help a kid.\n\n13:05.020 --> 13:07.020\nNot really.\n\n13:07.020 --> 13:10.020\nNot in a physical sense.\n\n13:10.020 --> 13:13.020\nThe kids like, I need help.\n\n13:13.020 --> 13:16.020\nCheckbook.\n\n13:16.020 --> 13:18.020\nI want to.\n\n13:18.020 --> 13:19.020\nI want to.\n\n13:19.020 --> 13:22.020\nYou want to not help a kid.\n\n13:22.020 --> 13:23.020\nI don't want to.\n\n13:23.020 --> 13:31.020\nWhat I don't want to do is tell the kid, like, is help a kid that would be me at 11, 12.\n\n13:31.020 --> 13:36.020\nLike, the kid that would be me would be like, fuck you, old piece of shit.\n\n13:36.020 --> 13:41.020\nLike, why am I, I want to go play my Commodore 64 at home.\n\n13:41.020 --> 13:43.020\nAnd I'm sure that's not still a problem.\n\n13:43.020 --> 13:44.020\nNo.\n\n13:44.020 --> 13:46.020\nI'm sure they've grown beyond that.\n\n13:46.020 --> 13:49.020\nWe've solved the Commodore 64 problem.\n\n13:49.020 --> 13:51.020\nThank God.\n\n13:51.020 --> 13:54.020\nIs there an archetypal kid that you would want to help?\n\n13:54.020 --> 13:56.020\nLike, if you could imagine the kind of kid that you would.\n\n13:56.020 --> 13:57.020\nIt's the kid.\n\n13:57.020 --> 13:58.020\nIt's me.\n\n13:58.020 --> 14:00.020\nBut it's the same kid that would be hard to help.\n\n14:00.020 --> 14:02.020\nThis dirty face little piece of shit.\n\n14:02.020 --> 14:06.020\nAnybody, let alone anybody that was telling him what to do.\n\n14:06.020 --> 14:11.020\nI grew up, like, hating adults, not wanting anybody to tell me what to do.\n\n14:11.020 --> 14:13.020\nI needed somebody to.\n\n14:13.020 --> 14:20.020\nI valued very much my parents when telling me my mom was unconditionally supportive of\n\n14:20.020 --> 14:21.020\nme creatively.\n\n14:21.020 --> 14:27.020\nLike, if I did anything, my mom was like, holy shit, that's amazing that you're doing that.\n\n14:27.020 --> 14:31.020\nI don't think that's something a lot of people have.\n\n14:31.020 --> 14:36.020\nBut at school, if somebody told me what to do, like, fuck you.\n\n14:36.020 --> 14:37.020\nLike karate chop.\n\n14:37.020 --> 14:40.020\nLike, every mental karate chop ever.\n\n14:40.020 --> 14:46.020\nAnyway, so what have you, since you were a beneficiary of this, have you become a benefactor of\n\n14:46.020 --> 14:52.020\nit, aside from the fact that you came to the sale today and spend untold millions?\n\n14:52.020 --> 14:57.020\nOh yes, it wasn't noted, but you're welcome for all the cake.\n\n14:57.020 --> 15:01.020\nHave you become active in the...\n\n15:01.020 --> 15:06.020\nSadly, I moved away from the country for a couple years, and even now I don't live\n\n15:06.020 --> 15:07.020\nnearby.\n\n15:07.020 --> 15:08.020\nYou went to Russia, didn't you?\n\n15:08.020 --> 15:12.020\nBecause you got taught to be a communist by this horrible socialist organization.\n\n15:12.020 --> 15:16.020\nI went to the first world, the second world, and now I'm in the third world, technically.\n\n15:16.020 --> 15:17.020\nSo that's what happens.\n\n15:17.020 --> 15:21.020\nBut no, no, even for what you were noting, if you don't necessarily want to be in front\n\n15:21.020 --> 15:25.020\nof a child and tell them what to do, I mean, the thing that...\n\n15:25.020 --> 15:26.020\nI can understand it.\n\n15:26.020 --> 15:28.020\nIt's a very odd situation.\n\n15:28.020 --> 15:30.020\nThey're frightening people, children.\n\n15:30.020 --> 15:31.020\nOh yeah.\n\n15:31.020 --> 15:36.020\nI mean, the thing that actually inspired me the most is that on the walls, at least in\n\n15:36.020 --> 15:42.020\nSan Francisco, writers would donate their first, second, and third versions of scripts\n\n15:42.020 --> 15:48.020\nor books, and you would see famous names like Coppola on his script, and he would just\n\n15:48.020 --> 15:52.020\naxe out huge portions of it, and it was supposed to instill in kids this idea that even some\n\n15:52.020 --> 15:55.020\nof these luminaries do not get it right.\n\n15:55.020 --> 15:56.020\nYou were always working.\n\n15:56.020 --> 15:57.020\nThat's cool.\n\n15:57.020 --> 15:58.020\nIt doesn't matter what your name is.\n\n15:58.020 --> 15:59.020\nAnd I never met any of these people.\n\n15:59.020 --> 16:03.020\nYou could just walk up and see someone's name that you knew, and you realized that it's\n\n16:03.020 --> 16:05.020\nnot always right the first time.\n\n16:05.020 --> 16:06.020\nYeah, yeah.\n\n16:06.020 --> 16:07.020\nI would love to...\n\n16:07.020 --> 16:08.020\nYeah.\n\n16:08.020 --> 16:09.020\nGod damn it.\n\n16:09.020 --> 16:13.020\nAs long as I don't have to touch them or look them in the eye, I will...\n\n16:13.020 --> 16:15.020\nWhy are you afraid of children?\n\n16:15.020 --> 16:17.020\nI can't do it.\n\n16:17.020 --> 16:19.020\nKids don't like me.\n\n16:19.020 --> 16:20.020\nSome kids like me...\n\n16:20.020 --> 16:22.020\nDo you know that?\n\n16:22.020 --> 16:26.020\nIt's really touch and go with me.\n\n16:26.020 --> 16:32.020\nDino's kid, when she was a little larva...\n\n16:32.020 --> 16:33.020\nToddler.\n\n16:33.020 --> 16:35.020\nI could...\n\n16:35.020 --> 16:36.020\nI would go like...\n\n16:36.020 --> 16:37.020\nI would go like...\n\n16:37.020 --> 16:41.020\nMr. Flappy Arms, Mr. Flappy Arms, and she'd be like...\n\n16:41.020 --> 16:45.020\nShe loved it.\n\n16:45.020 --> 16:49.020\nAnd now she's like 15 or something, and she's got the cell phone, and she's just rolling\n\n16:49.020 --> 16:52.020\nher eyes, and I can't even...\n\n16:52.020 --> 16:56.020\nYou're afraid of 13-year-old Dino's daughter right now?\n\n16:56.020 --> 16:59.020\nKids who are really actually cognitively active.\n\n16:59.020 --> 17:05.020\nBut why is a kid more or less frightening than an adult?\n\n17:05.020 --> 17:08.020\nBecause they're able to judge me.\n\n17:08.020 --> 17:10.020\nWell, adults are too, right?\n\n17:10.020 --> 17:12.020\nWell, yeah.\n\n17:12.020 --> 17:15.020\nBut adults are co-opted by me financially.\n\n17:15.020 --> 17:19.020\nI own all of them.\n\n17:19.020 --> 17:21.020\nMost kids don't have a filter.\n\n17:21.020 --> 17:24.020\nSo you're afraid of children because you don't own them yet?\n\n17:24.020 --> 17:25.020\nCorrect.\n\n17:25.020 --> 17:26.020\nYes.\n\n17:26.020 --> 17:29.020\nLike, Willy Wonka works for me.\n\n17:29.020 --> 17:33.020\nThe girl that turns into a blueberry, she's still got something over me because she doesn't\n\n17:33.020 --> 17:36.020\nunderstand finance yet.\n\n17:36.020 --> 17:39.020\nI'm figuring this out at the same time as you are.\n\n17:39.020 --> 17:40.020\nI guess that's what it is.\n\n17:40.020 --> 17:44.020\nI think we're going to agree that we haven't figured that we're not yet.\n\n17:44.020 --> 17:46.020\nI skipped a step.\n\n17:46.020 --> 17:50.020\nI skipped being good at football and went right to owning things.\n\n17:50.020 --> 17:53.020\nBut we've talked about the fact that you're not good with...\n\n17:53.020 --> 17:57.020\nYou're not comfortable around strangers or other people for that matter,\n\n17:57.020 --> 18:01.020\nbut are children more frightening than adults?\n\n18:01.020 --> 18:02.020\nTeenage children.\n\n18:02.020 --> 18:03.020\nYeah.\n\n18:03.020 --> 18:05.020\nI don't think there's anybody in this room that's like,\n\n18:05.020 --> 18:07.020\nI love teenagers.\n\n18:07.020 --> 18:10.020\nExcept in the most horrible sense.\n\n18:10.020 --> 18:12.020\nThere's eight.\n\n18:12.020 --> 18:15.020\nThat guy, that guy.\n\n18:15.020 --> 18:20.020\nBut I mean, like, teenagers are, for a good reason.\n\n18:20.020 --> 18:25.020\nWe send them to war and we worship them.\n\n18:25.020 --> 18:29.020\nAnd we are looking to them and they don't know anything.\n\n18:29.020 --> 18:31.020\nThey're like this monolith of energy.\n\n18:31.020 --> 18:33.020\nEverything comes off of them.\n\n18:33.020 --> 18:35.020\nAnd they don't know what the fuck they're doing.\n\n18:35.020 --> 18:39.020\nCapitalism almost like really fucks them over in that sense.\n\n18:39.020 --> 18:45.020\nThe baby boomers celebrate that day when the fucking Beatles played on Ed Sullivan or whatever.\n\n18:45.020 --> 18:46.020\nThat's their big day.\n\n18:46.020 --> 18:48.020\nBigger than the moon landing.\n\n18:48.020 --> 18:51.020\nYou see more footage of the fucking Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan\n\n18:51.020 --> 18:53.020\nthan you see of some yahoo landing on the moon.\n\n18:53.020 --> 18:55.020\nFucking moon is a fucking thing.\n\n18:55.020 --> 18:57.020\nA rock far away.\n\n18:57.020 --> 19:03.020\nHow many times like Robert Zemeckis thinks that the Beatles playing on Ed Sullivan is a bigger deal.\n\n19:08.020 --> 19:11.020\nForrest Gump, if you read the book,\n\n19:11.020 --> 19:14.020\nit has a whole chapter where he goes to the moon, by the way.\n\n19:14.020 --> 19:15.020\nWhat?\n\n19:15.020 --> 19:18.020\nThey took it out of the movie.\n\n19:18.020 --> 19:19.020\nNo.\n\n19:19.020 --> 19:22.020\nBecause it's not interesting to baby boomers.\n\n19:22.020 --> 19:23.020\nThere's no book.\n\n19:23.020 --> 19:25.020\nThey will mention it passing that they landed on the moon.\n\n19:25.020 --> 19:26.020\nThere's no book.\n\n19:26.020 --> 19:27.020\nForrest Gump is a fucking book.\n\n19:27.020 --> 19:28.020\nAre you kidding me?\n\n19:28.020 --> 19:29.020\nIs it a book?\n\n19:29.020 --> 19:31.020\nSomebody tell this asshole, Forrest Gump is a book.\n\n19:31.020 --> 19:34.020\nForrest Gump is a book, motherfucker!\n\n19:34.020 --> 19:37.020\nSorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n19:37.020 --> 19:39.020\nYes, Forrest Gump was a book.\n\n19:39.020 --> 19:41.020\nAnd in the book, for-\n\n19:41.020 --> 19:42.020\nHe goes to the moon?\n\n19:42.020 --> 19:43.020\nYes.\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:44.020\nForrest Gump-\n\n19:44.020 --> 19:45.020\nIn the moon.\n\n19:45.020 --> 19:47.020\nIn the Forrest Gump book.\n\n19:47.020 --> 19:50.020\nForrest Gump is legitimately like down syndrome.\n\n19:50.020 --> 19:51.020\nNo.\n\n19:51.020 --> 19:54.020\nWhat do you mean no?\n\n19:54.020 --> 19:56.020\nThree people said no.\n\n19:56.020 --> 19:58.020\nWell, okay.\n\n19:58.020 --> 20:01.020\nForrest Gump is pretty much labeled as legitimately.\n\n20:01.020 --> 20:06.020\nIt's pretty clear that he is like really low 90s IQ.\n\n20:06.020 --> 20:11.020\nLike he's like sub-Belushi.\n\n20:11.020 --> 20:14.020\nLike this.\n\n20:14.020 --> 20:19.020\nI don't know what the politically correct term is.\n\n20:19.020 --> 20:20.020\nSub-Belushi.\n\n20:20.020 --> 20:23.020\nThe book takes you through all of the interesting shit.\n\n20:23.020 --> 20:26.020\nHe throws his medal, the congressional medal, the thing.\n\n20:26.020 --> 20:29.020\nIn the book, for instance, he takes his purple heart\n\n20:29.020 --> 20:33.020\nand he throws it on the steps of the Capitol building\n\n20:33.020 --> 20:36.020\nand he hits a senator in the head.\n\n20:36.020 --> 20:40.020\nThat senator's name?\n\n20:40.020 --> 20:42.020\nForrest Gump.\n\n20:42.020 --> 20:46.020\nI'm saying in the book, it's more inflammatory.\n\n20:46.020 --> 20:47.020\nIt's more passionate.\n\n20:47.020 --> 20:50.020\nIt's like Cormac McCarthy, like the version of Forrest Gump.\n\n20:50.020 --> 20:51.020\nDid you read this book?\n\n20:51.020 --> 20:52.020\nYes, I did.\n\n20:52.020 --> 20:53.020\nI thought you didn't read books.\n\n20:53.020 --> 20:56.020\nI know, but sometimes I just grab one and just leave through it.\n\n20:56.020 --> 20:59.020\nThe one book you read was Forrest Gump.\n\n20:59.020 --> 21:01.020\nI'll page through them.\n\n21:01.020 --> 21:03.020\nI don't qualify it as reading.\n\n21:03.020 --> 21:06.020\nI just think, okay.\n\n21:06.020 --> 21:07.020\nI read Forrest Gump.\n\n21:07.020 --> 21:09.020\nHe goes into space in the book.\n\n21:09.020 --> 21:11.020\nI don't want to spend the whole podcast.\n\n21:11.020 --> 21:14.020\nI swear to God.\n\n21:14.020 --> 21:15.020\nGoogle it.\n\n21:15.020 --> 21:16.020\nHe goes to space.\n\n21:16.020 --> 21:17.020\nHere's my point.\n\n21:17.020 --> 21:20.020\nThe baby boomers who took over this planet\n\n21:20.020 --> 21:23.020\nand who are bulging it with garbage and corn syrup\n\n21:23.020 --> 21:27.020\nand fucking these narcissistic maniacs,\n\n21:27.020 --> 21:29.020\nthese people who've destroyed everything\n\n21:29.020 --> 21:32.020\nand who are telling us that we should be honored to follow\n\n21:32.020 --> 21:35.020\nin their footsteps, they landed on the moon.\n\n21:35.020 --> 21:36.020\nThey always tell us that.\n\n21:36.020 --> 21:39.020\nBut what they're really, really proud of is like,\n\n21:39.020 --> 21:40.020\nfucking Ed Sullivan show.\n\n21:40.020 --> 21:41.020\nHe loves you.\n\n21:41.020 --> 21:42.020\nYeah.\n\n21:42.020 --> 21:43.020\nYeah.\n\n21:43.020 --> 21:44.020\nYeah.\n\n21:44.020 --> 21:45.020\nGarbage.\n\n21:45.020 --> 21:47.020\nGarbage, garbage, garbage, garbage.\n\n21:47.020 --> 21:51.020\nI can't remember why we were on this topic.\n\n21:51.020 --> 21:52.020\nYou hate teenagers.\n\n21:52.020 --> 21:53.020\nYeah.\n\n21:53.020 --> 21:54.020\nWe were trying to help the teenagers.\n\n21:54.020 --> 21:55.020\nTeenagers.\n\n21:55.020 --> 21:56.020\nOkay.\n\n21:56.020 --> 22:01.020\nThe idea that teenagers are an entity.\n\n22:01.020 --> 22:05.020\nThe idea that teenagers in spite of not being old enough\n\n22:05.020 --> 22:07.020\nto go to war, not being old enough to drink,\n\n22:07.020 --> 22:09.020\nnot being old enough to drive a car,\n\n22:09.020 --> 22:13.020\nare somehow this center of capitalism.\n\n22:13.020 --> 22:17.020\nThat is a baby boomer invention because they were that age\n\n22:17.020 --> 22:19.020\nwhen they became sentient.\n\n22:19.020 --> 22:23.020\nAnd we are living in the shadow of that fucking gross willow tree.\n\n22:23.020 --> 22:26.020\nAnd that results in all of us going on YouTube,\n\n22:26.020 --> 22:31.020\n48-year-old people telling Miley Cyrus that she's a slut\n\n22:31.020 --> 22:32.020\nin the comment section.\n\n22:32.020 --> 22:35.020\nLike, let her be a slut.\n\n22:35.020 --> 22:37.020\nWhat the fuck did she do wrong?\n\n22:37.020 --> 22:38.020\nShe's a fucking teenager.\n\n22:38.020 --> 22:40.020\nLet her be a teenager either,\n\n22:40.020 --> 22:42.020\nand fucking Justin Bieber.\n\n22:42.020 --> 22:43.020\nI'm on his side.\n\n22:43.020 --> 22:45.020\nI'm still on his side.\n\n22:45.020 --> 22:46.020\nNo.\n\n22:46.020 --> 22:48.020\nI'm still pro-Beber.\n\n22:48.020 --> 22:49.020\nNo.\n\n22:49.020 --> 22:50.020\nWhy are you pro-Beber?\n\n22:50.020 --> 22:51.020\nI'm a believer.\n\n22:51.020 --> 22:52.020\nHe's a little

And the cover, it's just like this two column list of people.\n\n33:43.020 --> 33:49.020\nAnd I swear to God, every single person on that list is you can, you can let it go.\n\n33:49.020 --> 33:53.020\nAnd then just like right in the middle of it, it says Sinbad.\n\n33:53.020 --> 33:56.020\nAnd I, and I was like, that's kind of funny.\n\n33:56.020 --> 34:00.020\nIt kind of makes Sinbad feel like a contest winner, like after all this time.\n\n34:00.020 --> 34:05.020\nI took a, took an Instagram picture of it and I was like, I was going to make this tweet where I'm like,\n\n34:05.020 --> 34:09.020\nI don't know, my tweet was going to be like, eh, fuck Sinbad.\n\n34:09.020 --> 34:12.020\nYou know, let's just sum it up like that.\n\n34:12.020 --> 34:14.020\nAnd I went and sat over there, there was a chair there.\n\n34:14.020 --> 34:17.020\nIt was one of my chairs that hadn't been sold yet.\n\n34:17.020 --> 34:25.020\nAnd I sat there in the chair and I started to engineer this Instagram slash tweet.\n\n34:25.020 --> 34:33.020\nAnd I was about to fire off and this wave came over me that we all call deja vu,\n\n34:33.020 --> 34:39.020\nwhich I wanted to talk about a little bit because I suddenly had this incredible sense.\n\n34:39.020 --> 34:42.020\nSometimes you get deja vu where you're kind of standing in a kitchen and like,\n\n34:42.020 --> 34:44.020\nI get swear I had this conversation before.\n\n34:44.020 --> 34:48.020\nI had a huge one today. I had a deja vu that went on for like, like three minutes to seem like,\n\n34:48.020 --> 34:50.020\nlike I get deja vu a lot.\n\n34:50.020 --> 34:55.020\nI was filled with like, like you get, you get little ones where you're like,\n\n34:55.020 --> 35:03.020\neh, I feel like I've been in this kitchen talking to this hipster about the fact that the government's bullshit.\n\n35:03.020 --> 35:05.020\nLike, how do you know that that didn't happen already?\n\n35:05.020 --> 35:07.020\nI mean, you've been high for two weeks.\n\n35:07.020 --> 35:09.020\nLike, it probably did happen.\n\n35:09.020 --> 35:16.020\nI was sitting in this chair in this weird, like everything was so, such a freaky thing.\n\n35:16.020 --> 35:23.020\nThe concept of deja vu, I'm not a spiritually, I'm a spiritual person.\n\n35:23.020 --> 35:27.020\nI believe in like, some kind of relationship with the unknown.\n\n35:27.020 --> 35:29.020\nI choose to personify the unknown.\n\n35:29.020 --> 35:32.020\nI choose to have a relationship with the things I don't understand.\n\n35:32.020 --> 35:36.020\nOtherwise, I'm going to go into a McDonald's with a machine gun.\n\n35:36.020 --> 35:41.020\nBut that's something I choose and it doesn't, that has nothing to do with evidence.\n\n35:41.020 --> 35:43.020\nI'm not Fox Mulder.\n\n35:43.020 --> 35:45.020\nI choose precisely the opposite reason.\n\n35:45.020 --> 35:50.020\nWe will use this particular episode of this podcast as evidence when you do kill people.\n\n35:50.020 --> 35:52.020\nGo ahead, I'll be dead.\n\n35:52.020 --> 35:59.020\nI mean, I guarantee you, when I kill all of you, I'm going to do it in a way that takes me out too.\n\n35:59.020 --> 36:02.020\nThank you.\n\n36:02.020 --> 36:06.020\nI have more respect than my predecessors.\n\n36:06.020 --> 36:08.020\nWeird signature for it, but all right.\n\n36:08.020 --> 36:13.020\nThey know, they're like, I want to be killed by a guy who has the balls to kill himself.\n\n36:13.020 --> 36:16.020\nI respect that.\n\n36:16.020 --> 36:19.020\nToo soon?\n\n36:19.020 --> 36:21.020\nToo close?\n\n36:21.020 --> 36:23.020\nToo far?\n\n36:23.020 --> 36:25.020\nToo...\n\n36:25.020 --> 36:27.020\nPossible?\n\n36:27.020 --> 36:29.020\nToo something.\n\n36:29.020 --> 36:31.020\nToo plausible.\n\n36:31.020 --> 36:35.020\nSpeaking of two everything, Anatoly is wearing a Christmas wreath in his head.\n\n36:35.020 --> 36:38.020\nThere's a young lady behind you.\n\n36:38.020 --> 36:40.020\nI guess she can see me.\n\n36:40.020 --> 36:45.020\nLike I said earlier, he's dressed as Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream for some reason.\n\n36:45.020 --> 36:51.020\nHe's dressed as Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream in Dead Poets Society.\n\n36:51.020 --> 36:53.020\nThe kid who killed himself.\n\n36:53.020 --> 36:57.020\nOh, Neil! Oh, Neil! My boy!\n\n36:57.020 --> 37:00.020\nCan you fly, Bobby?\n\n37:00.020 --> 37:05.020\nKurt Woodsmith, shout outs.\n\n37:05.020 --> 37:07.020\nAll right, anyways.\n\n37:07.020 --> 37:09.020\nWhat was I talking about?\n\n37:09.020 --> 37:11.020\nI don't know. I'm not killing everybody.\n\n37:11.020 --> 37:13.020\nDeja vu.\n\n37:13.020 --> 37:18.020\nI wasn't going to drink, but I'm going to crack up in this Raphael's...\n\n37:18.020 --> 37:20.020\nI could have sworn to God.\n\n37:20.020 --> 37:23.020\nOkay, this is just like...\n\n37:25.020 --> 37:34.020\nI was filled with the sensation that if I had clicked send or tweaked or whatever the button says,\n\n37:34.020 --> 37:38.020\nokay, you gotcha.\n\n37:38.020 --> 37:40.020\nYou gotcha.\n\n37:40.020 --> 37:42.020\nGoPro, whatever it says.\n\n37:42.020 --> 37:44.020\nTeddy Bear, I don't know what...\n\n37:44.020 --> 37:47.020\nAre you on a Samsung?\n\n37:47.020 --> 37:50.020\nYou see Samsung?\n\n37:50.020 --> 37:52.020\nYou gotcha Samsung, right?\n\n37:52.020 --> 37:54.020\nYou gotcha Samsung. That's what the button says.\n\n37:54.020 --> 37:57.020\nYou gotcha.\n\n37:57.020 --> 38:01.020\nI was absolutely convinced that if I did it, I was going to die.\n\n38:01.020 --> 38:04.020\nAnd I didn't do it.\n\n38:04.020 --> 38:08.020\nThere's no note. You don't have to clap.\n\n38:08.020 --> 38:10.020\nBecause you're having deja vu?\n\n38:10.020 --> 38:12.020\nBecause the deja vu was that convincing.\n\n38:12.020 --> 38:18.020\nI was actually that convinced that I was living in some weird nexus of time and space.\n\n38:18.020 --> 38:22.020\nAnd then part of my memory of sitting...\n\n38:22.020 --> 38:25.020\nI was sitting there, and I was looking this way,\n\n38:25.020 --> 38:29.020\nand I was looking at an image of a bunch of weird shit on a table.\n\n38:29.020 --> 38:33.020\nThat was like a weird grad sale thing, and I was looking at a tweet that I was about to click send on.\n\n38:33.020 --> 38:35.020\nAnd I had this sudden sense...\n\n38:35.020 --> 38:44.020\nI had this memory of like a dream that I had when I was a kid of that image.\n\n38:44.020 --> 38:47.020\nWhich I didn't understand at the time.\n\n38:47.020 --> 38:49.020\nBecause obviously there was no...\n\n38:49.020 --> 38:51.020\nThis space didn't exist.\n\n38:51.020 --> 39:00.020\nSo I was remembering a memory that I remembered having when I was younger of this same space.\n\n39:00.020 --> 39:04.020\nBut I also remembered not understanding what any of it meant.\n\n39:04.020 --> 39:12.020\nBut I also remembered that I was about to click send on something on this device in my hand.\n\n39:12.020 --> 39:18.020\nWhich in my memory didn't make any sense because it didn't exist in my childhood.\n\n39:18.020 --> 39:22.020\nBut that when I clicked send, I was going to die.\n\n39:22.020 --> 39:26.020\nSo I didn't click send.\n\n39:26.020 --> 39:32.020\nSo the question is, is Sinbad's publicist God?\n\n39:32.020 --> 39:37.020\nWhich would explain his presence on the cover of that book.\n\n39:37.020 --> 39:40.020\nI think Sinbad is a universal context.\n\n39:40.020 --> 39:44.020\nI used to have deja vu twice a day every day for a long time.\n\n39:44.020 --> 39:46.020\nAnd deja vu is the one that went on for a long, long time.\n\n39:46.020 --> 39:50.020\nI tried to look into it, and I've heard it explained that it's an iron deficiency.\n\n39:50.020 --> 39:52.020\nIt's a...\n\n39:52.020 --> 39:54.020\nSo I need to eat more iron?\n\n39:54.020 --> 39:56.020\nMore spinach and shit.\n\n39:56.020 --> 39:57.020\nSpinach?\n\n39:57.020 --> 40:05.020\nAlthough spinach, the reason why people think spinach is iron heavy, it was a typo.\n\n40:05.020 --> 40:09.020\nIt was supposed to be spinach.\n\n40:09.020 --> 40:14.020\nThere was something like... I don't know what year it was, but there was something where...\n\n40:14.020 --> 40:21.020\nEarly days of the FDA, but before that, they typed up how much iron spinach had in it.\n\n40:21.020 --> 40:29.020\nAnd there was a typo of a decimal point, and it made it seem like spinach had a zillions of iron.\n\n40:29.020 --> 40:30.020\nIt doesn't.\n\n40:30.020 --> 40:32.020\nIt doesn't have more iron than most green vegetables.\n\n40:32.020 --> 40:38.020\nIt was just a typo and a thing, but that got lots of press, and that's why they ate lots of spinach.\n\n40:38.020 --> 40:41.020\nBut back to my point.\n\n40:41.020 --> 40:45.020\nIt was explained to me that deja vu is because I have so many of them.\n\n40:45.020 --> 40:49.020\nWhen I have them, I've been here, and I can predict the future.\n\n40:49.020 --> 40:51.020\nThe guy is going to walk in.\n\n40:51.020 --> 40:53.020\nOh, shit, there's the guy.\n\n40:53.020 --> 40:57.020\nYou're seeing a guy walk in, but your synapses are firing twice.\n\n40:57.020 --> 40:59.020\nIt's like a hiccup.\n\n40:59.020 --> 41:01.020\nSo it feels like your brain is falling.\n\n41:01.020 --> 41:02.020\nBut here's the fucking...\n\n41:02.020 --> 41:08.020\nBut when the synapse fires the second time, it's sensing it for the first time, and the first time it happens,\n\n41:08.020 --> 41:12.020\nit's been stored as subconscious memory, which doesn't have a date stamp on it.\n\n41:12.020 --> 41:13.020\nThat's the crate! That's it!\n\n41:13.020 --> 41:15.020\nThat's what happened.\n\n41:15.020 --> 41:18.020\nIt felt like I was eight years old and dreamt it.\n\n41:18.020 --> 41:23.020\nYou're going into a drawer in your subconscious mind that has no date stamp.\n\n41:23.020 --> 41:29.020\nIt's just this weird grab bag of stuff that it feels like a dream, a childhood memory.\n\n41:29.020 --> 41:34.020\nIt happened a split second before, or a nanosecond.\n\n41:34.020 --> 41:39.020\nSo your entire life is like your mom's rubber stamp collection.\n\n41:39.020 --> 41:41.020\nTell me more about this.\n\n41:43.020 --> 41:45.020\nMy mom collects rubber stamps.\n\n41:45.020 --> 41:47.020\nShe's got a snowflake for Christmas.\n\n41:47.020 --> 41:51.020\nShe can bring it out every Christmas, but if she chooses to, she can bring it out for Mother's Day.\n\n41:51.020 --> 41:52.020\nShe doesn't give a fuck.\n\n41:52.020 --> 41:54.020\nIt's whatever you dip into ink.\n\n41:54.020 --> 41:56.020\nIt's just like fucking stamps.\n\n41:56.020 --> 41:58.020\nYour brain has stamps, and it just goes...\n\n41:58.020 --> 42:02.020\nYou used a royal Wii on that one.\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:04.020\nOkay, my mom's crazy.\n\n42:04.020 --> 42:06.020\nIt has a rubber stamp collection.\n\n42:06.020 --> 42:08.020\nI'm saying your brain is fucking...\n\n42:08.020 --> 42:09.020\nIt's origami.\n\n42:09.020 --> 42:11.020\nIt can fold in on itself.\n\n42:11.020 --> 42:16.020\nOur perception of reality is based on, oh, this happened, and then this happened.\n\n42:16.020 --> 42:22.020\nBut we, in those fleeting moments, we can feel like something happened an indeterminate time ago.\n\n42:22.020 --> 42:25.020\nAnd if you killed somebody...\n\n42:25.020 --> 42:27.020\nHere we go again.\n\n42:27.020 --> 42:33.020\nIf you killed somebody, and then someone came up behind you and hit you in the head with a shovel,\n\n42:33.020 --> 42:37.020\nand then you woke up in a hospital bed, and no one...\n\n42:37.020 --> 42:41.020\nSomehow the person you killed tumbled out a ditch, and they fell into a tar pit,\n\n42:41.020 --> 42:46.020\nand they sank, and they didn't have family, and no one cared.\n\n42:46.020 --> 42:48.020\nLet's just say...\n\n42:48.020 --> 42:53.020\nThey were a babysitter that you got on Craigslist, and you looked into it,\n\n42:53.020 --> 42:56.020\nand no one knew she was at your house.\n\n42:56.020 --> 42:59.020\nAnd you were in the Lower Bray area, and it's filled with tar.\n\n42:59.020 --> 43:02.020\nNo, I'm doing a bit on the side.\n\n43:02.020 --> 43:04.020\nAre you planning a murder?\n\n43:04.020 --> 43:07.020\nI'm saying theoretically, you hit someone in the head with a shovel,\n\n43:07.020 --> 43:10.020\nthey tumbled down a pit, into a tar pit, they sink down.\n\n43:10.020 --> 43:15.020\nAnd you, at the same time, your friend comes up behind you and goes like...\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:17.020\nWhat are you doing?\n\n43:17.020 --> 43:21.020\nYou're missing the party!\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:28.020\nAnd they've got such a static charge on their feet that when they touch your shoulder, you get amnesia.\n\n43:28.020 --> 43:33.020\nThis is a theoretical construct for the purposes of an existential...\n\n43:33.020 --> 43:37.020\nDo you understand if a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it?\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:41.020\nI'm saying one of these things.\n\n43:41.020 --> 43:45.020\nThis is all in Forrest Gump's book, right?\n\n43:45.020 --> 43:50.020\nSo you wake up in a hospital, you don't remember this person who fell into a tar pit.\n\n43:50.020 --> 43:51.020\nNo one else does.\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:52.020\nThat you killed.\n\n43:52.020 --> 43:54.020\nYou never remember that you did it.\n\n43:54.020 --> 43:56.020\nWhy? Because the guys...\n\n43:56.020 --> 43:58.020\nBecause your brain stopped working.\n\n43:58.020 --> 44:01.020\nBecause of the static amnesia.\n\n44:01.020 --> 44:09.020\nDo I really have to be such a sci-fi wizard that I have to construct a device, a helmet that comes over your head?\n\n44:09.020 --> 44:16.020\nI'm saying if you don't remember, and while you're not remembering, that person stops existing,\n\n44:16.020 --> 44:22.020\nso you don't remember yourself, so you wake up in a world where you killed this person,\n\n44:22.020 --> 44:26.020\nbut you don't remember that you did it and no one ever knows that you did it.\n\n44:26.020 --> 44:31.020\nDid you just walk around, you're at the water cooler, like, hey, Gladys?\n\n44:31.020 --> 44:33.020\nWhoa, how about those Packers?\n\n44:33.020 --> 44:34.020\nDon't go there!\n\n44:34.020 --> 44:36.020\nAnd you're, like, getting mad, too?\n\n44:36.020 --> 44:38.020\nYou would be getting mad about, like, someone would go,\n\n44:38.020 --> 44:43.020\nhey, did you hear Steve cheated on the billiards pool or whatever the fucking office,\n\n44:43.020 --> 44:45.020\nI don't know what these office people are talking about.\n\n44:45.020 --> 44:47.020\nYou'd be like, he did what?\n\n44:47.020 --> 44:49.020\nHe, whoa, that's not fucking cool.\n\n44:49.020 --> 44:50.020\nHe shouldn't do that.\n\n44:50.020 --> 44:52.020\nLike, you'd be mad.\n\n44:52.020 --> 44:53.020\nI'm mad.\n\n44:53.020 --> 44:55.020\nI have no idea what's going on.\n\n44:55.020 --> 44:58.020\nIt's just, this is the human condition.\n\n44:58.020 --> 45:00.020\nIf you don't remember, where's this guy going?\n\n45:00.020 --> 45:02.020\nHe's going to take that bad of shit.\n\n45:02.020 --> 45:03.020\nAlright, that's fine.\n\n45:03.020 --> 45:05.020\nI don't mean to shame you, I'm not trying to shame you.\n\n45:05.020 --> 45:07.020\nI met this woman now, her name is Alice Flatterty.\n\n45:07.020 --> 45:11.020\nShe's a famous, crazy doctor from Harvard.\n\n45:11.020 --> 45:13.020\nFrom made-up name world.\n\n45:13.020 --> 45:15.020\nAlice Flatterty.\n\n45:15.020 --> 45:17.020\nAlice Flatterty.\n\n45:17.020 --> 45:19.020\nYou can look her up and she's a...\n\n45:19.020 --> 45:21.020\nOkay, let's all look her up.\n\n45:21.020 --> 45:22.020\nAlice Flatterty.\n\n45:22.020 --> 45:25.020\nHarvard, I think she's the chief chair of neurology there,\n\n45:25.020 --> 45:26.020\nand she teaches at Harvard.\n\n45:26.020 --> 45:29.020\nShe's the head of neurology at Boston General, I think.\n\n45:29.020 --> 45:32.020\nAnd I met her and she's a little, like, tiny little gal,\n\n45:32.020 --> 45:33.020\nand she walks on the tip of her toes,\n\n45:33.020 --> 45:35.020\nand she's hyper-graphic, and she writes down\n\n45:35.020 --> 45:37.020\neverything she thinks about.\n\n45:37.020 --> 45:40.020\nLike, I've read about her, and I met her,\n\n45:40.020 --> 45:42.020\nand I said something about, like,\n\n45:42.020 --> 45:45.020\nI was telling some story, and she wrote it down on her arm,\n\n45:45.020 --> 45:47.020\nand I said, will you pull up your sleeve?\n\n45:47.020 --> 45:49.020\nAnd she was like, really?\n\n45:49.020 --> 45:51.020\nShe pulled her sleeve up, and she had writing\n\n45:51.020 --> 45:54.020\nall up her arm, and she's hyper-graphic.\n\n45:54.020 --> 45:56.020\nShe has crayons, like, a certain kind of crayon\n\n45:56.020 --> 45:58.020\nthat she can write in the shower.\n\n45:58.020 --> 46:01.020\nHer shower in her place is nothing but writing,\n\n46:01.020 --> 46:04.020\nand her ceilings in her house,\n\n46:04.020 --> 46:07.020\na bunch of bulletin boards hung, like, next to each other,\n\n46:07.020 --> 46:09.020\nso she can put, like, post-it notes on it\n\n46:09.020 --> 46:11.020\nto create more surface area.\n\n46:11.020 --> 46:14.020\nShe's hyper-graphic, and she is a walking CAT scan,\n\n46:14.020 --> 46:17.020\nand she, like, can walk into a room full of people,\n\n46:17.020 --> 46:20.020\nand she can see something going on with people,\n\n46:20.020 --> 46:23.020\nand she was like, wait, did you ever go scuba diving?\n\n46:23.020 --> 46:25.020\nWell, yeah.\n\n46:25.020 --> 46:27.020\nOkay, you have temperature reversal.\n\n46:27.020 --> 46:29.020\nYou touch a certain kind of coral,\n\n46:29.020 --> 46:32.020\nand she just reads people's minds and stuff like that,\n\n46:32.020 --> 46:36.020\nand I was telling a story about how I fainted once,\n\n46:36.020 --> 46:39.020\nand she goes, wait, she overheard me.\n\n46:39.020 --> 46:41.020\nI wasn't telling her, I was telling somebody else.\n\n46:41.020 --> 46:43.020\nShe goes, you fainted once?\n\n46:43.020 --> 46:45.020\nWell, how old were you?\n\n46:45.020 --> 46:47.020\nI go 22 or 3?\n\n46:47.020 --> 46:50.020\nShe goes, had you just peed?\n\n46:57.020 --> 47:00.020\nAnd I said, yeah, I had just peed.\n\n47:00.020 --> 47:02.020\nShe goes, oh, thank God, and walked away.\n\n47:02.020 --> 47:04.020\nThank God!\n\n47:08.020 --> 47:10.020\nShe just left you with that.\n\n47:10.020 --> 47:12.020\nShe's been emailing her ever since.\n\n47:12.020 --> 47:14.020\nWhat did you mean?\n\n47:14.020 --> 47:17.020\nWell, I did a pilot for a TV show that never aired\n\n47:17.020 --> 47:19.020\nfor, I think, a TBS or something,\n\n47:19.020 --> 47:22.020\nand it was about her, about another crazy doctor,\n\n47:22.020 --> 47:25.020\nbut she's for real, and she's wonderfully brilliant.\n\n47:25.020 --> 47:29.020\nThere was an actor in a scene where I was playing a neurologist,\n\n47:29.020 --> 47:32.020\nand an actor was brought in on a gurney,\n\n47:32.020 --> 47:35.020\nand he had a brainstem herniation.\n\n47:35.020 --> 47:38.020\nHe was a farmer, and this is based on a real thing,\n\n47:38.020 --> 47:41.020\nhad touched a electrified fence,\n\n47:41.020 --> 47:44.020\nand had a pacemaker, and it gave him a brainstem herniation,\n\n47:44.020 --> 47:46.020\nwhatever that is.\n\n47:46.020 --> 47:49.020\nAnd so she was there with a bunch of other cast crew,\n\n47:49.020 --> 47:51.020\nlighting people, doctors.\n\n47:51.020 --> 47:53.020\nThey all got it?\n\n47:53.020 --> 47:55.020\nNo, sorry.\n\n47:55.020 --> 47:57.020\nWe're all in a hospital room, in a working hospital,\n\n47:57.020 --> 47:59.020\nwhere they shoot like Grey's Anatomy,\n\n47:59.020 --> 48:01.020\nwhich is next to a real hospital,\n\n48:01.020 --> 48:04.020\nand she was talking to this actor who's a really good,\n\n48:04.020 --> 48:07.020\nlike maybe late 50s, early 60s actor,\n\n48:07.020 --> 48:10.020\nlaying on a gurney, and she goes,\n\n48:10.020 --> 48:12.020\nokay, what would happen in this?\n\n48:12.020 --> 48:15.020\nYou'd be on your back, and your back would be arched,\n\n48:15.020 --> 48:17.020\nand your toes would be pointed,\n\n48:17.020 --> 48:19.020\nlike arched and pointed together,\n\n48:19.020 --> 48:21.020\nand your teeth would be gridded,\n\n48:21.020 --> 48:23.020\nand you'd be screaming gibberish.\n\n48:23.020 --> 48:25.020\nAnd so she goes, try that.\n\n48:25.020 --> 48:27.020\nAnd so the actor goes,\n\n48:27.020 --> 48:29.020\nand he does it, and she goes,\n\n48:29.020 --> 48:31.020\noh, God, I want to cut your brain up.\n\n48:31.020 --> 48:33.020\nI don't want to fucking do this.\n\n48:33.020 --> 48:35.020\nShe explained to me later on, she's like,\n\n48:35.020 --> 48:37.020\nneurologists are, we're not like therapists.\n\n48:37.020 --> 48:39.020\nWe're werewolves.\n\n48:39.020 --> 48:41.020\nWe want brains.\n\n48:41.020 --> 48:43.020\nYour brain is a crossword puzzle,\n\n48:43.020 --> 48:45.020\nand we just want to figure it out.\n\n48:45.020 --> 48:47.020\nShe's like, your brain is so fascinating.\n\n48:47.020 --> 48:49.020\nShe's like, Jeff, when you talk,\n\n48:49.020 --> 48:51.020\nand you do this with your hands,\n\n48:51.020 --> 48:54.020\nshe goes, she would say, when you wake up in the morning,\n\n48:54.020 --> 48:56.020\ndo you do this, this, this, this, this?\n\n48:56.020 --> 48:58.020\nYeah, because the way you,\n\n48:58.020 --> 49:00.020\neverything you do with your hands,\n\n49:00.020 --> 49:02.020\nshe can explain your whole life to you.\n\n49:02.020 --> 49:04.020\nIt's really weird.\n\n49:04.020 --> 49:06.020\nSo this actor turns back, and he's doing it perfectly.\n\n49:06.020 --> 49:09.020\nLike seizure, and what would happen is\n\n49:09.020 --> 49:11.020\nyour back would go all the way up off the gurney,\n\n49:11.020 --> 49:13.020\nand your eyes would go straight down\n\n49:13.020 --> 49:15.020\nto where we couldn't even see your irises.\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:17.020\nIt would just be white with your eyes looking straight down.\n\n49:17.020 --> 49:19.020\nSo look down as far as you can.\n\n49:19.020 --> 49:21.020\nSo the guy is doing it, I'm standing right next to him,\n\n49:21.020 --> 49:23.020\nbecause I'm in the scene, his eyes go straight down,\n\n49:23.020 --> 49:25.020\nbut they're only like half, like,\n\n49:25.020 --> 49:27.020\nyou can still see half of his iris.\n\n49:27.020 --> 49:29.020\nAnd she goes, no, no, look all the way down.\n\n49:29.020 --> 49:31.020\nYeah, I can't even do it.\n\n49:31.020 --> 49:34.020\nI'm trying to do it, and I can't do it.\n\n49:34.020 --> 49:36.020\nBecause you, and so this,\n\n49:36.020 --> 49:39.020\nshe's like 4'11\", you know,\n\n49:39.020 --> 49:41.020\nshe's like, you can't look any further down than that.\n\n49:41.020 --> 49:43.020\nAnd the actor's like,\n\n49:43.020 --> 49:45.020\nI'm looking down as far as I can, she goes,\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:48.020\nand there's 25 people in the room.\n\n49:48.020 --> 49:50.020\nAnd she goes, you have seven weeks.\n\n49:50.020 --> 49:53.020\nEven weirder, even way weirder.\n\n49:53.020 --> 49:55.020\nShe looks at him, and I'm sitting right next to her,\n\n49:55.020 --> 49:57.020\nand looking down at this actor on the gurney,\n\n49:57.020 --> 49:59.020\nand she goes, you can't look any further down than that?\n\n49:59.020 --> 50:01.020\nAnd he goes, I'm looking as far down as I can,\n\n50:01.020 --> 50:04.020\nand she goes, hmm.\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:07.020\nWhen you were, like, really little,\n\n50:07.020 --> 50:10.020\nmaybe like four or five or six years old,\n\n50:10.020 --> 50:12.020\nsomebody fell, and you were looking down at it,\n\n50:12.020 --> 50:14.020\nbut you don't want to look down anymore.\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:15.020\nWhat would you remember that?\n\n50:15.020 --> 50:18.020\nAnd the guy goes, I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n50:22.020 --> 50:24.020\nSo this was a CW show.\n\n50:24.020 --> 50:26.020\nNo, no.\n\n50:26.020 --> 50:28.020\nThis was for real.\n\n50:28.020 --> 50:30.020\nIt was for real.\n\n50:30.020 --> 50:33.020\nAnd also, some of the people in the room\n\n50:33.020 --> 50:36.020\nare actual medical, like, the people that are consultants\n\n50:36.020 --> 50:38.020\nthat are there to make sure that you're doing it\n\n50:38.020 --> 50:40.020\nright in a hospital setting.\n\n50:40.020 --> 50:42.020\nAnd everybody goes fucking silent,\n\n50:42.020 --> 50:45.020\nand she goes, now look down, and his eyes go all the way down.\n\n50:45.020 --> 50:48.020\nAnd then she goes, I want to talk to you later about that.\n\n50:48.020 --> 50:50.020\nAnd everybody, like, all the fucking hair\n\n50:50.020 --> 50:53.020\non the back of my neck stood up.\n\n50:53.020 --> 50:55.020\nAnd I talked to her later, and she goes,\n\n50:55.020 --> 50:58.020\nthe brain is this thing that, if you touch it,\n\n50:58.020 --> 51:00.020\nit feels like toothpaste.\n\n51:00.020 --> 51:02.020\nIt's this weird, massive goop in our heads.\n\n51:02.020 --> 51:05.020\nAnd we'll never understand it.\n\n51:05.020 --> 51:07.020\nBut she can walk into it and go, like,\n\n51:07.020 --> 51:10.020\nyou went scuba diving once.\n\n51:10.020 --> 51:13.020\nAnd we made a bad pilot.\n\n51:13.020 --> 51:14.020\nYeah.\n\n51:14.020 --> 51:16.020\nShe wasn't able to, like,\n\n51:16.020 --> 51:19.020\nyour eyes are looking at the TV.\n\n51:19.020 --> 51:20.020\nWhat are you seeing?\n\n51:20.020 --> 51:23.020\nAmerican Idol.\n\n51:23.020 --> 51:25.020\nThey're able to look away.\n\n51:25.020 --> 51:26.020\nWhat are you watching?\n\n51:26.020 --> 51:28.020\nA weird crap with no explanation.\n\n51:28.020 --> 51:30.020\nI have to say, the code of this is amazing.\n\n51:30.020 --> 51:32.020\nWe did this thing, and she's like,\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:34.020\nyou guys are, like, you actors, you guys are so funny.\n\n51:34.020 --> 51:36.020\nIt's like, you're the worst neurologist in the world.\n\n51:36.020 --> 51:38.020\nYou are not doing it right.\n\n51:38.020 --> 51:39.020\nI was like, why?\n\n51:39.020 --> 51:42.020\nShe said, because neurologists were bad with people.\n\n51:42.020 --> 51:44.020\nWe only want to solve the puzzle of the human brain.\n\n51:44.020 --> 51:47.020\nWe are not good with human interaction.\n\n51:47.020 --> 51:49.020\nBut you guys, you come into a scene,\n\n51:49.020 --> 51:51.020\nand you touch the other actor who's going through this thing.\n\n51:51.020 --> 51:53.020\nYou walk in, and you put your hand on the shoulder.\n\n51:53.020 --> 51:54.020\nYou smile.\n\n51:54.020 --> 51:57.020\nAnd she's like, we know that you can reverse engineer\n\n51:57.020 --> 51:58.020\nhappiness by smiling.\n\n51:58.020 --> 52:01.020\nYou can actually tell people, like, raise your cheeks up,\n\n52:01.020 --> 52:03.020\nand it actually creates joy.\n\n52:03.020 --> 52:06.020\nYou can reverse engineer happiness through faking smiles.\n\n52:06.020 --> 52:08.020\nShe's like, we know that, but we're bad at it.\n\n52:08.020 --> 52:10.020\nSo she wrote an article about how actors\n\n52:10.020 --> 52:13.020\ntaught her to be a better neurologist.\n\n52:13.020 --> 52:16.020\nAnd so there's a picture of me in the Harvard Medical Journal.\n\n52:16.020 --> 52:18.020\nAll right.\n\n52:18.020 --> 52:21.020\nYes.\n\n52:21.020 --> 52:24.020\nLet's bring out my betrothed Erin McGathy.\n\n52:24.020 --> 52:26.020\nHello.\n\n52:34.020 --> 52:35.020\nHello.\n\n52:35.020 --> 52:39.020\nI wanted to bring you out because I feel like you helped out\n\n52:39.020 --> 52:42.020\na little bit in today's charity.\n\n52:42.020 --> 52:44.020\nDan, you did most of the lifting today.\n\n52:44.020 --> 52:45.020\nYeah.\n\n52:45.020 --> 52:48.020\nI mean, I definitely, I was the reason why everything\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:51.020\nhappened today.\n\n52:51.020 --> 52:52.020\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n52:52.020 --> 52:56.020\nAaron is the absolutely the, I wish I could show everybody\n\n52:56.020 --> 53:00.020\na slideshow of all the times Aaron tried to make me lift\n\n53:00.020 --> 53:02.020\na finger for any of this.\n\n53:02.020 --> 53:05.020\nAnd I reminded her of the deal we had from the get go,\n\n53:05.020 --> 53:08.020\nwhich was you do whatever you want.\n\n53:08.020 --> 53:10.020\nI will show up on Sunday.\n\n53:10.020 --> 53:14.020\nBut if at any point you asked me to do anything,\n\n53:14.020 --> 53:18.020\nI am going to yell at you and be mean to you.\n\n53:18.020 --> 53:22.020\nAnd I held to that because I'm a hero.\n\n53:22.020 --> 53:24.020\nNo.\n\n53:24.020 --> 53:27.020\nYou sell yourself short.\n\n53:27.020 --> 53:28.020\nYou were great.\n\n53:28.020 --> 53:29.020\nYou did a lot.\n\n53:29.020 --> 53:32.020\nMay I share my favorite theory about deja vu,\n\n53:32.020 --> 53:35.020\nwhich I think is one of the more popular theories about why\n\n53:35.020 --> 53:39.020\ndeja vu happens is that your brain is simply mistaking the\n\n53:39.020 --> 53:42.020\npresent for the past, meaning that like there's something that\n\n53:42.020 --> 53:44.020\ngoes wrong in your brain.\n\n53:44.020 --> 53:47.020\nAnd often like people experience deja vu before seizures.\n\n53:47.020 --> 53:57.020\nDid you just put the goucher on me?\n\n53:57.020 --> 54:04.020\nCan we all just watch Jeff with spoons in our pockets?\n\n54:04.020 --> 54:05.020\nI'm joking.\n\n54:05.020 --> 54:07.020\nIt's all because people used to put spoons in people's\n\n54:07.020 --> 54:09.020\nmouths, seizures.\n\n54:09.020 --> 54:12.020\nAnyway, but the idea that your brain,\n\n54:12.020 --> 54:14.020\nit's just like a neurological misfire.\n\n54:14.020 --> 54:16.020\nThe idea that your brain can actually be like,\n\n54:16.020 --> 54:18.020\nno, this happened before.\n\n54:18.020 --> 54:21.020\nBut it's the idea that we have a condition in our brain that\n\n54:21.020 --> 54:22.020\njust says.\n\n54:22.020 --> 54:23.020\nYeah.\n\n54:23.020 --> 54:25.020\nI think what Jeff was describing, it's sort of like the engine\n\n54:25.020 --> 54:27.020\nis kind of like, it's a backfire.\n\n54:27.020 --> 54:29.020\nLike when you're in, when your muffler goes,\n\n54:29.020 --> 54:31.020\npop, it's because like something's happening with the\n\n54:31.020 --> 54:34.020\npistons, your engine is going, that's the insane thing is\n\n54:34.020 --> 54:38.020\nthat like your, our brains are designed to go down these\n\n54:38.020 --> 54:45.020\nrailroad tracks that we are like, we take for granted,\n\n54:45.020 --> 54:49.020\nhappen, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap.\n\n54:49.020 --> 54:53.020\nLike, like, but there's absolutely no reason why a brain\n\n54:53.020 --> 54:56.020\non a railroad track can't, for instance,\n\n54:56.020 --> 54:59.020\njust go backward.\n\n54:59.020 --> 55:02.020\nIf for instance, the entire railroad track should go,\n\n55:02.020 --> 55:04.020\nshould decide to fold in half.\n\n55:04.020 --> 55:08.020\nSo something that has more power over the railroad than\n\n55:08.020 --> 55:11.020\nthe people who built their little railroads.\n\n55:11.020 --> 55:15.020\nLike for instance, the God that created the entire planet,\n\n55:15.020 --> 55:18.020\nthe entire, the force of gravity.\n\n55:18.020 --> 55:24.020\nIt's so, to me, I've never had a deja vu that wasn't filled\n\n55:24.020 --> 55:28.020\nwith an absolute like sense of dread.\n\n55:28.020 --> 55:33.020\nI didn't click send after the deja vu was over.\n\n55:33.020 --> 55:38.020\nI declined to click send on a Sinbad bashing Instagram\n\n55:38.020 --> 55:44.020\nbecause I was so convinced that I had, I had been about\n\n55:44.020 --> 55:49.020\nto click send on this Sinbad bashing that I was certain\n\n55:49.020 --> 55:52.020\nthat when I clicked send, I was going to die.\n\n55:52.020 --> 55:53.020\nIron deficiency.\n\n55:53.020 --> 55:54.020\nIron deficiency.\n\n55:54.020 --> 55:57.020\nI just need to eat more Gerritol.\n\n55:57.020 --> 56:03.020\nJeff, what was your friend's name? Alice?\n\n56:03.020 --> 56:10.020\nShe's, she's, she's, she's a naysitter boots.\n\n56:10.020 --> 56:14.020\nI think your admiration of her is really beautiful.\n\n56:14.020 --> 56:16.020\nI also think it's really funny that you're just, sorry,\n\n56:16.020 --> 56:18.020\nI just spit on you on the toilet.\n\n56:18.020 --> 56:21.020\nI think you're like describing, describing her home walking\n\n56:21.020 --> 56:23.020\nin and there being things hanging everywhere.\n\n56:23.020 --> 56:25.020\nWell, this is just concerning.\n\n56:25.020 --> 56:27.020\nThis is by her description.\n\n56:27.020 --> 56:28.020\nI've never been there.\n\n56:28.020 --> 56:32.020\nIt's her description of it that she says that like this\n\n56:32.020 --> 56:35.020\nhypergraphia thing is called like where you write a lot.\n\n56:35.020 --> 56:38.020\nIf you are a bad writer and you write everywhere and you write\n\n56:38.020 --> 56:40.020\non every surface, they lock you up.\n\n56:40.020 --> 56:44.020\nIf you're a good writer and you're hypergraphic,\n\n56:44.020 --> 56:47.020\nyou're Chaucer, you're Dostoevsky.\n\n56:47.020 --> 56:49.020\nThere's people that have been hypergraphic throughout\n\n56:49.020 --> 56:51.020\nthe ages that they cannot stop writing.\n\n56:51.020 --> 56:53.020\nAnd there's a reason why we have these giant tomes by\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:55.020\ncertain authors.\n\n56:55.020 --> 56:59.020\nAnd she said the greatest thing I ever did was marry a publisher.\n\n56:59.020 --> 57:04.020\nBut she really does carry a certain kind of pen to write\n\n57:04.020 --> 57:06.020\nall the way up her wrists.\n\n57:06.020 --> 57:11.020\nBut also she's like, she was hospitalized, I believe.\n\n57:11.020 --> 57:12.020\nSucking.\n\n57:12.020 --> 57:16.020\nFor like self, like she kind of like melted down and\n\n57:16.020 --> 57:19.020\nthey said you can't like self diagnose yourself.\n\n57:19.020 --> 57:21.020\nWe have to put you away for a while.\n\n57:21.020 --> 57:22.020\nOh man.\n\n57:22.020 --> 57:24.020\nAnd she's like, no, I can do this.\n\n57:24.020 --> 57:27.020\nBut she wouldn't sleep and she would build things.\n\n57:27.020 --> 57:32.020\nThat's why I don't believe in psychiatry or psychology.\n\n57:32.020 --> 57:33.020\nWhy?\n\n57:33.020 --> 57:39.020\nBecause there's a disease you can diagnose called being awesome.\n\n57:39.020 --> 57:45.020\nThey call it superiority complex is a diagnosable thing.\n\n57:45.020 --> 57:50.020\nYou can go to a qualified doctor and you can tell them how\n\n57:50.020 --> 57:53.020\nyou feel and they can tell you that you have a diagnosable\n\n57:53.020 --> 57:56.020\nthing called superiority complex.\n\n57:56.020 --> 58:01.020\nAnd I'm like, OK, that may be true for an inferior person.\n\n58:01.020 --> 58:07.020\nHowever, you may need to dig deeper than that, parasite.\n\n58:07.020 --> 58:09.020\nActuality complex.\n\n58:09.020 --> 58:11.020\nKeep going.\n\n58:11.020 --> 58:15.020\nYes, I have a complex about how superior I am.\n\n58:15.020 --> 58:19.020\nSuperiority complex isn't superior enough a name for what I have.\n\n58:19.020 --> 58:20.020\nYeah.\n\n58:20.020 --> 58:28.020\nBut I'm being glib, but that's the failing of studying the mind.\n\n58:28.020 --> 58:30.020\nIt's a fucking don't laugh.\n\n58:30.020 --> 58:31.020\nI mean, do laugh.\n\n58:31.020 --> 58:34.020\nI was laughing because you put the mind in quotes.\n\n58:34.020 --> 58:38.020\nWell, I'm saying like this idea that you can circumscribe intellect\n\n58:38.020 --> 58:40.020\nhas this huge feeling.\n\n58:40.020 --> 58:44.020\nEveryone that we've ever, everyone that built the world that\n\n58:44.020 --> 58:45.020\nwe're sitting in.\n\n58:45.020 --> 58:51.020\nWe're sitting here under lights created by a guy that believed\n\n58:51.020 --> 58:55.020\nmore than someone else that you could illuminate this room\n\n58:55.020 --> 58:57.020\nafter sundown.\n\n58:57.020 --> 59:02.020\nMost importantly of all, we understand the universe we're\n\n59:02.020 --> 59:06.020\nliving in because of a guy who didn't believe, unlike everyone\n\n59:06.020 --> 59:10.020\nelse, that the reason light seems to travel the same speed no\n\n59:10.020 --> 59:13.020\nmatter what point of departure it has isn't because there's\n\n59:13.020 --> 59:16.020\nsome unseen jello we all live in called the ether.\n\n59:16.020 --> 59:18.020\nIt's because E equals MC squared.\n\n59:18.020 --> 59:20.020\nThat guy was out of his fucking mind.\n\n59:20.020 --> 59:23.020\nIf Einstein had gone to a therapist, they would have told him\n\n59:23.020 --> 59:26.020\nso many times, knock it off.\n\n59:26.020 --> 59:30.020\nThey would have said like, do you really think thinking that light\n\n59:30.020 --> 59:33.020\nis a variable is getting you anywhere?\n\n59:33.020 --> 59:35.020\nNo, I guess not.\n\n59:35.020 --> 59:38.020\nDon't you think you should comb your hair and change your sweater\n\n59:38.020 --> 59:41.020\nand fucking go work at Ikea?\n\n59:41.020 --> 59:43.020\nFuck, fuck, fuck therapist.\n\n59:43.020 --> 59:46.020\nAnd I'm not saying that anyone that has a problem with therapy\n\n59:46.020 --> 59:47.020\nis going to be Einstein.\n\n59:47.020 --> 59:50.020\nI'm just saying, fuck you therapy.\n\n59:50.020 --> 59:52.020\nYou just hate change.\n\n59:52.020 --> 59:53.020\nI don't.\n\n59:53.020 --> 59:55.020\nWait, I love change.\n\n59:55.020 --> 59:56.020\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n59:56.020 --> 59:57.020\nI hate change.\n\n59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.020\nEinstein loved change.\n\n01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.020\nHe was like, change everything all the time.\n\n01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.020\nHe died going, I didn't change enough.\n\n01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.020\nBut Stephen Hawking is like, I can't change enough.\n\n01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.020\nLike he's trying to change everything every day.\n\n01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.020\nHe's like, oh, fuck my body.\n\n01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:18.020\nOnly my eyeballs can move.\n\n01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.020\nI still want to prove how fucking retarded everything.\n\n01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020\nGod damn it.\n\n01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020\nI said it again.\n\n01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.020\nFucking it.\n\n01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.020\nYou're especially always trying to soak up.\n\n01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.020\nYou've come down pretty hard on retargeting.\n\n01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.020\nMy sister's retarded.\n\n01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.020\nSo fuck everybody.\n\n01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.020\nYou can't keep cashing that chip in, man.\n\n01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.020\nI mean, I gotta try.\n\n01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.020\nI know I can't.\n\n01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.020\nYou especially seem to always seek out positive things\n\n01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.020\nto change about yourself.\n\n01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:52.020\nYou just don't like therapists because they're not as smart as you\n\n01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.020\nmost of the time because most people aren't as smart.\n\n01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.020\nWhat more reason do you need?\n\n01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.020\nNo, I don't need any.\n\n01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.020\nI agree with you.\n\n01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.020\nI think that's a valid thing.\n\n01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.020\nI don't think it has anything to do with change.\n\n01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.020\nWe have a hand shooting up and we like to respect us at Harmontown.\n\n01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.020\nWhy is your hand shooting up?\n\n01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.020\nYou want me to go for it?\n\n01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.020\nYeah, I do.\n\n01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.020\nOh, whoa.\n\n01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.020\nI've been seeing...\n\n01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020\nHello there.\n\n01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.020\nMy name is Liz.\n\n01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.020\nHello.\n\n01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.020\nI'm a big fan.\n\n01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.020\nWe're in a safe place.\n\n01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.020\nI have been seeing a therapist for four years\n\n01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020\nand he is much dumber than me.\n\n01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.020\nAll right.\n\n01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.020\nI think what you're saying about therapists is something that's untrue.\n\n01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.020\nThey don't try to make you act like a normal person.\n\n01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.020\nI think you're a little bit angry because you don't actually have Asperger's\n\n01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.020\nand a therapist would tell you that.\n\n01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.020\nI don't believe that I have Asperger's.\n\n01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.020\nI wouldn't fault anybody for telling me that.\n\n01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:43.020\nWere you expecting a standing ovation for saying that?\n\n01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.020\nMaybe it's not necessarily about someone being smarter than you,\n\n01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.020\nbut it's about...\n\n01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.020\nI think it's...\n\n01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.020\nI haven't found a great therapist\n\n01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.020\nand I don't think it's because I can't find anyone smarter than me,\n\n01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.020\nbut I think you have to find someone that works with you.\n\n01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.020\nWait, wait.\n\n01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.020\nI want to stick to the healthy core of what she's saying.\n\n01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.020\nYou're a reasonably intelligent person\n\n01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.020\nand you've been going to a therapist that you feel...\n\n01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.020\nYou can sense maybe...\n\n01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.020\nHopefully he's not listening or she...\n\n01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.020\nYou feel like maybe they're...\n\n01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.020\nI've told him this before.\n\n01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.020\nThey're dumber than you.\n\n01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:18.020\nBut you're achieving a benefit from meeting with this person.\n\n01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.020\nSo explain that.\n\n01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020\nHow that's possible.\n\n01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.020\nHow you can go to a therapist that you think is dumber than you\n\n01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.020\nand how that can benefit you.\n\n01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:28.020\nI have a health insurance from, I think, Anthem\n\n01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:32.020\nand it covers Adderall Prescription for $5 a month.\n\n01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.020\nSo you have a drug dealer.\n\n01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.020\nYes.\n\n01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.020\nAnd he's done because he gives you drugs\n\n01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.020\nand you don't need them.\n\n01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.020\nSo that's great.\n\n01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.020\nThat's what you're saying.\n\n01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.020\nTechnically I do need them.\n\n01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.020\nI have ADHD.\n\n01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.020\nHe won't diagnose it because he doesn't believe in diagnoses.\n\n01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.020\nI have a million and no questions.\n\n01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.020\nI have negative five questions.\n\n01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.020\nYank the mic back like a fucking...\n\n01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.020\nBut thank you.\n\n01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.020\nThank you.\n\n01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:03.020\nSo yeah, Adderall's great.\n\n01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020\nTherapy's fine.\n\n01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.020\nLike everything where I...\n\n01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.020\nI and I think Dan feels the same way recently.\n\n01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:14.020\nLike I think that realizing that arbitrary things,\n\n01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.020\nlike anything that makes you feel better,\n\n01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.020\ngiving...\n\n01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.020\nLike deciding that a chair every time you see a chair every day\n\n01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.020\nis going to remind you that humanity is important.\n\n01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.020\nLike it's whatever fucking works for you.\n\n01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.020\nDan's not saying that therapy's bad.\n\n01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.020\nYeah, I am.\n\n01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020\nNo, for you.\n\n01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.020\nNo, but you won't say definitively.\n\n01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020\nNo, you don't.\n\n01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.020\nYou don't think it is.\n\n01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.020\nI think for...\n\n01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.020\nBut I do think...\n\n01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.020\nI think there's a fucking danger in it.\n\n01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.020\nI do.\n\n01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.020\nI agree.\n\n01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:44.020\nI think that the idea of therapy is founded by...\n\n01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.020\nLike there is no such thing as a revolutionary therapist.\n\n01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:52.020\nThere is no such thing as a person who sets up an office\n\n01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:55.020\nin a mini mall and sits there with a clipboard\n\n01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.020\nand waits for patients to come in\n\n01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020\nand sign their health insurance forms\n\n01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.020\nand can't wait to tell that person\n\n01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.020\nthat everything they thought walking in is bullshit\n\n01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.020\nand they need to go out and fucking up.\n\n01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.020\nBut when someone comes to you and says,\n\n01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.020\nDan, like, I have a therapist\n\n01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020\nand I don't know if I'm an asshole,\n\n01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.020\nbut this person works for me,\n\n01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.020\nyou don't say to them,\n\n01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020\nthat's not true.\n\n01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.020\nLike you're happy for people to do their own thing, right?\n\n01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020\nMarriage.\n\n01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.020\nRight?\n\n01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:27.020\nI mean, you're fine with people...\n\n01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.020\nYes, people who are already happy with the way things are going,\n\n01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.020\nwho are having weird speed bumps.\n\n01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.020\nI think that there's ways.\n\n01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:38.020\nWe got another hand coming up from the middle of the crowd.\n\n01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.020\nI don't know why.\n\n01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020\nI hope it's not...\n\n01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020\nJust okay.\n\n01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.020\nI won't say what I hope it's not.\n\n01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020\nHi.\n\n01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.020\nHello.\n\n01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.020\nI'm a big fan.\n\n01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.020\nAll right. Well, thank you.\n\n01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.020\nI just want to say that I didn't go to therapy\n\n01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.020\nfor a really long time\n\n01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.020\nand I started going and she's amazing\n\n01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.020\nand it's not because she tells me a thing new,\n\n01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.020\nit's because she supports the ideas I already have\n\n01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:07.020\nand she's a fucking awesome feminist.\n\n01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.020\nAll right.\n\n01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.020\nNow tell her she's wrong.\n\n01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.020\nTell her her feelings are bad.\n\n01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.020\nTell her her joy is wrong.\n\n01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.020\nTell her she should buy a bottle of booze.\n\n01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.020\nNo, I got...\n\n01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:23.020\nOh, I drink plenty.\n\n01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.020\nWhat's your...\n\n01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.020\nAre you willing to say your name?\n\n01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.020\nYeah, I'm Zoe.\n\n01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020\nHi, everybody.\n\n01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020\nHi.\n\n01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.020\nI did go...\n\n01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.020\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.020\nHere's where I come clean.\n\n01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.020\nI went to a therapist once who I think was awesome.\n\n01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.020\nWhoa!\n\n01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.020\nOh, shit!\n\n01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:50.020\nAnd he was way too expensive, way too expensive.\n\n01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.020\nLike if I had...\n\n01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:55.020\nMy mental health would have cost me my home, my everything.\n\n01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.020\nI would have been under a bridge being like,\n\n01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:03.020\nI get why this bridge deserves to be over me.\n\n01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.020\nI just fucking bailed because I got nervous\n\n01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:10.020\nbecause he was not covered by Blue Cross or Blue Shield or anything.\n\n01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.020\nAnd I just bailed.\n\n01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.020\nHe was Jungian, he told me...\n\n01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.020\nI'm saying like, Zoe's saying like,\n\n01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.020\nshe's probably a feminist.\n\n01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.020\nShe went to a therapist who's a feminist.\n\n01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.020\nIt's like, in other words, to extrapolate that,\n\n01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:28.020\nyou went to a therapist who's actually so activated that,\n\n01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.020\nyeah, you didn't feel like you were sitting in a strip mall\n\n01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.020\nwith somebody who was an agent of compromise.\n\n01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:36.020\nNo, she challenges me, but if I tell her,\n\n01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.020\nthat's not how I feel.\n\n01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.020\nShe totally...\n\n01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.020\nShe wants you to be who you are and how she is.\n\n01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.020\nZoe actually doesn't have a mic right now.\n\n01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.020\nThat's just how activated she is.\n\n01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.020\nShe's booming out to it.\n\n01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.020\nHer sense of self-worth.\n\n01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:52.020\nI did go to a guy who was like this amazing guy\n\n01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:56.020\nwho was a Jungian guy who told me in her first session,\n\n01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.020\nhe said, go home.\n\n01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.020\nIt was all Jungian stuff and I'm into Campbell.\n\n01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.020\nSo you love therapy.\n\n01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.020\nI like talking to this guy a little bit, kind of,\n\n01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:09.020\nbut it was like...\n\n01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.020\nYou got money, now go back to him, man.\n\n01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.020\nBut I'm telling you, I could be mentally unhealthy\n\n01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.020\nand drive it around on a Tesla.\n\n01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:19.020\nThis Jungian guy was Carl Jung.\n\n01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.020\nZoe, can you pass the mic to her?\n\n01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.020\nI'm just saying, you should see my therapist.\n\n01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.020\nShe's really supportive.\n\n01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.020\nI may.\n\n01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.020\nCan we bring her to Harmontown?\n\n01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.020\nShelly Wilson, her name.\n\n01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.020\nEY.\n\n01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.020\nJust really quick.\n\n01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.020\nReally quick.\n\n01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:43.020\nYou like talking to a person, but not the title therapist.\n\n01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:46.020\nYou like talking to a person and relaying things\n\n01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.020\nand actually having a conversation with someone\n\n01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.020\nyou feel has the credentials to talk to you.\n\n01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:59.020\nBut the therapist, the title therapist is just like too...\n\n01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.020\nIt gives them the right to take money from you\n\n01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:05.020\nand all this stuff for just talking to a person.\n\n01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.020\nRight.\n\n01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.020\nYou're saying that's how I feel.\n\n01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:13.020\nWell, from what I'm taking from what you're saying.\n\n01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:16.020\nYes, that's how I feel.\n\n01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.020\nIt's like a dentist, but for your brain.\n\n01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.020\nIt's not fair.\n\n01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.020\nThere's a million bad dentists.\n\n01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020\nThey're like, oh, your teeth are fucked up.\n\n01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.020\nI'm going to drill here and drill there,\n\n01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.020\nand it's like they're fucked up.\n\n01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.020\nThey don't go to school.\n\n01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.020\nWhat they learn at school is how many teeth people have.\n\n01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.020\nThey don't learn it when it takes to have a fucking bite.\n\n01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:35.020\nYeah.\n\n01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.020\nI'm agreeing with you.\n\n01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:40.020\nBut Zoe is saying like, you know, yeah.\n\n01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.020\nIt's like a therapist were called expert life livers.\n\n01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:47.020\nYou'd question everything about them,\n\n01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.020\nbut it's all different.\n\n01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020\nI mean, I figure I know.\n\n01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.020\nThis has been a long time coming.\n\n01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.020\nI'm glad this size audience came here.\n\n01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.020\nI've always been waiting to be called out on this.\n\n01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.020\nI know I need to go back to therapy.\n\n01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.020\nI know that nobody needs therapy more than me.\n\n01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.020\nSomeone who...\n\n01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020\nOne of your ex-girlfriends is in the back.\n\n01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.020\nIt's cheering.\n\n01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:16.020\nSomebody cheer like they're at a Bon Jovi concert.\n\n01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.020\nAnd I very much respect...\n\n01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.020\nI'm not even sure, young lady, what was your name?\n\n01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.020\nMichelle.\n\n01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.020\nMichelle.\n\n01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.020\nI'm not even sure if you're on my side or Zoe's side\n\n01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.020\nor somewhere in between,\n\n01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.020\nbut I respect everybody who's saying like, look,\n\n01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.020\nthat takes bravery.\n\n01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.020\nIt's a big throng where obviously all you'd have to do\n\n01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:37.020\nto be on my side is go fuck therapy.\n\n01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.020\nAnd yet there's...\n\n01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.020\nAll right, we have a hand up over here.\n\n01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.020\nJust become a town hall.\n\n01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:42.020\nShe is a therapist.\n\n01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.020\nCome on down.\n\n01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.020\nCome on down.\n\n01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.020\nCome on down.\n\n01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.020\nAre you willing to come out?\n\n01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:55.020\nExpert life, liver, ombre, sweater, looking healthy.\n\n01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.020\nAre you okay coming up?\n\n01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.020\nWe don't bully people here.\n\n01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:02.020\nDo you take writer's bill of insurance?\n\n01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.020\nHave you been to the show before?\n\n01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.020\nYes.\n\n01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.020\nOkay.\n\n01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020\nSo, you know, we never pick on people.\n\n01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.020\nNo one's going to pick on you here.\n\n01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.020\nThat'll protest too much.\n\n01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.020\nBut it's okay.\n\n01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.020\nYou said you got pushed up here,\n\n01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.020\nbut you're okay being up here.\n\n01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.020\nI'm okay being up here.\n\n01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020\nOkay.\n\n01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020\nAll right.\n\n01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020\nWhat's your name?\n\n01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.020\nMy name's Amber.\n\n01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.020\nDr. Amber.\n\n01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.020\nDr. Amber.\n\n01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020\nAll right.\n\n01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.020\nI just got licensed.\n\n01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.020\nThis Friday on The CW.\n\n01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.020\nI'm so excited about the show.\n\n01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.020\nThis has been a long time coming.\n\n01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.020\nI need to have my face rubbed in this section of the carpet.\n\n01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.020\nI've been talking a lot of shit a long time about therapy.\n\n01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.020\nI don't have a problem with what you've said.\n\n01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:44.020\nIf I did, it would go a little something.\n\n01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.020\nTherapists are professional helpers and like any doctor,\n\n01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.020\nif you don't like the first one,\n\n01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.020\nyou find another one that you do like.\n\n01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020\nRight.\n\n01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:55.020\nThere are a lot of shitty therapists\n\n01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:58.020\nand therapists that take advantage of people\n\n01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.020\nor are egotistical themselves,\n\n01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.020\nbut I went to school for a long time\n\n01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.020\nto learn techniques to help.\n\n01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.020\nAnd like Zoe's therapists and others,\n\n01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:09.020\nsome of them you find a good connection with someone\n\n01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.020\nwho's going to be real with you\n\n01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.020\nand lead you to be a better you.\n\n01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020\nThere's two things.\n\n01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.020\nJust in the short time that you talked,\n\n01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.020\nI was like, I want to say this.\n\n01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.020\nI want to say that.\n\n01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:26.020\nThe...\n\n01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:31.020\nI'm sorry, our time is up.\n\n01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.020\nI really hope, Amber, that you get some money out of this.\n\n01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:39.020\nWhen you go, I'll give her a pile of it.\n\n01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.020\nYou have to give it to 826LA though.\n\n01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.020\nBut when people go to study teeth in dental school,\n\n01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:51.020\nwhat they learn is that there's a certain amount of teeth\n\n01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.020\nthat they exist in an ideal condition\n\n01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.020\nin a certain row and things like that.\n\n01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.020\nSo the thing that scares me immediately\n\n01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.020\nis the idea of the human mind\n\n01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.020\nas an array of features\n\n01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.020\nthat's supposed to be arranged in a certain order.\n\n01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:09.020\nThat's the first thing that scares guys in my profession.\n\n01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.020\nI'm not unique in that way.\n\n01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:14.020\nEvery hack writer in the world wants to hold onto his specialness\n\n01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.020\nand thinks that it's going to be taken away.\n\n01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.020\nAnd I tell 9 out of 10 of those people,\n\n01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:20.020\nfuck you, you hack.\n\n01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.020\nStop using the fact that you did a rewrite\n\n01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.020\non The Pest with John Leguizamo\n\n01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.020\nas an excuse to be mean to your girlfriend.\n\n01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.020\nGo to therapy. You're being an asshole.\n\n01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.020\nBut me, that's a different matter.\n\n01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.020\nI really got something to protect over here.\n\n01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.020\nHow do you respond to that idea\n\n01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:45.020\nthat other sciences are like a doctor goes,\n\n01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.020\nokay, this is what a bone is supposed to do.\n\n01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.020\nThis is what a tooth is supposed to do.\n\n01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.020\nThis is what a liver is supposed to look like.\n\n01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.020\nWhen you're dealing with the human mind,\n\n01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.020\nnot the brain, but the mind, the personality,\n\n01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.020\nhow do you guys, what do they teach you in...\n\n01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:02.020\nIn 144 characters.\n\n01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.020\nTo account for the fact that some people actually\n\n01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.020\nare supposed to be a little bit crazy.\n\n01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.020\nI think number one is we've had a lot of trouble\n\n01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.020\neven being seen as a science.\n\n01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.020\nAnd I'm a psychologist.\n\n01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.020\nNot a psychiatrist, right.\n\n01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.020\nI don't prescribe medication.\n\n01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.020\nI do talk therapy and those kind of interventions.\n\n01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.020\nSo I see the human mind as messy.\n\n01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.020\nIt is not just black and white.\n\n01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:28.020\nWe're taught ways to get you to function better.\n\n01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.020\nWhat's your definition of it not functioning?\n\n01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.020\nI don't want to cut you off.\n\n01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.020\nThat's it.\n\n01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:33.020\nWhat's your definition?\n\n01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.020\nWhat's happening, you guys?\n\n01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.020\nIf I...\n\n01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.020\nWhat's your definition of it not functioning?\n\n01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.020\nIf somebody comes up to you, I would hope,\n\n01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.020\nif somebody said to you,\n\n01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.020\nI'm having fights with my girlfriend.\n\n01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.020\nI am going to marry her in November.\n\n01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.020\nThis is totally hypothetical about that.\n\n01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.020\nHe's asking for a friend.\n\n01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.020\nHe said, I just...\n\n01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.020\nHow do you account for...\n\n01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.020\nI want to ask you a million questions,\n\n01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.020\nbut I guess I'm supposed to pay for it.\n\n01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020\nWell, how many patients do you have?\n\n01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.020\nWhat fields do they come from?\n\n01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.020\nWhere's your office?\n\n01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.020\nHow long have you been doing this?\n\n01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.020\nI just finished my postdoc a couple months ago,\n\n01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.020\nso I'm starting to work at the VA.\n\n01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.020\nI don't have a start date yet.\n\n01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.020\nThat's my new job.\n\n01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.020\nYou're working with veterans?\n\n01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.020\nIt'll be, yes.\n\n01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.020\nIt's like a veteran hospital in West LA.\n\n01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.020\nBut I was working at a private practice in Studio City,\n\n01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.020\nand I saw kids and teens with autism and ADHD,\n\n01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.020\nand I saw just regular adults,\n\n01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.020\nand I worked at Kaiser for my internship,\n\n01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.020\nwhere we saw, excuse me, everyone,\n\n01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.020\nany walk of life psychosis to\n\n01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.020\nI'm just having trouble with my fiance.\n\n01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.020\nSo not to put you at a spot,\n\n01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.020\nbut if you could...\n\n01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.020\nWhat is your definition of...\n\n01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.020\nI don't even want to say an unhealthy mind.\n\n01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.020\nI want to say...\n\n01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:05.020\nI would say if the people around you are worried,\n\n01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.020\nand there's a consensus that\n\n01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:09.020\nyou could be doing better,\n\n01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.020\nthat would be indication number one.\n\n01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.020\nThat's terrifying!\n\n01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.020\nThat's Donald Sutherland in Body Snatchers.\n\n01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.020\nIf there's a consensus that you could be...\n\n01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.020\nYou know how that sounds.\n\n01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:25.020\nBut it would also be, do you think you could be doing better?\n\n01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020\nI mean, when someone comes into my office...\n\n01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:30.020\nBut what if I think I could be doing better\n\n01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.020\nand everyone else thinks I could be doing better?\n\n01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.020\nAnd what if I don't trust them?\n\n01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:37.020\nThen I'd start thinking about certain diagnoses.\n\n01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.020\nThen you'd send me to a psychiatrist.\n\n01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.020\nBut I would want to talk to those people\n\n01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:44.020\nand spend more than just five minutes\n\n01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.020\nin a strip mall with a clipboard.\n\n01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.020\nI would spend a couple hours talking to you about\n\n01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.020\nwhat's really going on, what are you worried about,\n\n01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:53.020\nwhy are you concerned about coming to see me even?\n\n01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.020\nWhat do you... I mean, you've already...\n\n01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.020\nIt's always... I'll answer your question,\n\n01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.020\nalthough I'm not coming to see you.\n\n01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.020\nI...\n\n01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.020\nThe last 11 therapists...\n\n01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.020\nThe last 11 times I've gone to a therapist\n\n01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.020\nit's always been because it's make or break with the...\n\n01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.020\nI'm always on the verge of, like,\n\n01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.020\nI'm hurting somebody that I'm with.\n\n01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.020\nI would say you've waited too long.\n\n01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:24.020\nI'm glad.\n\n01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:27.020\nI'm waiting for my mic to turn into a bouquet of flowers.\n\n01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.020\nI just mean that if...\n\n01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.020\nI think most people make the mistake of...\n\n01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.020\nWaiting until...\n\n01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.020\nIt's a last resort.\n\n01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.020\nI get that.\n\n01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.020\nAnd I'm not a couple's therapist, but...\n\n01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.020\nShe's not on your side, Erin.\n\n01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.020\nYou're not listening to what she's really saying.\n\n01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.020\nSome people do, like, preemptive,\n\n01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.020\nyou know, marriage counseling or couples counseling.\n\n01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:51.020\nBut that's, like, picking a scab, right?\n\n01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.020\nIt's like, you should have dealt with this\n\n01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.020\nwhen it was bleeding.\n\n01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.020\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.020\nI think preemptive counseling is cool,\n\n01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.020\nbecause...\n\n01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.020\nI think it's super rad.\n\n01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.020\nIt's totally Bieber.\n\n01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.020\nI mean, I'm really happy with our relationship right now,\n\n01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.020\nbut we do have a few communication issues,\n\n01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:21.020\nso it would be nice to kind of work out a game plan\n\n01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.020\nor just kind of have a...\n\n01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.020\nThis is one of the problems I would be coming to you with,\n\n01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.020\nis that I have a fiance who tries to parlay any situation\n\n01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.020\nand their political advantage.\n\n01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020\nI feel like...\n\n01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.020\nThat's not true.\n\n01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.020\nSomebody's storming the stage.\n\n01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.020\nCan you take that mic?\n\n01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.020\nJames, I'm coming humbly.\n\n01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.020\nWell, go sit behind the table.\n\n01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.020\nI'm coming humbly.\n\n01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.020\nOr he's just gonna...\n\n01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.020\nWhat's your name, sir?\n\n01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.020\nJames Lively.\n\n01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.020\nJames Lively?\n\n01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.020\nFake name.\n\n01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.020\nI do fake name counseling.\n\n01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.020\nYou can go with maybe a John Smith or a...\n\n01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.020\nMy name is Most Likely.\n\n01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:09.020\nMy grandfather was a Hollywood writer.\n\n01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.020\nNo, no, no, crazy alcoholic, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.020\nAnd I went to couples therapy.\n\n01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.020\nAnd I went to couples therapy.\n\n01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.020\nWhy do you have a microphone in your hand right now?\n\n01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.020\nThis undeserving douchebag that came up here,\n\n01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020\nthat's what I am.\n\n01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.020\nYou have something to say about couples therapy.\n\n01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.020\nIf we track back the conversation a little bit,\n\n01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.020\nwhat's interesting,\n\n01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.020\nif you go back to your comment about diagnosing people...\n\n01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.020\nNo.\n\n01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.020\nDiagnosing people who have a superiority complex.\n\n01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.020\nIt's troubling because those people are like Darwinian geniuses.\n\n01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.020\nThey're gonna take us all over, right?\n\n01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.020\nThey're like the technocratic,\n\n01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.020\nlike capitalistic geniuses.\n\n01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.020\nBut what's interesting about therapy\n\n01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:54.020\nis it's like a bunch of angst rid\n\n01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:56.020\nand people who decided that human compassion\n\n01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.020\nis actually more important.\n\n01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:01.020\nThat's why they're diagnosing things like\n\n01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.020\nsuperiority complex.\n\n01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.020\nYou expected an applause break that you did not get.\n\n01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.020\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.020\nI thought you were kind of like...\n\n01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.020\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:13.020\nAs long as we're doing philosophy though,\n\n01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.020\nyou're a Socrates, you care enough\n\n01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.020\nto listen to a rambling idiot like myself.\n\n01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020\nI'm not a Socrates guy.\n\n01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.020\nMr. Lively, you came up to support couples therapy, right?\n\n01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.020\nNo, it's interesting.\n\n01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.020\nDid I misunderstand?\n\n01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.020\nNo, it's interesting.\n\n01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.020\nI missed the thesis.\n\n01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.020\nWhat's going on?\n\n01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.020\nYeah, I don't know that there's much of a thesis.\n\n01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.020\nGet the fuck out the stairs!\n\n01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.020\nHe has sent me back down.\n\n01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:40.020\nWe can't all be on stage.\n\n01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:44.020\nBut it is notable that there are so many people\n\n01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:48.020\nthat are shooting their hands up in support of therapy.\n\n01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.020\nThere's got to be a way for you to gracefully...\n\n01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.020\nI have a way.\n\n01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.020\nLet's supplant James Lively.\n\n01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.020\nThank you very much, James Lively.\n\n01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:58.020\nLet's bring up Spencer Crittendale.\n\n01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.020\nIs he here?\n\n01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.020\nHe's not here?\n\n01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.020\nHe's not here!\n\n01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.020\nDon't tell James Lively that.\n\n01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.020\nI was sitting here with a message for you.\n\n01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.020\nOh, shit.\n\n01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.020\nWhere's Spencer?\n\n01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.020\nHe would like to take the week off.\n\n01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:17.020\nSpencer has grown up.\n\n01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.020\nHe's like...\n\n01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.020\nThank you, James.\n\n01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.020\nHe's got his...\n\n01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.020\nThank you, James.\n\n01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.020\nThank you.\n\n01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:24.020\nI have no idea what happened, but thank you.\n\n01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.020\nSorry, young lady.\n\n01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.020\nI didn't know...\n\n01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.020\nDoctor Amber, we were making headway here.\n\n01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.020\nI think we were making headway here.\n\n01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:34.020\nDoctor Amber, we were making headway here.\n\n01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:35.020\nShe gave it to me.\n\n01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.020\nOh, well, she's...\n\n01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.020\nYes.\n\n01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.020\nHi, Dan.\n\n01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:42.020\nWould you consider seeing somebody like Doctor Amber\n\n01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.020\nor somebody in her ilk?\n\n01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.020\nI don't know if I would...\n\n01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.020\nIf her name was Doctor Amber, I would...\n\n01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.020\nI would feel too nervous that when I came home\n\n01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:54.020\nand my fiancee asked me how it went with Doctor Amber,\n\n01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.020\nI would be like,\n\n01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.020\nFine!\n\n01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.020\nAnd it would be like...\n\n01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.020\nI made lots of...\n\n01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.020\nYeah.\n\n01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.020\nEarlier, you said that Doctor Amber wasn't on my side.\n\n01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.020\nYes, you were, right?\n\n01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.020\nAmber, Amber, don't pick sides.\n\n01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:17.020\nNot in an on my side thing.\n\n01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:21.020\nI mean, I think they're fine with us.\n\n01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:22.020\nEverything's fine.\n\n01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:23.020\nNo, I know.\n\n01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:25.020\nWe could have some tools.\n\n01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.020\nWe could use some tools.\n\n01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.020\nDan, let's just say, hypothetically,\n\n01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:33.020\nyou started going to sessions with Doctor Amber, let's say.\n\n01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.020\nBut Erin started...\n\n01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.020\nShe comes back smelling like pina coladas.\n\n01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:43.020\nBut Erin started also seeing one of her other doctors...\n\n01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.020\nDr. Thor.\n\n01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:46.020\nDr. Thor.\n\n01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.020\nWe meet in Asana.\n\n01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.020\nThat's where his office is, Dan.\n\n01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:52.020\nI wanted to actually...\n\n01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:55.020\nI think Doctor Amber, I think that's a weird name\n\n01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:57.020\nto give a person who's a doctor.\n\n01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:01.020\nIt sounds like a strip cheese is imminent.\n\n01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:04.020\nI think it's valuable that I am for the last...\n\n01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.020\nAt least a year and a half.\n\n01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.020\nGet those dollars out, gentlemen.\n\n01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.020\nTaking a shit on the profession of therapy in general.\n\n01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.020\nAnd I don't know.\n\n01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:18.020\nI would like to hear out any perspective from that side.\n\n01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:22.020\nWe never have anybody up here who has the guts to say,\n\n01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:25.020\nokay, I do that thing for a living and I'm not a piece of shit\n\n01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.020\nand I don't...\n\n01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.020\nI don't pray on people and I'm not an agent of compromise.\n\n01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.020\nI do just want people to feel good about themselves,\n\n01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.020\nregardless of how crazy they are.\n\n01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.020\nThat's the thing that I want to understand.\n\n01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:37.020\nShe likes you and appreciates you.\n\n01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.020\nI like Doctor Amber.\n\n01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.020\nI think you should go to Doctor Amber.\n\n01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:46.020\nAmber, how many towns have you heard or have been to?\n\n01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.020\nOh, I listen regularly.\n\n01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.020\nYou should go to Doctor Amber!\n\n01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.020\nWhat about where I go?\n\n01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.020\nThis is a larger, important issue.\n\n01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.020\nI have a follow-up question.\n\n01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:00.020\nDoes something come to your mind?\n\n01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:04.020\nI wouldn't ask you to diagnose Dan, but...\n\n01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.020\nBut you will in this moment.\n\n01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:11.020\nBut having heard, basically, Harmontown is nothing more\n\n01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:16.020\nthan just a huge soliloquy of what's going on with him.\n\n01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.020\nIs there any diagnosis that comes to mind?\n\n01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.020\nYou don't have an answer.\n\n01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:27.020\nI mean, honestly, I don't have an answer for that.\n\n01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.020\nThere isn't one that comes to mind.\n\n01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.020\nIs that really your business diagnosis?\n\n01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:33.020\nNo, I shouldn't diagnose having just heard a podcast.\n\n01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.020\nBut also either...\n\n01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.020\nDoctor Amber for life!\n\n01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.020\nMaybe we'll all be stuck in Amber!\n\n01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:43.020\nA psychologist doesn't diagnose, do they?\n\n01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:45.020\nThey don't prescribe anything.\n\n01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.020\nWhen you do diagnose, we use the DSM-5 now,\n\n01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:52.020\nbut that is by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.020\nThey all sound like real things.\n\n01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.020\nThey are real.\n\n01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.020\nBut they're the ones that can push medication,\n\n01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:01.020\nand so if they come up with diagnoses,\n\n01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.020\nmore of you can qualify for those medications.\n\n01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:07.020\nIf I took insurance and you came to me\n\n01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.020\nand I wanted to be reimbursed for helping you and everything,\n\n01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.020\nI would need to give you a diagnosis.\n\n01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.020\nKind of a conflict of interest.\n\n01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.020\nIt's a terrible system.\n\n01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.020\nBecause you need to actually come up with a label\n\n01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.020\nfor a person who happens to just have a problem with the way the world is.\n\n01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.020\nWhat a weird conflict of interest.\n\n01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:31.020\nThat's not to say that you have wasted your life in your occupation\n\n01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.020\nor that you're not a good person.\n\n01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.020\nBut I will say that means I'm fucking right.\n\n01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:39.020\nThat is fucking horse shit.\n\n01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.020\nThat's capitalism in action.\n\n01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.020\nIf you have a problem with the way the world works,\n\n01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:46.020\nyou're supposed to go to someone in a kiosk,\n\n01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:49.020\nand they are beholden not to your condition,\n\n01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:51.020\nnot to your happiness,\n\n01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.020\nand not even to the happiness of anyone around you,\n\n01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:56.020\nbut to the happiness of your fucking healthcare provider.\n\n01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:01.020\nThey're beholden to corporations, definitions of mental health.\n\n01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:06.020\nThere is no such thing as mental health as defined by a corporation.\n\n01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:11.020\nA corporation defines normality as corporations being human beings\n\n01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.020\nand having votes influencing society.\n\n01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.020\nThat's insanity.\n\n01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:21.020\nIt's insanity that corporations have any power over anybody.\n\n01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.020\nThat's automatically insane.\n\n01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.020\nYou wake up in an insane world.\n\n01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.020\nYou wake up in a world of psychosis.\n\n01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:32.020\nSo by definition, if you feel psychotic,\n\n01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:35.020\nif you think rivers are red and the sky is purple,\n\n01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.020\nyou may possibly be sane.\n\n01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:42.020\nYou may be the only sane person in the world.\n\n01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:44.020\nTaste the rainbow?\n\n01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.020\nFuck you, Skittles!\n\n01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.020\nYou can't taste a rainbow!\n\n01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.020\nPacing Dr. Hamburg.\n\n01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.020\nCode red.\n\n01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.020\nThey will tell you that you can taste a rainbow.\n\n01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.020\nCode rainbow.\n\n01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:59.020\nAnd it's not your fault, but you are part of the beehive,\n\n01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:02.020\nand that's why I don't do it.\n\n01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:05.020\nI don't do it. I won't taste the rainbow.\n\n01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.020\nDo you have any pets, Dr. Amber?\n\n01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:09.020\nI have two cats.\n\n01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.020\nDolly and Jezi.\n\n01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:14.020\nDolly and Jezi.\n\n01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.020\nLet's go to Dr. Amber.\n\n01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:20.020\nI went to school not to learn what the diagnoses are,\n\n01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:25.020\nbut I went to school to learn how to help people who present with a certain problem.\n\n01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:28.020\nLots of psychologists, lots of people are unhappy with the DSM,\n\n01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:31.020\nif people know what that is, the big book of mental illness.\n\n01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.020\nThere's huge controversy about it,\n\n01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.020\nbut I can still be a psychologist and throw some label on something,\n\n01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:40.020\nbut still treat the real issue.\n\n01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.020\nIf you have something you want to work on, we work on that,\n\n01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.020\nand I don't think too much about something I wrote on an insurance form.\n\n01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.020\nBut you have to write something.\n\n01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.020\nIf I take the insurance I have to, if I took cash, I'd say,\n\n01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.020\nyou're just troubled, let's just talk.\n\n01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.020\nHow much cash would you take?\n\n01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.020\nHow much are you willing to get?\n\n01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.020\nFucking too much for me to keep coming back.\n\n01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:03.020\nIf you happen to be a really smart fucking dude\n\n01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:05.020\nwho had a bunch of fucking problems,\n\n01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.020\nI would go bankrupt trying to set my mind straight.\n\n01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:09.020\nMaybe.\n\n01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.020\nFor sure.\n\n01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:14.020\nI mean, most charge between $150 and $200 an hour.\n\n01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.020\nWhat?\n\n01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:21.020\nThe dude that was working on me was charging more than my rent a month.\n\n01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:24.020\nIt was like, I loved it.\n\n01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.020\nHe was great, but fucking whatever.\n\n01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:31.020\nApparently, being mentally healthy means you can't live in this society,\n\n01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:34.020\nwhich is what I thought walking in the door.\n\n01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.020\nThat's what makes me crazy.\n\n01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:43.020\nIf tomorrow seems weird, maybe it needs to keep seeming weird.\n\n01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:48.020\nIf you're talking to a fire hydrant, everybody drives by you\n\n01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.020\nand pats their pockets as they walk by.\n\n01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.020\nI'm sorry, I can't help you.\n\n01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:54.020\nYou keep sliding the lever down from there.\n\n01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.020\nIt's like, I'm talking to a fire hydrant.

message.\n\n01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.020\nTherapy is not for everyone,\n\n01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.020\nbut if you're interested,\n\n01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.020\ntry a few until you find one that works.\n\n01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.020\nYou do hear people talk about it tonight,\n\n01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.020\nand it is just finding a connection with someone else.\n\n01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.020\nIf it's not a therapist,\n\n01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.020\nyour podcast is your therapy, I think.\n\n01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.020\nWould you agree?\n\n01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:30.020\nOkay, so stay up here for a second.\n\n01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.020\nNow you're trapped.\n\n01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:33.020\nBecause this brings up a good point.\n\n01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.020\nA dentist gets to say,\n\n01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.020\nthis is where your molar should be.\n\n01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:39.020\nIf your molar is in the front,\n\n01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.020\nthen there's something wrong,\n\n01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.020\nand the dentist can say...\n\n01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:43.020\nWhy are the teeth thinking?\n\n01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.020\nBecause it's an easy analogy\n\n01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.020\nto compare it to another science.\n\n01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:48.020\nOkay.\n\n01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:50.020\nSo with the mind,\n\n01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.020\nas Amber is saying,\n\n01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.020\nit's obviously more nuance than that.\n\n01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.020\nHowever, according to the insurance companies,\n\n01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.020\nit ain't.\n\n01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:59.020\nThat's the problem.\n\n01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.020\nSo what I'm saying to Amber is,\n\n01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:03.020\nin view of that,\n\n01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:05.020\nand the fact that that's how it is,\n\n01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.020\nis your suggestion to people\n\n01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:10.020\nthat, unlike a dentist,\n\n01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:12.020\nwith therapy,\n\n01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.020\nit's beholden upon the consumer\n\n01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.020\nto actually explore\n\n01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.020\nas much as they would with a romantic relationship.\n\n01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.020\nYou have to actually speed date.\n\n01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:21.020\nTotally.\n\n01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:24.020\nIf you go to your first therapist,\n\n01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:26.020\nand you're happy,\n\n01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.020\nyou're fucking up, maybe.\n\n01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:31.020\nAnd you're not really talking to your dentist.\n\n01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.020\nThe way that you might...\n\n01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:36.020\nAnd your teeth are set in order.\n\n01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.020\nBy order of six million years of evolution,\n\n01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.020\nwhereas your brain is...\n\n01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:42.020\nI'm saying, like,\n\n01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:43.020\nso all of you out there\n\n01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.020\nwho are happy with your first therapist,\n\n01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:47.020\nyou're about as happy as people who married\n\n01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.020\nout of high school.\n\n01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.020\nGo fuck yourself.\n\n01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.020\nOh, well done!\n\n01:31:51.020 -->

well done!\n\n01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.020\nEnjoy your divorce!\n\n01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.020\nStacy and Steve.\n\n01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.020\nOh, you were so cute together, remember?\n\n01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.020\nYou fucked up!\n\n01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.020\nWhat do you think the odds were?\n\n01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.020\nSorry, Zoe, you're raising your hand.\n\n01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:12.020\nI have something to say.\n\n01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.020\nAmber's like,\n\n01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:14.020\nGod damn it,\n\n01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.020\nwhat do I got to do to get out of here?\n\n01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.020\nAct three.\n\n01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:20.020\nSo, my first therapist was the one who got...\n\n01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:23.020\nhelped me get out of my first unhappy marriage.\n\n01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.020\nOkay, all right.\n\n01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.020\nIt's a good one.\n\n01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.020\nI'm

01:32:32.020\nokay, it's fine, Zoe.\n\n01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.020\nBut don't you think your second therapist\n\n01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.020\nmight have made you really mentally healthy?\n\n01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.020\nTo be fair, my therapist doesn't take insurance,\n\n01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.020\nso she's not beholden to anyone.\n\n01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.020\nI think you're a little jaded,\n\n01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.020\nand people, if you need therapy,\n\n01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.020\nyou should really pursue it.\n\n01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.020\nDon't listen

01:32:55.020\nYeah, you don't want to listen to a fat-rich millionaire\n\n01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:56.020\nwho doesn't speak for...\n\n01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.020\nYeah, I agree with that.\n\n01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:59.020\nI'm also a millionaire.\n\n01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:04.020\nWell, okay, now, see, that doesn't...\n\n01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:06.020\nIt's not a competition, I'm

seriously, it's someone who supports you\n\n01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.020\nand cares about you,\n\n01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.020\nand they're unbiased.\n\n01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:44.020\nNot as much as your second therapist.\n\n01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.020\nI don't know, man.\n\n01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.020\nSo are you saying my second husband\n\n01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.020\nis going to like me

laugh\n\n01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.020\nthan the callback.\n\n01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:03.020\nDon't be so mean to my first therapist.\n\n01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.020\nShe's really

happy when they get married out of high school.\n\n01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.020\nIt's totally different.\n\n01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.020\nIt's two different things.\n\n01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:21.020\nTherapy.\n\n01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:24.020\nZoe, I believe...\n\n01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:26.020\nNo, Zoe, we...\n\n01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:27.020\nZoe, I believe you.\n\n01:34:29.020 -->

though.\n\n01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.020\nNever again!\n\n01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:46.020\nI think that's perfect, though.\n\n01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.020\nI mean, that's perfect.\n\n01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.020\nBut really, everyone should stick with their first therapist.\n\n01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.020\nThey don't have to, they go to...\n\n01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.020\nNo, no, that's fine.\n\n01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.020\nThat's the point, though.\n\n01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.020\nI'm not being cynical.\n\n01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.020\nI'm not being an asshole.\n\n01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.020\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.020\nWhat that represents is the big pudding of...\n\n01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.020\nYou should think of therapy.\n\n01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.020\nI'm saying, Amber, you agree that...\n\n01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.020\nBecause you're being like...\n\n01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.020\nAnd I don't want to throw you under the bus,\n\n01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:13.020\nbut you're saying in this world where you have to...\n\n01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:18.020\nWe should definitely all seek therapy, number one.\n\n01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.020\nNumber two, we should all be really picky.\n\n01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.020\nI don't think she said that.\n\n01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.020\nNo, she didn't say that we should all seek therapy.\n\n01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:26.020\nDon't throw her under the bus at all.\n\n01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020\nI don't understand.\n\n01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.020\nShe's, this is Amber!\n\n01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.020\nAlright, let's let Amber go, so we don't embarrass her anymore.\n\n01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:34.020\nShe did a good job.\n\n01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.020\nAmber's a hero.\n\n01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:38.020\nDr. Amber, get stuck in Amber today!\n\n01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:42.020\nThank you very much.\n\n01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.020\nI hope we didn't embarrass her too much.\n\n01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.020\nI thought she was...\n\n01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.020\nAll Harmontown fans that come up on stage are fantastic.\n\n01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:53.020\nBut that was a tough, that was Daniel and the Lions done.\n\n01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.020\nDr. Amber, I think she acquitted herself quite nicely.\n\n01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:57.020\nNo, absolutely.\n\n01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:59.020\nI also think it's kind of an interesting idea,\n\n01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:02.020\nyou meeting with a therapist who listens to the podcast,\n\n01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.020\nbecause obviously they appreciate you in a certain way.\n\n01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.020\nI also think Zoe's standing up and being like,\n\n01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.020\noh my god, my fucking therapist is...\n\n01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.020\nNo, I think it's great to love your therapist.\n\n01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:17.020\nIt all mitigates the whole thing.\n\n01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.020\nI mean, all I do is stand up here and like,\n\n01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:20.020\nI don't want to be like some jagged, weird,\n\n01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.020\ncharcoal rock guy going, yeah, therapist,\n\n01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.020\nbullshit, I'm going to cut you if you come near me.\n\n01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.020\nAm I wrong?\n\n01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:32.020\nAaron, you support the idea of dead getting therapy.\n\n01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:38.020\nYou have too much in your head, like a weird,\n\n01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.020\na weird microphone porn.\n\n01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.020\nIt's so funny that I can move them in a way\n\n01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.020\nthat makes it a total, like there's a total...\n\n01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:49.020\nPractice makes perfect.\n\n01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:54.020\nSpecial video bonus for that joke.\n\n01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.020\nWhat if I felt some weird pressure to blow a mic\n\n01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.020\nbecause of the video?\n\n01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:07.020\nNo, I mean, Dan's fired up.\n\n01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:08.020\nI'm into that.\n\n01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.020\nJust in general?\n\n01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:15.020\nNo, I mean, speaking, there are passionate feelings\n\n01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:17.020\non the podcast.\n\n01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:19.020\nAnswer the question.\n\n01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:24.020\nYou know, I don't actually think that Dan needs therapy.\n\n01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.020\nYou know why?\n\n01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:27.020\nBecause you told her to say that.\n\n01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:31.020\nNo, because Turnabout's fair play.\n\n01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:33.020\nThat's why.\n\n01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.020\nBecause for the same reason I love her,\n\n01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.020\nand I'm going to marry her,\n\n01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.020\nbecause she don't want to go to her therapist.\n\n01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.020\nI also...\n\n01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.020\nBecause I have the same relationship with therapy,\n\n01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:43.020\nbut I also understand it.\n\n01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.020\nI can't let go of the other mic.\n\n01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.020\nThe last thing she needs is me coming home with you.\n\n01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.020\nBut I do want to do...\n\n01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:52.020\nI would like to go to a couple's therapist\n\n01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.020\nso just so we can have tools.\n\n01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.020\nJust for tools!\n\n01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.020\nErin, Erin, it's good news\n\n01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.020\nbecause I'm about to introduce a new segment.\n\n01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:00.020\nNo!\n\n01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.020\nIt's called Turnabout Therapy is Fair Play.\n\n01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:07.020\nYou guys get to be the each other's therapist for a moment.\n\n01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.020\nOh, okay.\n\n01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:11.020\nNo, everyone hates it.\n\n01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.020\nThe audience rejected your bet.\n\n01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:18.020\nThe audience doesn't want it.\n\n01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:20.020\nIt sounds like a bad idea.\n\n01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.020\nThey rejected it based on the title.\n\n01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:26.020\nMay I reveal...\n\n01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:27.020\nNBC executive.\n\n01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:29.020\nMay I reveal...\n\n01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.020\nThey know a failure when they hear it.\n\n01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:35.020\nMay I reveal a fantasy...\n\n01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:37.020\nA couple nights.\n\n01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.020\nI would like to reveal...\n\n01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.020\nDo you have one more microphone?\n\n01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.020\nMay I reveal a fantasy...\n\n01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.020\nSomeone else are they flaccid.\n\n01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:53.020\nYes, they are, sir.\n\n01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.020\nYes, they are.\n\n01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:58.020\nDon't tell her how to have a good...\n\n01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.020\nBecause they respect me.\n\n01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:03.020\nThey're flaccid because they respect you.\n\n01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:06.020\nBecause they're going to listen to me.\n\n01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.020\nAnd I haven't spoken yet.\n\n01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:11.020\nThey're going to become a wrecked once I've said...\n\n01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:19.020\nErin subscribes to a really high-priced,\n\n01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.020\ntedious brand of pornography\n\n01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:26.020\nin which the woman is surrounded by flaccid penises.\n\n01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:30.020\nA woman is surrounded by flaccid penises.\n\n01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:35.020\nAll the men are like...\n\n01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.020\nShe's too much, bro.\n\n01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.020\nI agree.\n\n01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.020\nI just can't get turned on.\n\n01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.020\nShe's so smart.\n\n01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.020\nI was going to come,\n\n01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.020\nbut she made a really good point just now.\n\n01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.020\nAnd the point is me just rubbing my face\n\n01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:51.020\nagainst them like beaded curtains.\n\n01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:53.020\nOkay, this is my fantasy.\n\n01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:55.020\nThis is my fantasy.\n\n01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.020\nMy fantasy just came true.\n\n01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.020\nWe only have a few minutes left.\n\n01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:05.020\nWe're going to keep this bullet train moving.\n\n01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:09.020\nDear Spencer is not here,\n\n01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:12.020\nbut I have always fantasized.\n\n01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.020\nI mean, I...\n\n01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:16.020\nWow, wow.\n\n01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.020\nWait a second.\n\n01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.020\nI shouldn't be using the word fantasy.\n\n01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.020\nI...\n\n01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:23.020\nIt's no secret.\n\n01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:26.020\nMy beard gently nestles under your tits.\n\n01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:31.020\nSlowly walking up his heart behind you\n\n01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.020\nwith polyhedral balls.\n\n01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.020\nHe sticks a dice tower.\n\n01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.020\nWhat?\n\n01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:46.020\nIn my fantasy, Spencer has polyhedral balls.\n\n01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:48.020\nYeah, that'd be neat.\n\n01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:54.020\nI am not a celebrated, excellent player of D&D.\n\n01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.020\nBut I have always fantasized\n\n01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:03.020\nabout maybe just Dungeon Mastering for a second.\n\n01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:06.020\nAnd...\n\n01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.020\nOh.\n\n01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.020\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.020\nYeah.\n\n01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:18.020\nIf I could just Dungeon...\n\n01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:21.020\nLike, just my own world,\n\n01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.020\nI'll give you guys characters just out of my head\n\n01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.020\nand we can just...\n\n01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.020\nand just let me do it for a second.\n\n01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.020\nThis could go horribly.\n\n01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:29.020\nI have no pickets either.\n\n01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.020\nI'm going to do it.\n\n01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.020\nFor no reason, she's moving to another microphone.\n\n01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.020\nShe has no dice.\n\n01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020\nShe could have stayed right where she was.\n\n01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.020\nNo way.\n\n01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:44.020\nHopped by Nature's Finish.\n\n01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:45.020\nIf you could play the music\n\n01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:47.020\nand I'll recap what happened last week.\n\n01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:52.020\nReally quick, Jeff's character is a pillar head.\n\n01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:57.020\nAnd Dan's character is Shania Twain.\n\n01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:06.020\nI want to check in with Dr. Amber after this is done.\n\n01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.020\nEric, you ready?\n\n01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:10.020\nYeah.\n\n01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:12.020\nBut...\n\n01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.020\nLast week on Arons and Dragons,\n\n01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:21.020\npillar head and Shania Twain were traveling\n\n01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:25.020\nthrough a dark cave filled with amethyst rock\n\n01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:30.020\nand small boxes filled with presents.\n\n01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.020\nShania Twain didn't know what to get\n\n01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:40.020\nfor her mother-in-law's birthday.\n\n01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:45.020\nAnd pillar head was irritated by how much emphasis\n\n01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:48.020\nshe was putting on her mother-in-law's birthday.\n\n01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:53.020\nAlso, a goblin named Nosferatu\n\n01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:58.020\nwas following after him with bags of blood\n\n01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:00.020\nthat he was going to devour\n\n01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:03.020\nand then they were going to metabolize\n\n01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:08.020\ninto flames of death.\n\n01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:14.020\nWill Nosferatu catch up with Shania Twain\n\n01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.020\nand pillar head?\n\n01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.020\nOr will pillar head finally confess\n\n01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:24.020\nhis love of pillars?\n\n01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:30.020\nWho knows what will happen this week\n\n01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:34.020\non Arons and...\n\n01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.020\nDragons!\n\n01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.020\nDragons!\n\n01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:51.020\nWell, as a 17th level samurai,\n\n01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:55.020\nI take out my samurai sword,\n\n01:43:55.020 --> 01:44:00.020\nwhich has a plus 11 against Nosferatu.\n\n01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.020\nGoblins.\n\n01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:06.020\nI do a lunging, dazzling display.\n\n01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.020\nHe's not in your visibility.\n\n01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:09.020\nYou don't see him.\n\n01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:10.020\nHe's falling behind you.\n\n01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.020\nRight now, you're just looking for a
