00:00.000 --> 00:29.300
Hello everybody, welcome to Harmontown at NerdMilts.

00:29.300 --> 00:54.300
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harbett.

00:54.300 --> 01:06.300
It's ridiculous that song.

01:06.300 --> 01:11.300
It's called Little Willie. No offense.

01:11.300 --> 01:17.300
I don't know if you had anything you wanted to talk about tonight, but we got a mysterious package delivered to us in the green room.

01:17.300 --> 01:30.300
It appears to be a self-published book by a man named Daniel Quinn called Beyond Civilization, Humanity's Next Great Adventure.

01:30.300 --> 01:43.300
You're all wondering, do I simply have to wrap something in brown paper and send it to the green room in order to have you focus your episode on it.

01:43.300 --> 01:53.300
Read the first couple sentences.

01:53.300 --> 02:03.300
In Beyond Civilization, Daniel Quinn thinks the unthinkable.

02:03.300 --> 02:07.300
We have to assume Daniel Quinn wrote this.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.300
But that doesn't matter.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.300
Everyone comes to a point in their life when...

02:13.300 --> 02:15.300
Is it possible to think the unthinkable?

02:15.300 --> 02:17.300
Thinks the unthinkable.

02:17.300 --> 02:25.300
We all know there's no one right way to build a bicycle.

02:25.300 --> 02:30.300
You're laughing at that because it's specific, but it's true. That's what hooks me in.

02:30.300 --> 02:39.300
We all know there's no one right way to build a bicycle, no one right way to design an automobile, no one right way to make a pair of shoes.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.300
We're convinced that there must be only one right way to live.

02:44.300 --> 02:48.300
And the one we have is it, no matter what.

02:48.300 --> 02:56.300
So the supposition of the book is that you're a pig-headed asshole.

02:56.300 --> 03:00.300
But no, it looks like...

03:00.300 --> 03:04.300
I feel like there's only one way to build a bicycle.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.300
Certainly two tires have to be involved.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.300
Or you've verged into tricycle territory.

03:12.300 --> 03:16.300
And they have to be in a row, otherwise you'd fall right over.

03:16.300 --> 03:21.300
Oh, I just see already now they're... I don't know.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.300
I could see a thing where there's like two tires, like a Segway.

03:25.300 --> 03:29.300
Daniel Quinn, what are you doing here?

03:29.300 --> 03:32.300
Is a Segway a bicycle? It's got two tires.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.300
No.

03:34.300 --> 03:38.300
The inventor of the Segway would have you believe the Segway is not a bicycle.

03:38.300 --> 03:44.300
He would have in his book called Segway Adventures,

03:44.300 --> 03:47.300
he would have you believe that the Segway is a new invention.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.300
Maybe it's just a bicycle.

03:49.300 --> 03:52.300
Right. So whose side are you on here?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.300
Daniel Quinn's.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.300
You like him for being an iconoclast about...

03:57.300 --> 04:00.300
I like him for asking questions, man.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.300
I like him for sending a secret crazy...

04:03.300 --> 04:06.300
Is his book organized by question? Are there more questions?

04:06.300 --> 04:08.300
It's weird.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.300
Will he ask me to rethink other things?

04:10.300 --> 04:15.300
If you paged through it and looked at it, it looked like it was some riddle book from the 80s.

04:15.300 --> 04:18.300
Each page is just like...

04:18.300 --> 04:22.300
I'm looking over your shoulder. The bottom fourth of every page is blank.

04:22.300 --> 04:27.300
Yeah, because each page is just a thought that he had.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.300
Like one page... look.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.300
Show the audience.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.300
And he often refers to some other book that he wrote.

04:34.300 --> 04:37.300
In My Ishmael, that's a book that he wrote,

04:37.300 --> 04:39.300
I recounted the life of a young man named Jeffrey,

04:39.300 --> 04:41.300
loosely based on Paul Eppinger,

04:41.300 --> 04:44.300
whose journal was published by his father under the title of wrestling.

04:44.300 --> 04:49.300
Why is every bottom fourth of every page blank for notes?

04:49.300 --> 04:52.300
Because he finishes his shit, man.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.300
Because he gets his thoughts out.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.300
Or otherwise the book's only like a pamphlet.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.300
Daniel Quinn, if you're out there, thank you for the book.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.300
Thank you for sending it. I opened it.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.300
Give me the book.

05:06.300 --> 05:11.300
Daniel Quinn, please come down undoubtedly from Canada.

05:11.300 --> 05:14.300
I'm 90% certain you're of Canadian.

05:14.300 --> 05:19.300
And defend this. Defend this use of paper.

05:19.300 --> 05:26.300
I'm looking at two pages where there's no more than 80 characters on the entire two pages.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.300
Okay, part two.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.300
Closing in on the process.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.300
Dot, dot, dot.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.300
And I'm going to come at this with an open mind, Dan.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.300
Well, I mean...

05:37.300 --> 05:38.300
I'm not mocking the person.

05:38.300 --> 05:39.300
Well, yeah.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.300
Like when Eminem writes controversial rap lyrics

05:42.300 --> 05:44.300
and they have somebody on CNN read rap lyrics.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.300
Was defaced and abandoned.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.300
The city's ultimate collapse.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.300
Whatever happened, the city was destroyed.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.300
The collapse may have been caused by...

05:52.300 --> 05:55.300
You're making him sound like a jack-off on purpose.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.300
I'm...

05:57.300 --> 05:58.300
It's unthinkable.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.300
It's unthinkable.

06:00.300 --> 06:04.300
To think the impossible think...

06:04.300 --> 06:07.300
One of these days I'm going to write a book and it will be...

06:07.300 --> 06:10.300
Many of the pages will be empty.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.300
I just don't...

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
Maybe...

06:13.300 --> 06:14.300
How about this?

06:14.300 --> 06:20.300
If every page is going to be equally blank for the bottom fourth or fifth of the page

06:20.300 --> 06:23.300
make a shorter book.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.300
Consolidate it, you're saying.

06:25.300 --> 06:30.300
I'm saying cut the bottom fourth of the book.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.300
Make it a little smaller.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.300
Well, by your logic everything should be on microfiche.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.300
I'm saying...

06:37.300 --> 06:40.300
If I had to flash through this, you could make...

06:40.300 --> 06:45.300
There's certainly room down there to invite a Mad Magazine artist or something.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.300
Yeah.

06:46.300 --> 06:49.300
Certainly there's new levels that could be added.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.300
That's definitely...

06:50.300 --> 06:51.300
I don't know.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.300
Probably not his fault, I think that would go to the publisher.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.300
Right.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.300
The publisher being...

06:57.300 --> 07:00.300
Daniel Quinn...

07:00.300 --> 07:04.300
Wastey McPaperson.

07:04.300 --> 07:08.300
Alright, so we took a dump on some poor kid.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.300
Is he a kid?

07:10.300 --> 07:12.300
I imagine...

07:12.300 --> 07:15.300
I don't think you're 40 and you're doing stuff like that.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.300
I don't know.

07:17.300 --> 07:23.300
Just smacks of a 25-year-old's penetrative lunge into the world.

07:23.300 --> 07:26.300
If I'm being hard on him, it's simply because...

07:26.300 --> 07:29.300
Come on.

07:29.300 --> 07:33.300
Alright, so we hazed the...

07:33.300 --> 07:37.300
You could end one three-line poem and then start a new one

07:37.300 --> 07:39.300
a couple lines beneath that and keep the book...

07:39.300 --> 07:41.300
Did you write a poem in there?

07:41.300 --> 07:42.300
Read it.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.300
Dan?

07:43.300 --> 07:47.300
This is Paige... Who the fuck knows because Paige is our number.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.300
Hey, why Paige knows?

07:50.300 --> 07:51.300
See that?

07:51.300 --> 07:52.300
I could get on board with that.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.300
Yeah.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.300
Paige numbers is just a way to tell the brother he's late.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.300
How many tires should I wear?

07:58.300 --> 07:59.300
Alright.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.300
This is part four toward the new tribalism.

08:02.300 --> 08:07.300
This is a two-and-a-half-line little graffito.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.300
It says,

08:08.300 --> 08:13.300
We are inclined to think of hunters and gatherers as poor because they don't have anything.

08:13.300 --> 08:19.300
Perhaps better to think of them for that reason as free.

08:19.300 --> 08:25.300
Wait, that's attributed to Marshall Solon, so he's just quoting people.

08:25.300 --> 08:29.300
Well, there's stuff he's come upon in his life that he wants to share with you.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.300
Alright.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.300
And you're chastising.

08:32.300 --> 08:36.300
No, I mean, I should write a book.

08:36.300 --> 08:40.300
Alright.

08:40.300 --> 08:44.300
So can we please...

08:44.300 --> 08:48.300
What did we do?

08:48.300 --> 08:49.300
Now we all know what you shouldn't do.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.300
You shouldn't write a book like that.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.300
You shouldn't send it to us.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.300
Again, I say it's more in the publisher.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.300
The format is what's got me.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.300
But I do think it's an interesting idea that we...

09:00.300 --> 09:07.300
Civilizations like bicycles or canopeners or shoes are inventions.

09:07.300 --> 09:12.300
They're systems that we have devised collectively.

09:12.300 --> 09:19.300
They're larger than shoes and canopeners, but they're just little things that we invented.

09:19.300 --> 09:23.300
We've decided at some point that civilizations should resemble...

09:23.300 --> 09:25.300
They should have a certain shape to them.

09:25.300 --> 09:34.300
Because what do you do when your species becomes so successful that it's outbreeding the bears, wolves and cats that used to eat it?

09:34.300 --> 09:37.300
What do you do?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.300
You form a civilization.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.300
You form rules.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.300
You build a big wall.

09:42.300 --> 09:46.300
We can't keep killing each other, gutting each other.

09:46.300 --> 09:54.300
We came up with a very, very thin kind of détente a long time ago.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.300
Like, let's not hurt each other.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.300
Holy shit.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.300
Let's love each other.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.300
Is it the right way?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.300
Do we think of each other in the right way?

10:02.300 --> 10:04.300
If we were to go to the moon, Jeff...

10:04.300 --> 10:08.300
Do you think that people think of each other as people that we shouldn't hurt or use or abuse?

10:08.300 --> 10:09.300
Yeah.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
You do.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.300
Yeah.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.300
I mean, I think if you look around at any...

10:14.300 --> 10:16.300
No, we're doing terrible things to each other.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.300
Yeah, at all times.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.300
Yeah.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.300
But I think...

10:19.300 --> 10:24.300
The only reason we stopped moving and we stopped hunting is because we found out that when you start...

10:24.300 --> 10:27.300
We started mastering metals and stone and masonry and things,

10:27.300 --> 10:31.300
and we could insulate ourselves that we didn't have to keep moving around.

10:31.300 --> 10:36.300
We could start making permanent dwellings, and that gave us leisure time.

10:36.300 --> 10:40.300
And that created things like art and created things like textiles and stuff like that.

10:40.300 --> 10:45.300
Also, it created the idea that men treated women like shit forever,

10:45.300 --> 10:47.300
like all kinds of other goodies.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.300
Yes.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.300
Okay.

10:50.300 --> 10:55.300
So there's an interesting, strange irony there,

10:55.300 --> 11:03.300
because it would seem that mankind kind of is very cruel to itself

11:03.300 --> 11:07.300
when we have shit on our plate.

11:07.300 --> 11:12.300
It all seems like there's a human impulse to be inhuman to each other

11:12.300 --> 11:16.300
when we have the excuse that we have so much shit to do.

11:16.300 --> 11:22.300
But at the same time, strangely enough, gender-wise,

11:22.300 --> 11:29.300
it would seem like luxury begets abuses.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.300
Yeah.

11:30.300 --> 11:35.300
Doesn't it seem like the more dessert, the more free time we get,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.300
the more unfair we are to...

11:37.300 --> 11:41.300
I'm sure I'll get it all the way wrong, because I'm only remembering things poorly.

11:41.300 --> 11:47.300
When things were like hunter-gatherer, they tended to be matriarchal and tended to be feminine.

11:47.300 --> 11:52.300
And the moment that we started building permanent dwellings, it became patrilineal.

11:52.300 --> 11:57.300
If I'm going to build a thing, I'm going to pass it down to my male heir,

11:57.300 --> 12:00.300
and then women would get pushed to the periphery.

12:00.300 --> 12:04.300
It's almost like there's two different tracks that we feel on,

12:04.300 --> 12:10.300
because the history of this amazing country, just to look at that as a microcosm of it,

12:10.300 --> 12:19.300
the insanely, poetically, tragically ironic fact that we built this country on slavery,

12:19.300 --> 12:23.300
which couldn't be a more inhuman act, that you take people from a different culture

12:23.300 --> 12:26.300
and you say to them, you are not human to us.

12:26.300 --> 12:30.300
We choose to use you to benefit ourselves,

12:30.300 --> 12:36.300
and we choose not to care about the happiness and health of you and your progeny.

12:36.300 --> 12:40.300
We choose, in fact, to breed you and herd you as if you were animals,

12:40.300 --> 12:42.300
and there's no other way to put it than that.

12:42.300 --> 12:46.300
And that is the true profanity of slavery.

12:46.300 --> 12:50.300
And to build a country on that, and then to come around and go,

12:50.300 --> 12:53.300
oh, you know what, we were wrong about that.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.300
Actually, boy, is anybody feeling nauseous about this?

12:56.300 --> 13:01.300
Yeah, right around the time that industry affords us the opportunity to replace these people with machines,

13:01.300 --> 13:03.300
yes, we all start to feel nauseous about it.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.300
But kicking and screaming.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.300
And then to give those people the vote,

13:07.300 --> 13:13.300
and then also, then after that, sometime after that, to say to women,

13:13.300 --> 13:17.300
you are now also allowed to participate in who's president.

13:17.300 --> 13:21.300
There's all kinds of amazing things when you focus in on the...

13:21.300 --> 13:25.300
The great modern cities, and I know it would include in New York,

13:25.300 --> 13:27.300
but also like Antwerp and Brussels,

13:27.300 --> 13:33.300
and the great cities of Europe were built on treating people like a resource.

13:33.300 --> 13:38.300
People were murdered by the millions to make great cities,

13:38.300 --> 13:46.300
to get rubber, to get gold, to get really basic things.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.300
That's why if you go to Antwerp and it's sexy,

13:49.300 --> 13:52.300
it's because of just slaughter of a thousand people.

13:52.300 --> 13:57.300
And then women got to vote later, which is fucking amazing.

13:57.300 --> 14:05.300
The women that the men who were hurting each other,

14:05.300 --> 14:11.300
men can have epiphanies about inhumanity,

14:11.300 --> 14:14.300
and the entire time they're having those epiphanies,

14:14.300 --> 14:20.300
they can go home to bed with a woman that they are actively oppressing.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.300
We were at the drawing room a couple weeks ago,

14:24.300 --> 14:27.300
and you said you were writing a thing for Vulture magazine or whatever.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.300
I was asking you about your 20 cultural references.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.300
And there are no women on the list.

14:33.300 --> 14:36.300
Yeah, but you've written about the things that informed you,

14:36.300 --> 14:38.300
and I made a joke, it's like no women, huh?

14:38.300 --> 14:40.300
And you're like, oh shit, you're right.

14:40.300 --> 14:44.300
But then you said Elaine...

14:44.300 --> 14:45.300
What's her name?

14:45.300 --> 14:46.300
Elaine Morgan.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.300
Elaine Morgan, which may or may not be a cultural thing,

14:49.300 --> 14:50.300
but it really is.

14:50.300 --> 14:58.300
But what's your stance on how do you perceive femininity as in culture?

14:58.300 --> 15:00.300
It's a pretty male thing.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.300
Our show tends to end up being a lot of dudes on stage,

15:04.300 --> 15:08.300
and occasionally a woman.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.300
That's the thing that I think is so fascinating about it,

15:11.300 --> 15:14.300
is that mankind has it within him,

15:14.300 --> 15:22.300
to a white man can look at another man

15:22.300 --> 15:25.300
who has different cheekbones or different pigmentation,

15:25.300 --> 15:31.300
and he can switch some switch in his head and say,

15:31.300 --> 15:35.300
oh well, I decide to dehumanize this person.

15:35.300 --> 15:40.300
I decide to commit the worst crime you can commit against another human being,

15:40.300 --> 15:42.300
which is to dehumanize them.

15:42.300 --> 15:47.300
I will in fact profit off of that dehumanization.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.300
I will switch off this thing in my head,

15:49.300 --> 15:51.300
I will abuse this person.

15:51.300 --> 15:58.300
Genocide, just like truly the worst crime you can commit.

15:58.300 --> 16:03.300
And then in that sort of male stereotypical sense,

16:03.300 --> 16:06.300
like watching two guys fight at a bar,

16:06.300 --> 16:10.300
where somebody breaks a bottle and they're slashing at each other,

16:10.300 --> 16:12.300
and then they work out something,

16:12.300 --> 16:14.300
and then they end up with their arms around each other,

16:14.300 --> 16:17.300
and then there's some weird elephant in the room where it's like,

16:17.300 --> 16:20.300
but none of you respect your women.

16:20.300 --> 16:24.300
And then gender politics still eludes us, I think.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.300
It's a really weird thing, because no one wants to,

16:27.300 --> 16:29.300
you don't want to hear about it.

16:29.300 --> 16:33.300
It makes you feel more, it's harder to handle than racial politics.

16:33.300 --> 16:38.300
Because racial politics can come down to some platitude about,

16:38.300 --> 16:42.300
you go, oh, well, yeah, I had an epiphany this morning while brushing my teeth.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.300
My friend's darker skin than me.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.300
That doesn't make him less of a person,

16:46.300 --> 16:49.300
but there are barriers you can't get beyond,

16:49.300 --> 16:51.300
and you're thinking about women.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.300
Your mom was a woman.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.300
If you had a wiener and your mom didn't,

16:56.300 --> 16:59.300
there may be shit that you're carrying into your adulthood.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.300
You may be punishing women for shit,

17:01.300 --> 17:04.300
that you don't know that you're doing it.

17:04.300 --> 17:08.300
Like, they've suffered, man.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.300
What is your relationship with women?

17:10.300 --> 17:12.300
They're beautiful.

17:12.300 --> 17:15.300
They're a groovy bunch of chicks.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.300
I don't know, I don't know.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.300
It's totally, totally un...

17:23.300 --> 17:25.300
I proposed to one, yeah.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.300
No, it's totally untapped for me.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.300
I really don't...

17:29.300 --> 17:31.300
It's uncharted territory.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.300
You said...

17:34.300 --> 17:40.300
I just watched the most recent cut of the Harmon Tour documentary,

17:40.300 --> 17:42.300
and you talk about the fact that, like,

17:42.300 --> 17:44.300
communicating with anybody, any stranger,

17:44.300 --> 17:47.300
even your friends, like, it's always a crisis,

17:47.300 --> 17:51.300
communicating with a stranger, extra crisis.

17:51.300 --> 17:59.300
How comfortable are women more strange to you than other men?

17:59.300 --> 18:02.300
You certainly seem to have a relationship with women

18:02.300 --> 18:06.300
that's, like, a little more fearful.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.300
I don't know.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.300
I'm more fearful than what?

18:11.300 --> 18:14.300
Than a nine-foot-tall guy, than a four-foot-tall guy,

18:14.300 --> 18:16.300
than a guy in a wheelchair,

18:16.300 --> 18:20.300
than a guy with a really weird hat on.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.300
Well, yeah, to the extent that, to great balance,

18:24.300 --> 18:27.300
the guy has to be nine feet tall, like...

18:27.300 --> 18:29.300
Well, that's what I'm saying, though.

18:29.300 --> 18:33.300
That's the unexplored question of gender,

18:33.300 --> 18:37.300
because we have this tendency to, simultaneously,

18:37.300 --> 18:45.300
we talk about the human species as if it's just very neatly divided down the middle,

18:45.300 --> 18:47.300
gender-wise, there's men and there's women,

18:47.300 --> 18:49.300
and then we have all of these...

18:49.300 --> 18:53.300
We have it out politically about race,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.300
and about nationality,

18:55.300 --> 18:58.300
but within all of these nations and all of these races,

18:58.300 --> 19:00.300
there's this...

19:00.300 --> 19:04.300
It's almost like the crime is committed and finished

19:04.300 --> 19:08.300
and gotten away with before it's ever called to court,

19:08.300 --> 19:13.300
because let's face it, we all, like, are born into a world

19:13.300 --> 19:21.300
where we're trained to think about men and women as these...

19:21.300 --> 19:23.300
Let's say you're in a writer's room,

19:23.300 --> 19:26.300
and there are your equal number in terms of sharewriters or whatever,

19:26.300 --> 19:29.300
and there's male writers and female writers.

19:29.300 --> 19:32.300
Do you not have an automatic opinion about...

19:32.300 --> 19:36.300
Or let's say there's a female writer in your writer's room.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.300
Do you carry anything into that?

19:38.300 --> 19:44.300
Yeah, if there's one female writer in a room full of 10 male writers,

19:44.300 --> 19:50.300
I am distracted by how distracting things must be for her.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.300
I get distracted by that.

19:52.300 --> 19:57.300
I would like it to be like half men and half women,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.300
and it rarely can be.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.300
So I find myself thinking about the two women,

20:02.300 --> 20:04.300
for instance, season five of Community Red,

20:04.300 --> 20:07.300
two female writers in the writer's room,

20:07.300 --> 20:11.300
and I find myself filtering things through their experience.

20:11.300 --> 20:16.300
Are we getting too abrasive?

20:16.300 --> 20:21.300
I know that female writers are not tender at all.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.300
That's not what I mean.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.300
But what would this look like on an affidavit later?

20:26.300 --> 20:33.300
It bears thinking,

20:33.300 --> 20:35.300
which is why the easiest thing in the world,

20:35.300 --> 20:37.300
or rather the hardest thing to achieve,

20:37.300 --> 20:39.300
but then the easiest thing to maintain,

20:39.300 --> 20:44.300
is half and half represent the species in the writer's room.

20:44.300 --> 20:52.300
So if a single individual male writer has a tendency to

20:52.300 --> 20:56.300
thrust his chest out and get abrasive in his language,

20:56.300 --> 21:00.300
then he's got a proper amount of women to contend with.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.300
There was a thing, I forget what year it was,

21:02.300 --> 21:04.300
somebody told me a story about,

21:04.300 --> 21:06.300
I think there was like a European Cup championship,

21:06.300 --> 21:10.300
like soccer, like football, proper football,

21:10.300 --> 21:12.300
and it was in the Netherlands,

21:12.300 --> 21:14.300
and I forget what countries were playing,

21:14.300 --> 21:16.300
I think it was held in the Netherlands,

21:16.300 --> 21:19.300
and the Dutch police did a genius thing,

21:19.300 --> 21:21.300
because there were two countries that hated each other

21:21.300 --> 21:22.300
and tend to get pretty violent.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.300
The two different countries, like their fans,

21:24.300 --> 21:27.300
got a little hooligan-y,

21:27.300 --> 21:31.300
and all the cops they put out, women.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.300
Out in the streets, all Dutch female police.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.300
As a story, I'm telling like seventh hand,

21:37.300 --> 21:39.300
but no fighting,

21:39.300 --> 21:41.300
because there was just a bunch of women police out there,

21:41.300 --> 21:45.300
and nobody did anything, nobody wanted to fight.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.300
And he was like, he didn't know if it was because

21:47.300 --> 21:49.300
they all wanted a picture with them,

21:49.300 --> 21:51.300
because they were all like,

21:51.300 --> 21:53.300
hey, we're in history.

21:53.300 --> 21:56.300
But you just eliminated the fact that if you added

21:56.300 --> 22:01.300
more guys to that angsty, like wound up

22:01.300 --> 22:03.300
testosterone-y environment,

22:03.300 --> 22:05.300
if you added more guys with more agendas

22:05.300 --> 22:07.300
and more weapons on them,

22:07.300 --> 22:10.300
not going to help, you just put a bunch of women in the mix

22:10.300 --> 22:13.300
and tempers it, because the idea that you have

22:13.300 --> 22:15.300
a thousand guys in the fucking building together

22:15.300 --> 22:18.300
that have agendas is going to be a fucking bummer.

22:18.300 --> 22:21.300
And that was the greatest moment in police force history

22:21.300 --> 22:25.300
of just saying, let's have some femininity out there

22:25.300 --> 22:27.300
and cool everything the fuck out.

22:27.300 --> 22:30.300
Yeah, but you can defend somebody so quick

22:30.300 --> 22:32.300
by talking about that.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.300
The idea that they have a gender identity,

22:34.300 --> 22:36.300
that they put those women out there,

22:36.300 --> 22:38.300
and that that had any kind of effect for any kind of issue.

22:38.300 --> 22:42.300
We do it here, because we'd be afraid that they get punched

22:42.300 --> 22:44.300
or something terrible would happen.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.300
I think they just did it because they had the idea

22:46.300 --> 22:48.300
that it would cool everything down.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.300
I don't know. Look it up, everybody.

22:51.300 --> 23:00.300
It's so interesting to me, because we all know for a fact.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.300
We all know for an absolute fact.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.300
Erin, get out of here. We need some women on stage.

23:04.300 --> 23:09.300
Thank you.

23:09.300 --> 23:13.300
Hello.

23:13.300 --> 23:18.300
I was squirming backstage because the reason why

23:18.300 --> 23:23.300
I initially really fell for you was your...

23:23.300 --> 23:25.300
Dan.

23:25.300 --> 23:35.300
What you said to me regarding how you felt about women

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
and their...

23:37.300 --> 23:39.300
I said they were...

23:39.300 --> 23:41.300
Thanks.

23:41.300 --> 23:47.300
You said to me that men were so violently opposed to...

23:47.300 --> 23:51.300
Funny men were opposed to funny women,

23:51.300 --> 23:56.300
because they hated women,

23:56.300 --> 23:58.300
because they were so threatened by them,

23:58.300 --> 24:04.300
because women were so dynamic and emotional

24:04.300 --> 24:09.300
and interesting and confident and weird,

24:09.300 --> 24:13.300
and men had a hard time with that.

24:13.300 --> 24:18.300
You weren't making it sound like a guy that just wanted to get laid.

24:18.300 --> 24:22.300
Do you remember that conversation?

24:22.300 --> 24:29.300
Dan said, hey, I think maybe I hate women,

24:29.300 --> 24:36.300
which obviously I was turned off by, but not...

24:36.300 --> 24:38.300
But someone saying, I think I hate women,

24:38.300 --> 24:40.300
but I think I hate them because I love them.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.300
I think I hate them because I want to be them,

24:42.300 --> 24:45.300
because I admire them, because I think they're amazing,

24:45.300 --> 24:49.300
and I am upset by that.

24:49.300 --> 24:52.300
And that was it.

24:52.300 --> 24:56.300
Okay, so gender is obviously the theme of the show tonight,

24:56.300 --> 24:58.300
which I think is important.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.300
Good. Great.

25:00.300 --> 25:04.300
If we go to the moon, it's easy,

25:04.300 --> 25:10.300
not at the risk of offending any of our listeners of color.

25:10.300 --> 25:15.300
Well, and is it gender or is it sex?

25:15.300 --> 25:18.300
I don't... Well, I mean, I don't know.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.300
Dan just made it race somehow.

25:20.300 --> 25:24.300
But race is easy. Race is easy.

25:24.300 --> 25:27.300
Yeah, we've proven that as a country.

25:27.300 --> 25:31.300
Give us 500 years, we'll figure it out.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.300
I know that if you go to the moon

25:34.300 --> 25:36.300
and you want to start a new perfect civilization,

25:36.300 --> 25:38.300
I know that you make the road straight.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.300
You disagree on that. You want a scenic view.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.300
You want it, blah, blah, blah.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.300
On the moon, they're going to tend to be straight.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.300
There's less typography.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.300
I want to do certain logical things.

25:47.300 --> 25:50.300
If I take a group of people to the moon and I start...

25:50.300 --> 25:52.300
Are you saying the roads are going to have to be straight

25:52.300 --> 25:54.300
and aggrid all over the moon?

25:54.300 --> 25:56.300
Don't get too distracted by that.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.300
The big reveal is that Dan and I got engaged,

25:58.300 --> 26:02.300
but Jeff and Dan got married.

26:02.300 --> 26:05.300
I'm just saying that when one fantasizes,

26:05.300 --> 26:07.300
when one expresses their impulse,

26:07.300 --> 26:09.300
and this is a healthy impulse,

26:09.300 --> 26:11.300
everyone in the audience asks yourself,

26:11.300 --> 26:14.300
what would you do if you could start from scratch,

26:14.300 --> 26:16.300
because then you might even actually be able to make

26:16.300 --> 26:18.300
a couple of those things happen down here.

26:18.300 --> 26:23.300
So what would you do about gender?

26:23.300 --> 26:26.300
What is it incumbent upon us?

26:26.300 --> 26:30.300
Because it's very, very easy to talk about race.

26:30.300 --> 26:35.300
Fact, our nation was built on slavery.

26:35.300 --> 26:42.300
Fact, most of the non-Coccozoid Americans,

26:42.300 --> 26:44.300
the African Americans, as we call them,

26:44.300 --> 26:46.300
which I think is a ridiculous phrase,

26:46.300 --> 26:50.300
there's descendants of a practice called slavery,

26:50.300 --> 26:52.300
which is not too long ago,

26:52.300 --> 26:55.300
where we built the entire country on them,

26:55.300 --> 26:58.300
and then we went, okay, we feel bad about this.

26:58.300 --> 27:01.300
Also, it's technologically appropriate.

27:01.300 --> 27:04.300
Now, let's weave this into society.

27:04.300 --> 27:07.300
These are easy facts to deal with,

27:07.300 --> 27:09.300
and you can easily deal with them,

27:09.300 --> 27:11.300
even though you can't easily deal with them

27:11.300 --> 27:13.300
politically and economically,

27:13.300 --> 27:15.300
you can easily deal with them philosophically

27:15.300 --> 27:19.300
by saying such simple, no one can argue with them things,

27:19.300 --> 27:23.300
like, ah, color, who cares?

27:23.300 --> 27:26.300
Easy, easy peasy.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.300
So as far as gender, do you mean?

27:28.300 --> 27:30.300
Gender is not easy.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.300
Right, but are you talking about the way

27:32.300 --> 27:35.300
that the government would address gender,

27:35.300 --> 27:38.300
as far as, like, restrooms and marriage licenses?

27:38.300 --> 27:40.300
I don't know, yeah.

27:40.300 --> 27:42.300
Looking back for a very, very long time,

27:42.300 --> 27:46.300
and what we consider, like, wow, civilization,

27:46.300 --> 27:49.300
it's been gross white dudes controlling shit,

27:49.300 --> 27:52.300
and women have been pushed out

27:52.300 --> 27:55.300
of all fucking conversation at all times,

27:55.300 --> 27:58.300
and the times when I have, like, for instance,

27:58.300 --> 28:00.300
I've been on a television show

28:00.300 --> 28:02.300
where there's been run by all men,

28:02.300 --> 28:04.300
and the men, there were the writers,

28:04.300 --> 28:06.300
and the producers, and the camera,

28:06.300 --> 28:08.300
so you hear arguments, and you hear

28:08.300 --> 28:10.300
a bunch of fucking bullshit all day long.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.300
I've also been on shows where the front line was women,

28:12.300 --> 28:14.300
women were the director's camera,

28:14.300 --> 28:16.300
like, first ADs and stuff like that.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.300
No fucking bullshit.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.300
Communication, they all fucking dealt with stuff.

28:20.300 --> 28:23.300
There was no less problems and no less, like, stakes.

28:23.300 --> 28:26.300
They just managed to deal with it in a much cooler way.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.300
I think you should involve women way more,

28:29.300 --> 28:31.300
and instead of letting a bunch of guys,

28:31.300 --> 28:34.300
like, I run everything because it's gross

28:34.300 --> 28:36.300
and icky and a bunch of fucking cock fighting all the time.

28:36.300 --> 28:39.300
Sure, but that would protest too much.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.300
But...

28:40.300 --> 28:41.300
I protest too much about what?

28:41.300 --> 28:43.300
Well, obviously.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.300
Yeah, I mean...

28:45.300 --> 28:47.300
I'm not a hero for saying that,

28:47.300 --> 28:49.300
it's just ridiculous, the idea that

28:49.300 --> 28:52.300
all of our statues are a bunch of dudes,

28:52.300 --> 28:54.300
and when we ever put a woman on a coin,

28:54.300 --> 28:56.300
it's ironic, like it's fucking hilarious.

28:56.300 --> 29:03.300
Like, we live in a needlessly male world.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.300
It's so stupid.

29:05.300 --> 29:08.300
Right, but we don't, but we don't.

29:08.300 --> 29:11.300
We do, but we...

29:11.300 --> 29:14.300
Okay, but do you actually, like,

29:14.300 --> 29:15.300
is there...

29:15.300 --> 29:17.300
Okay, fantasize in your head.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.300
I'm on a unicorn.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.300
We're landing on the moon tomorrow.

29:21.300 --> 29:22.300
Right.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.300
There's a rocket ship full of 100 people.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.300
That's 40 unicorns.

29:27.300 --> 29:29.300
Let's assume 50 men and 50 women.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.300
Let's assume that we're splitting it down the middle.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.300
Okay.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.300
I don't know if I'm making a mistake assuming that,

29:35.300 --> 29:39.300
but it's 100 people, 50 men, 50 women, biologically.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.300
Should be 51, 40 men.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.300
When...

29:42.300 --> 29:44.300
We are going to set up a school.

29:44.300 --> 29:47.300
We're going to teach children.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.300
We're going to...

29:49.300 --> 29:51.300
There's going to be a new generation

29:51.300 --> 29:54.300
after we land on the moon and we pitch our tents

29:54.300 --> 29:56.300
and we do our thing.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.300
The idea is that the following generation

29:59.300 --> 30:02.300
is going to have a chance of being wiped clean

30:02.300 --> 30:04.300
of all kinds of shit,

30:04.300 --> 30:06.300
because that's all we've been trying to do down here forever.

30:06.300 --> 30:09.300
With our funerals for various words

30:09.300 --> 30:12.300
and our letters to TV guide

30:12.300 --> 30:14.300
and our fucking...

30:14.300 --> 30:17.300
We fantasize about a clean slate.

30:17.300 --> 30:20.300
And there's no better clean slate than a colony.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.300
You just take a select group of people

30:22.300 --> 30:24.300
and you just go, okay.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.300
So what are we going to teach these kids about?

30:27.300 --> 30:33.300
Are we going to outlaw gender projection?

30:33.300 --> 30:35.300
Well, that's my question.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.300
Do you mean like sexually it's 50 men and 50 women

30:38.300 --> 30:41.300
or do you mean gender-wise it's 50 men and 50 women?

30:41.300 --> 30:43.300
Before we even get into that,

30:43.300 --> 30:45.300
I think you're talking about the LA perspective

30:45.300 --> 30:47.300
where it's like our 10 of these people,

30:47.300 --> 30:49.300
people that are men that identify as women and blah, blah, blah.

30:49.300 --> 30:54.300
But I'm saying like, let's just start simple.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.300
When we're teaching them the alphabet,

30:57.300 --> 31:02.300
when we're giving them toys,

31:02.300 --> 31:06.300
are we going to commit to the idea

31:06.300 --> 31:08.300
that children need to be programmed

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
and are we...

31:10.300 --> 31:12.300
We know how to do that racially.

31:12.300 --> 31:15.300
We know that you just don't make children racist.

31:15.300 --> 31:20.300
We know that you just simply don't program children with racism.

31:20.300 --> 31:27.300
But we don't know yet how to not program children with gender politics.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.300
We don't understand what that means.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.300
I don't understand what that means.

31:31.300 --> 31:36.300
What would you do in a neutral sterile kind of colony?

31:36.300 --> 31:38.300
Would you...

31:38.300 --> 31:42.300
Are there pitfalls that you avoid?

31:42.300 --> 31:44.300
Kids like toys.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.300
What do you...

31:46.300 --> 31:50.300
Do you have to give them gender-neutral toys?

31:50.300 --> 31:55.300
Do kids start to express gender?

31:55.300 --> 32:02.300
I listened to stories on NPR about kids expressing their gender.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.300
When it's in an ironic capacity,

32:05.300 --> 32:07.300
when the kid is like,

32:07.300 --> 32:14.300
we wanted to support him but he wanted to do the thing and blah blah blah,

32:14.300 --> 32:18.300
we don't know what is politically correct right now, do we?

32:18.300 --> 32:20.300
Right, yeah.

32:20.300 --> 32:24.300
I think the real answer,

32:24.300 --> 32:28.300
if we were really going to the moon and we were really figuring this stuff out,

32:28.300 --> 32:30.300
I think that I would...

32:30.300 --> 32:35.300
Which I think is what most parents do is just follow whatever their kids want.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.300
I don't think that my parents...

32:37.300 --> 32:39.300
My parents were great,

32:39.300 --> 32:41.300
but I don't think that they were progressive in any way.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.300
And I know that when I was growing up,

32:43.300 --> 32:47.300
I played with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

32:47.300 --> 32:49.300
within a Barbie house,

32:49.300 --> 32:52.300
but with no Barbies.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.300
So when were you...

32:54.300 --> 32:57.300
So I think that the real answer,

32:57.300 --> 33:00.300
if we're first sending everyone to the moon and everyone gets a kit

33:00.300 --> 33:04.300
and it's like a bag of Kit Kat bars,

33:04.300 --> 33:06.300
that's a terrible idea.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.300
There's a bag of Weedabix

33:09.300 --> 33:13.300
and cucumbers and tomatoes and eggs.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.300
And then for the kids,

33:15.300 --> 33:19.300
it would just be like a burlap sack that would have matchbox cars,

33:19.300 --> 33:26.300
matchbox cars, but also treasure trolls and dolls.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.300
I mean, it's not...

33:28.300 --> 33:31.300
The real answer is that that's not that big of a deal

33:31.300 --> 33:34.300
because that doesn't mean...

33:34.300 --> 33:37.300
That doesn't identify anyone's sexuality,

33:37.300 --> 33:40.300
like what toys you play with,

33:40.300 --> 33:42.300
but making them available to everyone.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.300
I'm sorry.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.300
Louren Gage, you can't stop it.

33:46.300 --> 33:48.300
I want to bring Camille out.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.300
Let's bring Camille out.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.300
Get his perspective as well.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.300
Camille!

33:54.300 --> 33:56.300
Camille?

33:56.300 --> 34:00.300
We should really be bringing out his Camille's wife, Emily.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.300
She specializes in this stuff, doesn't she?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.300
She's not here, yeah.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.300
She had to drop me off, that sucks.

34:06.300 --> 34:08.300
She does specialize in this stuff.

34:08.300 --> 34:10.300
She thinks about these things for a living, right?

34:10.300 --> 34:12.300
Yeah, she tells me about it, but I don't listen.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.300
We're having fun.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.300
It is...

34:16.300 --> 34:18.300
By the way, was that book you guys reading?

34:18.300 --> 34:20.300
That was Daniel Quinn?

34:20.300 --> 34:22.300
Yeah.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.300
I know who...

34:24.300 --> 34:26.300
You know Daniel Quinn?

34:26.300 --> 34:28.300
I just read one of his books in college

34:28.300 --> 34:30.300
so much.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.300
It's called Ishmael was his book.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.300
He refers to it in that book?

34:34.300 --> 34:36.300
Yeah, no, he's up his own ass.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.300
I don't want to get off topic,

34:38.300 --> 34:40.300
but Ishmael is about this gorilla

34:40.300 --> 34:42.300
that teaches this guy the right way to live

34:42.300 --> 34:44.300
and civilization is fucked up,

34:44.300 --> 34:46.300
and it's basically he's sort of advocating

34:46.300 --> 34:48.300
that we don't help other countries

34:48.300 --> 34:50.300
and just kind of let them

34:50.300 --> 34:52.300
die when they get diseases.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.300
Anyway, that really is...

34:54.300 --> 34:56.300
For real? That's this guy?

34:56.300 --> 34:58.300
See, I didn't like the book based on

34:58.300 --> 35:00.300
format.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.300
I like finding out

35:02.300 --> 35:04.300
that you don't like him for real reasons.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.300
Yeah, there's so much to hate about it.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.300
I thought it was poetry from far away.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.300
Well, it's written...

35:10.300 --> 35:12.300
You look at it and you think, oh, it's sucky.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.300
He comings. He doesn't care about format,

35:14.300 --> 35:16.300
but also he comings had fucking content.

35:16.300 --> 35:18.300
Also, it was

35:18.300 --> 35:20.300
Anthropology 101 and everyone else in the class

35:20.300 --> 35:22.300
was blown away by this book

35:22.300 --> 35:24.300
and how it changed their lives,

35:24.300 --> 35:26.300
and I really, really had such

35:26.300 --> 35:28.300
a visceral negative reaction to it.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.300
There's a chapter in here that says, I eat bets.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.300
I'm just saying.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.300
So Camille, are you and Emily going to have kids

35:34.300 --> 35:36.300
start to pry?

35:36.300 --> 35:38.300
I mean, yeah.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.300
Yeah, I hope so,

35:40.300 --> 35:42.300
unless, you know, one of us...

35:42.300 --> 35:44.300
The rest of that sentence is with us.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.300
Is this a new thing?

35:46.300 --> 35:48.300
Well, you've heard

35:48.300 --> 35:50.300
of these kid partnerships, right?

35:50.300 --> 35:52.300
No.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.300
You find another couple

35:54.300 --> 35:56.300
who you admire.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.300
It's like a key party.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.300
Yeah, it's like a key party.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.300
It's called a womb...

36:02.300 --> 36:04.300
womb blast.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.300
Yeah.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.300
And you just switch babies?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.300
No, no, no, no, no.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.300
We just say to you, so Camille

36:12.300 --> 36:14.300
and Emily, like, you guys are having kids?

36:14.300 --> 36:16.300
Yeah, you have your own kid,

36:16.300 --> 36:18.300
but then after a while, it's our kid.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.300
And our kid is your kid.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.300
It's called a womb blast.

36:22.300 --> 36:24.300
And we have parties,

36:24.300 --> 36:26.300
and we all hang out together.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.300
It's basically like a play date,

36:28.300 --> 36:30.300
but just, like, more official.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.300
No, but I...

36:32.300 --> 36:34.300
Yes, we are, I think,

36:34.300 --> 36:36.300
and if our stuff works,

36:36.300 --> 36:38.300
we will have a kid.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.300
So...

36:40.300 --> 36:42.300
We were talking about

36:42.300 --> 36:44.300
gender politics.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.300
Politics doesn't even

36:46.300 --> 36:48.300
work as a word

36:48.300 --> 36:50.300
for the issue at hand.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.300
What does gender mean?

36:52.300 --> 36:54.300
How much is

36:54.300 --> 36:56.300
gender an artificial construct

36:56.300 --> 36:58.300
in a world where we've started to understand

36:58.300 --> 37:00.300
that race is an artificial construct?

37:00.300 --> 37:02.300
Like, how much do we owe it

37:02.300 --> 37:04.300
to ourselves to think of gender

37:04.300 --> 37:06.300
as an artificial construct?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.300
Maybe I'm just being thick right now.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.300
I don't understand what your hang-up is.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.300
Like gender roles, right?

37:12.300 --> 37:14.300
My hang-up is that in the 1950s,

37:14.300 --> 37:16.300
if you were to take your kid

37:16.300 --> 37:18.300
into the garage

37:18.300 --> 37:20.300
and close the garage door

37:20.300 --> 37:22.300
and train the kid to be racist,

37:22.300 --> 37:24.300
we now know

37:24.300 --> 37:26.300
through the lens of 2014

37:26.300 --> 37:28.300
how to recognize

37:28.300 --> 37:30.300
what you're doing right and wrong with the child.

37:30.300 --> 37:32.300
We can actually,

37:32.300 --> 37:34.300
in a sort of empirical sense,

37:34.300 --> 37:36.300
we can define bad child-breering

37:36.300 --> 37:38.300
to the extent that you're raising

37:38.300 --> 37:40.300
your child to be conscious

37:40.300 --> 37:42.300
of race.

37:42.300 --> 37:44.300
So what's your concern about having a child?

37:44.300 --> 37:46.300
My question is

37:46.300 --> 37:48.300
how now

37:48.300 --> 37:50.300
how does that work with gender?

37:50.300 --> 37:52.300
Emily has friends,

37:52.300 --> 37:54.300
they're a lesbian

37:54.300 --> 37:56.300
and they have a kid

37:56.300 --> 37:58.300
and they are raising the baby gender neutral

37:58.300 --> 38:00.300
and

38:00.300 --> 38:02.300
so the baby is female

38:02.300 --> 38:04.300
and you know the baby has a female name

38:04.300 --> 38:06.300
but what they're doing is there's no

38:06.300 --> 38:08.300
nothing is blue and nothing is pink

38:08.300 --> 38:10.300
and it's not dolls and it's not action figures

38:10.300 --> 38:12.300
so the baby's playing with toys

38:12.300 --> 38:14.300
and a boy or a girl

38:14.300 --> 38:16.300
could play with

38:16.300 --> 38:18.300
but it's hard because they asked

38:18.300 --> 38:20.300
Emily's mom

38:20.300 --> 38:22.300
who's very close to the couple

38:22.300 --> 38:24.300
they asked to give the kid gender neutral stuff

38:24.300 --> 38:26.300
and so the mom bought her

38:26.300 --> 38:28.300
my mother-in-law

38:28.300 --> 38:30.300
and she was trying her best

38:30.300 --> 38:32.300
she bought her

38:32.300 --> 38:34.300
like a flower bow

38:34.300 --> 38:36.300
that was purple instead of pink

38:36.300 --> 38:38.300
and she said purple is like a male color

38:38.300 --> 38:40.300
but this is

38:40.300 --> 38:42.300
this is a key issue

38:42.300 --> 38:44.300
toys are us

38:44.300 --> 38:46.300
you walk into it

38:46.300 --> 38:48.300
aisle 3

38:48.300 --> 38:50.300
aisle 4, aisle 5, aisle 6, aisle 7

38:50.300 --> 38:52.300
they're not, they're based on

38:52.300 --> 38:54.300
ages of children

38:54.300 --> 38:56.300
they're also based on genders of children

38:56.300 --> 38:58.300
I don't know if they've tried

38:58.300 --> 39:00.300
do you, capitalism

39:00.300 --> 39:02.300
so if you're a same sex couple

39:02.300 --> 39:04.300
you're lesbian friends

39:04.300 --> 39:06.300
they're having a kid, they make the decision

39:06.300 --> 39:08.300
we're going to have a gender neutral child

39:08.300 --> 39:10.300
we're not going to fuck with this child

39:10.300 --> 39:12.300
gender-wise

39:12.300 --> 39:14.300
now, they're also in this

39:14.300 --> 39:16.300
larger

39:16.300 --> 39:18.300
colony

39:18.300 --> 39:20.300
yeah, sure

39:20.300 --> 39:22.300
it's impossible to what extent are you

39:22.300 --> 39:24.300
the thing is more about

39:24.300 --> 39:26.300
not saying because the kid

39:26.300 --> 39:28.300
is playing with trucks that they're

39:28.300 --> 39:30.300
gay or straight or male or female

39:30.300 --> 39:32.300
nobody's doing that to a kid

39:32.300 --> 39:34.300
nobody, well maybe some parent

39:34.300 --> 39:36.300
somewhere out there might be going

39:36.300 --> 39:38.300
to play with that truck

39:38.300 --> 39:40.300
I'm sure that's not the right

39:40.300 --> 39:42.300
that's a very straight thing to do

39:42.300 --> 39:44.300
I mean the fact that

39:44.300 --> 39:46.300
it's very invoked to give kids well things

39:46.300 --> 39:48.300
I'm sure there are kids here

39:48.300 --> 39:50.300
I'm sure there are people here who have

39:50.300 --> 39:52.300
young children who

39:52.300 --> 39:54.300
does anyone here have kids

39:54.300 --> 39:56.300
perfect

39:56.300 --> 39:58.300
yeah, that feels right

39:58.300 --> 40:00.300
someone back there has kids

40:00.300 --> 40:02.300
with your hands

40:02.300 --> 40:04.300
as a

40:04.300 --> 40:06.300
nanny in Los Angeles, and maybe this is

40:06.300 --> 40:08.300
different in other places, but it's

40:08.300 --> 40:10.300
very uncool to suggest

40:10.300 --> 40:12.300
to a child

40:12.300 --> 40:14.300
that they should be playing with a certain thing

40:14.300 --> 40:16.300
that kids tend to be attracted to one or the other

40:16.300 --> 40:18.300
but it doesn't mean anything

40:18.300 --> 40:20.300
but I do think it comes from

40:20.300 --> 40:22.300
like you said, the larger society

40:22.300 --> 40:24.300
it's almost impossible to raise a kid completely gender neutral

40:24.300 --> 40:26.300
because as you said, there are these sort of

40:26.300 --> 40:28.300
roles and things and that's just how it is

40:28.300 --> 40:30.300
like

40:30.300 --> 40:32.300
given both things

40:32.300 --> 40:34.300
there's two things

40:34.300 --> 40:36.300
but it's going to be hard even when the kid goes to school

40:36.300 --> 40:38.300
and it's like, oh the boys

40:38.300 --> 40:40.300
are you kidding me?

40:40.300 --> 40:42.300
and the girls play with things that have great shoes

40:42.300 --> 40:44.300
you know

40:44.300 --> 40:46.300
but that is going to happen, I mean we're conditioned

40:46.300 --> 40:48.300
when you're a kid, look at the fucking

40:48.300 --> 40:50.300
commercials for kids toys on TV

40:50.300 --> 40:52.300
like it's all sort of

40:52.300 --> 40:54.300
it's either one or the other and that's really

40:54.300 --> 40:56.300
the thing to do is

40:56.300 --> 40:58.300
if your little girl

40:58.300 --> 41:00.300
is playing with trucks and is talking about

41:00.300 --> 41:02.300
murdering cowboys or whatever

41:02.300 --> 41:04.300
is to not say

41:04.300 --> 41:06.300
you let her murder cowboys

41:06.300 --> 41:08.300
maybe I'm talking about myself

41:08.300 --> 41:10.300
but the thing is to not

41:10.300 --> 41:12.300
like the gender

41:12.300 --> 41:14.300
gender neutral thing is to not say

41:14.300 --> 41:16.300
oh well this child

41:16.300 --> 41:18.300
she's a lesbian, like at four years old

41:18.300 --> 41:20.300
well she's clearly a lesbian, she likes these trucks

41:20.300 --> 41:22.300
she doesn't like these dolls

41:22.300 --> 41:24.300
it's just

41:24.300 --> 41:26.300
about allowing kids to do whatever

41:26.300 --> 41:28.300
because in the

41:28.300 --> 41:30.300
honestly, when a little girl

41:30.300 --> 41:32.300
would play with a truck

41:32.300 --> 41:34.300
that was bad, they would take the truck away

41:34.300 --> 41:36.300
do you take your kid

41:36.300 --> 41:38.300
through Toys R Us

41:38.300 --> 41:40.300
and let the kid

41:40.300 --> 41:42.300
yes, which is not a crazy idea

41:42.300 --> 41:44.300
they get to play with whatever

41:44.300 --> 41:46.300
and that's a good small stuff

41:46.300 --> 41:48.300
so you sort of let the kid be the guide

41:48.300 --> 41:50.300
but we are living

41:50.300 --> 41:52.300
within a dichotomy though

41:52.300 --> 41:54.300
and the kid is being guided

41:54.300 --> 41:56.300
by other stuff other than the parents

41:56.300 --> 41:58.300
that the parents are trying

41:58.300 --> 42:00.300
I remember specifically at some point being like

42:00.300 --> 42:02.300
I'm going to learn to walk more manly

42:02.300 --> 42:04.300
I remember thinking that

42:04.300 --> 42:06.300
and no one told me or made fun of me of the way I walked

42:06.300 --> 42:08.300
but I mean look at me walk

42:08.300 --> 42:10.300
I walk fucking manly now

42:10.300 --> 42:12.300
but I remember that pressure came

42:12.300 --> 42:14.300
and even if nobody tells you

42:14.300 --> 42:16.300
it's all there, it is a dichotomy

42:16.300 --> 42:18.300
Dan and Aaron, you guys are engaged

42:18.300 --> 42:20.300
you're going to be married

42:20.300 --> 42:22.300
probably within the year or so right

42:22.300 --> 42:24.300
are you already thinking about kids

42:24.300 --> 42:26.300
have you talked

42:26.300 --> 42:28.300
yes, yes

42:28.300 --> 42:30.300
is that where this comes from

42:30.300 --> 42:32.300
any part of this conversation or not

42:32.300 --> 42:34.300
no, I don't know why we're talking about gender

42:34.300 --> 42:36.300
the guy gave a book, I don't know

42:36.300 --> 42:38.300
I'm riffed

42:38.300 --> 42:40.300
that guy is not in the crowd

42:40.300 --> 42:42.300
is he the guy who wrote that book

42:42.300 --> 42:44.300
if he was he left

42:44.300 --> 42:46.300
let's say you guys had a kid

42:46.300 --> 42:48.300
and let's say it was

42:48.300 --> 42:50.300
pick it random, guy or girl

42:50.300 --> 42:52.300
guy

42:52.300 --> 42:54.300
how would you approach that

42:54.300 --> 42:56.300
would you have it

42:56.300 --> 42:58.300
I would lovingly

42:58.300 --> 43:00.300
fondle his privates

43:02.300 --> 43:04.300
I would kiss his balls

43:04.300 --> 43:06.300
I'm already doing wrong

43:06.300 --> 43:08.300
what if it's a girl

43:08.300 --> 43:10.300
I would call him King Harmon

43:10.300 --> 43:12.300
as long as she would lovingly fondle her privates too

43:12.300 --> 43:14.300
as long as it's equal

43:14.300 --> 43:16.300
it's called a wraparound

43:18.300 --> 43:20.300
with a baby it's called a wraparound

43:20.300 --> 43:22.300
I have a million questions

43:22.300 --> 43:24.300
I

43:24.300 --> 43:26.300
I would be very happy

43:26.300 --> 43:28.300
if I

43:28.300 --> 43:30.300
was blessed enough that we were able to

43:30.300 --> 43:32.300
conceive a child

43:32.300 --> 43:34.300
what would your first choice be

43:34.300 --> 43:36.300
first choice

43:36.300 --> 43:38.300
let's say on the counter thing

43:38.300 --> 43:40.300
you had to pick

43:40.300 --> 43:42.300
lately

43:42.300 --> 43:44.300
I've been thinking

43:44.300 --> 43:46.300
I'd rather have a girl

43:46.300 --> 43:48.300
because

43:50.300 --> 43:52.300
all I can do is be

43:52.300 --> 43:54.300
ironic

43:54.300 --> 43:56.300
and the

43:56.300 --> 43:58.300
circumcision issue weighs very heavy on me

43:58.300 --> 44:00.300
that's tough

44:00.300 --> 44:02.300
I don't want my son to go through that

44:02.300 --> 44:04.300
or my daughter

44:04.300 --> 44:06.300
we could take our daughter to

44:06.300 --> 44:08.300
Guana and get her circumcised

44:08.300 --> 44:10.300
oh I know some places here

44:10.300 --> 44:12.300
and I feel like same sex children

44:12.300 --> 44:14.300
tend to target

44:14.300 --> 44:16.300
in puberty

44:16.300 --> 44:18.300
they target the same sex parent

44:18.300 --> 44:20.300
I've been reading a lot at Homer

44:22.300 --> 44:24.300
I like the idea of just having a little girl

44:24.300 --> 44:26.300
that's like daddy's little girl

44:26.300 --> 44:28.300
and starts to hate you

44:28.300 --> 44:30.300
when she's 12

44:30.300 --> 44:32.300
and they're like come on take it easy

44:32.300 --> 44:34.300
on your mom she tries hard

44:36.300 --> 44:38.300
it's a little slug out and prom night

44:38.300 --> 44:40.300
no fuck you old man

44:40.300 --> 44:42.300
Dan let's say you had a boy

44:42.300 --> 44:44.300
let's say you had a boy

44:44.300 --> 44:46.300
and it's like he and his

44:46.300 --> 44:48.300
it's time for little league or soccer

44:48.300 --> 44:50.300
yeah fuck you

44:50.300 --> 44:52.300
little satchel

44:52.300 --> 44:54.300
I

44:54.300 --> 44:56.300
would love to have a little boy

44:56.300 --> 44:58.300
I'm absolutely

44:58.300 --> 45:00.300
I'm not

45:00.300 --> 45:02.300
I know that the way karma works

45:02.300 --> 45:04.300
is I will have a kid

45:04.300 --> 45:06.300
and he will be

45:06.300 --> 45:08.300
very into football I know that

45:08.300 --> 45:10.300
but there's nothing wrong with that

45:10.300 --> 45:12.300
it's fine it's fine

45:12.300 --> 45:14.300
I'm psyched about football

45:14.300 --> 45:16.300
I'm psyching myself up about football

45:16.300 --> 45:18.300
for my kids sake

45:18.300 --> 45:20.300
and I swear to God he'll never see a typewriter

45:22.300 --> 45:24.300
he won't be able to read because they don't exist anymore

45:24.300 --> 45:26.300
it'll be a little secret I keep

45:26.300 --> 45:28.300
I felt afraid

45:28.300 --> 45:30.300
on many occasions

45:30.300 --> 45:32.300
of having a girl

45:34.300 --> 45:36.300
yeah you should

45:36.300 --> 45:38.300
they're terrible

45:38.300 --> 45:40.300
now we're getting to it

45:40.300 --> 45:42.300
they're terrifying people

45:44.300 --> 45:46.300
I mean I know this

45:46.300 --> 45:48.300
but they love their dads

45:48.300 --> 45:50.300
not necessarily

45:50.300 --> 45:52.300
shout out to my dad who I love very much

45:52.300 --> 45:54.300
who

45:54.300 --> 45:56.300
very much wants to

45:56.300 --> 45:58.300
perform our wedding

45:58.300 --> 46:00.300
perform at your wedding or perform

46:00.300 --> 46:02.300
no because my dad is a preacher

46:02.300 --> 46:04.300
he wants to

46:04.300 --> 46:06.300
he wants to officiate the wedding

46:06.300 --> 46:08.300
he wants to

46:08.300 --> 46:10.300
yes and we will not allow him

46:10.300 --> 46:12.300
to officiate the wedding

46:12.300 --> 46:14.300
because he's so great

46:14.300 --> 46:16.300
he's so good

46:16.300 --> 46:18.300
at being a wedding officiant

46:18.300 --> 46:20.300
I've always felt

46:20.300 --> 46:22.300
since I was very young

46:22.300 --> 46:24.300
when my dad would randomly say

46:24.300 --> 46:26.300
well perform your wedding

46:26.300 --> 46:28.300
I've always felt really weird about that

46:28.300 --> 46:30.300
he says perform

46:30.300 --> 46:32.300
yeah you perform a wedding

46:32.300 --> 46:34.300
you perform like a right

46:34.300 --> 46:36.300
hundreds of weddings

46:36.300 --> 46:38.300
alright so hey if you have a kid

46:38.300 --> 46:40.300
but

46:40.300 --> 46:42.300
really quick on this subject

46:42.300 --> 46:44.300
and I'm so sorry

46:44.300 --> 46:46.300
I was a nanny in LA for many years

46:46.300 --> 46:48.300
not a parent

46:48.300 --> 46:50.300
but the gender thing

46:50.300 --> 46:52.300
becomes really

46:52.300 --> 46:54.300
unimportant

46:54.300 --> 46:56.300
in LA when everyone's rich

46:56.300 --> 46:58.300
I'm talking about

46:58.300 --> 47:00.300
we're starting a colony

47:00.300 --> 47:02.300
how do you approach things

47:02.300 --> 47:04.300
logically I'm saying what's the right thing to do

47:04.300 --> 47:06.300
we're all well aware as Adam Goldberg

47:06.300 --> 47:08.300
very succinctly said we're in LA

47:08.300 --> 47:10.300
it's been cool to be gay here for 80 years

47:10.300 --> 47:12.300
like we do live

47:12.300 --> 47:14.300
in a bit of a bubble

47:14.300 --> 47:16.300
progressively speaking

47:16.300 --> 47:18.300
I think the thing is to detach

47:18.300 --> 47:20.300
gender identity from

47:20.300 --> 47:22.300
trucks and dolls and whatever

47:22.300 --> 47:24.300
because everyone is like little kids are

47:24.300 --> 47:26.300
attracted to so many different things

47:26.300 --> 47:28.300
and it doesn't mean any sort of

47:28.300 --> 47:30.300
thing

47:30.300 --> 47:32.300
okay so

47:32.300 --> 47:34.300
the bottom line

47:34.300 --> 47:36.300
is that the kid

47:36.300 --> 47:38.300
you take a

47:38.300 --> 47:40.300
bifurcated approach

47:40.300 --> 47:42.300
you buy a dump truck

47:42.300 --> 47:44.300
and a Barbie doll

47:44.300 --> 47:46.300
and you put them in front of them

47:46.300 --> 47:48.300
or you get also board games

47:48.300 --> 47:50.300
I think

47:50.300 --> 47:52.300
I don't think board games

47:52.300 --> 47:54.300
in my head that was the most gender neutral thing

47:54.300 --> 47:56.300
I could take out

47:56.300 --> 47:58.300
jigsaw puzzles

47:58.300 --> 48:00.300
my brother

48:00.300 --> 48:02.300
and my brother Bill and his wife Jill

48:02.300 --> 48:04.300
they have Bill and Jill

48:04.300 --> 48:06.300
that's unfortunate

48:06.300 --> 48:08.300
ask Jeff

48:08.300 --> 48:10.300
what his mother's name was

48:10.300 --> 48:12.300
Phil

48:12.300 --> 48:14.300
my mother's name was

48:14.300 --> 48:16.300
Betty Ann Larson and she married Dwayne Davis

48:16.300 --> 48:18.300
she became Betty Davis

48:18.300 --> 48:20.300
and it suited her because she was

48:20.300 --> 48:22.300
a grand diva

48:22.300 --> 48:24.300
but my brother

48:24.300 --> 48:26.300
and his wife

48:26.300 --> 48:28.300
my sister-in-law

48:28.300 --> 48:30.300
they raised their daughter

48:30.300 --> 48:32.300
they didn't want to give her princess costumes

48:32.300 --> 48:34.300
before she was too old to choose them

48:34.300 --> 48:36.300
like no overtly

48:36.300 --> 48:38.300
girly stuff

48:38.300 --> 48:40.300
as time has passed

48:40.300 --> 48:42.300
Maddox my niece has just absolutely

48:42.300 --> 48:44.300
on her own

48:44.300 --> 48:46.300
she doesn't watch TV, she doesn't watch any commercials

48:46.300 --> 48:48.300
she has never watched TV

48:48.300 --> 48:50.300
they asked her what do you offer for Christmas

48:50.300 --> 48:52.300
or for your birthday she just turned five

48:52.300 --> 48:54.300
they said what do you want

48:54.300 --> 48:56.300
water

48:56.300 --> 48:58.300
water

48:58.300 --> 49:00.300
because she doesn't watch

49:00.300 --> 49:02.300
she's not inundated with advertising

49:02.300 --> 49:04.300
practical

49:04.300 --> 49:06.300
that says you should have this ridiculous thing

49:06.300 --> 49:08.300
or this incredibly feminine thing

49:08.300 --> 49:10.300
or male thing or whatever the fuck

49:10.300 --> 49:12.300
but on her own terms

49:12.300 --> 49:14.300
she has started dressing up

49:14.300 --> 49:16.300
like princesses and fairies because she's into that

49:16.300 --> 49:18.300
and that was never put on her

49:18.300 --> 49:20.300
she has just gravitated towards costumes

49:20.300 --> 49:22.300
and what they made for her for her fifth birthday

49:22.300 --> 49:24.300
was a big wardrobe

49:24.300 --> 49:26.300
and they filled it with costumes

49:26.300 --> 49:28.300
gender-neutral, male, female

49:28.300 --> 49:30.300
there's cowboys, cowgirls, princesses

49:30.300 --> 49:32.300
they gave her water

49:32.300 --> 49:34.300
that's not what she was asking for

49:34.300 --> 49:36.300
they listened to her

49:36.300 --> 49:38.300
they gave her latitude

49:38.300 --> 49:40.300
and gradually as she became

49:40.300 --> 49:42.300
she was a very advanced

49:42.300 --> 49:44.300
like she was advanced two year old

49:44.300 --> 49:46.300
she was advanced three and four and five year old

49:46.300 --> 49:48.300
she very clearly made her own decisions

49:48.300 --> 49:50.300
about what she would like to

49:50.300 --> 49:52.300
walk around the house

49:52.300 --> 49:54.300
I bet if we didn't make kids choose

49:54.300 --> 49:56.300
I think, I know

49:56.300 --> 49:58.300
I would have chosen a dress too

49:58.300 --> 50:00.300
they're so much prettier

50:00.300 --> 50:02.300
look at those eyelashes, holy shit

50:02.300 --> 50:04.300
I know right

50:04.300 --> 50:06.300
my mother very clearly

50:06.300 --> 50:08.300
I really feel like my mother was

50:08.300 --> 50:10.300
hoped that I was a girl

50:10.300 --> 50:12.300
because she had two girls in her first marriage

50:12.300 --> 50:14.300
and then she married my dad

50:14.300 --> 50:16.300
and my brother was the first born

50:16.300 --> 50:18.300
and that marriage was a boy

50:18.300 --> 50:20.300
more and when I came along

50:20.300 --> 50:22.300
I really feel like I was supposed to be a girl

50:22.300 --> 50:24.300
so much of my child

50:24.300 --> 50:26.300
was dressed in tights and dancing and doing things like that

50:26.300 --> 50:28.300
and I really feel like I ought to have been a girl

50:28.300 --> 50:30.300
as far as my mom was concerned

50:30.300 --> 50:32.300
I didn't get it out of my system until I came here

50:32.300 --> 50:34.300
and my first three Halloween's I dressed as

50:34.300 --> 50:36.300
a woman, that was my costume

50:36.300 --> 50:38.300
what were the costumes? just women?

50:38.300 --> 50:40.300
just me wearing a gown

50:40.300 --> 50:42.300
I was just a lady

50:42.300 --> 50:44.300
in a frat way?

50:44.300 --> 50:46.300
in a frat way?

50:46.300 --> 50:48.300
because there are always frat guys who are dressing as

50:48.300 --> 50:50.300
girls

50:50.300 --> 50:52.300
I felt very pretty

50:52.300 --> 50:54.300
I didn't feel like a frat guy

50:54.300 --> 50:56.300
you have no frat element to you

50:56.300 --> 50:58.300
do you know what I mean?

50:58.300 --> 51:00.300
when I was in high school college

51:00.300 --> 51:02.300
there was a thing where girls

51:02.300 --> 51:04.300
love to put me in women's clothing

51:04.300 --> 51:06.300
they just like to dress

51:06.300 --> 51:08.300
certain friends of theirs up

51:08.300 --> 51:10.300
they always love to put me in women's clothing

51:10.300 --> 51:12.300
I was always totally fine with that

51:12.300 --> 51:14.300
kind of a turn on right?

51:14.300 --> 51:16.300
if it turned on for them

51:16.300 --> 51:18.300
it's fine, it didn't really ever mean anything to me

51:18.300 --> 51:20.300
I didn't do it on my own

51:20.300 --> 51:22.300
but however, I love dressing up as a woman

51:22.300 --> 51:24.300
it's great, it feels fine

51:24.300 --> 51:26.300
like

51:26.300 --> 51:28.300
I just don't see why you would force it on

51:30.300 --> 51:32.300
what the point of putting on a child

51:32.300 --> 51:34.300
that there's an idea that you have to do one way or the other

51:34.300 --> 51:36.300
how does anyone would do it unintentionally?

51:36.300 --> 51:38.300
intentionally

51:38.300 --> 51:40.300
I grew up in Los Angeles

51:40.300 --> 51:42.300
my dad taught me

51:42.300 --> 51:44.300
how to throw a curve ball

51:44.300 --> 51:46.300
and a change up and a slider

51:46.300 --> 51:48.300
and all this stuff and I learned how to do all this manly stuff

51:48.300 --> 51:50.300
also I was dancing

51:50.300 --> 51:52.300
I got so much femininity and so much masculinity

51:52.300 --> 51:54.300
and not in any dogmatic way

51:54.300 --> 51:56.300
on either side

51:56.300 --> 51:58.300
I'm the product

51:58.300 --> 52:00.300
of a very Los Angeles life

52:00.300 --> 52:02.300
I grew up in a theater

52:02.300 --> 52:04.300
because you were doing all those plays and because you were in the King and I

52:04.300 --> 52:06.300
did your dad ever do any sort of

52:06.300 --> 52:08.300
like, hey!

52:08.300 --> 52:10.300
I had friends

52:10.300 --> 52:12.300
when I was three years old

52:12.300 --> 52:14.300
there was a guy that directed the first play I was in

52:14.300 --> 52:16.300
he was very clearly, even to a four-year-old me

52:16.300 --> 52:18.300
I knew that he was a queen

52:18.300 --> 52:20.300
he was a big, fancy, Oscar Wilde

52:20.300 --> 52:22.300
like, awesome

52:22.300 --> 52:24.300
grand theater queer

52:24.300 --> 52:26.300
he was awesome

52:26.300 --> 52:28.300
and he was my mother's friend throughout her entire life

52:28.300 --> 52:30.300
until she died

52:30.300 --> 52:32.300
and he was a part of my life and I grew up in the theater

52:32.300 --> 52:34.300
and there were clearly people that

52:34.300 --> 52:36.300
before I knew what sexuality was

52:36.300 --> 52:38.300
before I'd ever had an erection

52:38.300 --> 52:40.300
all anatomy was

52:40.300 --> 52:42.300
I didn't know that there were people in my life

52:42.300 --> 52:44.300
that weren't the way

52:44.300 --> 52:46.300
I was supposed to be

52:46.300 --> 52:48.300
my parents weren't dogmatic about it

52:48.300 --> 52:50.300
I became the most homophobic person in the world

52:50.300 --> 52:52.300
because of the theater

52:52.300 --> 52:54.300
because my parents weren't homophobic

52:54.300 --> 52:56.300
my parents weren't dogmatic

52:56.300 --> 52:58.300
and I feel like I must have talked about this in the show before

52:58.300 --> 53:00.300
maybe not

53:00.300 --> 53:02.300
I was nine years old

53:02.300 --> 53:04.300
or even younger, I had dressers

53:04.300 --> 53:06.300
and they were the great

53:06.300 --> 53:08.300
late 70s, early 80s queens

53:08.300 --> 53:10.300
and they didn't make out

53:10.300 --> 53:12.300
with each other in front of me

53:12.300 --> 53:14.300
and I asked my hairdresser when I was

53:14.300 --> 53:16.300
nine or ten

53:16.300 --> 53:18.300
your hairdresser would make out in front of you

53:18.300 --> 53:20.300
would you get a terrible haircut?

53:20.300 --> 53:22.300
no, you're getting

53:22.300 --> 53:24.300
made up before a play

53:24.300 --> 53:26.300
so I was on Broadway

53:26.300 --> 53:28.300
I was ten years old and I had a

53:28.300 --> 53:30.300
dresser and a hairdresser

53:30.300 --> 53:32.300
you were on Broadway?

53:32.300 --> 53:34.300
I can't deny

53:34.300 --> 53:36.300
you did not know this

53:36.300 --> 53:38.300
with the Yule Brenner

53:38.300 --> 53:40.300
what is your life?

53:40.300 --> 53:42.300
the king and I was your Brenner

53:42.300 --> 53:44.300
when I was a kid

53:44.300 --> 53:46.300
that's fucking crazy

53:46.300 --> 53:48.300
with the Yule Brenner?

53:48.300 --> 53:50.300
yeah, Camille you've never seen a sexier kid

53:50.300 --> 53:52.300
shit

53:52.300 --> 53:54.300
so I had this dresser named Gordon

53:54.300 --> 53:56.300
he was great and he was

53:56.300 --> 53:58.300
so funny

53:58.300 --> 54:00.300
the costumes were really hard to get

54:00.300 --> 54:02.300
there were tons of hooks and snaps and shit like that

54:02.300 --> 54:04.300
really ridiculous old costumes

54:04.300 --> 54:06.300
and then a guy

54:06.300 --> 54:08.300
that he was kind of dating was his hairdresser

54:08.300 --> 54:10.300
guy that would come in and they were just like

54:10.300 --> 54:12.300
french kiss in front of me and I was ten

54:12.300 --> 54:14.300
and then eleven

54:14.300 --> 54:16.300
and I asked the younger guy who was probably

54:16.300 --> 54:18.300
like in his mid-twenties

54:18.300 --> 54:20.300
so did you know you were gay all the time?

54:20.300 --> 54:22.300
did you always know you were going to be gay?

54:22.300 --> 54:24.300
he goes oh no, I didn't know until I was eighteen

54:24.300 --> 54:26.300
I was like who?

54:26.300 --> 54:28.300
don't say that

54:28.300 --> 54:30.300
say you always knew

54:30.300 --> 54:32.300
because not that I felt like I was ever going to get punched

54:32.300 --> 54:34.300
or beaten or

54:34.300 --> 54:36.300
ostracized if I did grow up to be

54:36.300 --> 54:38.300
like a good

54:38.300 --> 54:40.300
seventy percent of the people in that production

54:40.300 --> 54:42.300
were gay

54:42.300 --> 54:44.300
and sadly and absolutely truly

54:44.300 --> 54:46.300
almost all of them debt

54:46.300 --> 54:48.300
from AIDS

54:48.300 --> 54:50.300
I mean that was a big crazy time

54:50.300 --> 54:52.300
this was the early days of that

54:52.300 --> 54:54.300
what was it, eighties?

54:54.300 --> 54:56.300
yeah, this is 84, 85

54:56.300 --> 54:58.300
and like most of that production

54:58.300 --> 55:00.300
is gone

55:00.300 --> 55:02.300
including I think these guys

55:02.300 --> 55:04.300
this guy told me

55:04.300 --> 55:06.300
I thought I was straight until I was eighteen

55:06.300 --> 55:08.300
I got so homophobic and so worried about that

55:08.300 --> 55:10.300
only because of my

55:10.300 --> 55:12.300
being gay is hard I'm sure

55:12.300 --> 55:14.300
and you wouldn't choose it as a young boy

55:14.300 --> 55:16.300
and I was literally

55:16.300 --> 55:18.300
taking off the pictures mount

55:18.300 --> 55:20.300
to go audition for the king and I

55:20.300 --> 55:22.300
embarrassingly so by my mom

55:22.300 --> 55:24.300
and so when I went home at night

55:24.300 --> 55:26.300
or the last thing I did before I went to bed

55:26.300 --> 55:28.300
was close a magazine and it was a picture of a guy

55:28.300 --> 55:30.300
I would keep looking until there was a picture of a woman

55:32.300 --> 55:34.300
but to the point of like

55:34.300 --> 55:36.300
like mania and if I was watching TV

55:36.300 --> 55:38.300
I would turn the TV off and right

55:38.300 --> 55:40.300
last thing was a guy, fuck turn it back on

55:40.300 --> 55:42.300
and wait until there was a picture of a woman

55:42.300 --> 55:44.300
because if the last image of my mind

55:44.300 --> 55:46.300
was a picture of a man

55:46.300 --> 55:48.300
being straight or gay was this toss

55:48.300 --> 55:50.300
of the coin

55:50.300 --> 55:52.300
maybe that's what that guy did

55:52.300 --> 55:54.300
he turned the TV off when it was a guy

55:54.300 --> 55:56.300
at 18

55:56.300 --> 55:58.300
and he turned gay

55:58.300 --> 56:00.300
as a 10 or 11 year old

56:00.300 --> 56:02.300
that was the world that I thought

56:02.300 --> 56:04.300
we lived in and then one day

56:04.300 --> 56:06.300
when I was 12 years old like laying in bed

56:06.300 --> 56:08.300
I just went like oh

56:08.300 --> 56:10.300
I like women

56:10.300 --> 56:12.300
and went to bed

56:12.300 --> 56:14.300
and never did that again but that wasn't because

56:14.300 --> 56:16.300
anybody told or beat it out of me or whatever

56:16.300 --> 56:18.300
but there was a big point in my life

56:18.300 --> 56:20.300
where I felt like I really have to do come to grips

56:20.300 --> 56:22.300
with the fact that like I might not know this

56:22.300 --> 56:24.300
until I'm much older than I am right now

56:24.300 --> 56:26.300
and that will be okay

56:26.300 --> 56:28.300
but it won't be okay because it's fucking hard

56:28.300 --> 56:30.300
you'll get treating like shit

56:30.300 --> 56:32.300
you'll get pushed around

56:32.300 --> 56:34.300
well this is something that you're able to articulate

56:34.300 --> 56:36.300
at the age of 40

56:36.300 --> 56:38.300
looking back on it

56:38.300 --> 56:40.300
because it's as clean cut as straight

56:40.300 --> 56:42.300
versus gay and that's what I'm talking

56:42.300 --> 56:44.300
about because we're

56:44.300 --> 56:46.300
entering a world now where we're becoming

56:46.300 --> 56:48.300
increasingly conscious of

56:48.300 --> 56:50.300
the pressures of

56:50.300 --> 56:52.300
gender identity

56:52.300 --> 56:54.300
and it's

56:54.300 --> 56:56.300
not as clean cut as

56:56.300 --> 56:58.300
straight or gay with gender identity

56:58.300 --> 57:00.300
you don't know how feminine you're

57:00.300 --> 57:02.300
allowed to be or supposed to be

57:02.300 --> 57:04.300
or how masculine you're allowed to be

57:04.300 --> 57:06.300
or supposed to be this isn't about

57:06.300 --> 57:08.300
straight or gay straight or gay comes down

57:08.300 --> 57:10.300
that's our struggle

57:10.300 --> 57:12.300
to turn gender politics into

57:12.300 --> 57:14.300
something as clean cut as racial politics

57:14.300 --> 57:16.300
because your skin

57:16.300 --> 57:18.300
is brown or your skin is white

57:18.300 --> 57:20.300
and you had

57:20.300 --> 57:22.300
sex with a man and put your mouth

57:22.300 --> 57:24.300
on his penis or you didn't

57:24.300 --> 57:26.300
there are

57:26.300 --> 57:28.300
we have friends of Harmontown

57:28.300 --> 57:30.300
who come up here

57:30.300 --> 57:32.300
who look like dudes

57:32.300 --> 57:34.300
and act like dudes

57:34.300 --> 57:36.300
and identify as women

57:36.300 --> 57:38.300
in their hearts and their minds

57:38.300 --> 57:40.300
and it's incumbent upon us

57:40.300 --> 57:42.300
I'm just curious as a guy

57:42.300 --> 57:44.300
who's thinking about having a kid in this new world

57:44.300 --> 57:46.300
and also as a philosophical thought exercise

57:46.300 --> 57:48.300
I'm asking the question

57:48.300 --> 57:50.300
like it doesn't like

57:50.300 --> 57:52.300
look what goes through the young brain

57:52.300 --> 57:54.300
look what carries through

57:54.300 --> 57:56.300
to the 40 year old adult

57:56.300 --> 57:58.300
about when you felt like

57:58.300 --> 58:00.300
gender was being projected on to you

58:00.300 --> 58:02.300
your sexual roles and stuff

58:02.300 --> 58:04.300
I went to the

58:04.300 --> 58:06.300
in the King and I dressing room

58:06.300 --> 58:08.300
there was the dancers dressing room

58:08.300 --> 58:10.300
there was the women's dressing room for the dancers

58:10.300 --> 58:12.300
the chorus and the men's

58:12.300 --> 58:14.300
and I would say there's probably about 20

58:14.300 --> 58:16.300
and the men's dressing room

58:16.300 --> 58:18.300
there were only a couple straight guys in that

58:18.300 --> 58:20.300
most of the dancers were gay guys

58:20.300 --> 58:22.300
and they always had

58:22.300 --> 58:24.300
kind of ironically and wherever we traveled

58:24.300 --> 58:26.300
we did like 13 cities together

58:26.300 --> 58:28.300
there'd be a there'd be two calendars

58:28.300 --> 58:30.300
next to each other one was a calendar of all like

58:30.300 --> 58:32.300
like hot like firemen and like

58:32.300 --> 58:34.300
like naked dudes and then one of

58:34.300 --> 58:36.300
naked women but it was only

58:36.300 --> 58:38.300
for one or two guys

58:38.300 --> 58:40.300
and it was like it was always like

58:40.300 --> 58:42.300
they did it like out of equality

58:42.300 --> 58:44.300
so I was

58:44.300 --> 58:46.300
I was 10 years old and my friend

58:46.300 --> 58:48.300
my understudy Luke went down

58:48.300 --> 58:50.300
you had an understudy

58:50.300 --> 58:52.300
that's fucking

58:52.300 --> 58:54.300
crazy dude

58:54.300 --> 58:56.300
they wouldn't let us not do the show

58:56.300 --> 58:58.300
that's a whole lot of the story

58:58.300 --> 59:00.300
even when I was sick and I chipped the whole front tooth off

59:00.300 --> 59:02.300
and I lost my voice they would not

59:02.300 --> 59:04.300
let you not go on even though

59:04.300 --> 59:06.300
you wanted your understudy to go do it

59:06.300 --> 59:08.300
you were just so good

59:08.300 --> 59:10.300
they just had this weird climate

59:10.300 --> 59:12.300
of they did not want the understudy to go out there

59:12.300 --> 59:14.300
he was also Camille have you seen

59:14.300 --> 59:16.300
a picture of Jeff as a kid

59:16.300 --> 59:18.300
no I mean I'm scared

59:18.300 --> 59:20.300
is there anybody in the audience

59:20.300 --> 59:22.300
I wouldn't imagine

59:22.300 --> 59:24.300
I wasn't doing the story real quick

59:24.300 --> 59:26.300
I walked in with Luke down there

59:26.300 --> 59:28.300
we were looking at the he and I were both looking at

59:28.300 --> 59:30.300
the only

59:30.300 --> 59:32.300
we weren't exposed to a lot of pictures of naked women

59:32.300 --> 59:34.300
so we saw these calendars it was right next to

59:34.300 --> 59:36.300
like like naked guys and then there was

59:36.300 --> 59:38.300
the naked girls and we're looking at them

59:38.300 --> 59:40.300
there was a dude in the fucking cast

59:40.300 --> 59:42.300
god bless him a Hawaiian guy named

59:42.300 --> 59:44.300
Kaipo who was

59:44.300 --> 59:46.300
just as gay as a day in May

59:46.300 --> 59:48.300
he was so fucking

59:48.300 --> 59:50.300
he would always kind of harangas

59:50.300 --> 59:52.300
he was like hello Jeff I know which calendar

59:52.300 --> 59:54.300
you're really looking at

59:54.300 --> 59:56.300
I was like Kaipo I'm fucking 10

59:56.300 --> 59:58.300
he gave me a fucking

59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.300
lighter one time he and this dude Stanley

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.300
gave me a fucking lighter and they had a lighter cover

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.300
like he's a regular big lighter

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.300
but it was inserted into a penis

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.300
that you could flip the head of the

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.300
penis off and open and light

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.300
the cigarette and Kaipo was like Jeff

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.300
could you get this out I can't get it out

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.300
it's stuck and he just sat there and watched

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.300
I didn't get the joke I was just

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.300
struggling with this fake plastic

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.300
penis trying to

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.300
and they sat there giggling and

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.300
like halfway through I'm like are you mother fuckers

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.300
like it was the theater they treat

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.300
you like an adult but it was fucking open

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.300
season on sexuality there

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.300
I feel like for me having

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.300
I think having a kid is so scary anyway

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.300
I think you do the best you can

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.300
I mean it's a job everybody

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.300
has wonderful parents right and we

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.300
all have problems with them we're all signing up

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.300
for a job that no one in history

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.300
has ever nailed

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.300
no one's ever gotten it exactly right

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.300
and we're like yeah we're gonna fucking try

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:56.300
we're gonna be the ones you know it's crazy

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.300
it's Christmas shopping at

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.300
Target and

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.300
walking down the aisles

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.300
I was just

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.300
I was looking for a catchphrase game because we were

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.300
gender neutral toy yeah

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.300
gender neutral

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.300
and just seeing

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.300
because all my friends who have kids are

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.300
raising their kids quote-unquote

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.300
gender neutral

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.300
which I guess just means letting your kid follow

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.300
whatever they'd like which I think most

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.300
parents do but the

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.300
the rows for girls

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.300
pink

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.300
pink like really pink

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.300
and then the rows for boys are black

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.300
and blue like they really

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.300
feels like you have to choose

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.300
between the two

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.300
it's so strong I remember always

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.300
my life until I was like in my

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.300
20s being very obsessed with

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.300
seeming masculine and I was like a little

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.300
kid I was skinny show us

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.300
the walk show us the walk

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.300
I don't know

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.300
I remember I was like

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.300
the key to having a good walk is to

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.300
act like you don't give a shit

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.300
what your walk looks like so I would

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.300
give a shit about having a

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.300
walk that looked like I didn't give a shit

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.300
do you know how old you were

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.300
I was probably 12 or something

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.300
when I was 8 I felt like I was too

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.300
masculine so I created a laugh

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.300
that was more feminine yeah

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.300
let's hear it

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.300
well have you seen

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.300
can you do it? yeah

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.300
have you seen the Looney Tunes witch

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.300
when she leaves?

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.300
I saw that and I thought that was a

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.300
height of femininity for some reason

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.300
so my

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.300
so my laugh

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.300
that I created was

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.300
really

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.300
I remember there was this dude Eugene

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.300
who was like the funniest dude

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.300
in seventh grade

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.300
and then he went away

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.300
for the summer and then he came back

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.300
and he decided that he was going to be like any

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.300
Murphy and he had affected this

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.300
laugh

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.300
it was so bummed out because Eugene

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.300
was so funny

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.300
such a nerdy funny dude and then he came back

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.300
all sexy drenched in cologne

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:06.300
doing this any Murphy laugh

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.300
is there anybody in our audience

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.300
and it's fine if the answer is no

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.300
let it

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.300
let it slide a little we'll bring up Spencer

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.300
and we'll continue to have a great evening

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.300
but I'm just curious

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.300
like

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.300
in this Los Angeles audience

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.300
is there anybody that can speak from the

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.300
surf

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.300
of gender

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.300
somebody that's had

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.300
a discomforting upbringing

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.300
like somebody that can talk about

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.300
the

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.300
you know give us give us more information

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.300
than we have

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.300
because we've been pontificating about

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.300
how you're supposed to raise a kid and what

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.300
you're supposed to imprint on them gender-wise

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.300
is there anybody out there that

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.300
sort of you know went back and forth

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.300
or

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.300
existed in between

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.300
had a weird experience

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.300
or

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300
anybody that wants to is willing to come up

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.300
and talk about it you're willing

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.300
to come up and speak for a little bit

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.300
yeah coming up

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.300
Sarah

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.300
I'm gonna stand I

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.300
I've never had like a gender

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.300
identity

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.300
crisis with myself but I feel like my parents did

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.300
like they didn't think I was girly enough

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.300
my mom was really upset because I didn't want to wear

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.300
makeup and things like that but

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.300
this whole conversation I've kind of been

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.300
hearing

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.300
that it feels

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.300
to you like gender neutrality

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.300
is something that you have to work

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.300
for with a kid and it's sort of like the opposite

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.300
of the default which is trucks and dolls

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.300
but

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.300
the gender system in my

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.300
the gender system that we have is just

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.300
as much of a construct as

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.300
making something gender neutral

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.300
it's just like it's it's beyond trucks and dolls

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.300
like it manifests like gender neutrality

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.300
would also be an artificial construct

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.300
but it would be one that gives more choice

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.300
because the gender system

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.300
we have now takes that choice away

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.300
and the problem that I have

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.300
with with the gender system we have now is not

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.300
just like okay maybe if you let a boy

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.300
not know he's a boy or what being

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.300
a boy means maybe he'll want to play with guns

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.300
and trucks anyway and a lot of little boys do

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.300
but it manifests in like everything

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.300
in your life like I'm constantly coming up

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.300
against this like realization that I don't

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.300
think I can do something because I'm a girl

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.300
even though I'm fully aware of that

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.300
and like just

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.300
one example that I can't stop

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300
thinking about is this motherfucker with

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.300
his feet on the stage

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.300
like that's not something girls do

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.300
you think if you did that as a girl you're thinking like somebody

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.300
would go hey bitch get your feet off the stage

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.300
I think about I think that about

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.300
him constantly

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.300
he is

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.300
way out of line putting his feet on the stage

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.300
I would never see a girl do that

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.300
no matter how like the holes out

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.300
no matter how pink Anatoly shoes are

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.300
they're still all over our stage

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.300
he's Russian it's a whole different thing

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.300
and it feels very phallic

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.300
continue please

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.300
that's it it's just

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.300
it's things like that and you know

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.300
just kind of thinking like man why don't I feel

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.300
like I can do a thing

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.300
because and then it makes

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300
a real difference seeing people that look

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.300
like you do stuff you want to do

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.300
sorry may I ask how old you are

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.300
23

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.300
Sarah Silverman

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.300
I'm just going to say it she said don't tell

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.300
little girls they can do whatever they want to do

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.300
because they would never have

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.300
occurred to them that they couldn't

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.300
and I think just having to tell girls

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.300
that they could be like whatever they want to be

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300
it comes from such a place of

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.300
you know where there are certain things that you feel

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.300
don't feel comfortable doing

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.300
when you say

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.300
people that look like you

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.300
what does that mean to you

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.300
it means gender

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.300
it means sex it means race it means everything

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.300
and it's a kind of thing we're like

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.300
I don't consciously think about it all the time

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.300
when I look at a stage and there's only men on it

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.300
I don't usually think

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.300
oh man it's all men they don't look like me

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.300
but then if a woman comes on stage

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.300
I feel relieved and I

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.300
didn't realize that I was holding my breath

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.300
and that's how I feel

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.300
where were you raised in

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.300
in the Bay Area

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.300
and that's pretty progressive

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.300
so Sarah do you get

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.300
bummed out when

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.300
sometimes I just

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.300
do you come to the show a lot

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.300
oh this is my second time I just moved here

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.300
cool

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.300
do you ever

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.300
cause I feel self conscious about this do you ever feel

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.300
bummed out that

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.300
when you talk about being a girl

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.300
no I'm so glad

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.300
alright thanks Sarah

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.300
it's just feels

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.300
weird to

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.300
it would have been really weird if they had this whole discussion

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.300
and you didn't come to the stage

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.300
what has been glaring really

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.300
when you look back on your childhood

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.300
do you think about

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.300
so you're raised in the Bay Area

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.300
by a parent who are

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.300
what were they trying to do

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.300
to you

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.300
were they on a mission

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.300
they were just trying to do what they thought was normal

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.300
which is what everybody else

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.300
is trying to do

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.300
but it was like

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.300
I remember I always just wanted because I have an older brother

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.300
and I just always wanted to do everything you want to do

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.300
my parents didn't really put much on me

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.300
until you know like puberty

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.300
and then they were like

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.300
they just thought it was weird that I didn't

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.300
hang out with boys

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.300
that they didn't see I don't know

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.300
because they were like alright you're a kid whatever

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.300
play with blocks but

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.300
then after a while I began to see

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.300
concern with them

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.300
and I didn't really understand why

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.300
did they ever discourage you from doing anything that was like

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.300
gender exclusive

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.300
no they just thought I was

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.300
autistic

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.300
no it wasn't gender

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.300
we had a lot of problems but

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.300
most of them were not gender related

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.300
my mom was very like

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.300
I thought I was raising you to be a feminist

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.300
I would do things she didn't think she would kind of use

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.300
like I thought you were supposed to be a strong woman

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.300
I was like I don't know what that means

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.300
I think in a way

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.300
maybe this is totally wrong

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.300
but I feel like for girls

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.300
it's a little more weird

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.300
because the girl things are so

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.300
girly

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.300
they're so babies

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.300
they're so pink houses

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.300
they're so everything whereas boys

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.300
there are trucks and there are models

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:26.300
and all these different things

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.300
are a little weirder to

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.300
but I also do think girls get to have

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.300
a little more variance

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.300
like a little girl playing with a truck is okay

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.300
but a little boy playing with a truck is okay

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.300
yeah no you're right

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.300
that's totally crap

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.300
I feel like the deck is stacked

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.300
well I feel like the deck is stacked against

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.300
girls a little more

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.300
because if a boy

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.300
a boy doesn't have to

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.300
put on a pink chiffon

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.300
dress

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.300
bringing it in order to be perceived as being

01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.300
less masculine

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.300
like

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.300
a boy gets more

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.300
leeway

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.300
a boy is allowed to be for instance

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.300
smart, a nerd

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.300
like I feel like

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.300
if a girl like Mary Curie

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.300
I feel like if she's

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.300
more interested in looking through a microscope

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.300
than

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.300
her coming out party

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.300
I feel like she gets more punished than her male counterpart

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.300
that is true

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.300
being a guy is

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.300
the best

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.300
so everything's in our favor

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.300
but we're all very familiar with the term

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.300
Tom Boy but we don't have the same thing

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.300
exactly that's my point

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.300
at my niece's

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.300
fifth birthday party

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.300
in December

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.300
she has all these costumes and most of them are

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.300
little girl costumes

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.300
because they're for her

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.300
there were a bunch of other kids

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.300
that were there

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.300
but one of them

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.300
there were boys

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.300
so there were four boys there

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.300
and there was only one male

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.300
outfit to put on so all of the guys

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.300
were running around dressed like Cinderella

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.300
and princesses and shit

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.300
and the thing is

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.300
nobody gave it to the parents

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.300
there was a moment like

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.300
this is the first time anybody's ever seen anything like this

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.300
but all the little boys were running around

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.300
these four and five year old six year old boys

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.300
dressed like Johannes and shit and it was hilarious

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.300
and they all like

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.300
they didn't give a fuck

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.300
because they're playing Cowboys and Nindians

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.300
but if you're a little girl

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.300
and you go into your brothers

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.300
and it's all Cowboys and Nindians stuff

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.300
the little girls aren't allowed to dress up

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.300
like a cowboy or Nindian

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.300
they have to dress up like a damsel

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.300
but it was all the parents were running around

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.300
just watching

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.300
my niece Maddox

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.300
enforce that all the boys

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.300
princess outfits

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.300
and nobody gave a fuck

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.300
everybody just like everyone's shoulders relaxed

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.300
like okay it's all gonna be alright

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.300
because like this isn't as it should be

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.300
and it was

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.300
nobody was enforcing anything and the boys

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.300
didn't lose any credit among each other

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300
or in front of anybody

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.300
Emily worked at this facility

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.300
and I don't want to say where it was

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.300
but it was like one four because she's a therapist

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.300
it was for like bad kids

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300
but these were like bad kids

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.300
like done a bunch of drugs and stuff

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.300
so they were all like sort of very obsessed

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.300
with seeming like you know hard and tough

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.300
and because it was all just guys there

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.300
the kids would end up like

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.300
fucking each other

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.300
and then they would have these sort of

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.300
crises they would come to Emily

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.300
be like I think I'm gay and Emily would be like well

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.300
not necessarily you might be but also

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.300
you just have to get this out

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.300
one time she heard

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.300
these two kids were snuggling

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300
and they weren't allowed to go home for Christmas

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.300
and these two like really

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.300
rough and tumble

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.300
like 14 year olds and she heard them

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.300
whisper one guy said to the other

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.300
he's like Merry Christmas baby

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.300
and I think that's what

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.300
they sort of

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.300
it became a safe environment

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.300
to kind of do whatever

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.300
they wanted to do and not have

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.300
to have a label on it you know

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.300
and I think that sort of

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.300
was weirdly kind of freeing for them

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.300
yeah I think

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.300
100% right when you say that

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.300
it's not cool

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.300
for boys to be girly

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.300
but

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.300
boys are really rewarded for being

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.300
funny and goofy and

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.300
putting on girls

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.300
outfits and whatever else like it's not

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.300
like for girls just talking a lot

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.300
yeah they were just talking a lot it sounds

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.300
like Sarah had the same experience

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.300
that I did where

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.300
their parents were kind of panicked

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.300
over the way that

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.300
you were interacting with the world

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.300
and

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.300
we're worried that like you weren't going to be

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.300
I know for sure like my mom

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.300
had an actual conversation with me

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.300
that was about me not

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.300
being pretty enough or like me not

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.300
being pretty or losing weight or

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.300
etc etc like everyone feels really

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:58.300
panicked when they see a girl playing with trucks

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.300
because it's like oh my god like their value

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.300
like what is their

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.300
which might not be true now

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.300
as much especially not in the last year choice

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.300
I mean one was the last time you heard a guy

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:10.300
being called Mouthy you know you don't really

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.300
hear that but there's these certain

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.300
words that are that are sort of

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.300
they're so ingrained and they are used

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.300
to sort of denigrate

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.300
women you know like Emily this will happen

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.300
all the time Emily and I host this video game

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:24.300
podcast it's called the indoor kids listen to it it's great

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.300
but whenever I

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.300
fuck up a video game fact

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.300
they say Emily fucked up a video game it

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.300
always goes on her every single

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.300
time and they also tell her to

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.300
relax all the time which like

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.300
fucking drives me nuts but that's another

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.300
thing like the way Emily is a bitch

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.300
she

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.300
is a mouthy bitch

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.300
no Emily Emily is 100%

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.300
that's interesting because they're

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.300
you notice there aren't any equivalents

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.300
you know how they're out like

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.300
you know

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.300
racially like you have

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.300
the n-word you have

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.300
you have the height of profanity

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.300
when there's a group

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.300
that is not part of the ownership

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.300
class and then we joke

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.300
about how there's no what are you going to

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.300
call us a cracker, honky

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.300
those words don't matter

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.300
there is no

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.300
you can call you can say

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.300
bitch you can say the C word

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.300
you can say there's like five

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.300
words that you can use to

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.300
to indicate that a woman

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.300
is out of line

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.300
and when a guy is really

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.300
out of line it's the

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.300
same words because you're impugn

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.300
their gender

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.300
I am the biggest

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.300
defender of that

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.300
emasculation

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.300
when you really

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.300
really really

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.300
disapprove of a fella

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.300
like I find

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.300
myself emasculating him

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.300
linguistically yes

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.300
that they are a C word

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.300
that they are a T word

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.300
it's the T word

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.300
twat

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.300
I don't think it's common enough

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.300
that you could just say T word

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.300
and we know what you're talking about

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.300
I thought it was titty

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.300
titty face

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.300
there's not a lot to it

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:16.300
what do you do

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.300
from there you get into homophobia

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.300
you could call a guy a cocksucker

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.300
so then Dan what does that mean

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.300
when you say that to a woman

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.300
what does that mean

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:28.300
you're dehumanizing them

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:30.300
if you call a woman a C word

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.300
and if you call a guy the C word

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.300
you're making him like a woman

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.300
which is the worst thing you can say

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.300
they just say it all the time

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.300
stop being a

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:42.300
anyways

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.300
you're probably uncomfortable standing up here

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.300
can I say something

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.300
of course please

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.300
you've heard it

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.300
I promised my friend Eric that if I got up

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.300
and got to talk I would talk about him

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.300
it loves you

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.300
his name is Eric Krasner

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.300
he's going to listen to the podcast

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.300
he's going to be so psyched

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.300
he's one of my best friends

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.300
sounds like a queer

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.300
thank you Sarah

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.300
thank you Eric

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.300
I'm the worst

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.300
what was her name

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.300
where did she go

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.300
is it with a Z

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.300
Sarah

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.300
where are your parents from some other place

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.300
I don't know how else

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.300
to put it

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.300
it's Sarah not Sarah

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.300
you're Irani okay

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.300
your parents got away from the Islamic

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.300
revolution

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.300
nice

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.300
did you speak Farsi

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.300
did you grow up here

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.300
we made you sit down

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.300
then we started interviewing again

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.300
how sex is that

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.300
sit down

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.300
we're talking from a distance

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.300
it's not a good show

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.300
by applause

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.300
how many girls here had a similar

01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:04.300
experience where their

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.300
parents were weird about their

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.300
humble applause

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.300
our parents did that to us

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.300
I'm sure

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.300
a bunch of the guys here

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.300
I'm not

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.300
I'm going to dismiss it

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.300
that's a thing gender politics

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:24.300
what is it

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.300
once you invite Hasbro

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.300
and Mattel

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.300
into

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.300
and

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.300
they only mean

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:36.300
well

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.300
they're not going to try

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.300
they don't mean well

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.300
Mattel does not mean well

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.300
I could argue

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.300
that they do

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.300
mean well

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.300
when you entrust a system like capitalism

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.300
into something organic

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.300
like your gender identity

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.300
you can guarantee

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.300
one thing

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.300
Parker Brothers

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.300
and Mattel

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.300
and these companies

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.300
they're definitely going to go where the heat is

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.300
they have no interest

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.300
in informing

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.300
your gender identity

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.300
based on some glass ceiling

01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.300
they want to maintain

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.300
they want to make money

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.300
and if they think that little boys like

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.300
to shoot things and make them bleed

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.300
they're going to

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.300
become part of a cycle

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.300
that makes little boys

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.300
feel like they want to make things

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.300
bleed

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.300
but I also think that if when you're a kid

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.300
like labeling yourself

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.300
is sort of a powerful thing

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.300
you're figuring out your identity

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.300
and it is easier

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:44.300
straight male, I'm a manly male

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.300
I like sports, you know what I mean

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.300
it's much harder when it's fluid

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.300
so I know that that's a good goal to have

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.300
but for kids that can be a little

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:54.300
it's a little more challenging

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.300
yeah, that's what I'm saying

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:58.300
like you don't look to your fucking

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.300
Saturday morning cartoon

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.300
you don't even look to your god damn parents

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.300
I'm sorry

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.300
like they're

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.300
awash in this shit

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.300
like

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.300
everyone's confused

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.300
and if you

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.300
look to who came before you

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.300
for what you should do

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.300
on your 13th birthday

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.300
and what you should wear and what you should be playing with

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:24.300
what you should be doing

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:26.300
you might get a little bit of truth

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.300
but you're probably going to get a lot of

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.300
misinformation

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.300
and parents

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.300
parents' responsibility

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.300
is to do the best they can

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.300
I guess

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.300
within this maelstrom

01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:42.300
to make sure that there's

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.300
a smorgasbord

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.300
there's also a likelihood

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.300
not because it's a right or wrong way to do it

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.300
it's just because

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.300
everybody got it wrong

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.300
nobody's got it

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.300
no one's ever been convicted of being the world's perfect parent

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.300
you could try

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.300
so hard to make things

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.300
gender-neutral that you

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.300
absolutely create more confusion than there needs to be

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.300
yeah, you can fuck your kid up that way too

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.300
holy crap

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.300
as somebody who was a nanny in LA working with kids

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.300
who grew up with a lot of money

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.300
there's the oppression

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.300
of gender-neutral

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.300
I've told the story a thousand times

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.300
this is such a classic story

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.300
me being a kid growing up in the 70s

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.300
my mom sitting down with me

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.300
I was playing with

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.300
the Sesame Street

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.300
figures

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.300
and Sesame Street was already

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.300
it was a

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.300
multi-racial environment

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.300
so there were these little figures that were different colors

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.300
and my mom

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.300
I remember my mom saying

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.300
can you tell me the difference between this guy

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.300
and this guy

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.300
and I went

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.300
guy who's got a hat on

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.300
that guy doesn't have a hat on and she's like

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.300
really that's the only difference

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.300
and I said yeah

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.300
well the shirt's different

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.300
and my mom

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.300
I remember her going

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.300
this guy is so

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.300
great

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.300
that you

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.300
don't see the difference between them

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.300
because the real difference is that this guy's black

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.300
and this guy's

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:16.300
white

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.300
and you are part of a new generation

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.300
that will not perceive race

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.300
until otherwise

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.300
notified

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.300
this is exactly your origin story

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:28.300
by the way

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.300
this is the same mom

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.300
came and sat on the foot of my bed

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.300
because

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.300
there was a miniseries on tv

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.300
and I remember her coming into my room

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.300
and waking me up and sitting on the foot of my bed

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.300
and saying

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.300
I'm waking you up

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.300
and telling you

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.300
there is going to come a day

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:50.300
when people tell you

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.300
that something called the holocaust

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.300
never happened

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.300
it did happen

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.300
it happened

01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:00.300
they tried to kill all the Jews

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.300
I don't care

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:04.300
who says

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.300
what evidence they present you

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.300
the most well meaning

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.300
how can you get

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:12.300
more progressive than that

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.300
that story is so funny

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.300
because it sounds like it just occurred to her

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.300
it did

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.300
because my mother

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.300
realized things when the television

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.300
said that

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.300
that's why I'm here

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.300
hahaha

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.300
because I am like

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.300
an apocalyptic

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.300
I've climbed up

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.300
to the top of the pyramid

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.300
the thing that told my mom what to think

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:40.300
on Wednesday

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.300
I would say god damn it

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.300
I don't want to wash the dishes and she'd slap me

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.300
and say you don't say god damn it

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:48.300
no one says god damn it

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.300
that's usually the Lord's name in vain

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.300
Thursday night Johnny Carson

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.300
god damn it this fucking

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.300
here

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.300
but mom I gotta

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.300
well Johnny Carson said it so fuck it

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.300
I gotta

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:04.300
get out to where this world

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.300
makes this television

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.300
I am going to control people's thoughts

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.300
I am going to become

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.300
a real person

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.300
well you had to get out to television where it was fine

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.300
because you were on television

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.300
because it's where you make dumb people

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:20.300
think

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.300
period

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.300
everybody

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.300
really quick

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.300
I got a new chair

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.300
that's what we're talking about now

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.300
paradigm shift

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.300
it's not folding

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.300
I don't like it

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.300
it's not folding you don't like this one

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:54.300
I don't know about it

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:56.300
are you afraid of change?

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.300
there's a pillow on it

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.300
there's a pillow on your chair

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.300
there was

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.300
are you saying

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.300
are you implying that my butt ate the pillow

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.300
what are you saying

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.300
no I wasn't having none of that

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.300
Spencer would you agree that

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:14.300
the key to gender neutrality

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.300
is not attributing anything

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.300
to male or female

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.300
I mean labels are important to humanity

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.300
but you can't

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.300
stay stuck on the labels because they're only as useful

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:26.300
as defining the actual thing which is important

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:28.300
what was your favorite toy as a child

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.300
that's a really brave stance by the way

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.300
the key to gender neutrality is

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.300
to not

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.300
imprint any gender on anybody

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.300
oh really

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.300
I had been operating

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.300
under the age old

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.300
idea that the key to

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.300
gender neutrality was to imprint male

01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:48.300
gender on everything

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.300
I don't think I articulated

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.300
what I meant very well

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.300
what I meant was that

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.300
as far as gender neutrality goes

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.300
we say like oh we'll play with a truck

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.300
because that's a boy thing or play with a

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.300
Barbie house because that's a girl thing

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:04.300
it's just like not

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.300
Jeff's walking across the stage

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.300
what's happening? oh let me go get my character

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.300
sheets out

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.300
no but you're right

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.300
it turns out the key to gender neutrality

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.300
is to not

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:18.300
pay attention to gender who would have thought

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:20.300
what?

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.300
I feel like

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.300
we spent an hour and a half not getting to the

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.300
bottom of this at all

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.300
what did you think we would get to the bottom of this

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.300
in an hour and a half that would be like on CNN

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:32.300
front page tomorrow

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.300
Harmontown figures out

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.300
the gender problem

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.300
you see what I mean like I think

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.300
a lesser minded person would approach

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.300
gender neutrality by saying like

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.300
here's a boy thing here's a girl thing

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.300
as opposed to like not

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.300
getting beyond like things being boy

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.300
or girl things like trucks aren't

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.300
necessarily boy things and

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.300
houses aren't necessarily

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.300
I'm killing myself after that

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.300
I get what you're saying I just

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.300
don't know what I can do from here at this point

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:02.300
20 minutes from here

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.300
Spencer what was your favorite

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.300
toy as a

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:08.300
as a young Spencer

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.300
Legos I mean I don't know

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.300
you'd like the dick butt right

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.300
yeah the dick butt

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.300
for me it was Legos and Star Wars

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.300
action figures and that's all I needed

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.300
that's about building your own universe

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.300
boys toys are cooler than

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.300
girls toys

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.300
well that's the thing is like

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.300
it's all about options like

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.300
why don't women have powers because their

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.300
options are limited

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.300
well that's what powers is

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.300
having options powers

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.300
being able to choose your options right

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.300
if you only have pink toys

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:42.300
if you only have the ability to choose pink

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.300
toys you're being limited boys

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.300
boys toys don't have

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.300
a color like you said earlier they're blue or black

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.300
they're not they're every color

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.300
you know pink toys are like girls toys

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.300
so it's just about options

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.300
it's not about saying

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.300
one's better than the other boys toys

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.300
have changed and girls toys

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.300
are still Barbies yeah they really haven't

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.300
changed much it's all about like emulating

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.300
a house life

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.300
yeah right from the girls in the audience

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.300
was anyone else jealous of

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:12.300
boys toys

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.300
because yeah there was more

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.300
there's more types like more options

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.300
I was jealous of your girls toys

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.300
yeah I was jealous of my nieces toys

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.300
their toys had like

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.300
because there was an option that I wasn't exposed to

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.300
I just like that

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.300
like wait you have little ponies

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.300
with hair like my action figures don't have

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.300
hair I left strawberry shortcake

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.300
fucking strawberry they smell great

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.300
fucking purple pie man

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.300
and fucking yeah

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.300
my friend Chris and I

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.300
yeah his older sister had

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.300
strawberry shortcake and we would

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.300
we went into her

01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:48.300
bedroom and you sniff on them

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.300
and we would sniff em

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.300
they were great

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.300
we had a pageant

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300
we had a strawberry shortcake pageant

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.300
and he had a whole room

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.300
full of Star Wars and G.I. Joe stuff

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.300
and like

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:04.300
we were having a beauty pageant

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.300
in his sister's bedroom with

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.300
strawberry shortcake girls

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.300
strawberry shortcake yep

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.300
she smelled the best

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.300
oh it was a

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.300
what about the little pillow

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.300
the pillow-kissing thing you had

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.300
with you with a

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.300
ramstack there's no toys involved in that

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.300
when I was on the fucking road

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.300
I was like a fucking 11 years old

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.300
not you know very prepubescent

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.300
and there was my the guy that played the

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.300
prince there's two male

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.300
kid lead characters

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.300
and the king and I there's the prince

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:42.300
who's the son of the king and Louis the son

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.300
of the teacher it was me

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.300
and Doug Clef

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.300
who was 13 he was going through puberty

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.300
and he uh he

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.300
jerked off in front of us just to show us that

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.300
things came out like

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.300
just to show us that

01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:58.300
things came out

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.300
that's cool

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.300
he was like he was like guys

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:04.300
you're a year and a half younger than me

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.300
watch this

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.300
and we said that

01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:10.300
and it wasn't like oh come on man

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:12.300
we didn't know what the fucking point was

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.300
it was like watching somebody make the world's best

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:16.300
chicken salad sandwich

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.300
like oh I didn't know the recipe for that

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.300
I didn't know that

01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:22.300
what was he looking at was he making eye contact

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.300
with you

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.300
what was he doing what was going on

01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:28.300
he struck your dick it gets bigger

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:30.300
also for my money the guy's dick

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.300
was as big as a thermos

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.300
I had a little

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.300
11 year old dick and this guy had a dick

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.300
like fucking some sort of like wow

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.300
and

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.300
and then he jerked off and a little

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:44.300
drop of white shit came out of it we were like

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.300
fucking interesting interesting

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.300
and then he turned like later on

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.300
we traveled with seven kids

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:54.300
there were four guys

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.300
and three girls had traveled with the show

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.300
with the girls you also showed the girls

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.300
we were talking to the three girls

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.300
afterwards like you know there's a Douglas over here

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:04.300
he can touch his

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:06.300
ding-a-lingy thingy and

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.300
a little bit of white stuff emerges from it

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.300
like magic

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:12.300
and he changed the girls in a very conspiratorial

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.300
tone

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.300
and says Kathy event

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:18.300
and these girls are

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:20.300
12

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.300
13

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.300
girls you guys have the equivalent

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.300
for girls and they're like

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.300
we have our thing

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.300
and they're like yeah yeah we have our thing

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:32.300
and me and Luke

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.300
and the other fucking guys are like what is the thing

01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:36.300
what happens

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.300
like your vagina

01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.300
becomes open

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:42.300
it blooms like a flower

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.300
going back in time

01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:46.300
they were talking about the girls get wet

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.300
they had cracked this mysterious code

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.300
and it was secret

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.300
because they were a year and a half older than us

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:54.300
there was nothing weird about the fact that the Douglas

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.300
just took us to the bathroom and showed us

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.300
what cum looked like

01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.300
I remember in kindergarten

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.300
I got all the kids together

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:04.300
and was like hey I have something to show you

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.300
and then I just showed everyone my penis

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.300
and then

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:10.300
I was like hey you guys

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.300
check this out

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:14.300
and I was, I had it out

01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:16.300
and ultimately did everyone get a good look

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.300
and then they brought my mom in

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.300
that was the whole thing

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.300
do you remember what motivated you

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.300
were you like oh my god I have this thing

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:26.300
I remember just being like

01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.300
oh they haven't seen this

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.300
what was the reaction

01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.300
I think, I don't remember

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.300
I remember it being

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.300
aww, but I'm sure it wasn't that

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.300
you remember it was a what

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.300
aww, aww

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.300
awstruck

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.300
it sounds like Monday morning quarterback

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.300
I showed everyone

01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:52.300
I'm sure I told the story on the harm attempt

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.300
before when I was like 4 or 5

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:56.300
and I took a bath with my niece who was 2 years younger

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.300
than me because I was half

01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.300
6 or even way older

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:02.300
and I saw the difference like plumbing

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:04.300
and I emerged into one of my parents fancy pants

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.300
older cocktail parties

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.300
and I just walked out and said ladies and gentlemen

01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:10.300
I have an announcement to make

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.300
I thought I was laying down some timeless

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.300
wisdom and I said boys

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.300
have wee-wees

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.300
girls have crack-wees

01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.300
and I left the room

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.300
to applause

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.300
to applause

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.300
and I took it as I fucking blew their mind

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:32.300
the applause was holy shit

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.300
that was fucking amazing

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:36.300
and your mom said there's an audition coming up

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:38.300
for the king and I

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:40.300
crack-wees

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.300
crack-wees and I stand by that

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.300
assertion you guys

01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:46.300
my friend was telling me that his friend's kid

01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.300
who was 5 she just learned to masturbate

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.300
like she was scratching herself and she was like

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.300
oh this feels good so she would do it in front

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:54.300
of like company and stuff

01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.300
she would just like whack off this 5 year old girl

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.300
and they were like

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.300
they were like why do you do this

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.300
she's like it feels good they're like when do you stop

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.300
and she said I stop when I see the flowers

01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:08.300
this little 5 year old was fucking

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.300
I think The Rolling Stones wrote a song about that

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:12.300
alright

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:14.300
Spencer if you would let's take us through some

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.300
some fantastic engineering

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:18.300
okay

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.300
keep it to 13 minutes will ya

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.300
yeah

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.300
yeah I will

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.300
what's happening

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.300
last time on Harmontown

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.300
the gang was feeling pretty empty

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:32.300
after their victory against

01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.300
Admiral Darkstar

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.300
maybe it was the fact that the shards of power

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:38.300
were still in the wrong hands

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:40.300
maybe it was because Christopher

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.300
kept barfing everywhere and cut off his penis

01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.300
all

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.300
was not well

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.300
they encountered their friend Morris Goldbright

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:50.300
who made a cameo appearance

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.300
noticing Christopher's strange behavior

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.300
and a stranger stone that Chris

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.300
had dropped from his hand

01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:58.300
the stone burst and at the same time

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.300
Admiral Darkstar's castle

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:02.300
crumbled into a hole in the frozen earth

01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:04.300
this enraged the rogue

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.300
and caused him to attack Quark

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.300
was having none of that however

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.300
and threw Christopher

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.300
severed member into the ice hole

01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:14.300
in response, Chris possessed by ghoulish

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.300
strength hurled Quark down into the ice

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.300
hole himself

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.300
Sharpie left into action and teleported to Quark

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:22.300
carrying them down safely

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.300
with his feather fall

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:26.300
but down where and down why

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.300
we'll find out

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.300
down to why

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:32.300
so

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:38.300
right now Sharpie and I are falling down into a

01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.300
down where

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.300
you got me

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.300
who's got you

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.300
yeah

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.300
so yeah you guys are floating

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:50.300
for quite a while

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:52.300
and you float

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.300
kind of floating diagonally just because that's

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.300
how momentum works

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.300
and you see the crumbled

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.300
ruins of

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.300
the statue

01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.300
of the castle that's fallen through the ice hole

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.300
there's this whole new layer

01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.300
of ground it looks like it's maybe

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.300
700 feet below

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:12.300
you know the surface

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.300
of the earth before so you guys are

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.300
down that far and there's a

01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:18.300
new ground this ground looks gray

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.300
and cracked like dust

01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:22.300
like gray and cracked dust

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:24.300
and you see this

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.300
crumbled destroyed statue

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:28.300
on it looks like

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.300
it's covering or it's falling upon

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.300
like a giant pile of bones

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.300
like maybe a woolly

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.300
mammoth sort of thing

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:38.300
but woolly bones mammoth

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.300
can Sharpie and I feather fall upon

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.300
that and land safely

01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:44.300
well yeah you're falling and you're on this

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:46.300
cracked gray ground

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.300
that's where you are

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.300
you guys are above

01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:52.300
hundreds of feet above us

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:54.300
in this out of this hole

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.300
can you guys see my dick

01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.300
so we landed

01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:00.300
on bones that are

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.300
on the side of a pit

01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.300
or the bottom

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.300
when you're landing it's pretty dark the only thing

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.300
you can see other than this great massive

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:10.300
expanse of like undergroundness

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.300
that you didn't know about

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:14.300
is this just giant crumbled castle

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:16.300
looks like it's on a heap of bones like

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.300
a landed on a heap of bones that's all you can see

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.300
we landed on a heap of bones

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.300
alright

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.300
what you're telling me

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.300
well I mean the castle did you're next to it

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.300
you're kind of looking at it

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.300
or next to a castle that landed on a heap of bones

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:32.300
like a woolly bones mammoth you said

01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.300
yep

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.300
may have said that

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:38.300
Chris is it just me or do they seem pretty casual

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.300
about

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.300
about falling on these bones

01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.300
we're hundreds of feet above

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.300
um

01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:48.300
I pick her up and I toss her down

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:50.300
yeah

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.300
yeah that happens

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.300
do I follow like a feather

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.300
I mean no

01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:04.300
I'm sorry

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.300
that's yeah that's gonna hurt

01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.300
oh boy

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.300
alright

01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:14.300
levitate levitate I have a spell called levitate

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.300
can I cast that on a person

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.300
let's

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.300
I'm gonna not look it up right the second and say yes

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.300
can I target her

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:24.300
if I hear her screaming

01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.300
that's what I'm not looking at

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.300
as Mulraine plummets

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.300
to what is almost certainly her doom

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.300
she gets within maybe

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.300
40 feet of the ground before

01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.300
being slowed and propelled by this

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.300
levitating force that gently

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.300
drifts you down

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.300
to the earth

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.300
you kind of stop like a foot or so above it

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.300
going down

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:48.300
I'm sorry

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.300
first floor

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.300
awesomeness

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:54.300
thank you so much

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.300
well now it happens

01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:58.300
can I if I jump down

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.300
will you guys levitate me too

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.300
listen

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:04.300
I know I've done a lot of bad shit recently

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:06.300
but I think

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:08.300
like throwing the previous person down

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:14.300
but I'm feeling better

01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.300
I don't know how many times

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.300
I have levitate charged

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:22.300
I can shoot an arrow at you

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:24.300
I don't know if that's gonna help

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:26.300
no I don't I don't think it will

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:28.300
it could break your fall maybe

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.300
the arrow if he shoots it up it'll like

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.300
it'll slow me down

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.300
while killing me

01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:36.300
I could craft something

01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.300
well that's true

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:40.300
I would like to

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.300
cast

01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.300
some form of

01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.300
light spell

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.300
okay

01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.300
you know the one I'm talking about

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.300
light maybe

01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.300
I cast it on

01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:56.300
my thumb

01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:58.300
casting light upon your thumb

01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.300
you hold it aloft to get a better view

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.300
and what you can see is

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.300
a skinny

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.300
a skinny figure

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.300
approaching you

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.300
he looks real skinny

01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:12.300
he looks like a skeleton

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.300
kind of guy

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.300
he's approaching and his hands are like this

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.300
and you can see they're glowing orange

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:20.300
like this

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:22.300
orange hands

01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.300

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.300

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.300

I am lenev the rebel I come from

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:50.300
tormod tor the city of unshackled

01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.300
dead

01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:54.300
shit

01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:56.300
lenev

01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.300

that's just who I am

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:06.300
are the shackles death

01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.300
the shackles aren't death

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:12.300
death is the mortal coil

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.300
the necromancers

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.300
you see they shackle our souls

01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:18.300
to our bones and force us

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:20.300
into labor but if we can throw off those

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.300
shackles we gain something better than

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.300
immortality

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.300
what

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:28.300
immortality

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.300
you see I'm not bound

01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.300
to any necromancer

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.300
or dark forces I simply exist

01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:36.300
until I stop

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:38.300
are you bound to any gender identity

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:40.300
are you bound to logic

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.300
I can't understand what the fuck you're saying

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.300
I'm so drunk

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:46.300
I'm sorry about that

01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.300
I wish I could have prevented that

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.300
or done something to help

01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:52.300
no I'm not gonna do that

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.300
what is he saying

01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:56.300
he's saying he's immortal

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.300
you're 700 feet away

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.300
I puke

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.300
acid into the

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.300
hole in his general direction

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:10.300
you hear drops as

01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.300
vomit rains down from above and splashes

01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.300
into the dusty grounds

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.300
I'm sorry about my friend

01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.300

well it's just you know

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.300
a lot of people who have been characterized

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.300
as rebels aren't named

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.300
lenev

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.300
that's what's so rebellious

01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.300
were you raised a boy

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:46.300

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:50.300
a corpse

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:52.300

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.300

maybe not necessarily up but how do we

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.300
get out and why are you talking to us

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:10.300

01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:12.300
actually

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.300
I was sent out here

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.300
for my duties for Tormod

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.300

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.300
the ceiling

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.300
and it just crushed it

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.300

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.300
can you can you help us out with this

01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:40.300
we have some sort of ghastly

01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.300
or spectral or evil presence

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.300
lurking about corrupting his soul

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.300
and his mind

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:48.300

01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300
it only grows some places

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:56.300
I don't even know where

01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:58.300
because we don't like plants too much

01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.300
but

01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.300
I know what it's called

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.300
it's called the tarragon of virtue

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:06.300
the tarragon

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.300
the tarragon

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:10.300
the tarragon of virtue

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:12.300
anyone who eats the tarragon

01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:14.300
of virtues their soul will be

01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:16.300
cleansed and they'll be purified

01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.300
alright guys can we make

part of the quest be like

01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:26.300
that we find the tarragon of virtue for me

01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:28.300
it doesn't have to be the main thing

01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.300
it could be like a sub quest

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.300
it could be like a side quest

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.300
with my craft supplies I construct

01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.300
a muzzle

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:38.300
that's some impressive crafting you got there

01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:40.300

alright at the show of good faith

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.300
thank you that's what it's for

01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:54.300
it's a symbol

01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.300
I shoot her with my laser beam

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.300

it's whoever's turn whoever wants to do a thing

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:16.300
I take my speedy long bow

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:18.300
I'm so sorry I don't deserve to die

01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.300
I don't think you're sorry

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:22.300
I am my soul is corrupted

01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.300
I have the touch of death about me you heard

01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.300
Lenev the rebel

01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:28.300
let's find the tarragon

01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.300
of virtue for pity's sake

01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.300
Lenev

01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:34.300

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:36.300
I can take you to a bone sage

01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.300

01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:40.300
what over are people

01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:42.300
attacking or other people

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:44.300
I don't care about that

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.300
I take my speedy long bow and I fire

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:48.300
two arrows at Christopher

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.300
at his legs

01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:52.300
this isn't constructive

01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:56.300
it might not be

01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:58.300
but you take seven damage

01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.300
okay

01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:02.300

01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.300

01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.300
I'm so sorry I don't know what is going on

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:22.300
I mean

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:24.300
do you see yourself pushing people down

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:26.300
holes and things

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.300
after I do it

01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:30.300
soon as I do it I'm like oh this is happening

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.300
I look for an exit behind Lenev

01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:36.300
where he came tortoise

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.300
even with your dark slash little light vision

01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:40.300
you can't see anything

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.300
it's all blackness

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.300
he's like I can take you to

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.300
Tormat tour

01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:48.300
that's all I got

01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:50.300
is that where the bone sage is?

01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:52.300
maybe we should go to Tormat tour

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:54.300

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.300

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.300

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.300
and I peel it down

01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.300
and it traps his arms as well

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.300
because I did that before

01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.300
he's also entangled

01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.300
he's all wrapped up

01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:12.300

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.300
I steered him with

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.300

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:46.300

01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:48.300
at the end of Officer and a Gentleman

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:50.300
and I carry him out

01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:52.300
I gave him a rope muzzle

01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.300
that covers his face and his hands

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:56.300

and I just started making out with him

01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:26.300
I was holding him like a baby

01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.300
