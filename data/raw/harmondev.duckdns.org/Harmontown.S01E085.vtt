{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:29.300\nHello everybody, welcome to Harmontown at NerdMilts.\n\n00:29.300 --> 00:54.300\nWelcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harbett.\n\n00:54.300 --> 01:06.300\nIt's ridiculous that song.\n\n01:06.300 --> 01:11.300\nIt's called Little Willie. No offense.\n\n01:11.300 --> 01:17.300\nI don't know if you had anything you wanted to talk about tonight, but we got a mysterious package delivered to us in the green room.\n\n01:17.300 --> 01:30.300\nIt appears to be a self-published book by a man named Daniel Quinn called Beyond Civilization, Humanity's Next Great Adventure.\n\n01:30.300 --> 01:43.300\nYou're all wondering, do I simply have to wrap something in brown paper and send it to the green room in order to have you focus your episode on it.\n\n01:43.300 --> 01:53.300\nRead the first couple sentences.\n\n01:53.300 --> 02:03.300\nIn Beyond Civilization, Daniel Quinn thinks the unthinkable.\n\n02:03.300 --> 02:07.300\nWe have to assume Daniel Quinn wrote this.\n\n02:07.300 --> 02:10.300\nBut that doesn't matter.\n\n02:10.300 --> 02:13.300\nEveryone comes to a point in their life when...\n\n02:13.300 --> 02:15.300\nIs it possible to think the unthinkable?\n\n02:15.300 --> 02:17.300\nThinks the unthinkable.\n\n02:17.300 --> 02:25.300\nWe all know there's no one right way to build a bicycle.\n\n02:25.300 --> 02:30.300\nYou're laughing at that because it's specific, but it's true. That's what hooks me in.\n\n02:30.300 --> 02:39.300\nWe all know there's no one right way to build a bicycle, no one right way to design an automobile, no one right way to make a pair of shoes.\n\n02:39.300 --> 02:44.300\nWe're convinced that there must be only one right way to live.\n\n02:44.300 --> 02:48.300\nAnd the one we have is it, no matter what.\n\n02:48.300 --> 02:56.300\nSo the supposition of the book is that you're a pig-headed asshole.\n\n02:56.300 --> 03:00.300\nBut no, it looks like...\n\n03:00.300 --> 03:04.300\nI feel like there's only one way to build a bicycle.\n\n03:04.300 --> 03:08.300\nCertainly two tires have to be involved.\n\n03:08.300 --> 03:12.300\nOr you've verged into tricycle territory.\n\n03:12.300 --> 03:16.300\nAnd they have to be in a row, otherwise you'd fall right over.\n\n03:16.300 --> 03:21.300\nOh, I just see already now they're... I don't know.\n\n03:21.300 --> 03:25.300\nI could see a thing where there's like two tires, like a Segway.\n\n03:25.300 --> 03:29.300\nDaniel Quinn, what are you doing here?\n\n03:29.300 --> 03:32.300\nIs a Segway a bicycle? It's got two tires.\n\n03:32.300 --> 03:34.300\nNo.\n\n03:34.300 --> 03:38.300\nThe inventor of the Segway would have you believe the Segway is not a bicycle.\n\n03:38.300 --> 03:44.300\nHe would have in his book called Segway Adventures,\n\n03:44.300 --> 03:47.300\nhe would have you believe that the Segway is a new invention.\n\n03:47.300 --> 03:49.300\nMaybe it's just a bicycle.\n\n03:49.300 --> 03:52.300\nRight. So whose side are you on here?\n\n03:52.300 --> 03:54.300\nDaniel Quinn's.\n\n03:54.300 --> 03:57.300\nYou like him for being an iconoclast about...\n\n03:57.300 --> 04:00.300\nI like him for asking questions, man.\n\n04:00.300 --> 04:03.300\nI like him for sending a secret crazy...\n\n04:03.300 --> 04:06.300\nIs his book organized by question? Are there more questions?\n\n04:06.300 --> 04:08.300\nIt's weird.\n\n04:08.300 --> 04:10.300\nWill he ask me to rethink other things?\n\n04:10.300 --> 04:15.300\nIf you paged through it and looked at it, it looked like it was some riddle book from the 80s.\n\n04:15.300 --> 04:18.300\nEach page is just like...\n\n04:18.300 --> 04:22.300\nI'm looking over your shoulder. The bottom fourth of every page is blank.\n\n04:22.300 --> 04:27.300\nYeah, because each page is just a thought that he had.\n\n04:27.300 --> 04:29.300\nLike one page... look.\n\n04:29.300 --> 04:31.300\nShow the audience.\n\n04:31.300 --> 04:34.300\nAnd he often refers to some other book that he wrote.\n\n04:34.300 --> 04:37.300\nIn My Ishmael, that's a book that he wrote,\n\n04:37.300 --> 04:39.300\nI recounted the life of a young man named Jeffrey,\n\n04:39.300 --> 04:41.300\nloosely based on Paul Eppinger,\n\n04:41.300 --> 04:44.300\nwhose journal was published by his father under the title of wrestling.\n\n04:44.300 --> 04:49.300\nWhy is every bottom fourth of every page blank for notes?\n\n04:49.300 --> 04:52.300\nBecause he finishes his shit, man.\n\n04:52.300 --> 04:54.300\nBecause he gets his thoughts out.\n\n04:54.300 --> 04:58.300\nOr otherwise the book's only like a pamphlet.\n\n04:58.300 --> 05:01.300\nDaniel Quinn, if you're out there, thank you for the book.\n\n05:01.300 --> 05:03.300\nThank you for sending it. I opened it.\n\n05:03.300 --> 05:06.300\nGive me the book.\n\n05:06.300 --> 05:11.300\nDaniel Quinn, please come down undoubtedly from Canada.\n\n05:11.300 --> 05:14.300\nI'm 90% certain you're of Canadian.\n\n05:14.300 --> 05:19.300\nAnd defend this. Defend this use of paper.\n\n05:19.300 --> 05:26.300\nI'm looking at two pages where there's no more than 80 characters on the entire two pages.\n\n05:26.300 --> 05:28.300\nOkay, part two.\n\n05:28.300 --> 05:30.300\nClosing in on the process.\n\n05:30.300 --> 05:32.300\nDot, dot, dot.\n\n05:32.300 --> 05:35.300\nAnd I'm going to come at this with an open mind, Dan.\n\n05:35.300 --> 05:37.300\nWell, I mean...\n\n05:37.300 --> 05:38.300\nI'm not mocking the person.\n\n05:38.300 --> 05:39.300\nWell, yeah.\n\n05:39.300 --> 05:42.300\nLike when Eminem writes controversial rap lyrics\n\n05:42.300 --> 05:44.300\nand they have somebody on CNN read rap lyrics.\n\n05:44.300 --> 05:45.300\nWas defaced and abandoned.\n\n05:45.300 --> 05:47.300\nThe city's ultimate collapse.\n\n05:47.300 --> 05:49.300\nWhatever happened, the city was destroyed.\n\n05:49.300 --> 05:52.300\nThe collapse may have been caused by...\n\n05:52.300 --> 05:55.300\nYou're making him sound like a jack-off on purpose.\n\n05:55.300 --> 05:57.300\nI'm...\n\n05:57.300 --> 05:58.300\nIt's unthinkable.\n\n05:58.300 --> 06:00.300\nIt's unthinkable.\n\n06:00.300 --> 06:04.300\nTo think the impossible think...\n\n06:04.300 --> 06:07.300\nOne of these days I'm going to write a book and it will be...\n\n06:07.300 --> 06:10.300\nMany of the pages will be empty.\n\n06:10.300 --> 06:12.300\nI just don't...\n\n06:12.300 --> 06:13.300\nMaybe...\n\n06:13.300 --> 06:14.300\nHow about this?\n\n06:14.300 --> 06:20.300\nIf every page is going to be equally blank for the bottom fourth or fifth of the page\n\n06:20.300 --> 06:23.300\nmake a shorter book.\n\n06:23.300 --> 06:25.300\nConsolidate it, you're saying.\n\n06:25.300 --> 06:30.300\nI'm saying cut the bottom fourth of the book.\n\n06:30.300 --> 06:32.300\nMake it a little smaller.\n\n06:32.300 --> 06:36.300\nWell, by your logic everything should be on microfiche.\n\n06:36.300 --> 06:37.300\nI'm saying...\n\n06:37.300 --> 06:40.300\nIf I had to flash through this, you could make...\n\n06:40.300 --> 06:45.300\nThere's certainly room down there to invite a Mad Magazine artist or something.\n\n06:45.300 --> 06:46.300\nYeah.\n\n06:46.300 --> 06:49.300\nCertainly there's new levels that could be added.\n\n06:49.300 --> 06:50.300\nThat's definitely...\n\n06:50.300 --> 06:51.300\nI don't know.\n\n06:51.300 --> 06:54.300\nProbably not his fault, I think that would go to the publisher.\n\n06:54.300 --> 06:55.300\nRight.\n\n06:55.300 --> 06:57.300\nThe publisher being...\n\n06:57.300 --> 07:00.300\nDaniel Quinn...\n\n07:00.300 --> 07:04.300\nWastey McPaperson.\n\n07:04.300 --> 07:08.300\nAlright, so we took a dump on some poor kid.\n\n07:08.300 --> 07:10.300\nIs he a kid?\n\n07:10.300 --> 07:12.300\nI imagine...\n\n07:12.300 --> 07:15.300\nI don't think you're 40 and you're doing stuff like that.\n\n07:15.300 --> 07:17.300\nI don't know.\n\n07:17.300 --> 07:23.300\nJust smacks of a 25-year-old's penetrative lunge into the world.\n\n07:23.300 --> 07:26.300\nIf I'm being hard on him, it's simply because...\n\n07:26.300 --> 07:29.300\nCome on.\n\n07:29.300 --> 07:33.300\nAlright, so we hazed the...\n\n07:33.300 --> 07:37.300\nYou could end one three-line poem and then start a new one\n\n07:37.300 --> 07:39.300\na couple lines beneath that and keep the book...\n\n07:39.300 --> 07:41.300\nDid you write a poem in there?\n\n07:41.300 --> 07:42.300\nRead it.\n\n07:42.300 --> 07:43.300\nDan?\n\n07:43.300 --> 07:47.300\nThis is Paige... Who the fuck knows because Paige is our number.\n\n07:47.300 --> 07:50.300\nHey, why Paige knows?\n\n07:50.300 --> 07:51.300\nSee that?\n\n07:51.300 --> 07:52.300\nI could get on board with that.\n\n07:52.300 --> 07:53.300\nYeah.\n\n07:53.300 --> 07:55.300\nPaige numbers is just a way to tell the brother he's late.\n\n07:55.300 --> 07:58.300\nHow many tires should I wear?\n\n07:58.300 --> 07:59.300\nAlright.\n\n07:59.300 --> 08:02.300\nThis is part four toward the new tribalism.\n\n08:02.300 --> 08:07.300\nThis is a two-and-a-half-line little graffito.\n\n08:07.300 --> 08:08.300\nIt says,\n\n08:08.300 --> 08:13.300\nWe are inclined to think of hunters and gatherers as poor because they don't have anything.\n\n08:13.300 --> 08:19.300\nPerhaps better to think of them for that reason as free.\n\n08:19.300 --> 08:25.300\nWait, that's attributed to Marshall Solon, so he's just quoting people.\n\n08:25.300 --> 08:29.300\nWell, there's stuff he's come upon in his life that he wants to share with you.\n\n08:29.300 --> 08:30.300\nAlright.\n\n08:30.300 --> 08:32.300\nAnd you're chastising.\n\n08:32.300 --> 08:36.300\nNo, I mean, I should write a book.\n\n08:36.300 --> 08:40.300\nAlright.\n\n08:40.300 --> 08:44.300\nSo can we please...\n\n08:44.300 --> 08:48.300\nWhat did we do?\n\n08:48.300 --> 08:49.300\nNow we all know what you shouldn't do.\n\n08:49.300 --> 08:50.300\nYou shouldn't write a book like that.\n\n08:50.300 --> 08:52.300\nYou shouldn't send it to us.\n\n08:52.300 --> 08:54.300\nAgain, I say it's more in the publisher.\n\n08:54.300 --> 08:57.300\nThe format is what's got me.\n\n08:57.300 --> 09:00.300\nBut I do think it's an interesting idea that we...\n\n09:00.300 --> 09:07.300\nCivilizations like bicycles or canopeners or shoes are inventions.\n\n09:07.300 --> 09:12.300\nThey're systems that we have devised collectively.\n\n09:12.300 --> 09:19.300\nThey're larger than shoes and canopeners, but they're just little things that we invented.\n\n09:19.300 --> 09:23.300\nWe've decided at some point that civilizations should resemble...\n\n09:23.300 --> 09:25.300\nThey should have a certain shape to them.\n\n09:25.300 --> 09:34.300\nBecause what do you do when your species becomes so successful that it's outbreeding the bears, wolves and cats that used to eat it?\n\n09:34.300 --> 09:37.300\nWhat do you do?\n\n09:37.300 --> 09:39.300\nYou form a civilization.\n\n09:39.300 --> 09:40.300\nYou form rules.\n\n09:40.300 --> 09:42.300\nYou build a big wall.\n\n09:42.300 --> 09:46.300\nWe can't keep killing each other, gutting each other.\n\n09:46.300 --> 09:54.300\nWe came up with a very, very thin kind of détente a long time ago.\n\n09:54.300 --> 09:56.300\nLike, let's not hurt each other.\n\n09:56.300 --> 09:57.300\nHoly shit.\n\n09:57.300 --> 09:59.300\nLet's love each other.\n\n09:59.300 --> 10:00.300\nIs it the right way?\n\n10:00.300 --> 10:02.300\nDo we think of each other in the right way?\n\n10:02.300 --> 10:04.300\nIf we were to go to the moon, Jeff...\n\n10:04.300 --> 10:08.300\nDo you think that people think of each other as people that we shouldn't hurt or use or abuse?\n\n10:08.300 --> 10:09.300\nYeah.\n\n10:09.300 --> 10:10.300\nYou do.\n\n10:10.300 --> 10:11.300\nYeah.\n\n10:11.300 --> 10:14.300\nI mean, I think if you look around at any...\n\n10:14.300 --> 10:16.300\nNo, we're doing terrible things to each other.\n\n10:16.300 --> 10:17.300\nYeah, at all times.\n\n10:17.300 --> 10:18.300\nYeah.\n\n10:18.300 --> 10:19.300\nBut I think...\n\n10:19.300 --> 10:24.300\nThe only reason we stopped moving and we stopped hunting is because we found out that when you start...\n\n10:24.300 --> 10:27.300\nWe started mastering metals and stone and masonry and things,\n\n10:27.300 --> 10:31.300\nand we could insulate ourselves that we didn't have to keep moving around.\n\n10:31.300 --> 10:36.300\nWe could start making permanent dwellings, and that gave us leisure time.\n\n10:36.300 --> 10:40.300\nAnd that created things like art and created things like textiles and stuff like that.\n\n10:40.300 --> 10:45.300\nAlso, it created the idea that men treated women like shit forever,\n\n10:45.300 --> 10:47.300\nlike all kinds of other goodies.\n\n10:47.300 --> 10:49.300\nYes.\n\n10:49.300 --> 10:50.300\nOkay.\n\n10:50.300 --> 10:55.300\nSo there's an interesting, strange irony there,\n\n10:55.300 --> 11:03.300\nbecause it would seem that mankind kind of is very cruel to itself\n\n11:03.300 --> 11:07.300\nwhen we have shit on our plate.\n\n11:07.300 --> 11:12.300\nIt all seems like there's a human impulse to be inhuman to each other\n\n11:12.300 --> 11:16.300\nwhen we have the excuse that we have so much shit to do.\n\n11:16.300 --> 11:22.300\nBut at the same time, strangely enough, gender-wise,\n\n11:22.300 --> 11:29.300\nit would seem like luxury begets abuses.\n\n11:29.300 --> 11:30.300\nYeah.\n\n11:30.300 --> 11:35.300\nDoesn't it seem like the more dessert, the more free time we get,\n\n11:35.300 --> 11:37.300\nthe more unfair we are to...\n\n11:37.300 --> 11:41.300\nI'm sure I'll get it all the way wrong, because I'm only remembering things poorly.\n\n11:41.300 --> 11:47.300\nWhen things were like hunter-gatherer, they tended to be matriarchal and tended to be feminine.\n\n11:47.300 --> 11:52.300\nAnd the moment that we started building permanent dwellings, it became patrilineal.\n\n11:52.300 --> 11:57.300\nIf I'm going to build a thing, I'm going to pass it down to my male heir,\n\n11:57.300 --> 12:00.300\nand then women would get pushed to the periphery.\n\n12:00.300 --> 12:04.300\nIt's almost like there's two different tracks that we feel on,\n\n12:04.300 --> 12:10.300\nbecause the history of this amazing country, just to look at that as a microcosm of it,\n\n12:10.300 --> 12:19.300\nthe insanely, poetically, tragically ironic fact that we built this country on slavery,\n\n12:19.300 --> 12:23.300\nwhich couldn't be a more inhuman act, that you take people from a different culture\n\n12:23.300 --> 12:26.300\nand you say to them, you are not human to us.\n\n12:26.300 --> 12:30.300\nWe choose to use you to benefit ourselves,\n\n12:30.300 --> 12:36.300\nand we choose not to care about the happiness and health of you and your progeny.\n\n12:36.300 --> 12:40.300\nWe choose, in fact, to breed you and herd you as if you were animals,\n\n12:40.300 --> 12:42.300\nand there's no other way to put it than that.\n\n12:42.300 --> 12:46.300\nAnd that is the true profanity of slavery.\n\n12:46.300 --> 12:50.300\nAnd to build a country on that, and then to come around and go,\n\n12:50.300 --> 12:53.300\noh, you know what, we were wrong about that.\n\n12:53.300 --> 12:56.300\nActually, boy, is anybody feeling nauseous about this?\n\n12:56.300 --> 13:01.300\nYeah, right around the time that industry affords us the opportunity to replace these people with machines,\n\n13:01.300 --> 13:03.300\nyes, we all start to feel nauseous about it.\n\n13:03.300 --> 13:04.300\nBut kicking and screaming.\n\n13:04.300 --> 13:07.300\nAnd then to give those people the vote,\n\n13:07.300 --> 13:13.300\nand then also, then after that, sometime after that, to say to women,\n\n13:13.300 --> 13:17.300\nyou are now also allowed to participate in who's president.\n\n13:17.300 --> 13:21.300\nThere's all kinds of amazing things when you focus in on the...\n\n13:21.300 --> 13:25.300\nThe great modern cities, and I know it would include in New York,\n\n13:25.300 --> 13:27.300\nbut also like Antwerp and Brussels,\n\n13:27.300 --> 13:33.300\nand the great cities of Europe were built on treating people like a resource.\n\n13:33.300 --> 13:38.300\nPeople were murdered by the millions to make great cities,\n\n13:38.300 --> 13:46.300\nto get rubber, to get gold, to get really basic things.\n\n13:46.300 --> 13:49.300\nThat's why if you go to Antwerp and it's sexy,\n\n13:49.300 --> 13:52.300\nit's because of just slaughter of a thousand people.\n\n13:52.300 --> 13:57.300\nAnd then women got to vote later, which is fucking amazing.\n\n13:57.300 --> 14:05.300\nThe women that the men who were hurting each other,\n\n14:05.300 --> 14:11.300\nmen can have epiphanies about inhumanity,\n\n14:11.300 --> 14:14.300\nand the entire time they're having those epiphanies,\n\n14:14.300 --> 14:20.300\nthey can go home to bed with a woman that they are actively oppressing.\n\n14:20.300 --> 14:24.300\nWe were at the drawing room a couple weeks ago,\n\n14:24.300 --> 14:27.300\nand you said you were writing a thing for Vulture magazine or whatever.\n\n14:27.300 --> 14:32.300\nI was asking you about your 20 cultural references.\n\n14:32.300 --> 14:33.300\nAnd there are no women on the list.\n\n14:33.300 --> 14:36.300\nYeah, but you've written about the things that informed you,\n\n14:36.300 --> 14:38.300\nand I made a joke, it's like no women, huh?\n\n14:38.300 --> 14:40.300\nAnd you're like, oh shit, you're right.\n\n14:40.300 --> 14:44.300\nBut then you said Elaine...\n\n14:44.300 --> 14:45.300\nWhat's her name?\n\n14:45.300 --> 14:46.300\nElaine Morgan.\n\n14:46.300 --> 14:49.300\nElaine Morgan, which may or may not be a cultural thing,\n\n14:49.300 --> 14:50.300\nbut it really is.\n\n14:50.300 --> 14:58.300\nBut what's your stance on how do you perceive femininity as in culture?\n\n14:58.300 --> 15:00.300\nIt's a pretty male thing.\n\n15:00.300 --> 15:04.300\nOur show tends to end up being a lot of dudes on stage,\n\n15:04.300 --> 15:08.300\nand occasionally a woman.\n\n15:08.300 --> 15:11.300\nThat's the thing that I think is so fascinating about it,\n\n15:11.300 --> 15:14.300\nis that mankind has it within him,\n\n15:14.300 --> 15:22.300\nto a white man can look at another man\n\n15:22.300 --> 15:25.300\nwho has different cheekbones or different pigmentation,\n\n15:25.300 --> 15:31.300\nand he can switch some switch in his head and say,\n\n15:31.300 --> 15:35.300\noh well, I decide to dehumanize this person.\n\n15:35.300 --> 15:40.300\nI decide to commit the worst crime you can commit against another human being,\n\n15:40.300 --> 15:42.300\nwhich is to dehumanize them.\n\n15:42.300 --> 15:47.300\nI will in fact profit off of that dehumanization.\n\n15:47.300 --> 15:49.300\nI will switch off this thing in my head,\n\n15:49.300 --> 15:51.300\nI will abuse this person.\n\n15:51.300 --> 15:58.300\nGenocide, just like truly the worst crime you can commit.\n\n15:58.300 --> 16:03.300\nAnd then in that sort of male stereotypical sense,\n\n16:03.300 --> 16:06.300\nlike watching two guys fight at a bar,\n\n16:06.300 --> 16:10.300\nwhere somebody breaks a bottle and they're slashing at each other,\n\n16:10.300 --> 16:12.300\nand then they work out something,\n\n16:12.300 --> 16:14.300\nand then they end up with their arms around each other,\n\n16:14.300 --> 16:17.300\nand then there's some weird elephant in the room where it's like,\n\n16:17.300 --> 16:20.300\nbut none of you respect your women.\n\n16:20.300 --> 16:24.300\nAnd then gender politics still eludes us, I think.\n\n16:24.300 --> 16:27.300\nIt's a really weird thing, because no one wants to,\n\n16:27.300 --> 16:29.300\nyou don't want to hear about it.\n\n16:29.300 --> 16:33.300\nIt makes you feel more, it's harder to handle than racial politics.\n\n16:33.300 --> 16:38.300\nBecause racial politics can come down to some platitude about,\n\n16:38.300 --> 16:42.300\nyou go, oh, well, yeah, I had an epiphany this morning while brushing my teeth.\n\n16:42.300 --> 16:44.300\nMy friend's darker skin than me.\n\n16:44.300 --> 16:46.300\nThat doesn't make him less of a person,\n\n16:46.300 --> 16:49.300\nbut there are barriers you can't get beyond,\n\n16:49.300 --> 16:51.300\nand you're thinking about women.\n\n16:51.300 --> 16:53.300\nYour mom was a woman.\n\n16:53.300 --> 16:56.300\nIf you had a wiener and your mom didn't,\n\n16:56.300 --> 16:59.300\nthere may be shit that you're carrying into your adulthood.\n\n16:59.300 --> 17:01.300\nYou may be punishing women for shit,\n\n17:01.300 --> 17:04.300\nthat you don't know that you're doing it.\n\n17:04.300 --> 17:08.300\nLike, they've suffered, man.\n\n17:08.300 --> 17:10.300\nWhat is your relationship with women?\n\n17:10.300 --> 17:12.300\nThey're beautiful.\n\n17:12.300 --> 17:15.300\nThey're a groovy bunch of chicks.\n\n17:15.300 --> 17:17.300\nI don't know, I don't know.\n\n17:17.300 --> 17:20.300\nIt's totally, totally un...\n\n17:23.300 --> 17:25.300\nI proposed to one, yeah.\n\n17:25.300 --> 17:27.300\nNo, it's totally untapped for me.\n\n17:27.300 --> 17:29.300\nI really don't...\n\n17:29.300 --> 17:31.300\nIt's uncharted territory.\n\n17:31.300 --> 17:34.300\nYou said...\n\n17:34.300 --> 17:40.300\nI just watched the most recent cut of the Harmon Tour documentary,\n\n17:40.300 --> 17:42.300\nand you talk about the fact that, like,\n\n17:42.300 --> 17:44.300\ncommunicating with anybody, any stranger,\n\n17:44.300 --> 17:47.300\neven your friends, like, it's always a crisis,\n\n17:47.300 --> 17:51.300\ncommunicating with a stranger, extra crisis.\n\n17:51.300 --> 17:59.300\nHow comfortable are women more strange to you than other men?\n\n17:59.300 --> 18:02.300\nYou certainly seem to have a relationship with women\n\n18:02.300 --> 18:06.300\nthat's, like, a little more fearful.\n\n18:06.300 --> 18:08.300\nI don't know.\n\n18:08.300 --> 18:11.300\nI'm more fearful than what?\n\n18:11.300 --> 18:14.300\nThan a nine-foot-tall guy, than a four-foot-tall guy,\n\n18:14.300 --> 18:16.300\nthan a guy in a wheelchair,\n\n18:16.300 --> 18:20.300\nthan a guy with a really weird hat on.\n\n18:20.300 --> 18:24.300\nWell, yeah, to the extent that, to great balance,\n\n18:24.300 --> 18:27.300\nthe guy has to be nine feet tall, like...\n\n18:27.300 --> 18:29.300\nWell, that's what I'm saying, though.\n\n18:29.300 --> 18:33.300\nThat's the unexplored question of gender,\n\n18:33.300 --> 18:37.300\nbecause we have this tendency to, simultaneously,\n\n18:37.300 --> 18:45.300\nwe talk about the human species as if it's just very neatly divided down the middle,\n\n18:45.300 --> 18:47.300\ngender-wise, there's men and there's women,\n\n18:47.300 --> 18:49.300\nand then we have all of these...\n\n18:49.300 --> 18:53.300\nWe have it out politically about race,\n\n18:53.300 --> 18:55.300\nand about nationality,\n\n18:55.300 --> 18:58.300\nbut within all of these nations and all of these races,\n\n18:58.300 --> 19:00.300\nthere's this...\n\n19:00.300 --> 19:04.300\nIt's almost like the crime is committed and finished\n\n19:04.300 --> 19:08.300\nand gotten away with before it's ever called to court,\n\n19:08.300 --> 19:13.300\nbecause let's face it, we all, like, are born into a world\n\n19:13.300 --> 19:21.300\nwhere we're trained to think about men and women as these...\n\n19:21.300 --> 19:23.300\nLet's say you're in a writer's room,\n\n19:23.300 --> 19:26.300\nand there are your equal number in terms of sharewriters or whatever,\n\n19:26.300 --> 19:29.300\nand there's male writers and female writers.\n\n19:29.300 --> 19:32.300\nDo you not have an automatic opinion about...\n\n19:32.300 --> 19:36.300\nOr let's say there's a female writer in your writer's room.\n\n19:36.300 --> 19:38.300\nDo you carry anything into that?\n\n19:38.300 --> 19:44.300\nYeah, if there's one female writer in a room full of 10 male writers,\n\n19:44.300 --> 19:50.300\nI am distracted by how distracting things must be for her.\n\n19:50.300 --> 19:52.300\nI get distracted by that.\n\n19:52.300 --> 19:57.300\nI would like it to be like half men and half women,\n\n19:57.300 --> 19:59.300\nand it rarely can be.\n\n19:59.300 --> 20:02.300\nSo I find myself thinking about the two women,\n\n20:02.300 --> 20:04.300\nfor instance, season five of Community Red,\n\n20:04.300 --> 20:07.300\ntwo female writers in the writer's room,\n\n20:07.300 --> 20:11.300\nand I find myself filtering things through their experience.\n\n20:11.300 --> 20:16.300\nAre we getting too abrasive?\n\n20:16.300 --> 20:21.300\nI know that female writers are not tender at all.\n\n20:21.300 --> 20:23.300\nThat's not what I mean.\n\n20:23.300 --> 20:26.300\nBut what would this look like on an affidavit later?\n\n20:26.300 --> 20:33.300\nIt bears thinking,\n\n20:33.300 --> 20:35.300\nwhich is why the easiest thing in the world,\n\n20:35.300 --> 20:37.300\nor rather the hardest thing to achieve,\n\n20:37.300 --> 20:39.300\nbut then the easiest thing to maintain,\n\n20:39.300 --> 20:44.300\nis half and half represent the species in the writer's room.\n\n20:44.300 --> 20:52.300\nSo if a single individual male writer has a tendency to\n\n20:52.300 --> 20:56.300\nthrust his chest out and get abrasive in his language,\n\n20:56.300 --> 21:00.300\nthen he's got a proper amount of women to contend with.\n\n21:00.300 --> 21:02.300\nThere was a thing, I forget what year it was,\n\n21:02.300 --> 21:04.300\nsomebody told me a story about,\n\n21:04.300 --> 21:06.300\nI think there was like a European Cup championship,\n\n21:06.300 --> 21:10.300\nlike soccer, like football, proper football,\n\n21:10.300 --> 21:12.300\nand it was in the Netherlands,\n\n21:12.300 --> 21:14.300\nand I forget what countries were playing,\n\n21:14.300 --> 21:16.300\nI think it was held in the Netherlands,\n\n21:16.300 --> 21:19.300\nand the Dutch police did a genius thing,\n\n21:19.300 --> 21:21.300\nbecause there were two countries that hated each other\n\n21:21.300 --> 21:22.300\nand tend to get pretty violent.\n\n21:22.300 --> 21:24.300\nThe two different countries, like their fans,\n\n21:24.300 --> 21:27.300\ngot a little hooligan-y,\n\n21:27.300 --> 21:31.300\nand all the cops they put out, women.\n\n21:31.300 --> 21:34.300\nOut in the streets, all Dutch female police.\n\n21:34.300 --> 21:37.300\nAs a story, I'm telling like seventh hand,\n\n21:37.300 --> 21:39.300\nbut no fighting,\n\n21:39.300 --> 21:41.300\nbecause there was just a bunch of women police out there,\n\n21:41.300 --> 21:45.300\nand nobody did anything, nobody wanted to fight.\n\n21:45.300 --> 21:47.300\nAnd he was like, he didn't know if it was because\n\n21:47.300 --> 21:49.300\nthey all wanted a picture with them,\n\n21:49.300 --> 21:51.300\nbecause they were all like,\n\n21:51.300 --> 21:53.300\nhey, we're in history.\n\n21:53.300 --> 21:56.300\nBut you just eliminated the fact that if you added\n\n21:56.300 --> 22:01.300\nmore guys to that angsty, like wound up\n\n22:01.300 --> 22:03.300\ntestosterone-y environment,\n\n22:03.300 --> 22:05.300\nif you added more guys with more agendas\n\n22:05.300 --> 22:07.300\nand more weapons on them,\n\n22:07.300 --> 22:10.300\nnot going to help, you just put a bunch of women in the mix\n\n22:10.300 --> 22:13.300\nand tempers it, because the idea that you have\n\n22:13.300 --> 22:15.300\na thousand guys in the fucking building together\n\n22:15.300 --> 22:18.300\nthat have agendas is going to be a fucking bummer.\n\n22:18.300 --> 22:21.300\nAnd that was the greatest moment in police force history\n\n22:21.300 --> 22:25.300\nof just saying, let's have some femininity out there\n\n22:25.300 --> 22:27.300\nand cool everything the fuck out.\n\n22:27.300 --> 22:30.300\nYeah, but you can defend somebody so quick\n\n22:30.300 --> 22:32.300\nby talking about that.\n\n22:32.300 --> 22:34.300\nThe idea that they have a gender identity,\n\n22:34.300 --> 22:36.300\nthat they put those women out there,\n\n22:36.300 --> 22:38.300\nand that that had any kind of effect for any kind of issue.\n\n22:38.300 --> 22:42.300\nWe do it here, because we'd be afraid that they get punched\n\n22:42.300 --> 22:44.300\nor something terrible would happen.\n\n22:44.300 --> 22:46.300\nI think they just did it because they had the idea\n\n22:46.300 --> 22:48.300\nthat it would cool everything down.\n\n22:48.300 --> 22:51.300\nI don't know. Look it up, everybody.\n\n22:51.300 --> 23:00.300\nIt's so interesting to me, because we all know for a fact.\n\n23:00.300 --> 23:02.300\nWe all know for an absolute fact.\n\n23:02.300 --> 23:04.300\nErin, get out of here. We need some women on stage.\n\n23:04.300 --> 23:09.300\nThank you.\n\n23:09.300 --> 23:13.300\nHello.\n\n23:13.300 --> 23:18.300\nI was squirming backstage because the reason why\n\n23:18.300 --> 23:23.300\nI initially really fell for you was your...\n\n23:23.300 --> 23:25.300\nDan.\n\n23:25.300 --> 23:35.300\nWhat you said to me regarding how you felt about women\n\n23:35.300 --> 23:37.300\nand their...\n\n23:37.300 --> 23:39.300\nI said they were...\n\n23:39.300 --> 23:41.300\nThanks.\n\n23:41.300 --> 23:47.300\nYou said to me that men were so violently opposed to...\n\n23:47.300 --> 23:51.300\nFunny men were opposed to funny women,\n\n23:51.300 --> 23:56.300\nbecause they hated women,\n\n23:56.300 --> 23:58.300\nbecause they were so threatened by them,\n\n23:58.300 --> 24:04.300\nbecause women were so dynamic and emotional\n\n24:04.300 --> 24:09.300\nand interesting and confident and weird,\n\n24:09.300 --> 24:13.300\nand men had a hard time with that.\n\n24:13.300 --> 24:18.300\nYou weren't making it sound like a guy that just wanted to get laid.\n\n24:18.300 --> 24:22.300\nDo you remember that conversation?\n\n24:22.300 --> 24:29.300\nDan said, hey, I think maybe I hate women,\n\n24:29.300 --> 24:36.300\nwhich obviously I was turned off by, but not...\n\n24:36.300 --> 24:38.300\nBut someone saying, I think I hate women,\n\n24:38.300 --> 24:40.300\nbut I think I hate them because I love them.\n\n24:40.300 --> 24:42.300\nI think I hate them because I want to be them,\n\n24:42.300 --> 24:45.300\nbecause I admire them, because I think they're amazing,\n\n24:45.300 --> 24:49.300\nand I am upset by that.\n\n24:49.300 --> 24:52.300\nAnd that was it.\n\n24:52.300 --> 24:56.300\nOkay, so gender is obviously the theme of the show tonight,\n\n24:56.300 --> 24:58.300\nwhich I think is important.\n\n24:58.300 --> 25:00.300\nGood. Great.\n\n25:00.300 --> 25:04.300\nIf we go to the moon, it's easy,\n\n25:04.300 --> 25:10.300\nnot at the risk of offending any of our listeners of color.\n\n25:10.300 --> 25:15.300\nWell, and is it gender or is it sex?\n\n25:15.300 --> 25:18.300\nI don't... Well, I mean, I don't know.\n\n25:18.300 --> 25:20.300\nDan just made it race somehow.\n\n25:20.300 --> 25:24.300\nBut race is easy. Race is easy.\n\n25:24.300 --> 25:27.300\nYeah, we've proven that as a country.\n\n25:27.300 --> 25:31.300\nGive us 500 years, we'll figure it out.\n\n25:31.300 --> 25:34.300\nI know that if you go to the moon\n\n25:34.300 --> 25:36.300\nand you want to start a new perfect civilization,\n\n25:36.300 --> 25:38.300\nI know that you make the road straight.\n\n25:38.300 --> 25:40.300\nYou disagree on that. You want a scenic view.\n\n25:40.300 --> 25:42.300\nYou want it, blah, blah, blah.\n\n25:42.300 --> 25:44.300\nOn the moon, they're going to tend to be straight.\n\n25:44.300 --> 25:45.300\nThere's less typography.\n\n25:45.300 --> 25:47.300\nI want to do certain logical things.\n\n25:47.300 --> 25:50.300\nIf I take a group of people to the moon and I start...\n\n25:50.300 --> 25:52.300\nAre you saying the roads are going to have to be straight\n\n25:52.300 --> 25:54.300\nand aggrid all over the moon?\n\n25:54.300 --> 25:56.300\nDon't get too distracted by that.\n\n25:56.300 --> 25:58.300\nThe big reveal is that Dan and I got engaged,\n\n25:58.300 --> 26:02.300\nbut Jeff and Dan got married.\n\n26:02.300 --> 26:05.300\nI'm just saying that when one fantasizes,\n\n26:05.300 --> 26:07.300\nwhen one expresses their impulse,\n\n26:07.300 --> 26:09.300\nand this is a healthy impulse,\n\n26:09.300 --> 26:11.300\neveryone in the audience asks yourself,\n\n26:11.300 --> 26:14.300\nwhat would you do if you could start from scratch,\n\n26:14.300 --> 26:16.300\nbecause then you might even actually be able to make\n\n26:16.300 --> 26:18.300\na couple of those things happen down here.\n\n26:18.300 --> 26:23.300\nSo what would you do about gender?\n\n26:23.300 --> 26:26.300\nWhat is it incumbent upon us?\n\n26:26.300 --> 26:30.300\nBecause it's very, very easy to talk about race.\n\n26:30.300 --> 26:35.300\nFact, our nation was built on slavery.\n\n26:35.300 --> 26:42.300\nFact, most of the non-Coccozoid Americans,\n\n26:42.300 --> 26:44.300\nthe African Americans, as we call them,\n\n26:44.300 --> 26:46.300\nwhich I think is a ridiculous phrase,\n\n26:46.300 --> 26:50.300\nthere's descendants of a practice called slavery,\n\n26:50.300 --> 26:52.300\nwhich is not too long ago,\n\n26:52.300 --> 26:55.300\nwhere we built the entire country on them,\n\n26:55.300 --> 26:58.300\nand then we went, okay, we feel bad about this.\n\n26:58.300 --> 27:01.300\nAlso, it's technologically appropriate.\n\n27:01.300 --> 27:04.300\nNow, let's weave this into society.\n\n27:04.300 --> 27:07.300\nThese are easy facts to deal with,\n\n27:07.300 --> 27:09.300\nand you can easily deal with them,\n\n27:09.300 --> 27:11.300\neven though you can't easily deal with them\n\n27:11.300 --> 27:13.300\npolitically and economically,\n\n27:13.300 --> 27:15.300\nyou can easily deal with them philosophically\n\n27:15.300 --> 27:19.300\nby saying such simple, no one can argue with them things,\n\n27:19.300 --> 27:23.300\nlike, ah, color, who cares?\n\n27:23.300 --> 27:26.300\nEasy, easy peasy.\n\n27:26.300 --> 27:28.300\nSo as far as gender, do you mean?\n\n27:28.300 --> 27:30.300\nGender is not easy.\n\n27:30.300 --> 27:32.300\nRight, but are you talking about the way\n\n27:32.300 --> 27:35.300\nthat the government would address gender,\n\n27:35.300 --> 27:38.300\nas far as, like, restrooms and marriage licenses?\n\n27:38.300 --> 27:40.300\nI don't know, yeah.\n\n27:40.300 --> 27:42.300\nLooking back for a very, very long time,\n\n27:42.300 --> 27:46.300\nand what we consider, like, wow, civilization,\n\n27:46.300 --> 27:49.300\nit's been gross white dudes controlling shit,\n\n27:49.300 --> 27:52.300\nand women have been pushed out\n\n27:52.300 --> 27:55.300\nof all fucking conversation at all times,\n\n27:55.300 --> 27:58.300\nand the times when I have, like, for instance,\n\n27:58.300 --> 28:00.300\nI've been on a television show\n\n28:00.300 --> 28:02.300\nwhere there's been run by all men,\n\n28:02.300 --> 28:04.300\nand the men, there were the writers,\n\n28:04.300 --> 28:06.300\nand the producers, and the camera,\n\n28:06.300 --> 28:08.300\nso you hear arguments, and you hear\n\n28:08.300 --> 28:10.300\na bunch of fucking bullshit all day long.\n\n28:10.300 --> 28:12.300\nI've also been on shows where the front line was women,\n\n28:12.300 --> 28:14.300\nwomen were the director's camera,\n\n28:14.300 --> 28:16.300\nlike, first ADs and stuff like that.\n\n28:16.300 --> 28:18.300\nNo fucking bullshit.\n\n28:18.300 --> 28:20.300\nCommunication, they all fucking dealt with stuff.\n\n28:20.300 --> 28:23.300\nThere was no less problems and no less, like, stakes.\n\n28:23.300 --> 28:26.300\nThey just managed to deal with it in a much cooler way.\n\n28:26.300 --> 28:29.300\nI think you should involve women way more,\n\n28:29.300 --> 28:31.300\nand instead of letting a bunch of guys,\n\n28:31.300 --> 28:34.300\nlike, I run everything because it's gross\n\n28:34.300 --> 28:36.300\nand icky and a bunch of fucking cock fighting all the time.\n\n28:36.300 --> 28:39.300\nSure, but that would protest too much.\n\n28:39.300 --> 28:40.300\nBut...\n\n28:40.300 --> 28:41.300\nI protest too much about what?\n\n28:41.300 --> 28:43.300\nWell, obviously.\n\n28:43.300 --> 28:45.300\nYeah, I mean...\n\n28:45.300 --> 28:47.300\nI'm not a hero for saying that,\n\n28:47.300 --> 28:49.300\nit's just ridiculous, the idea that\n\n28:49.300 --> 28:52.300\nall of our statues are a bunch of dudes,\n\n28:52.300 --> 28:54.300\nand when we ever put a woman on a coin,\n\n28:54.300 --> 28:56.300\nit's ironic, like it's fucking hilarious.\n\n28:56.300 --> 29:03.300\nLike, we live in a needlessly male world.\n\n29:03.300 --> 29:05.300\nIt's so stupid.\n\n29:05.300 --> 29:08.300\nRight, but we don't, but we don't.\n\n29:08.300 --> 29:11.300\nWe do, but we...\n\n29:11.300 --> 29:14.300\nOkay, but do you actually, like,\n\n29:14.300 --> 29:15.300\nis there...\n\n29:15.300 --> 29:17.300\nOkay, fantasize in your head.\n\n29:17.300 --> 29:19.300\nI'm on a unicorn.\n\n29:19.300 --> 29:21.300\nWe're landing on the moon tomorrow.\n\n29:21.300 --> 29:22.300\nRight.\n\n29:22.300 --> 29:25.300\nThere's a rocket ship full of 100 people.\n\n29:25.300 --> 29:27.300\nThat's 40 unicorns.\n\n29:27.300 --> 29:29.300\nLet's assume 50 men and 50 women.\n\n29:29.300 --> 29:32.300\nLet's assume that we're splitting it down the middle.\n\n29:32.300 --> 29:33.300\nOkay.\n\n29:33.300 --> 29:35.300\nI don't know if I'm making a mistake assuming that,\n\n29:35.300 --> 29:39.300\nbut it's 100 people, 50 men, 50 women, biologically.\n\n29:39.300 --> 29:41.300\nShould be 51, 40 men.\n\n29:41.300 --> 29:42.300\nWhen...\n\n29:42.300 --> 29:44.300\nWe are going to set up a school.\n\n29:44.300 --> 29:47.300\nWe're going to teach children.\n\n29:47.300 --> 29:49.300\nWe're going to...\n\n29:49.300 --> 29:51.300\nThere's going to be a new generation\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:54.300\nafter we land on the moon and we pitch our tents\n\n29:54.300 --> 29:56.300\nand we do our thing.\n\n29:56.300 --> 29:59.300\nThe idea is that the following generation\n\n29:59.300 --> 30:02.300\nis going to have a chance of being wiped clean\n\n30:02.300 --> 30:04.300\nof all kinds of shit,\n\n30:04.300 --> 30:06.300\nbecause that's all we've been trying to do down here forever.\n\n30:06.300 --> 30:09.300\nWith our funerals for various words\n\n30:09.300 --> 30:12.300\nand our letters to TV guide\n\n30:12.300 --> 30:14.300\nand our fucking...\n\n30:14.300 --> 30:17.300\nWe fantasize about a clean slate.\n\n30:17.300 --> 30:20.300\nAnd there's no better clean slate than a colony.\n\n30:20.300 --> 30:22.300\nYou just take a select group of people\n\n30:22.300 --> 30:24.300\nand you just go, okay.\n\n30:24.300 --> 30:27.300\nSo what are we going to teach these kids about?\n\n30:27.300 --> 30:33.300\nAre we going to outlaw gender projection?\n\n30:33.300 --> 30:35.300\nWell, that's my question.\n\n30:35.300 --> 30:38.300\nDo you mean like sexually it's 50 men and 50 women\n\n30:38.300 --> 30:41.300\nor do you mean gender-wise it's 50 men and 50 women?\n\n30:41.300 --> 30:43.300\nBefore we even get into that,\n\n30:43.300 --> 30:45.300\nI think you're talking about the LA perspective\n\n30:45.300 --> 30:47.300\nwhere it's like our 10 of these people,\n\n30:47.300 --> 30:49.300\npeople that are men that identify as women and blah, blah, blah.\n\n30:49.300 --> 30:54.300\nBut I'm saying like, let's just start simple.\n\n30:54.300 --> 30:57.300\nWhen we're teaching them the alphabet,\n\n30:57.300 --> 31:02.300\nwhen we're giving them toys,\n\n31:02.300 --> 31:06.300\nare we going to commit to the idea\n\n31:06.300 --> 31:08.300\nthat children need to be programmed\n\n31:08.300 --> 31:10.300\nand are we...\n\n31:10.300 --> 31:12.300\nWe know how to do that racially.\n\n31:12.300 --> 31:15.300\nWe know that you just don't make children racist.\n\n31:15.300 --> 31:20.300\nWe know that you just simply don't program children with racism.\n\n31:20.300 --> 31:27.300\nBut we don't know yet how to not program children with gender politics.\n\n31:27.300 --> 31:29.300\nWe don't understand what that means.\n\n31:29.300 --> 31:31.300\nI don't understand what that means.\n\n31:31.300 --> 31:36.300\nWhat would you do in a neutral sterile kind of colony?\n\n31:36.300 --> 31:38.300\nWould you...\n\n31:38.300 --> 31:42.300\nAre there pitfalls that you avoid?\n\n31:42.300 --> 31:44.300\nKids like toys.\n\n31:44.300 --> 31:46.300\nWhat do you...\n\n31:46.300 --> 31:50.300\nDo you have to give them gender-neutral toys?\n\n31:50.300 --> 31:55.300\nDo kids start to express gender?\n\n31:55.300 --> 32:02.300\nI listened to stories on NPR about kids expressing their gender.\n\n32:02.300 --> 32:05.300\nWhen it's in an ironic capacity,\n\n32:05.300 --> 32:07.300\nwhen the kid is like,\n\n32:07.300 --> 32:14.300\nwe wanted to support him but he wanted to do the thing and blah blah blah,\n\n32:14.300 --> 32:18.300\nwe don't know what is politically correct right now, do we?\n\n32:18.300 --> 32:20.300\nRight, yeah.\n\n32:20.300 --> 32:24.300\nI think the real answer,\n\n32:24.300 --> 32:28.300\nif we were really going to the moon and we were really figuring this stuff out,\n\n32:28.300 --> 32:30.300\nI think that I would...\n\n32:30.300 --> 32:35.300\nWhich I think is what most parents do is just follow whatever their kids want.\n\n32:35.300 --> 32:37.300\nI don't think that my parents...\n\n32:37.300 --> 32:39.300\nMy parents were great,\n\n32:39.300 --> 32:41.300\nbut I don't think that they were progressive in any way.\n\n32:41.300 --> 32:43.300\nAnd I know that when I was growing up,\n\n32:43.300 --> 32:47.300\nI played with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\n32:47.300 --> 32:49.300\nwithin a Barbie house,\n\n32:49.300 --> 32:52.300\nbut with no Barbies.\n\n32:52.300 --> 32:54.300\nSo when were you...\n\n32:54.300 --> 32:57.300\nSo I think that the real answer,\n\n32:57.300 --> 33:00.300\nif we're first sending everyone to the moon and everyone gets a kit\n\n33:00.300 --> 33:04.300\nand it's like a bag of Kit Kat bars,\n\n33:04.300 --> 33:06.300\nthat's a terrible idea.\n\n33:06.300 --> 33:09.300\nThere's a bag of Weedabix\n\n33:09.300 --> 33:13.300\nand cucumbers and tomatoes and eggs.\n\n33:13.300 --> 33:15.300\nAnd then for the kids,\n\n33:15.300 --> 33:19.300\nit would just be like a burlap sack that would have matchbox cars,\n\n33:19.300 --> 33:26.300\nmatchbox cars, but also treasure trolls and dolls.\n\n33:26.300 --> 33:28.300\nI mean, it's not...\n\n33:28.300 --> 33:31.300\nThe real answer is that that's not that big of a deal\n\n33:31.300 --> 33:34.300\nbecause that doesn't mean...\n\n33:34.300 --> 33:37.300\nThat doesn't identify anyone's sexuality,\n\n33:37.300 --> 33:40.300\nlike what toys you play with,\n\n33:40.300 --> 33:42.300\nbut making them available to everyone.\n\n33:42.300 --> 33:44.300\nI'm sorry.\n\n33:44.300 --> 33:46.300\nLouren Gage, you can't stop it.\n\n33:46.300 --> 33:48.300\nI want to bring Camille out.\n\n33:48.300 --> 33:50.300\nLet's bring Camille out.\n\n33:50.300 --> 33:52.300\nGet his perspective as well.\n\n33:52.300 --> 33:54.300\nCamille!\n\n33:54.300 --> 33:56.300\nCamille?\n\n33:56.300 --> 34:00.300\nWe should really be bringing out his Camille's wife, Emily.\n\n34:00.300 --> 34:02.300\nShe specializes in this stuff, doesn't she?\n\n34:02.300 --> 34:04.300\nShe's not here, yeah.\n\n34:04.300 --> 34:06.300\nShe had to drop me off, that sucks.\n\n34:06.300 --> 34:08.300\nShe does specialize in this stuff.\n\n34:08.300 --> 34:10.300\nShe thinks about these things for a living, right?\n\n34:10.300 --> 34:12.300\nYeah, she tells me about it, but I don't listen.\n\n34:12.300 --> 34:14.300\nWe're having fun.\n\n34:14.300 --> 34:16.300\nIt is...\n\n34:16.300 --> 34:18.300\nBy the way, was that book you guys reading?\n\n34:18.300 --> 34:20.300\nThat was Daniel Quinn?\n\n34:20.300 --> 34:22.300\nYeah.\n\n34:22.300 --> 34:24.300\nI know who...\n\n34:24.300 --> 34:26.300\nYou know Daniel Quinn?\n\n34:26.300 --> 34:28.300\nI just read one of his books in college\n\n34:28.300 --> 34:30.300\nso much.\n\n34:30.300 --> 34:32.300\nIt's called Ishmael was his book.\n\n34:32.300 --> 34:34.300\nHe refers to it in that book?\n\n34:34.300 --> 34:36.300\nYeah, no, he's up his own ass.\n\n34:36.300 --> 34:38.300\nI don't want to get off topic,\n\n34:38.300 --> 34:40.300\nbut Ishmael is about this gorilla\n\n34:40.300 --> 34:42.300\nthat teaches this guy the right way to live\n\n34:42.300 --> 34:44.300\nand civilization is fucked up,\n\n34:44.300 --> 34:46.300\nand it's basically he's sort of advocating\n\n34:46.300 --> 34:48.300\nthat we don't help other countries\n\n34:48.300 --> 34:50.300\nand just kind of let them\n\n34:50.300 --> 34:52.300\ndie when they get diseases.\n\n34:52.300 --> 34:54.300\nAnyway, that really is...\n\n34:54.300 --> 34:56.300\nFor real? That's this guy?\n\n34:56.300 --> 34:58.300\nSee, I didn't like the book based on\n\n34:58.300 --> 35:00.300\nformat.\n\n35:00.300 --> 35:02.300\nI like finding out\n\n35:02.300 --> 35:04.300\nthat you don't like him for real reasons.\n\n35:04.300 --> 35:06.300\nYeah, there's so much to hate about it.\n\n35:06.300 --> 35:08.300\nI thought it was poetry from far away.\n\n35:08.300 --> 35:10.300\nWell, it's written...\n\n35:10.300 --> 35:12.300\nYou look at it and you think, oh, it's sucky.\n\n35:12.300 --> 35:14.300\nHe comings. He doesn't care about format,\n\n35:14.300 --> 35:16.300\nbut also he comings had fucking content.\n\n35:16.300 --> 35:18.300\nAlso, it was\n\n35:18.300 --> 35:20.300\nAnthropology 101 and everyone else in the class\n\n35:20.300 --> 35:22.300\nwas blown away by this book\n\n35:22.300 --> 35:24.300\nand how it changed their lives,\n\n35:24.300 --> 35:26.300\nand I really, really had such\n\n35:26.300 --> 35:28.300\na visceral negative reaction to it.\n\n35:28.300 --> 35:30.300\nThere's a chapter in here that says, I eat bets.\n\n35:30.300 --> 35:32.300\nI'm just saying.\n\n35:32.300 --> 35:34.300\nSo Camille, are you and Emily going to have kids\n\n35:34.300 --> 35:36.300\nstart to pry?\n\n35:36.300 --> 35:38.300\nI mean, yeah.\n\n35:38.300 --> 35:40.300\nYeah, I hope so,\n\n35:40.300 --> 35:42.300\nunless, you know, one of us...\n\n35:42.300 --> 35:44.300\nThe rest of that sentence is with us.\n\n35:44.300 --> 35:46.300\nIs this a new thing?\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:48.300\nWell, you've heard\n\n35:48.300 --> 35:50.300\nof these kid partnerships, right?\n\n35:50.300 --> 35:52.300\nNo.\n\n35:52.300 --> 35:54.300\nYou find another couple\n\n35:54.300 --> 35:56.300\nwho you admire.\n\n35:56.300 --> 35:58.300\nIt's like a key party.\n\n35:58.300 --> 36:00.300\nYeah, it's like a key party.\n\n36:00.300 --> 36:02.300\nIt's called a womb...\n\n36:02.300 --> 36:04.300\nwomb blast.\n\n36:04.300 --> 36:06.300\nYeah.\n\n36:06.300 --> 36:08.300\nAnd you just switch babies?\n\n36:08.300 --> 36:10.300\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\n36:10.300 --> 36:12.300\nWe just say to you, so Camille\n\n36:12.300 --> 36:14.300\nand Emily, like, you guys are having kids?\n\n36:14.300 --> 36:16.300\nYeah, you have your own kid,\n\n36:16.300 --> 36:18.300\nbut then after a while, it's our kid.\n\n36:18.300 --> 36:20.300\nAnd our kid is your kid.\n\n36:20.300 --> 36:22.300\nIt's called a womb blast.\n\n36:22.300 --> 36:24.300\nAnd we have parties,\n\n36:24.300 --> 36:26.300\nand we all hang out together.\n\n36:26.300 --> 36:28.300\nIt's basically like a play date,\n\n36:28.300 --> 36:30.300\nbut just, like, more official.\n\n36:30.300 --> 36:32.300\nNo, but I...\n\n36:32.300 --> 36:34.300\nYes, we are, I think,\n\n36:34.300 --> 36:36.300\nand if our stuff works,\n\n36:36.300 --> 36:38.300\nwe will have a kid.\n\n36:38.300 --> 36:40.300\nSo...\n\n36:40.300 --> 36:42.300\nWe were talking about\n\n36:42.300 --> 36:44.300\ngender politics.\n\n36:44.300 --> 36:46.300\nPolitics doesn't even\n\n36:46.300 --> 36:48.300\nwork as a word\n\n36:48.300 --> 36:50.300\nfor the issue at hand.\n\n36:50.300 --> 36:52.300\nWhat does gender mean?\n\n36:52.300 --> 36:54.300\nHow much is\n\n36:54.300 --> 36:56.300\ngender an artificial construct\n\n36:56.300 --> 36:58.300\nin a world where we've started to understand\n\n36:58.300 --> 37:00.300\nthat race is an artificial construct?\n\n37:00.300 --> 37:02.300\nLike, how much do we owe it\n\n37:02.300 --> 37:04.300\nto ourselves to think of gender\n\n37:04.300 --> 37:06.300\nas an artificial construct?\n\n37:06.300 --> 37:08.300\nMaybe I'm just being thick right now.\n\n37:08.300 --> 37:10.300\nI don't understand what your hang-up is.\n\n37:10.300 --> 37:12.300\nLike gender roles, right?\n\n37:12.300 --> 37:14.300\nMy hang-up is that in the 1950s,\n\n37:14.300 --> 37:16.300\nif you were to take your kid\n\n37:16.300 --> 37:18.300\ninto the garage\n\n37:18.300 --> 37:20.300\nand close the garage door\n\n37:20.300 --> 37:22.300\nand train the kid to be racist,\n\n37:22.300 --> 37:24.300\nwe now know\n\n37:24.300 --> 37:26.300\nthrough the lens of 2014\n\n37:26.300 --> 37:28.300\nhow to recognize\n\n37:28.300 --> 37:30.300\nwhat you're doing right and wrong with the child.\n\n37:30.300 --> 37:32.300\nWe can actually,\n\n37:32.300 --> 37:34.300\nin a sort of empirical sense,\n\n37:34.300 --> 37:36.300\nwe can define bad child-breering\n\n37:36.300 --> 37:38.300\nto the extent that you're raising\n\n37:38.300 --> 37:40.300\nyour child to be conscious\n\n37:40.300 --> 37:42.300\nof race.\n\n37:42.300 --> 37:44.300\nSo what's your concern about having a child?\n\n37:44.300 --> 37:46.300\nMy question is\n\n37:46.300 --> 37:48.300\nhow now\n\n37:48.300 --> 37:50.300\nhow does that work with gender?\n\n37:50.300 --> 37:52.300\nEmily has friends,\n\n37:52.300 --> 37:54.300\nthey're a lesbian\n\n37:54.300 --> 37:56.300\nand they have a kid\n\n37:56.300 --> 37:58.300\nand they are raising the baby gender neutral\n\n37:58.300 --> 38:00.300\nand\n\n38:00.300 --> 38:02.300\nso the baby is female\n\n38:02.300 --> 38:04.300\nand you know the baby has a female name\n\n38:04.300 --> 38:06.300\nbut what they're doing is there's no\n\n38:06.300 --> 38:08.300\nnothing is blue and nothing is pink\n\n38:08.300 --> 38:10.300\nand it's not dolls and it's not action figures\n\n38:10.300 --> 38:12.300\nso the baby's playing with toys\n\n38:12.300 --> 38:14.300\nand a boy or a girl\n\n38:14.300 --> 38:16.300\ncould play with\n\n38:16.300 --> 38:18.300\nbut it's hard because they asked\n\n38:18.300 --> 38:20.300\nEmily's mom\n\n38:20.300 --> 38:22.300\nwho's very close to the couple\n\n38:22.300 --> 38:24.300\nthey asked to give the kid gender neutral stuff\n\n38:24.300 --> 38:26.300\nand so the mom bought her\n\n38:26.300 --> 38:28.300\nmy mother-in-law\n\n38:28.300 --> 38:30.300\nand she was trying her best\n\n38:30.300 --> 38:32.300\nshe bought her\n\n38:32.300 --> 38:34.300\nlike a flower bow\n\n38:34.300 --> 38:36.300\nthat was purple instead of pink\n\n38:36.300 --> 38:38.300\nand she said purple is like a male color\n\n38:38.300 --> 38:40.300\nbut this is\n\n38:40.300 --> 38:42.300\nthis is a key issue\n\n38:42.300 --> 38:44.300\ntoys are us\n\n38:44.300 --> 38:46.300\nyou walk into it\n\n38:46.300 --> 38:48.300\naisle 3\n\n38:48.300 --> 38:50.300\naisle 4, aisle 5, aisle 6, aisle 7\n\n38:50.300 --> 38:52.300\nthey're not, they're based on\n\n38:52.300 --> 38:54.300\nages of children\n\n38:54.300 --> 38:56.300\nthey're also based on genders of children\n\n38:56.300 --> 38:58.300\nI don't know if they've tried\n\n38:58.300 --> 39:00.300\ndo you, capitalism\n\n39:00.300 --> 39:02.300\nso if you're a same sex couple\n\n39:02.300 --> 39:04.300\nyou're lesbian friends\n\n39:04.300 --> 39:06.300\nthey're having a kid, they make the decision\n\n39:06.300 --> 39:08.300\nwe're going to have a gender neutral child\n\n39:08.300 --> 39:10.300\nwe're not going to fuck with this child\n\n39:10.300 --> 39:12.300\ngender-wise\n\n39:12.300 --> 39:14.300\nnow, they're also in this\n\n39:14.300 --> 39:16.300\nlarger\n\n39:16.300 --> 39:18.300\ncolony\n\n39:18.300 --> 39:20.300\nyeah, sure\n\n39:20.300 --> 39:22.300\nit's impossible to what extent are you\n\n39:22.300 --> 39:24.300\nthe thing is more about\n\n39:24.300 --> 39:26.300\nnot saying because the kid\n\n39:26.300 --> 39:28.300\nis playing with trucks that they're\n\n39:28.300 --> 39:30.300\ngay or straight or male or female\n\n39:30.300 --> 39:32.300\nnobody's doing that to a kid\n\n39:32.300 --> 39:34.300\nnobody, well maybe some parent\n\n39:34.300 --> 39:36.300\nsomewhere out there might be going\n\n39:36.300 --> 39:38.300\nto play with that truck\n\n39:38.300 --> 39:40.300\nI'm sure that's not the right\n\n39:40.300 --> 39:42.300\nthat's a very straight thing to do\n\n39:42.300 --> 39:44.300\nI mean the fact that\n\n39:44.300 --> 39:46.300\nit's very invoked to give kids well things\n\n39:46.300 --> 39:48.300\nI'm sure there are kids here\n\n39:48.300 --> 39:50.300\nI'm sure there are people here who have\n\n39:50.300 --> 39:52.300\nyoung children who\n\n39:52.300 --> 39:54.300\ndoes anyone here have kids\n\n39:54.300 --> 39:56.300\nperfect\n\n39:56.300 --> 39:58.300\nyeah, that feels right\n\n39:58.300 --> 40:00.300\nsomeone back there has kids\n\n40:00.300 --> 40:02.300\nwith your hands\n\n40:02.300 --> 40:04.300\nas a\n\n40:04.300 --> 40:06.300\nnanny in Los Angeles, and maybe this is\n\n40:06.300 --> 40:08.300\ndifferent in other places, but it's\n\n40:08.300 --> 40:10.300\nvery uncool to suggest\n\n40:10.300 --> 40:12.300\nto a child\n\n40:12.300 --> 40:14.300\nthat they should be playing with a certain thing\n\n40:14.300 --> 40:16.300\nthat kids tend to be attracted to one or the other\n\n40:16.300 --> 40:18.300\nbut it doesn't mean anything\n\n40:18.300 --> 40:20.300\nbut I do think it comes from\n\n40:20.300 --> 40:22.300\nlike you said, the larger society\n\n40:22.300 --> 40:24.300\nit's almost impossible to raise a kid completely gender neutral\n\n40:24.300 --> 40:26.300\nbecause as you said, there are these sort of\n\n40:26.300 --> 40:28.300\nroles and things and that's just how it is\n\n40:28.300 --> 40:30.300\nlike\n\n40:30.300 --> 40:32.300\ngiven both things\n\n40:32.300 --> 40:34.300\nthere's two things\n\n40:34.300 --> 40:36.300\nbut it's going to be hard even when the kid goes to school\n\n40:36.300 --> 40:38.300\nand it's like, oh the boys\n\n40:38.300 --> 40:40.300\nare you kidding me?\n\n40:40.300 --> 40:42.300\nand the girls play with things that have great shoes\n\n40:42.300 --> 40:44.300\nyou know\n\n40:44.300 --> 40:46.300\nbut that is going to happen, I mean we're conditioned\n\n40:46.300 --> 40:48.300\nwhen you're a kid, look at the fucking\n\n40:48.300 --> 40:50.300\ncommercials for kids toys on TV\n\n40:50.300 --> 40:52.300\nlike it's all sort of\n\n40:52.300 --> 40:54.300\nit's either one or the other and that's really\n\n40:54.300 --> 40:56.300\nthe thing to do is\n\n40:56.300 --> 40:58.300\nif your little girl\n\n40:58.300 --> 41:00.300\nis playing with trucks and is talking about\n\n41:00.300 --> 41:02.300\nmurdering cowboys or whatever\n\n41:02.300 --> 41:04.300\nis to not say\n\n41:04.300 --> 41:06.300\nyou let her murder cowboys\n\n41:06.300 --> 41:08.300\nmaybe I'm talking about myself\n\n41:08.300 --> 41:10.300\nbut the thing is to not\n\n41:10.300 --> 41:12.300\nlike the gender\n\n41:12.300 --> 41:14.300\ngender neutral thing is to not say\n\n41:14.300 --> 41:16.300\noh well this child\n\n41:16.300 --> 41:18.300\nshe's a lesbian, like at four years old\n\n41:18.300 --> 41:20.300\nwell she's clearly a lesbian, she likes these trucks\n\n41:20.300 --> 41:22.300\nshe doesn't like these dolls\n\n41:22.300 --> 41:24.300\nit's just\n\n41:24.300 --> 41:26.300\nabout allowing kids to do whatever\n\n41:26.300 --> 41:28.300\nbecause in the\n\n41:28.300 --> 41:30.300\nhonestly, when a little girl\n\n41:30.300 --> 41:32.300\nwould play with a truck\n\n41:32.300 --> 41:34.300\nthat was bad, they would take the truck away\n\n41:34.300 --> 41:36.300\ndo you take your kid\n\n41:36.300 --> 41:38.300\nthrough Toys R Us\n\n41:38.300 --> 41:40.300\nand let the kid\n\n41:40.300 --> 41:42.300\nyes, which is not a crazy idea\n\n41:42.300 --> 41:44.300\nthey get to play with whatever\n\n41:44.300 --> 41:46.300\nand that's a good small stuff\n\n41:46.300 --> 41:48.300\nso you sort of let the kid be the guide\n\n41:48.300 --> 41:50.300\nbut we are living\n\n41:50.300 --> 41:52.300\nwithin a dichotomy though\n\n41:52.300 --> 41:54.300\nand the kid is being guided\n\n41:54.300 --> 41:56.300\nby other stuff other than the parents\n\n41:56.300 --> 41:58.300\nthat the parents are trying\n\n41:58.300 --> 42:00.300\nI remember specifically at some point being like\n\n42:00.300 --> 42:02.300\nI'm going to learn to walk more manly\n\n42:02.300 --> 42:04.300\nI remember thinking that\n\n42:04.300 --> 42:06.300\nand no one told me or made fun of me of the way I walked\n\n42:06.300 --> 42:08.300\nbut I mean look at me walk\n\n42:08.300 --> 42:10.300\nI walk fucking manly now\n\n42:10.300 --> 42:12.300\nbut I remember that pressure came\n\n42:12.300 --> 42:14.300\nand even if nobody tells you\n\n42:14.300 --> 42:16.300\nit's all there, it is a dichotomy\n\n42:16.300 --> 42:18.300\nDan and Aaron, you guys are engaged\n\n42:18.300 --> 42:20.300\nyou're going to be married\n\n42:20.300 --> 42:22.300\nprobably within the year or so right\n\n42:22.300 --> 42:24.300\nare you already thinking about kids\n\n42:24.300 --> 42:26.300\nhave you talked\n\n42:26.300 --> 42:28.300\nyes, yes\n\n42:28.300 --> 42:30.300\nis that where this comes from\n\n42:30.300 --> 42:32.300\nany part of this conversation or not\n\n42:32.300 --> 42:34.300\nno, I don't know why we're talking about gender\n\n42:34.300 --> 42:36.300\nthe guy gave a book, I don't know\n\n42:36.300 --> 42:38.300\nI'm riffed\n\n42:38.300 --> 42:40.300\nthat guy is not in the crowd\n\n42:40.300 --> 42:42.300\nis he the guy who wrote that book\n\n42:42.300 --> 42:44.300\nif he was he left\n\n42:44.300 --> 42:46.300\nlet's say you guys had a kid\n\n42:46.300 --> 42:48.300\nand let's say it was\n\n42:48.300 --> 42:50.300\npick it random, guy or girl\n\n42:50.300 --> 42:52.300\nguy\n\n42:52.300 --> 42:54.300\nhow would you approach that\n\n42:54.300 --> 42:56.300\nwould you have it\n\n42:56.300 --> 42:58.300\nI would lovingly\n\n42:58.300 --> 43:00.300\nfondle his privates\n\n43:02.300 --> 43:04.300\nI would kiss his balls\n\n43:04.300 --> 43:06.300\nI'm already doing wrong\n\n43:06.300 --> 43:08.300\nwhat if it's a girl\n\n43:08.300 --> 43:10.300\nI would call him King Harmon\n\n43:10.300 --> 43:12.300\nas long as she would lovingly fondle her privates

thing\n\n46:50.300 --> 46:52.300\nbecomes really\n\n46:52.300 --> 46:54.300\nunimportant\n\n46:54.300 --> 46:56.300\nin LA when everyone's rich\n\n46:56.300 --> 46:58.300\nI'm talking about\n\n46:58.300 --> 47:00.300\nwe're starting a colony\n\n47:00.300 --> 47:02.300\nhow do you approach things\n\n47:02.300 --> 47:04.300\nlogically I'm saying what's the right thing to

to detach\n\n47:18.300 --> 47:20.300\ngender identity from\n\n47:20.300 --> 47:22.300\ntrucks and dolls and whatever\n\n47:22.300 --> 47:24.300\nbecause everyone is like little kids are\n\n47:24.300

think\n\n47:50.300 --> 47:52.300\nI don't think board games\n\n47:52.300 --> 47:54.300\nin my head that was the most gender neutral thing\n\n47:54.300 --> 47:56.300\nI could take out\n\n47:56.300 -->

was\n\n48:20.300 --> 48:22.300\na grand diva\n\n48:22.300 --> 48:24.300\nbut my brother\n\n48:24.300 --> 48:26.300\nand his wife\n\n48:26.300 --> 48:28.300\nmy sister-in-law\n\n48:28.300 -->

that\n\n49:16.300 --> 49:18.300\nand that was never put on her\n\n49:18.300 --> 49:20.300\nshe has just gravitated towards costumes\n\n49:20.300 --> 49:22.300\nand what they made for her for her fifth birthday\n\n49:22.300 --> 49:24.300\nwas a big wardrobe\n\n49:24.300 --> 49:26.300\nand they filled it with costumes\n\n49:26.300 --> 49:28.300\ngender-neutral, male, female\n\n49:28.300 -->

died\n\n52:30.300 --> 52:32.300\nand he was a part of my life and I grew up in the theater\n\n52:32.300 --> 52:34.300\nand there were clearly people that\n\n52:34.300 --> 52:36.300\nbefore I knew what sexuality was\n\n52:36.300 --> 52:38.300\nbefore I'd ever had an erection\n\n52:38.300 --> 52:40.300\nall anatomy was\n\n52:40.300 --> 52:42.300\nI didn't know that there were people in my life\n\n52:42.300 --> 52:44.300\nthat weren't the way\n\n52:44.300 --> 52:46.300\nI was supposed to be\n\n52:46.300 --> 52:48.300\nmy parents weren't dogmatic about it\n\n52:48.300 --> 52:50.300\nI became the most homophobic person in the world\n\n52:50.300 --> 52:52.300\nbecause of the theater\n\n52:52.300 --> 52:54.300\nbecause my parents weren't homophobic\n\n52:54.300 --> 52:56.300\nmy parents weren't dogmatic\n\n52:56.300 --> 52:58.300\nand I feel like I must have talked about this in the show before\n\n52:58.300 --> 53:00.300\nmaybe not\n\n53:00.300 --> 53:02.300\nI was nine years old\n\n53:02.300 --> 53:04.300\nor even younger, I had dressers\n\n53:04.300 --> 53:06.300\nand they were the great\n\n53:06.300 --> 53:08.300\nlate 70s, early 80s queens\n\n53:08.300 --> 53:10.300\nand they didn't make out\n\n53:10.300 --> 53:12.300\nwith each other in front of me\n\n53:12.300 --> 53:14.300\nand I asked my hairdresser when I was\n\n53:14.300 --> 53:16.300\nnine or ten\n\n53:16.300 --> 53:18.300\nyour hairdresser would make out in front of you\n\n53:18.300 --> 53:20.300\nwould you get a terrible haircut?\n\n53:20.300 --> 53:22.300\nno, you're

53:30.300\ndresser and a hairdresser\n\n53:30.300 --> 53:32.300\nyou were on Broadway?\n\n53:32.300 --> 53:34.300\nI can't deny\n\n53:34.300 --> 53:36.300\nyou did not know this\n\n53:36.300 --> 53:38.300\nwith the Yule Brenner\n\n53:38.300 --> 53:40.300\nwhat is your life?\n\n53:40.300 --> 53:42.300\nthe king and I was your Brenner\n\n53:42.300 --> 53:44.300\nwhen I was a kid\n\n53:44.300

53:52.300\nshit\n\n53:52.300 --> 53:54.300\nso I had this dresser named Gordon\n\n53:54.300 --> 53:56.300\nhe was great and he was\n\n53:56.300 --> 53:58.300\nso funny\n\n53:58.300 --> 54:00.300\nthe costumes were really hard to get\n\n54:00.300 --> 54:02.300\nthere were tons of hooks and snaps and shit like that\n\n54:02.300 --> 54:04.300\nreally ridiculous old costumes\n\n54:04.300 --> 54:06.300\nand then a guy\n\n54:06.300 --> 54:08.300\nthat he was kind of dating was his hairdresser\n\n54:08.300 --> 54:10.300\nguy that would come in and they were just like\n\n54:10.300 --> 54:12.300\nfrench kiss in front of me and I was ten\n\n54:12.300 --> 54:14.300\nand then eleven\n\n54:14.300 --> 54:16.300\nand I asked the younger guy who was probably\n\n54:16.300 --> 54:18.300\nlike in his mid-twenties\n\n54:18.300 --> 54:20.300\nso did you know you were gay all the time?\n\n54:20.300 --> 54:22.300\ndid you always know you were going to be gay?\n\n54:22.300 -->

knew\n\n54:30.300 --> 54:32.300\nbecause not that I felt like I was ever going to get punched\n\n54:32.300 --> 54:34.300\nor beaten or\n\n54:34.300 --> 54:36.300\nostracized if I did grow up to be\n\n54:36.300 --> 54:38.300\nlike a good\n\n54:38.300 --> 54:40.300\nseventy percent of the people in that production\n\n54:40.300 --> 54:42.300\nwere gay\n\n54:42.300 --> 54:44.300\nand sadly and absolutely truly\n\n54:44.300 --> 54:46.300\nalmost all of them debt\n\n54:46.300 --> 54:48.300\nfrom AIDS\n\n54:48.300 --> 54:50.300\nI mean that was a big crazy time\n\n54:50.300 --> 54:52.300\nthis was the early days of that\n\n54:52.300 --> 54:54.300\nwhat was it, eighties?\n\n54:54.300 --> 54:56.300\nyeah, this is 84, 85\n\n54:56.300 --> 54:58.300\nand like most of that production\n\n54:58.300 --> 55:00.300\nis gone\n\n55:00.300 --> 55:02.300\nincluding I think these guys\n\n55:02.300 --> 55:04.300\nthis guy told me\n\n55:04.300 --> 55:06.300\nI thought I was straight until I was eighteen\n\n55:06.300 --> 55:08.300\nI got so homophobic and so worried about that\n\n55:08.300 --> 55:10.300\nonly because of my\n\n55:10.300 --> 55:12.300\nbeing gay is hard I'm sure\n\n55:12.300 --> 55:14.300\nand you wouldn't choose it as a young boy\n\n55:14.300 --> 55:16.300\nand I was literally\n\n55:16.300 --> 55:18.300\ntaking off the pictures mount\n\n55:18.300 --> 55:20.300\nto go audition for the king and I\n\n55:20.300 --> 55:22.300\nembarrassingly so by my mom\n\n55:22.300 --> 55:24.300\nand so when I went home at night\n\n55:24.300 --> 55:26.300\nor the last thing I did before I went to bed\n\n55:26.300 --> 55:28.300\nwas close a magazine and it was a picture of a guy\n\n55:28.300 --> 55:30.300\nI would keep looking until there was a picture of a woman\n\n55:32.300 --> 55:34.300\nbut to the point of like\n\n55:34.300 --> 55:36.300\nlike mania and if I was watching TV\n\n55:36.300 --> 55:38.300\nI would turn the TV off and right\n\n55:38.300 --> 55:40.300\nlast thing was a guy, fuck turn it back on\n\n55:40.300 --> 55:42.300\nand wait until there was a picture of a woman\n\n55:42.300 --> 55:44.300\nbecause if the last image of my mind\n\n55:44.300 --> 55:46.300\nwas a picture of a man\n\n55:46.300 --> 55:48.300\nbeing straight or gay was this toss\n\n55:48.300 --> 55:50.300\nof the coin\n\n55:50.300 --> 55:52.300\nmaybe that's what that guy did\n\n55:52.300 --> 55:54.300\nhe turned the TV off when it was a guy\n\n55:54.300 --> 55:56.300\nat 18\n\n55:56.300 --> 55:58.300\nand he turned gay\n\n55:58.300 --> 56:00.300\nas a 10 or 11 year old\n\n56:00.300 --> 56:02.300\nthat was the world that I thought\n\n56:02.300 --> 56:04.300\nwe lived in and then one day\n\n56:04.300 --> 56:06.300\nwhen I was 12 years old like laying in bed\n\n56:06.300 --> 56:08.300\nI just went like oh\n\n56:08.300 --> 56:10.300\nI like women\n\n56:10.300 --> 56:12.300\nand went to bed\n\n56:12.300 --> 56:14.300\nand never did that again but that wasn't because\n\n56:14.300 --> 56:16.300\nanybody told or beat it out of me or whatever\n\n56:16.300 --> 56:18.300\nbut there was a big point in my life\n\n56:18.300 --> 56:20.300\nwhere I felt like I really have to do come to grips\n\n56:20.300 --> 56:22.300\nwith the fact that like I might not know this\n\n56:22.300 --> 56:24.300\nuntil I'm much older than I am right now\n\n56:24.300 --> 56:26.300\nand that will be okay\n\n56:26.300 --> 56:28.300\nbut it won't be okay because it's fucking hard\n\n56:28.300 --> 56:30.300\nyou'll get treating like shit\n\n56:30.300 --> 56:32.300\nyou'll get pushed around\n\n56:32.300 --> 56:34.300\nwell this is something that you're able to articulate\n\n56:34.300 --> 56:36.300\nat the age of 40\n\n56:36.300 --> 56:38.300\nlooking back on it\n\n56:38.300 --> 56:40.300\nbecause it's as clean cut as straight\n\n56:40.300 --> 56:42.300\nversus gay and that's what I'm talking\n\n56:42.300 --> 56:44.300\nabout because we're\n\n56:44.300 --> 56:46.300\nentering a world now where we're becoming\n\n56:46.300 --> 56:48.300\nincreasingly conscious of\n\n56:48.300 --> 56:50.300\nthe pressures of\n\n56:50.300 --> 56:52.300\ngender identity\n\n56:52.300 --> 56:54.300\nand it's\n\n56:54.300 --> 56:56.300\nnot as clean cut as\n\n56:56.300 --> 56:58.300\nstraight or gay with gender identity\n\n56:58.300 --> 57:00.300\nyou don't know how feminine you're\n\n57:00.300 --> 57:02.300\nallowed to be or supposed to be\n\n57:02.300 --> 57:04.300\nor how masculine you're allowed to be\n\n57:04.300 --> 57:06.300\nor supposed to be this isn't about\n\n57:06.300 --> 57:08.300\nstraight or gay straight or gay comes down\n\n57:08.300 --> 57:10.300\nthat's our struggle\n\n57:10.300 --> 57:12.300\nto turn gender politics into\n\n57:12.300 --> 57:14.300\nsomething as clean cut as racial politics\n\n57:14.300 --> 57:16.300\nbecause your skin\n\n57:16.300 --> 57:18.300\nis brown or your skin is white\n\n57:18.300 --> 57:20.300\nand you had\n\n57:20.300 --> 57:22.300\nsex with a man and put your mouth\n\n57:22.300 --> 57:24.300\non his penis or you didn't\n\n57:24.300 --> 57:26.300\nthere are\n\n57:26.300 --> 57:28.300\nwe have friends of Harmontown\n\n57:28.300 --> 57:30.300\nwho come up here\n\n57:30.300 --> 57:32.300\nwho look like dudes\n\n57:32.300 --> 57:34.300\nand act like dudes\n\n57:34.300 --> 57:36.300\nand identify as women\n\n57:36.300 --> 57:38.300\nin their hearts and their minds\n\n57:38.300 --> 57:40.300\nand it's incumbent upon us\n\n57:40.300 --> 57:42.300\nI'm just curious as a guy\n\n57:42.300 --> 57:44.300\nwho's thinking about having a kid in this new world\n\n57:44.300 --> 57:46.300\nand also as a philosophical thought exercise\n\n57:46.300 --> 57:48.300\nI'm asking the question\n\n57:48.300 --> 57:50.300\nlike it doesn't like\n\n57:50.300 --> 57:52.300\nlook what goes through the young brain\n\n57:52.300 --> 57:54.300\nlook what carries through\n\n57:54.300 --> 57:56.300\nto the 40 year old adult\n\n57:56.300 --> 57:58.300\nabout when you felt like\n\n57:58.300 --> 58:00.300\ngender was being projected on to you\n\n58:00.300 --> 58:02.300\nyour sexual roles

--> 58:16.300\nand the men's dressing room\n\n58:16.300 --> 58:18.300\nthere were only a couple straight guys in that\n\n58:18.300 --> 58:20.300\nmost of the dancers were gay guys\n\n58:20.300 --> 58:22.300\nand they always had\n\n58:22.300 --> 58:24.300\nkind of ironically and wherever we traveled\n\n58:24.300 --> 58:26.300\nwe did like 13 cities together\n\n58:26.300 --> 58:28.300\nthere'd be

created a laugh\n\n01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.300\nthat was more feminine yeah\n\n01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.300\nlet's hear it\n\n01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.300\nwell have you seen\n\n01:02:20.300 -->

gender\n\n01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.300\nidentity\n\n01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.300\ncrisis with myself but I feel like my parents did\n\n01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.300\nlike they didn't think I was girly enough\n\n01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.300\nmy mom was really upset because I didn't want to wear\n\n01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.300\nmakeup and things like that but\n\n01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.300\nthis whole conversation I've kind of been\n\n01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.300\nhearing\n\n01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.300\nthat it feels\n\n01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.300\nto you like gender neutrality\n\n01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.300\nis something that you have to work\n\n01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.300\nfor with a kid and it's sort of like the opposite\n\n01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.300\nof the default which is trucks and dolls\n\n01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.300\nbut\n\n01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.300\nthe gender system in my\n\n01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.300\nthe gender system that we have is just\n\n01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.300\nas much of a construct as\n\n01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.300\nmaking something gender neutral\n\n01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.300\nit's just like it's it's beyond trucks and dolls\n\n01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.300\nlike it manifests like gender neutrality\n\n01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.300\nwould also be an artificial construct\n\n01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.300\nbut it would be one that gives more choice\n\n01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.300\nbecause the gender system\n\n01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.300\nwe have now takes that choice away\n\n01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.300\nand the problem that I have\n\n01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.300\nwith with the gender system we have now is not\n\n01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.300\njust like okay maybe if you let a boy\n\n01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.300\nnot know he's a boy or what being\n\n01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.300\na boy means maybe he'll want to play with guns\n\n01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.300\nand trucks anyway and a lot of little boys do\n\n01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.300\nbut it manifests in like everything\n\n01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.300\nin your life like I'm constantly coming up\n\n01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.300\nagainst this like realization that I don't\n\n01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.300\nthink I can do something because I'm a girl\n\n01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.300\neven though I'm fully aware of that\n\n01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.300\nand like just\n\n01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.300\none example that I can't stop\n\n01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300\nthinking about is this motherfucker with\n\n01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.300\nhis feet on the stage\n\n01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:36.300\nlike that's not something girls do\n\n01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.300\nyou think if you did that as a girl you're thinking like somebody\n\n01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.300\nwould go hey bitch get your feet off the stage\n\n01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.300\nI think about I think that about\n\n01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.300\nhim constantly\n\n01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.300\nhe is\n\n01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.300\nway out of line putting his feet on the stage\n\n01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.300\nI would never see a girl do that\n\n01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.300\nno matter how like the holes out\n\n01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.300\nno matter how pink Anatoly shoes are\n\n01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.300\nthey're still all over our stage\n\n01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.300\nhe's Russian it's a whole different thing\n\n01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.300\nand it feels very phallic\n\n01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.300\ncontinue please\n\n01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.300\nthat's it it's just\n\n01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.300\nit's things like that and you know\n\n01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.300\njust kind of thinking like man why don't I feel\n\n01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:10.300\nlike I can do a thing\n\n01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.300\nbecause and then it makes\n\n01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300\na real difference seeing people that look\n\n01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.300\nlike you do stuff you want to do\n\n01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.300\nsorry may I ask how old you are\n\n01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.300\n23\n\n01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.300\nSarah Silverman\n\n01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.300\nI'm just going to say it she said don't tell\n\n01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.300\nlittle girls they can do whatever they want to do\n\n01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.300\nbecause they would never have\n\n01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.300\noccurred to them that they couldn't\n\n01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.300\nand I think just having to tell girls\n\n01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.300\nthat they could be like whatever they want to be\n\n01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300\nit comes from such a place of\n\n01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.300\nyou know where there are certain things that you feel\n\n01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.300\ndon't feel comfortable doing\n\n01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.300\nwhen you say\n\n01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.300\npeople that look like you\n\n01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.300\nwhat does that mean to you\n\n01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.300\nit means gender\n\n01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.300\nit means sex it means race it means everything\n\n01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.300\nand it's a kind of thing we're like\n\n01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.300\nI don't consciously think about it all the time\n\n01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.300\nwhen I look at a stage and there's only men on it\n\n01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.300\nI don't usually think\n\n01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.300\noh man it's all men they don't look like me\n\n01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.300\nbut then if a woman comes on stage\n\n01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.300\nI feel relieved and I\n\n01:07:04.300

discussion\n\n01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.300\nand you didn't come to the stage\n\n01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.300\nwhat has been glaring really\n\n01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.300\nwhen you look back on your childhood\n\n01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.300\ndo you think about\n\n01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.300\nso you're raised in the Bay Area\n\n01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.300\nby a parent who are\n\n01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.300\nwhat were they trying to do\n\n01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.300\nto you\n\n01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.300\nwere they on a mission\n\n01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.300\nthey were just trying to do what they thought was normal\n\n01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.300\nwhich is what everybody else\n\n01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.300\nis trying to do\n\n01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.300\nbut it was like\n\n01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.300\nI remember I always just wanted because I have an older brother\n\n01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.300\nand I just always wanted to do everything you want to do\n\n01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.300\nmy parents didn't really put much on me\n\n01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.300\nuntil you know like puberty\n\n01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.300\nand then they were like\n\n01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.300\nthey just thought it was weird that I didn't\n\n01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.300\nhang out with boys\n\n01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.300\nthat they didn't see I don't know\n\n01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.300\nbecause they were like alright you're a kid whatever\n\n01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.300\nplay with blocks but\n\n01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.300\nthen after a while I began to see\n\n01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.300\nconcern with them\n\n01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.300\nand I didn't really understand why\n\n01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.300\ndid they ever discourage you from doing anything that was like\n\n01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.300\ngender exclusive\n\n01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.300\nno they just thought I was\n\n01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.300\nautistic\n\n01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.300\nno it wasn't gender\n\n01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.300\nwe had a lot of problems but\n\n01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.300\nmost of them were not gender related\n\n01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.300\nmy mom was very like\n\n01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.300\nI thought I was raising you to be a feminist\n\n01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.300\nI would do things she didn't think she would kind of use\n\n01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.300\nlike I thought you were supposed to be a strong woman\n\n01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.300\nI was like I don't know what that means\n\n01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.300\nI think in a way\n\n01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.300\nmaybe this is totally wrong\n\n01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.300\nbut I feel like for girls\n\n01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.300\nit's a little more weird\n\n01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.300\nbecause the girl things are so\n\n01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.300\ngirly\n\n01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.300\nthey're so babies\n\n01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.300\nthey're so pink houses\n\n01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.300\nthey're so everything whereas boys\n\n01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.300\nthere are trucks and there are models\n\n01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:26.300\nand all these different things\n\n01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.300\nare a little weirder to\n\n01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.300\nbut I also do think girls get to have\n\n01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.300\na little more variance\n\n01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.300\nlike a little girl playing with a truck is okay\n\n01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.300\nbut a little boy playing with a truck is okay\n\n01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.300\nyeah no you're right\n\n01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.300\nthat's totally crap\n\n01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:42.300\nI feel like the deck is stacked\n\n01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.300\nwell I feel like the deck is stacked against\n\n01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.300\ngirls a little more\n\n01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.300\nbecause if a boy\n\n01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.300\na boy doesn't have to\n\n01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.300\nput on a pink chiffon\n\n01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.300\ndress\n\n01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.300\nbringing it in order to be perceived as being\n\n01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.300\nless masculine\n\n01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.300\nlike\n\n01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.300\na boy gets more\n\n01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.300\nleeway\n\n01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.300\na boy is allowed to be for instance\n\n01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.300\nsmart, a nerd\n\n01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.300\nlike I feel like\n\n01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.300\nif a girl like Mary Curie\n\n01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.300\nI feel like if she's\n\n01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.300\nmore interested in looking through a microscope\n\n01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.300\nthan\n\n01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.300\nher coming out party\n\n01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.300\nI feel like she gets more punished than her male counterpart\n\n01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.300\nthat is true\n\n01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.300\nbeing a guy is\n\n01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.300\nthe best\n\n01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.300\nso everything's in our favor\n\n01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.300\nbut we're all very familiar with the term\n\n01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.300\nTom Boy but we don't have the same thing\n\n01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.300\nexactly that's my point\n\n01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.300\nat my niece's\n\n01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.300\nfifth birthday party\n\n01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.300\nin December\n\n01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.300\nshe has all these costumes and most of them are\n\n01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.300\nlittle girl costumes\n\n01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.300\nbecause they're for her\n\n01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.300\nthere were a bunch of other kids\n\n01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.300\nthat were there\n\n01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.300\nbut one of them\n\n01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.300\nthere were boys\n\n01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:58.300\nso there were four boys there\n\n01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.300\nand there was only one male\n\n01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.300\noutfit to put on so all of the guys\n\n01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.300\nwere running around dressed like Cinderella\n\n01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.300\nand princesses and shit\n\n01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.300\nand the thing is\n\n01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.300\nnobody gave it to the parents\n\n01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.300\nthere was a moment like\n\n01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.300\nthis is the first time anybody's ever seen anything like this\n\n01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.300\nbut all the little boys were running around\n\n01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.300\nthese four and five year old six year old boys\n\n01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.300\ndressed like Johannes and shit and it was hilarious\n\n01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.300\nand they all like\n\n01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.300\nthey didn't give a fuck\n\n01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.300\nbecause they're playing Cowboys and Nindians\n\n01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.300\nbut if you're a little girl\n\n01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.300\nand you go into your brothers\n\n01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.300\nand it's all Cowboys and Nindians stuff\n\n01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.300\nthe little girls aren't allowed to dress up\n\n01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.300\nlike

and the boys\n\n01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.300\ndidn't lose any credit among each other\n\n01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300\nor in front of anybody\n\n01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.300\nEmily worked at this facility\n\n01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.300\nand I don't want to say where it was\n\n01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.300\nbut it was like one four because she's a therapist\n\n01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.300\nit was for like bad kids\n\n01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300\nbut these were like bad kids\n\n01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.300\nlike done a bunch of drugs and stuff\n\n01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.300\nso they were all like sort of very obsessed\n\n01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.300\nwith seeming like you know hard and tough\n\n01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.300\nand because it was all just guys there\n\n01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.300\nthe kids would end up like\n\n01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.300\nfucking each other\n\n01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.300\nand then they would have these sort of\n\n01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.300\ncrises they would come to Emily\n\n01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.300\nbe like I think I'm gay and Emily would be like well\n\n01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.300\nnot necessarily you might be but also\n\n01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.300\nyou just have to get this out\n\n01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.300\none time she heard\n\n01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.300\nthese two kids were snuggling\n\n01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300\nand they weren't allowed to go home for Christmas\n\n01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.300\nand these two like really\n\n01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.300\nrough and tumble\n\n01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.300\nlike 14 year olds and she heard them\n\n01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.300\nwhisper one guy said to the other\n\n01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.300\nhe's like Merry Christmas baby\n\n01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.300\nand I think that's what\n\n01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.300\nthey sort of\n\n01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.300\nit became a safe environment\n\n01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.300\nto kind of do whatever\n\n01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.300\nthey wanted to do and not have\n\n01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.300\nto have a label on it you know\n\n01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.300\nand I think that sort of\n\n01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.300\nwas weirdly kind of freeing for them\n\n01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.300\nyeah I think\n\n01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.300\n100% right when you say that\n\n01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.300\nit's not cool\n\n01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.300\nfor boys to be girly\n\n01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:18.300\nbut\n\n01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.300\nboys are really rewarded for being\n\n01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.300\nfunny and goofy and\n\n01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.300\nputting on girls\n\n01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.300\noutfits and whatever else like it's not\n\n01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.300\nlike for girls just talking a lot\n\n01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.300\nyeah they were just talking a lot it sounds\n\n01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.300\nlike Sarah had the same experience\n\n01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.300\nthat I did where\n\n01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.300\ntheir parents were kind of panicked\n\n01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.300\nover the way that\n\n01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.300\nyou were interacting with the world\n\n01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.300\nand\n\n01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.300\nwe're worried that like you weren't going to be\n\n01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.300\nI know for sure like my mom\n\n01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.300\nhad an actual conversation with me\n\n01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.300\nthat was about me not\n\n01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.300\nbeing pretty enough or like me not\n\n01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.300\nbeing pretty or losing weight or\n\n01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.300\netc etc like
