WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
From the beautiful Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia!

00:18.000 --> 00:30.000
We're not in the main room, we're in a sexy little underground dungeon called the studio here.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Harmontown is in session.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden!

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
Hey guys, how's it going man?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh, I'm good.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
You're looking good.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
No.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
You're not good.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Thank you.

00:54.000 --> 01:19.000
I think it's good. Let's bring out the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
Hello for the second night, Sydney, Australia.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Port Capital of the World.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
A ship hull to the planet.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
The big city in the place down there.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm not afraid to say it.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
You've been wonderful to us.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
Hold on.

01:56.000 --> 02:05.000
I did another, I did a panel tonight.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
You're not allowed to ask for your money back, I'm not in charge of that.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
But it's going to be a bad show.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
Are you saying that we're not going to get a chicken dinner after the show tonight?

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Because I distinctly wished you chukas before the show.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
When I say bad show, you need to lower your bar.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Because here's the thing that happened last night.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
As you know, I'm afraid of the fact that I don't have an act, so I'll do a rap.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I'll end the show with a rap.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.000
It's like, oh, they have to applaud.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
You have to do something to end the show that has no...

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
I did a rap about Australia.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I said the word Australia, and I couldn't rhyme it.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Then everyone starts yelling out, genitalia and all this shit.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
But I just want to point out to you that that's a pretty cool thing.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
That you, to buy a ticket to a performer who is so committed to not preparing for a show,

03:16.000 --> 03:27.000
that he can spend a 15-hour flight to a continent he's pretty sure he'll be rapping about.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
And he doesn't have a rhyme, one rhyme, for the name of the continent.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
What you're getting when you come to my show is not corporate bullshit.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Kepler didn't decide what you'd be tasting.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Sometimes, therefore, it will be shit.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Sometimes, you'll be tasting shit.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Sometimes, it's Harry Potter's Dumbledore...

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Sometimes, you get the nice chukkas.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
A nice what?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Do you not listen to the beginning of the show?

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
I found out the chukkas, which is their break of leg,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
means that you get a chicken dinner after the show if you do a good job.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
No, I don't listen to the... No.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
What am I supposed to listen to?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
What are you doing back there?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I'm getting in the zone.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
You're coming up with rhymes for Tasmania.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
This conflict is hilarious, but we couldn't hear you back there.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Sometimes, I'll make a crack if I notice it's been eight minutes.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
I'll go, hey, can Jeff keep it to a tight ten here?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I don't hear what's happening.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
All I hear is the sound of my laughs getting sucked into your hat.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
You know that metaphor.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
You know the old...

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
The laugh-sucking hat.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
The laugh-sucking hat by Roald Dahl.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
Anyways, no, I didn't hear...

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I didn't hear, tell me, you already told me.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
I got scared, you came back, I thought you were saying they were rowdy tonight.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
You were like, there's a lot of people, they seem fine.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
They're just good fun here.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
We thought, like, Brisbane was a little nutty,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
and Melbourne, a guy vomited in his shoe and then got in a fight.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
But in a hip way.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
That made you ask, what's a shoe?

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
How do you puke in it?

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Well, it's the earliest that's ever been 9-11 in our show.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
This is going to be the 9-11 of shows.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Thank you, 9-11 Watchers.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Our international scouts.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Be honest, is there anybody here that actually sets like an alarm for that

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
so that they won't forget that it's 9-11?

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Yup.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
We got Australian Dave Kline out there.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Yup, mate.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Alright, okay, it's our last night in Sydney.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Let's take this relationship to a deeper place than we have.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
First, with sincerity, I'm not going to say, it's nice weather.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
I mean, your opera house is shaped funny, like a porcupine.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
We're beyond that. We're now into the surface.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I want to say kudos to you.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It seems like my girlfriend pointed out, and I was like, yeah, you're right.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I think I did notice that too.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
There's a very, very gentlemanly sidewalk culture here.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
Gentlemen are not guaranteed to fucking leer and cat-call and who's a witzel.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Jesus, did you not notice that? Are you guys not proud of that?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
You're saying that they're gentlemanly towards women walking down the street.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Yeah, they don't scream at women.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
There's not as much rubber-necking and like kind of intimidation and stuff like stranger to stranger.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Well, all the women disagree with you.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Okay, alright.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Well, what do they know?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
They're crazy, yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I never got cat-called once.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
Those seats could have been filled with juicy cocks.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
This is a man's show.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
I want juicy nuts and hard cocks in those seats.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
That's the Harmontown guarantee.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
I was walking down the road by myself in Brisbane. I went over to the West End

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
and there was a guy that was honking his horn and he yelled out to...

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I'm assuming a woman.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I mean, it could have been anybody.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
He said, you got a fairness!

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Oh, okay. I guess I was wrong.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Alright.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I don't know what...

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
What would be the best case scenario that you guys would all applaud yourselves?

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
You're right. We do have no sexual harassment in our city.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
You would be the worst city in the world if you did that.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
That was true. You'd be shitty people.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Here's how polite things are. I took a little wander today

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
and I ended up in no direction.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
My phone, like, data wasn't working.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
So I was like, I'm just going to walk.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
I can still see where the downtown is, I know, my way back.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
And I ended up in King's Cross and there was a bunch of bikers over there

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
hanging out in front of whorehouses?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Like strip clubs, right?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
10 a.m., everybody's in casinos and strip clubs.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
It is a million, like, Hell's Angels looking bikers.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
And they were the nicest people.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
I guess the first way I received that is I feel like you're...

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I feel like you're beating me at some kind of traveling contest.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
I had waffles.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, Jeff is way better at traveling than you.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I never wanted to find that out, you know?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It's not why I invited him.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Invited me?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
That's right, sir.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
But now it all comes out.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah, that's right, I invited you.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I saw your e-vites and I said, yes.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
Can we bring out a professional from the Australian Entertainment District?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
A friend I made tonight.

09:22.000 --> 09:33.000
I want you to meet my friend, Josh Thomas.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay, I just want you to be happy.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
That ship has sailed, Josh.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
It's like, notice the bottle of vodka.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
All right, and this isn't...

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You've never been on the show, so you don't know.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
This is me.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
I know some not a performer.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
You know, tweeting.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm not tweeting.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I'm not, like, looking.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm like, who else could have known?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's Tracy Allman still.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
But I honestly, I mean, it's not making any bones about the fact that I don't...

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
I've not seen a single frame of your work.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
We just met.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I just met and I just liked him sitting next to him at a thing.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm going to worry about this.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
I think Luke's here and I don't want Luke to think that means I don't like him and anybody that...

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Well, you seem to have just said that.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I was sitting near as to you.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
I'm worried because I feel like we did the panel today and I had a nice time with you

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
and you had a nice time with me and then you thought, let's keep this going.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And I just don't know if it's going to happen again.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I feel like we're chasing the heroin.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I don't want to do that.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, no, let's resign ourselves to not liking each other.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
We'll just get there now.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I fucking hate you.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
We don't like the cut of each other's chips.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
We're strangers to each other.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
But we have strangers up on stage in the show all the time.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
We get to know them.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
You're an Australian.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Sorry for saying that I hate you.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I mean, it's okay.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Well, I like you.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And if you said you hated me as long as...

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
Hate me because I'm a genius.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then I'm like bulletproof.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
But if you hate me because I'm not talented, then I have to figure out a way to kill you.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
I have literally no feelings towards you.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
There's a lot more ways than just those two to hate you.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Like so many ways.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
There's all these accesses of hate that don't even cross talent or genius at all.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
You know, let's just, I mean, race for one.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
People hate people for race all the time.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
The fact that you think all seats should be filled with juicy balls.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Right. Hard cocks.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Do you think I should be hated for that, Josh Thomas?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I thought it was very progressive of me.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I also like juicy cock.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
If you want to make an advocate on it, you're going to have to break 51% of the population's ex.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Yeah.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
No.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Do you have to hate women to love games?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
So shall it be written?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
So shall it be done.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm making up these rules.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
That's not a rule.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Don't worry, everybody.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
All right.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
So I made that mistake.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I made that faux pas.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I was like, when my girlfriend says it, I take it seriously.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
She's a girl.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
She wouldn't lie.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
She was like, I actually, and I guess what I did as I ran it through my perception is like,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
I didn't have any moment since I landed on this continent.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I haven't met a prick.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I haven't met a passive aggressive person.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I haven't met anything that meets my definition of a bad person.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
And that especially includes, I haven't felt like I was in a pissing contest with any

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
men that I hadn't met.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And I just feel that way all the time.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
We will tell you that we're awful.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That's how we're like, hello.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm sorry for existing.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I'm a slug.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm disgusting.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
I smell bad.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I've wasted your time.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Please leave me alone.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
And Americans, they do the opposite to they tell you how good they are.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And it took me a long time in America to work out that I'm not meant to do that.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Because if you go to an American and you say, oh, I'm a slug, they're like, great.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Well, I've wasted my time talking to this slug.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Or they'll say, we love slugs.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Do we love slugs?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Love slugs.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
We have a hundred slug pile you could sit in and absorb the moisture in the room so

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
they don't feel better.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
They'll play it up.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
They're like, this is huge.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Will Ferrell did this and now look.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Anyway, just a warning.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
Josh, I learned from my friend Lee that's from here of a thing called the tall poppy syndrome.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Yeah.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Do you know about this, Dan?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
No.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Tall poppy gets cut, right?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Like.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Like.

13:54.000 --> 14:03.000
Spenser cutting to the chase.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
Like you are not supposed to be a taller poppy than the rest of the field.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Like if you are, you're going to get, people want to chop you down.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Like you don't want to stand out, right?

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Do you not like, to me, that feels so natural.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Does that, do you not feel that?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Like.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
I think what you said just before, like in the States, no, like you are rewarded for being

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
a tall poppy.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Lee, how did you word that?

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
You mean like the Quentin Crisp quote?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Oh, was it Quentin Crisp?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Well, we were talking about a couple things.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Yeah.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Hi, everyone.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
We're quoting.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Tell us the Quentin Crisp quote.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
It was the idea that this guy was left, left.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Here, I'm going to give you a mic.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Dreams coming true.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You're all here for this.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
Hey, buddy, it was the idea that Quentin, you have to correct me when I get this incredibly

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
wrong.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.000
Quentin Crisp was a socialite and an advocate and an openly gay man in a time when it was

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
not okay to be gay.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Gross.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Sad.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
My opinion.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's a hot tick.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Juicy cock though, so.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
He had that one.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
It is gross.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
It says gay sex is gross.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
It says one thing we could all agree on is that gay sex is disgusting.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Please continue.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Okay.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I'm so sorry.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
This is so weird, everybody.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Are you gay?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
I'm not.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Okay.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I could learn.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
It's so tight.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I could teach you.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Wouldn't he be a great guy?

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
He looks like a, like, if Errol Flynn was a hustler.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
He looks like a faggot.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That's what he looks like.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I found that, not only does he have the awesome Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
mustache, I found that today he's also really good at archery and he's, he can fence.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
So he is, he's a pirate.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
He's a, yeah, like, like, if Robin Hood pirate.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Let's don't use archery.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Lee.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Lee, just come up here.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Come on.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Lee London, everybody.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Welcome, Lee and my friend.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
I know I'm a guest here, but I would like to know why do you know this boy?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
I know, we used to date.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
I know his father, his music producer from London, but he lives in Los Angeles.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And when Lee comes out to visit, we've hung out.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Okay.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
It's not just you in a suit.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I'm in a suit.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
Well, let me tell you a thing, a sexual quote at once.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
You sir, I have a couple of questions about pocket squares.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I would like to ask you.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
No, no, what was the quote?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
I forget how that goes.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Okay.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
He said, he was being asked about why he, why he left England and went to New York.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
And he said, he said in, he said in England, people will hold you back in fear that when

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
you get to the top, you will have forgotten them.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
But in America, people will raise you up knowing you'll be there to lend them a hand when you

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
get there.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Wow.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
But here, the tall poppy thing is like, that's like, it's...

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Fuck that guy.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
He's shinier than me.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Isn't Milwaukee like that, Dan?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Didn't you see that?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Aren't the people, they don't want you to rise up in the same way?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah, I think, well, I think there's a, yeah.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
If you live in a town where most people make the most money lifting things with their physical

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
arms, and New York is one of those cities, even though there's so much...

17:55.000 --> 18:04.000
There's going to be more antipathy or disconnect between the idea of, it's like the idea that,

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
okay, well, as I've always said, if you live in Milwaukee and you don't believe that living

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
in warm weather will kill you, why are you living in Milwaukee?

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
You can't, your brain has to make certain justifications, and I'm not saying those are

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
false, because it is fucked up to live in Los Angeles.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
There's a million bad reasons to live there, but yeah, I don't know, there's a Harrison

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
Bergeron kind of like, yeah, like discouragement of exceptionality.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
The poppy thing we're talking about, that's a culture where it's like very wisely, fuck

18:41.000 --> 18:47.000
this person, who is this person that keeps obsessing about how good it can get, how close

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
to the sun they can get.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
They seem like trouble, let's get them out of here.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
That seems like a wise social policy, but one that would never profit me.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Do you not feel that way?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Do I not feel...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Well, yeah, look at that.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
He just told you to hate him because he's a genius.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
No, no, that's a voice I hear in my head all the time.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
It's like you're pretentious, what are you doing?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Get your head out of your ass.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
If you were going to have sex with a boy, right?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I'm listening.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It would go a little something.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Would you want him to have like a bigger dick than you or a smaller dick than you?

19:22.000 --> 19:30.000
Oh my God.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
We'll be right back.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
This show does deserve to be in an opera house.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
This isn't some fucking bullshit podcast.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
This is amazing.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's the first time I'm 43.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I've never answered that.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
Do I want to have the thing in my butt or do I want to...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
That's really up to you to decide.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Can I answer a question with a question, but I'll keep the ball in my court.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Balls.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I do want to know, like, is it...

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
It's politically incorrect to ask questions about who's pitching, who's catching.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Those are distinctions.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Is there different ways to be gay?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Is there different ways to be gay?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, there's different ways to be gay.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Is there...

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Can you be a gay person that hates anal sex?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
You can't be, right?

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
You can't love oral sex and hate anal sex and be a gay guy, right?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yeah.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Because I need to know before I answer my question.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Because I need to know my options.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Can be anything you want to be.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
You can, like, decide you don't want to do anal sex.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
You can decide you don't want to have dicks in it.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
I mean, the gay guy who doesn't want to do any anal sex is not going to be a very popular gay guy.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Like, good luck out there.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I don't have time for him.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I don't know about you, I don't have time for him.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
But there's definitely gays who don't put dicks in them.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
And there's gays who don't put their dicks in other boys.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Can you let people know, can you be gay, can you go like...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
This is called Grindr.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And that's what's so good about technology is now you get to discuss it.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
You can say, like, you're a top or a bottom, you know, right?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Are you a... what are you into?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Question mark.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Me?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
That's what you say in the app.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Is this... it's actually a bit weird to me that you don't know this,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
but of course you haven't been on Grindr.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
It's weird to me too, just to be clear.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Smaller dick, smaller dick.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I forget the world isn't...

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Smaller dick.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I figured it out, I've been thinking through it,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
and I asked them dumb questions that were...

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That made me think, like, what am I doing?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I don't mean because you're scared of, like, putting a big dick in you.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I mean, like, because it's, you know, obviously it's festive to have a bigger dick.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Like, that's like a fun...

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That's like...

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
You can hang decorations off of it.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
If we know... I wasn't asking you...

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
I wasn't asking about your pain thresholds.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I was saying, like...

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Well, I was considering that, I was.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Dude, like, if, like, in the spirit of, like,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
obviously presumably it's better to have a big dick,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
because it's so fun.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Dan, you and your gay lover are in the shower,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
you know, after some horseplay.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
And, uh...

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
After the horseplay?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Yeah.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
After the loving? After the loving?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Or the first thing in the morning, it doesn't matter, you're in the shower,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and you're soaping each other up.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Do you want to look over and go, oh, this guy's got a bigger dick than me?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Or do you want to go, look, I got big, my fucking dick is compared to this guy?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Yeah, are you like, oh, I've got such...

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Do you want to be, oh, I've got such a big dick, isn't that great?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Or do you want to be, oh, look how big a dick I found?

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
We're going to win a fucking Emmy or a Tony for this.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
This is amazing.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Uh, I think, well, before he brought up the shower,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I was just thinking like, okay, little dick, I'm overthinking it.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I was just like, little dick, because I have...

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
I want to cuddle with a smaller of, like, like, uh...

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
You want to be...

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I want to be, uh...

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
As heterosexual as you can be.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
That's what I...

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Can he have a vagina?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah, well, but isn't that...

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
You want to be Papa Bear, and by the way, you wouldn't be a bear.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
But then when he brought up the shower, which is like...

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
We were soaping each other up, but then the idea of the fray...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, look what a big dick my lover has.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I was like, oh, well, I mean, yeah, I haven't thought this through this enough.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I'm not overthinking it.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I should think really hard about this.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I should think...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
I should think about this for years.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Because there's a version of me that would be like,

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
oh, I should...

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
I'm like a baby man, and when you're gay,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
you don't have to be like, I'm a baby man.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
You could be like, I'm a baby man.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Like, I could be like a baby man,

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
and a smaller, smarter dude could just let me have it,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
and like, own me.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I definitely want to have it.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And he could have a huge dick.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And I'm like, I could soap it up and go like,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
this is gigantic, and I'd not be jealous of it.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
And that's a fun time.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Like, I own this dick.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Exactly.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I get it.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
It's like a...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
There's a...

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
We've been...

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
I've been making a mistake of thinking that the dial that...

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
where at the very top, the misogyny and gayness are like...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
I thought there was like an oven dial.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Like, but you could go backwards.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
You could just go click.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
I'm a person that's a narcissist.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
That reflects itself in misogyny if I'm straight.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
It could actually...

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The solution could be being gay.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Well, I definitely...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Like, you wouldn't have to disrespect somebody...

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The solution is to be gay.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
You're fucking it up.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Right.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Sorry, I guess I got excited too long-winded away.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I want them to have the smallest dick.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
I want a micro penis.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I want to be the one with the big dick.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
That's what I want.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I have a small dick.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
You want to have a taller poppy.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I just want to be...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, I would just be a lot happier if I...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Right.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Just that's what I...

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Is it a sense of like a self-esteem thing?

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Yes, it's a self-esteem thing.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Right.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
But you kind of...

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
You kind of high-roated me when I had the exact same answer as you.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
No, but you were just thinking about the mechanics.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
I wanted to know spiritually.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
You mean if I go through an entire spiritual journey,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
I'll come around to wanting the same things I do as a gross straight guy?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Like, as you're like, you know, do you...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
I think we finished.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Yeah, that was right.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Yeah, I should learn to take a...

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Read the room.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
They ended the bit.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
They're like, great, you did it.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
That's who's on first.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I mean, obviously...

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Obviously, I'd like to talk for another 45 minutes about...

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
What about testicles?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So, okay, so you're with a girl who really wants to have bigger tits.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Dan has talked about at length that he has enormous balls.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Me too.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
You've got very large balls.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Well, I just...

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I need to tell myself that for obvious reasons.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Sorry.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
There's a photo of Dan that his girlfriend took

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
where he's laying on his back.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
He's smiling.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
He's aware that it's happening,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
but she'd already gotten the camera out because he's wearing boxes

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
and just his balls are out.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
And they're just this incredible, like...

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Like, the color is like a...

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
Like a tropical sunset kind of pinkish orange.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
I don't know what's going on there.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
They're just fucking...

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
They're huge.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Is this podcast video or just audio?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It's odd.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
It's a shame that they're not going to hear the look in your eyes

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
as you talk about his balls.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
It's a shame they can't hear the glint you had.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Yeah.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
For the subscribers, we could probably put up like imagery.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It would be nice, I think.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I got lost.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
You got lost in my eyes when I was talking about Dan's balls.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Because this is going to be the best for some of our lives tonight.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
All right.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I think it's hilarious that your friend is still up here.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
I just want to point that out, but I don't want to believe.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I don't want to believe.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I think it's funny now.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
I think it's funny that he's up here.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm now just listening to the podcast.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Yeah, no.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
That's what happens.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
That's what happens.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
That's what I do.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Yeah.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
But I'm going to take a little...

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
Watch this genius turn into the dunes of the Australian dunes.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Spencer used to catch seagulls.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Yeah.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Spencer revealed to us that...

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
In confidence.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
No, that's a joke.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
It's true.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
It's true.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
It is true.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
I never said that to you.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
It's fine.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
I'm going to talk about it.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I just put it right in the thing.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
It's fine.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Actually, Cody told me, you're going to put them...

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Yeah, I'm going to put them...

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I missed the top of you explaining this.

27:33.000 --> 27:41.000
Spencer, we went to the aquarium today because I love fish and forgot I hate people.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
But Spencer, at some point, was talking to the group and I was just lost.

27:47.000 --> 27:54.000
By the time I came into the conversation, Spencer was explaining that during his wayward youth...

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Where were you?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Seamy Valley?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Where is this taking place?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
More part.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Well, we were at the beach.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
You would go to the beach in your youth.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
It's hard to imagine you at the beach.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Right.

28:07.000 --> 28:14.000
Can you explain this thing that you would do if you don't mind?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
All right.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You go to the beach.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
You lay down in the sand.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You can go to the beach.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
I didn't always have this beard.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Without a beard, it makes a lot more sense.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
If you go to the beach with that beard, people think you just washed up on shore.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
People think you're there to reclaim Greece.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
I got shipwrecked.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
You promised me a white bull.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Release the Kraken.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I forgot that's a hack reference.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I was just saying it mythically.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Release the Kraken.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I was going to own it.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
All right.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I'm at the beach.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
What you do is you bury...

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
You get someone to cover...

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Well, you could do it yourself.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
You cover your legs and stomach and most of your chest and sand such that you're buried beneath the sand.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Up to your neck.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, no.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
I said the parts you cover.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
The legs and the stomach.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Your upper chest, your head and your arms stay over the sand,

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
but you have a towel, a beach towel, covering the whole lot.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
So for all intents and purposes, it looks like someone put someone's head underneath a beach towel.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
It's like that scene in The Virgin where he's trying to convince everyone he's had sex with a woman.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
And he's like, you know, when you're having sex with a woman, he's never been to the beach.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And then she's coming.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
He hasn't been.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
You really think the lie he'd pick to tell would be...

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
I used to catch seagulls as a teenager.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Wait.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
This guy's got a band of teenagers out there.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Is your three quarters covered in sand?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Thank you.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yes.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
But you have a towel covering you that looks like...

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
It's the final quarter.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Someone just tucked you in like you're in bed with a towel over you.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Buried up to your waist.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Over my head.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Over your head.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And stomach.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
Again, you're de-clarifying the situation.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
Legs, feet, knees, dick, stomach.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Maybe right under my tits.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
You know, that's where it starts.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Okay.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
The rest of it...

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
But laying understand.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Under beach level.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
The rest of it is underneath the towel.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Okay.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Arms exposed underneath the towel.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Arms are under the towel.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
Jesus Christ.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
So look, see this?

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
You see this part?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Yeah.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
All of this that you see is under a towel.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Because beach towels are very large.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
They could cover this whole area.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
It's amazing.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
So, Google towel.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
With the beach towel over your face,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
you get someone like a brother or a friend

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
to put food out on the towel.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And scattered around, you know,

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
because it's very suspicious.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Especially to seagulls.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Because they've been hurt before.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Right.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Because I do it all the time.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
I did it all the time.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So, yeah, with the food in place,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
you just wait and then, you know,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
you hear them squawking and you hear them

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
flapping around.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Don't yell at me.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I have a question.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Okay.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
Is your head above the towel?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I'm not going to answer that because...

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
He's covered.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
He's trying to be in disguise from the seagulls.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
So, he's covered.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
So, nobody in the family is showing.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
So, he's got a towel over his head.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
I was just thinking maybe part of the fun

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
was that they don't regard a head as a threat.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
The fun is catching a seagull.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
It's not...

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
It's not gaslighting this.

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
The fun is watching a guy lost in his...

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
The fun is physically catching a seagull.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah, that's the whole point.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
Not mentally circumscribing it with semiotics.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
All right.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I think we all have the visual now.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
I don't think Dan has...

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Well, I don't.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
The truth is I don't.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
And there may be a problem with society where

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
at a certain point people like...

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Whoo!

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
All right.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Like this.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Where's the sand?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
The sand goes up to here.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Not my chest.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Do you see this is the chest?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Okay, but is the...

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I have questions.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I know you think I'm doing a bit,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
but I swear I have questions.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Can you imagine a towel fitting...

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
Now...

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
Okay.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Okay, so, and the rest of it is a mound?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
What sound?

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
The rest of it is a mound?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Is that below sand level?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Well, half and half.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You make a little shallow grave

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
and then you slip into it when you do this.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Right.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
If you were a seagull, you didn't know

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
there was a boy pretending to be at the beach.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, the whole point.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
That's all I'm doing.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Tricking them into thinking I'm not there.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
All right.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
I should get up.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
You get it, right?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Well, as long as you're down there,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
take us through the process.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
All right, so I'm laying here

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
and the seagulls...

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
And your brother or friend, as you said.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
Or friend, yes.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Has put chips around your head.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Uh-huh.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Okay.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Like, yeah, it's on my head.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Real quick, Josh,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I think I'd want the guy to have a bigger dick.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
All right, go ahead.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
To soap it, did you think about the shower

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
when you thought about it?

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Because I want to wash it.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I figured it out.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
It's all about the soap.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
It becomes like a Cadillac or a bicycle

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
or anything you treasure.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
A throwing knife, a new blender.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
It's like...

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I had this epiphany where I was like,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
wait, all right, all right.

33:55.000 --> 34:03.000
Come on, Spencer.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Hey, guys.

34:04.000 --> 34:11.000
All right, we don't take them for granted.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
That was so awesome.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
I'm not even going to bother to describe that to the listeners.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Yeah, $5 a month.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah, $5 a month to see the coolest exit of all time.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Probably a lot of theatrical people in the audience,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Spencer returned to his one.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
All right, so Spencer, now you are partially sandy,

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
you're partially tiled, you got bits of food,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
you got French fries and whatnot on top of you.

34:36.000 --> 34:41.000
And now we're hearing the seagulls coming in.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Because my eyes are covered.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
I don't see what's happening.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I have to rely on my ears and my sense of touch.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
But now your sense of hearing is heightened now

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
because you can't see.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Oh, of course.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I mean, without question.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That goes without saying.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So I'm doing that.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
It's a feeding frenzy.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
They're suspicious.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
However, will any sensory gift,

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
even the score between you and the most dangerous game of all,

35:05.000 --> 35:12.000
a confused, slightly domesticated, urban plight parasite?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
All right, they're real parasite.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
They're everywhere in California.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
It's terrible.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Anyway, so they're coming in.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
You feel them getting up on your chest and or body.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
And they got to get like right on your head area

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
just because that's the center of your bear trap action.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
So your arms are out, crucifix styles.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
You can close them like a bear trap.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Yes, I got you.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
Yes.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
So once, you know, and you got to wait

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
because they know it's something's up.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Because again, there's like a giant lump under a towel.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
They're stupid, but it looks weird and they know that.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
So, okay.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
So you're being patient.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
They're like, is this, is this how I die?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Or is this the first day of the rest of my life?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Right.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Those potato chips on a decorative mound.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Yeah.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Because usually a semi-circular pattern.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Yeah.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Around a beardy, beardy bulge.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
I didn't have a beard.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
And a bunch of other humans kind of in the middle distance,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
like giggling.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Yeah, because it's a big, like it draws a crowd, certainly.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
Yeah.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Especially after the first couple of times.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
People overselling a transparently perfunctural game of hacky sack

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
as they clearly are more invested in the towel.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.000
So, so they're getting up on my face and I'm waiting for my moment.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And then I, you know, I do what I did.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
I go.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
And then, you know, you use the towel as a crude net

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
and then you just try and grab as many as you can.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Is that the end or is that phase one?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
Yeah.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
That's phase one.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
And once you have 200, you can fly away.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
No, it's just for fun.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
I mean, do you, do you keep them as pets?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Do you let them go?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
You like that?

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
No, I snap their necks and toss them into the sea.

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
I believe that.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
No.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
So it's just for fun.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
I don't know.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I don't know.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
I couldn't tell you what my end game was

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
other than catching seagulls.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Does it, does it, does it, doesn't hurt them, does it?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
I hope not.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I mean, I never saw them maimed or anything.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Like they all flew away.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
You have to mention, you said two things that stick out about the story

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
is that you, you'd find that as you did this,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
people would root for you while you were doing it.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Right.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
But then once you were successful.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Once I had a seagull in my grasp,

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
it became this whole big animal rights issue.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
And then you said you stopped after the experience you had.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
So, so one of the times,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
I've probably caught about five seagulls this way.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
It takes a lot of tries.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
They were calling you old, old,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
old wispy arms.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Goal, goal reaver.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
They called you goal reaver.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Goal reaver.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
All right.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
I like that.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Did you invent, like, is this something you,

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
did you invent this or did the guy that invented it?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Did he?

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
I think he got the idea from a Metallica album.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
I'm certain I didn't invent it.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
There's no way.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Was this, if it was like a bigger brother,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
this seems like the kind of thing where it's like,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
I'm going to tell my little brother,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I'm going to fucking bury him in a beach

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
and get a crowd around.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Was there like a hat?

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Was he collecting money?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
No.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
To like, you know what I mean?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Were you busking by accident?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I wish.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
No, I could have made a lot.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Because I mean, the crowds cannot be understated.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
It was hard to hear.

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
There's no, there is no overstating the throngs of people.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
It was hard to hear the seagulls.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Among their hoots and hollers.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Stop being worried about the seagulls.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
People on the beach just cry.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
They're like, like, like, like Thunderdome.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
People are like, like, climbing up on things and like.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I thought you were going to say early,

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
I thought you were saying, there is no business,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
like seagull catching business.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Anyways, all right.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
So, all right.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
But this leads somewhere.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
This is the Michael Crichton twist.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Again, I've only probably caught five.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
It's not easy to do.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Season the gold catcher, though.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Yeah.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
So one time I got one and, yeah, I caught it

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and he was flapping around, you know,

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
and I, like, got him by his body so he couldn't flap away.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And he's starting to, like, attack at me.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
He's biting at me and he tries to peck.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
He tries to peck my eye out.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
He goes, what, bam, with his beak right at my eye.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
And at the last second, the last fifth is a second I'll say,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
very short period of time, like it was very close.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
It opens its beak and I can see down its throat.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
And I got scars, little tiny scars up here

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
and then down here above and below my eye

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
to prove that this was a dangerous beak

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
that could peck an eye out, but didn't.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
And I swear to God, it was just because of, like,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
Jesus or something that I didn't have my eye pecked out that day.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Or the devil, because if I had an eye patch and a beard,

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
holy shit, look out.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
If you had an eye patch, if you had an eye patch,

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
you and Lee could really make, this would be a great pirate movie.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
Archery, doing so much archery.

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
Do you prefer the seagulls have a bigger or smaller beak than you?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
Definitely real big.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I like that in Spencer's universe,

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
it's possible the devil was responsible

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
because it left him without an eye patch.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Right.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
And the devil in your universe is just...

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
He wants me to look less ridiculous.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
He's just bad at marketing, right?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
The devil is like, he's chaos.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
He doesn't package things right.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
But so he's biting and pecking around.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I mean, the story kind of trails off here.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
So I stuff my finger in his mouth so he can't bite or peck.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
And at that point, kids were coming up and wanted to pet him

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
and people were getting mad and say, you shouldn't do that.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
And then eventually, I just let it go

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
because it's like, you know, seagull doesn't want to be there.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I don't know what to do with it.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
Oh, you know, my parents told me that their family members did it.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
That's how I got the idea,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
because one of them would tie a string around their foot

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
and kind of fly it around for a while.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
That's what... But I never did that.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
What kind of weird handbilly...

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Yeah, that's what I said.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
But I never did that.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Yeah, no, I'm normal.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
I'm not some weirdo.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
But yeah, and so people were petting it and then I let it go.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
It was great.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
But after that, it was just...

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
I mean, it was very scary.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
I was almost pecked out.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Like, it should have been pecked out by all accounts

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
because it was trying to bite and peck at me.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
You're gonna have a hard time tying this into, like, a sub-story for you.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
My aunt was almost...

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
No, I mean, I don't want pity.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I would love respect.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Um, he doesn't want...

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
He doesn't want our seagulls to pity him.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
He wants them to fear him, right?

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
Hey, Jeff, what if there was a beer commercial

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
that Sam Elliott was doing a voiceover for?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
A beer commercial?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
And it involved...

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Well, I didn't want to pimp you and say,

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
can Sam Elliott sell seagull catching,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
but I like your Sam Elliott impression.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Let's see, what would...

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
But it could be like a beer that's...

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
that they're using seagull catching the way that a beer...

42:38.000 --> 42:45.000
Hello, I'm Sam Elliott for the 2017 seagull catching competition.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
This year, it's an Australian Bondi beach,

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
but they don't have seagulls here, right?

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
But fuck seagulls.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
We're going to kill a bunch of those greasy-ass ibises.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Fuck ibises.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Those things are gross.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I mean, I saw one in the park,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
what's the Hyde Park, right?

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
And there's a crazy-ass, like, awesome, exotic bird,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and then they just, like, they were just...

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
They're just, like, raccoons, they're just in the trash,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
and they're all covered in shit, and they're just...

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
They sound like somebody punched a baby.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Can you tell me who Sam Elliott is?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Do you ever see...

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Okay.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Do you ever see Big Lebowski?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
Oh, friends here.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Did you see Big Lebowski, Josh?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Yeah.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
No.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Did you see Mask with Cher?

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
Well, I think probably if you keep listing things that he's in,

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
then I'm going to keep saying no.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Well, obviously, it's still now.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
No, he's a character actor who has a big mustache.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Okay, yeah.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Is it good impression, I guess?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Nah.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
I've done better.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
I was struggling with the material.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
That was a curveball.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I didn't set him up to succeed.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I trust him, though.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I mean, it was...

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Sam Elliott.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
Josh, there's one line from a movie called Frogs.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It's a terrible movie with him and Ray Maland.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
Yeah.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
And on the poster of the movie Frogs,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
there's a frog the size of a Volkswagen Beetle

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
with a human arm hanging out of its mouth.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Okay.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
And that doesn't happen in the movie.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
There's never giant frogs.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
In fact, most of the frogs aren't even in the movie

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
because when they shot this movie,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
they had a bunch of frogs brought in on the set.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
They let him out.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
And guess what?

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
The frog's just fucked off into the night.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
And so while they're shooting the movie,

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
guess what?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
They're two things.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
They don't have frogs.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Yeah.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But you could hear a million frogs.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
So they had audio issues and third act problems.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Well, as long as you have Sam Elliott,

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
you can get through that.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
But Sam Elliott doesn't have a mustache in this one.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And you kind of see why he always has the mustache.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
He's got kind of a weird lip that hangs down real far like that.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
You never saw Tombstone with Kurt Russell?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
So I don't know if I can repeat this again.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Anything you mentioned with Sam Elliott in it,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
I haven't seen.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
OK, I'm going to do what I say is a fairly OK impression

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
of Sam Elliott doing one line from the movie Frogs,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Sam Elliott and Rainbow Land.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I don't think we're going to see any of them again.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Not live, anyway.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
And, awesomely, if you can find it,

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
because Rob Schrab has the VHS of it,

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
the trailer is the worst syntax like set in structure.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
It goes, Frogs is coming.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
And there's a big-ass frog in the poster.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
You never see.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Well, it's hard because if it's Frogs,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
if it's the animal, ah, coming.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
But if it's Frogs, the name of the movie, then it is coming.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah, Frogs is coming to a theater to you,

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
but it doesn't work.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Yeah, it doesn't.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
Birds is coming.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
They thought it was going to be the birds of amphibians.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Spencer, what would your tactic be to catch a wild frog?

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Oh, no.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
You just...

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
You go out in the rain.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
They always come out in the rain.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
But they're easy to catch.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
So...

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I dated a girl very briefly who was Italian

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
and her family was supposedly in the mob

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
and she had, for real, an Uncle Vinny, Uncle Vince.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
And he was a real lunatic.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
And he was a property manager in an apartment building.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
He slept with a.357 under his pillow, loaded.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
And when he would see pigeons in his backyard

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
at the apartment complex,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
he would catch them in a pillowcase,

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
tie the pillowcase in a knot, and throw it in the pool.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Oh.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
All right.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Well, let's just...

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
He's jealous.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Why didn't I think of that?

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
All right.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
So, getting back to Australian politics...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Josh, before I...

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
I only have so much more time where I care about this stuff.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
I have Australian questions that I couldn't Google.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Is there a president?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
There is, right?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
And there's none.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Okay.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
But there's a prime minister...

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
That's a prime minister.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
But then there's something else.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
The states have premiers.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Oh, but the Queen is just the Queen of England, right?

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Yeah.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Okay.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
But...

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Okay.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I think he was asking me.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Okay?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I've got a cupboard.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
I've got a cupboard.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
The prime minister who is, like, the head of the country.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
And then there's the governor general,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
but he doesn't do all she, I guess.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
He doesn't do nothing.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
So that guy wants me to do nothing.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
So, prime ministers...

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Well, those other people are, like, they're federal.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
They're Australia-wide.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
What?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Their office is...

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
The government?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Yeah, it's Australia-wide.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
I mean, that's not...

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
These offices aren't state-level.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
They're...

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
They're the same.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
You guys have, like, your electoral states,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and then there's people.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
It's the same.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Don't worry about it.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
All right, don't worry about it.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
We have, like...

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
We have Donald Trump, but she's a woman.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Pauline Hansen?

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
And she's not as popular.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
But she's so pretty popular.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Yeah, but I can get through every show

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
by shitting on her for half an hour.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Yeah, fuck Pauline Hansen.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Yeah, I learned...

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I learned to grip that hang glider

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
first night in Brisbane, man.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I was like...

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Well, they love her in Brisbane.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Well, that's not saying anything bad about Pauline Hansen

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
in Brisbane.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Not my fans, no.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Well, they're laughing very nervously.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
They're all taking you home.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
They were stuck.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Oh, shit.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
I'm from Brisbane, and I'm not going to argue with you.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah, I don't like her, but Brisbane likes her.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
We're not going to pretend like Brisbane's not racist.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
I'm not going to sit here like,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
you're a person, I'm a person.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
We're looking at each other's eyes,

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
all I can see is black,

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
but you can see my eyes.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
We're going to lie to each other.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Brisbane is racist.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Look at that.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
It definitely is.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Yeah.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
We're not...

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Hello.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I mean, the world...

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
I lived there.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
I lived there.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
I left, because they're so racist.

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
You left, you're here.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
They don't...

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Oh, shit.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Oh, fuck.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
See?

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
See, they hate others.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
They can't be tolerance.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
We were in Brisbane,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
and there wasn't a single problem.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
When we landed on Ipswich,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
everyone was like, they were stoked about shooting on Ipswich.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I'd love to do a show on Ipswich before we leave here

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
just to verify that this is all a cycle of bullshit.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Because, like, we filled a theater there.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
It was fucking weird and rowdy.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Did you actually do a gig in Ipswich?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Yeah.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
And they were smart and great.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
No, no, Brisbane, we did.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Brisbane.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
No, no, no.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm sorry.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
I was too busy answering the question

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
before you finished asking it.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
I'm like, yeah.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Yeah.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
No, we didn't do a show on Ipswich.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Fuck those fucking stump-humping rednecks.

50:16.000 --> 50:21.000
I'll do anything to regain control.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
What is wrong with you?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
I know.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
When they talk, you just say yes, ma'am, and continue

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
arguing with them.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Is this what you do in your gay TV show?

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
I can't believe it's legal.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Wait, is gay marriage legal here?

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Oh, yeah.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
What is this?

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah, I didn't think so.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
No, it's not at all.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
You can get arrested just for getting married?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
They're getting married.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
You just can't get married.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
It's just off the table.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
You're not in prison.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
There's not these prisons filled with gay men who

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
try to get married who would then actually...

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Well, this is the best life I've ever had

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
stuck in prison.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
It's not Singapore.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I never asked that question before.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
All this conversation about gay marriage in America

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
was never like, well, they're not going to arrest people

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
if they get married, right?

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
But no, yeah, you're just taking a license from them.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
No, they just can't.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
They just won't.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
You just feel like, I'm going to get married.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
They'd be like, no.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
No, go and get married.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
You can't have like...

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
That's a shame because that's how weddings became romantic.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Before, they were arranged, and then it became romantic,

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
the idea that you'd slip off into the woods with a priest

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
who would say, you two, in this forest clearing

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
among your friends, like you're...

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
This is official.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
It's, you know, that's...

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Marriage became like a sacred thing that was about two people

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
like being into each other.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
And it's funny.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
It's funny.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
What?

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
What happened?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
It's funny.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
What happens with the priest?

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
You know, like Robin Hood times, like, come on.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Okay.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
He thinks you meant you go and fuck the priest in the woods.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Is that...

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh, no, no.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
That's what I had.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Yeah.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
In my head, you won't think it by a priest.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
You won't want to think that.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Yeah.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
It's like, the idea that the ceremony is romantic,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
that it's an expression of true love,

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
that it has something other...

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
It has something to do with anything other than, like...

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
The government.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Government.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
It's like, it's kind of ironic, isn't it?

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Because it truly is a government...

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Now you want the contract for something.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
I don't know.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
I don't...

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Well, because it's about health benefits now.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
It's about being treated...

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
It's not my fault.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I just got swept up in the gay marriage thing.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
There's nothing I can do about it here.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
I am in the center of it.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
They won't let me get married.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
I have to feel passionate about it.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
I don't really care.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
I don't want to get married.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I've got a boyfriend that's terrified of commitments.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
So I'm like, I vote for that.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Luck for that party.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
It'll keep me...

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
But personally, that's not something you'd ever do.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
It's not really...

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Why do I want to get married?

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
You're going to get married?

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Your girlfriend's here.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
I got married.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
And then I...

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
You got divorced.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
I don't think...

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
And now I'm in love.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Like, I...

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
It's...

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
I...

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
It...

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
It...

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
I think you reacted wrong.

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
I'm not going to...

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
I understand I can connect those dots, but you're making candor difficult.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
And that makes you the bad people.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I'm going to stick with that.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
It doesn't seem very romantic to me to sign a contract that says I'm going to love you forever.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
That just seems a bit fucked.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
So can you agree of my observation of the irony drunk as I am?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
But it's like, that's the thing.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Like, it's not romantic.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
The exact issues that make it a political issue.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
I'm going to love you forever.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
Decide that morning.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Don't decide 10 years ago.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
No?

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
I hate the idea of waking up next to someone and they've signed some...

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Yeah.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
If it becomes a legal document, then it's just a legal document.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
Until I have to go to the rallies and...

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I think we're on the same page, I think.

53:40.000 --> 53:45.000
Because we're equal and we're equal to you and that's important.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Leah, are you going to get married?

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Are you a married type?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
He's talking me out of it.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
What?

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
I'm not going to marry you.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
She's freaking out.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Is that your girlfriend?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
It is.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Very careful that you have to...

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Oh, shit.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Maybe you should propose right now.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
What a beautiful opportunity.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Pull the trigger, Lee.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Pull the goddamn trigger.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
The tech team is not playing songbird.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
You can get down on your knee and make her so happy.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Why don't you want to make her happy?

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Ally and Lee...

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Make her happy.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Have you guys ever discussed it?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
You guys talk about it or is it something that you guys never talk about?

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I feel like I'm being bullied.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
That's all I can say.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
You know, being bullied, the woman that you love is sitting in front of a thousand people

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
saying, why won't you keep me forever?

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
And you're saying, because you're a witch.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That's what I saw.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Is that what you saw?

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
Oh, well, I'm looking at my coach.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
What a beautiful opportunity to make a lovely moment.

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
Who's with me?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I'm so sorry.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
So there's no press.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
I didn't even know if I meant to acknowledge you.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
Did you know that what I learned today is that penguins propose,

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
they propose to each other.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
The male brings the smoothest rock he can find up to the female penguin.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
We didn't learn this together.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
No, I'm telling you...

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Oh, I think I got away with that.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
We went to the aquarium.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
What do you mean they propose to each other?

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
That's what it said on the sign outside the penguin cage

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
at what Jeff calls the fish prison.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
How do they propose?

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
The quays are fucking fish jails.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I'm not going to fucking fish jail.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
It says, they get to swim in the fucking biggest part of our planet

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
and we go, ah, fuck it, get in the box.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
So we can look at you like perverse fucking cynical douchebag.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Yeah, a lot of those tanks are pretty small.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
There are some that are pretty big sized,

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
but a lot of them were small.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
Yeah, and we know how much you hate it when people hood animals.

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
Again, I never hurt them.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Well, other than like, you know...

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
You certainly provoke them into attacking your eyeballs.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
If you're going to put them in such a small box,

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
why not rustle them up a bit so we can get some excitement?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Yes, right.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
Spencer Zoo would just be people half buried with towels.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
We didn't have this...

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I thought we'd have the laptop again tonight

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
that I could show a video that I took at the aquarium

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
because it was the strangest thing...

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
One of the big tanks, the big giant wall tanks,

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
a bunch of fish floating in it, and there's like staircases.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
And then there was this upper middle-aged guy.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
I'm going to put him at, like, let's say 60 to 65.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
He's a tourist from some Asian country.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I'm being racist by saying that. He was Asian.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
He had a baseball cap on, a windbreaker.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Like, kind of seemed middle-class, 65-year-old guy.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
And his equally aged wife, like, approached the thing.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
And then they exchanged words that were in their native language.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
It was too dark. I don't...

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
I'm not going to speculate what of the thousand Asian countries

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
they were from. I just keep calling them Asian.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I also don't see the world through that lens,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
so I don't know what...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
But to me, it is important...

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
There was a certain kind of, like, thing happening here.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
So it is important.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Their cheekbones were just so narrative.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
You say there was 65, but how do you know?

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
They exchanged words, and they had, like, shopping bags.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
They're very touristy, and we're in front of this, like...

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
What? What is the problem there?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
What is that? Is that... Did I...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We just toast... Is it because we toasted our drinks?

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Oh, God. I thought I was stumbling into the realization

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
that there was an Asian stereotype about shopping bags.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
And I got mad at them, even though I projected that.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I was like, fuck you people!

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And then I was like, no, you thought...

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
That's the first thought you had, racist.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Okay. They were reacting to something other than me,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
and my race, which will one day rule the Earth!

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
One day.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Yeah, one day.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
But the...

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
They were...

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
She exchanged words with him,

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
and then, like, he went up to the giant fish tank,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
and she hung behind with her camera,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
and he raised his hands like this, like, facing her.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Like, he's, like, gesturing, like, the fisher behind him.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
And then she's... The whole time they're speaking a language,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I don't speak when she's, like, going up to him,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and she says more stuff to him.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
And then he turns around, and he holds his arms up,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
and he says the other thing, and she kept...

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
And it went on for a full five minutes,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
and, like, my girlfriend and I started watching it,

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
and we didn't exchange a word, we didn't even really look at each other,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
because it was like, we were just watching them,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
and then we started to get in the moment

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
of them being so out of the moment that they were in the moment,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
because she had so many opinions

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
about how you're supposed to hold your arms

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
when you pose in front of a wall of fish,

58:41.000 --> 58:46.000
and there was no toxicity between them that we could tell.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I mean, we don't know.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
There could be the least healthy relationship in all of Earth,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
or it could be the most healthy.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
There was no way of telling. We were just watching two people,

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
and they were, like, connected by some weird,

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
perpetually dissatisfied telepathy,

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
because they were like...

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
He never thought it was weird that she just kept making them,

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
she kept adjusting them, and I took a video of it,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
because they play, like, John Williams' music

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
when you're going through the aquarium,

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
because they want to let you know fish are majestic,

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
because otherwise, they're in a tank, it's depressing,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
so they play a lot of music that's, like, sweeping strings,

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
and, like, Shawshank Redemption, but after he gets out...

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
And it's like sweeping music playing over these speakers,

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
and we spent five minutes watching this couple

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
that had merged into some, like, weird two-fish school together,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
like, doing this weird thing that was, like...

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
And then we were, like, holding each other,

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
because it was so weirdly adorable and frightening, like...

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
And then I took out my video camera,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
and I still got, like, this perfect, like...

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
There was this orchestral score going, and she...

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
And then you finally realize she hasn't taken a single picture.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
She's been, like, adjusting his arms,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
and he's never asked any questions,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and he's just waiting patiently, like, he's not stoked,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
but he's not ever getting mad.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
He's just, like, she wants this picture,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
and she's just, like, kept adjusting him,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and then she took one fucking picture.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
There was, like, seven minutes went by,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
and I think she only ever took one picture.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And then they gathered their stuff and walked away,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and I kind of wept a little bit and held my girlfriend.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I don't know what the point of my story was.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It was... I wanted to show the video, so you got...

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
My boyfriend takes pictures of me.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
He adjusts you?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Tell me to adjust my face,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
and then after a while, it's like,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
oh, you just don't like my face?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yeah, why don't you show me a picture of the guy

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
you wish you were with, and I'll take it to the stylist?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But, brother, I know.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
How long have you been together with the boyfriend?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Five years.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Five fucking years.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah, okay.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Why are you so surprised?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
They said it wouldn't last.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Because they're both Josh's.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
His name is Josh.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
What?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
His name is Josh.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It used to be Josh.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I got him to change it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I thought they went,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
aw, because it was like a brief realization of, like,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
oh, as if we didn't already have a long list

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
of how cute it would be to be gay.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
You could both be Josh's.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
You can't do that in a lesbian couple.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
No, lesbian couple, you can.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You can't both be Josh's.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
No, we can't both be Josh's.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
That's not as good to you.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Both be Matilda's or both be...

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It was a simple observation.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Only in a gay male couple can you have two Josh's.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
We don't notice the simple things.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Does the other Josh have a micro penis?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
He has a great...

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Did you hear him behind the curtain?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Get him out here.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Other Josh, I think we need to exploit you.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Can you come stand down?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
He has a nice penis.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
He has a good...

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It's all right.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Other Josh, show the crowd your penis

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and let's just move on.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
He has a nice penis.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
He has a nice penis.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
He has a nice penis.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Show the crowd your penis and let's just move on.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Can we just move on from this?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
No, don't.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Sorry, don't.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
OK.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
All of a sudden, I look controlling.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
All of a sudden, I look like I'm controlling.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
That's my penis.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000
That's to me and you and any other cute boy we find.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Any other...

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
OK, next in my Ask an Australian segment.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Yeah.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Australian woman.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Stay away from me.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
OK.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
We did a show last night.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
No women came on stage.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
We have to have at least a woman on stage.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I want...

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Josh, you're coming in close second to that.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
No, I'm not a woman.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
No.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
No, it's not the same.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Speaking of Quentin Crisp,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
you could play a young Quentin Crisp

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
if there were ever a play of Quentin Crisp.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I don't know what Quentin Crisp is either,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
but I don't know much.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
He's a fantastic writer.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
He's got loads of great quotes.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Well, you guys brought up that there's no women.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Can we trade your friend, Jeff?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I brought a celebrity.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Someone more important.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Let's hear it for Lelani, everybody.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
APPLAUSE

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Lelani.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
This guy's got four seasons

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
of Australian television.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm not a big mustache guy,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
but that guy's mustache is good.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I did like...

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I wanted to expound more on the idea

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
of the Robin Hood but done

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
as a 70s movie.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
He does like Errol Flynn, but like...

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But he's dressed like Al Pacino

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
in Scarface.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Like a cocaine-driven Robin Hood thing.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Like, you know how men of respect

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
was like Macbeth, but gangsters

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
doing like a Robin Hood thing

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
in the 70s. That'd be cool.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Why don't you write that movie?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Do you love him?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You just seem a bit...

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Do you love him?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
We're friends.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
OK.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I mean, I love him in a friendly way.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I just feel like you spent a lot of time

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
complimenting him.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I'm very...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
He's got a girlfriend.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And they're almost engaged.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
LAUGHTER

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
APPLAUSE

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
When they get married, I'm going to be their priest

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
but I'm going to do the old-fashioned way

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
where they have to fuck me in the forest.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
LAUGHTER

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
You guys didn't get that at all.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
LAUGHTER

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Nobody gets me.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I thought I could come down here.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I feel them really understand

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
what happened to you in the progress.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
LAUGHTER

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Because I know we're joking

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
about the priests and that.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I know that, but I don't know

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
what really happened.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
No, it wasn't a story from my life.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm not one of these

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
new millennial showrunners that...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Like, I'm not...

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I was talking about history.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I own the planet.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
My beard was stretching across time.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I wasn't just, like, this thing happened

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
when I was six.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I was, like, I was fucking explaining shit

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
to the planet about itself.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But that time has passed.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I wanted to ask you about Australia.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Do you guys have fortune cookies?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yes.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Are they fortunes or are they advice?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
LAUGHTER

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
You know fortune cookies aren't Chinese, right?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
You know that you invented them.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Yeah, they were made in, like, California, right?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Okay. Yeah.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
That's fine.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Do you know my favorite fortune cookie story?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
But I don't know. Is this what we're doing?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
No, I don't know your fortune cookie story.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
What?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I've never heard a...

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
A little more angry question.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Are you checking Wikipedia?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
This is the most presumptuous question I've ever heard,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
and I'm Dan Harmon.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I've never heard your fortune cookie story.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I met you a half hour ago.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I'd love to hear it.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And how dare you?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Apparently, you don't read The Daily Sun.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
LAUGHTER

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I'd love to hear your fortune cookie story.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's not a great story, but it's...

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Oh, well, I'll take ten.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It's my favorite fortune cookie story.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
So if we had to pick a subject to the subject,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
it was fortune cookie.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Then this is the story I would tell you.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
But we are...

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
restricted by the subject matter.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I just don't even remember that going forward.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Well, I can...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
In America,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
there was like a lotto, right?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And, like, 15 people run Second Division,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and they were like, what went on?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
They're looking at this big investigation.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And what happened was some fortune cookie company

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
just always printed the same lucky numbers.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Oh.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And then everyone wrote them on their lotto form,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
and, like, 12 people won the lotto.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Oh, my God.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
But it's just because one company was printing them.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Is that good?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Wait, and the...

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
It's pretty interesting.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Was there a court case about it?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Because they were like...

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
The lotto went off.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There's, like,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
second place is $2 million.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
All these people won,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
and they were like, well, all these people have cheated.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So there's this big, like, investigation.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And it turns out every person had just written

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
their number off the fortune cookie company

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
because, like, the Chicago Fortune Cookie Company

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
just printed the same numbers

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
because they're so lazy, you know?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I thought you were saying all those people sued

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
the lottery or the fortune cookie company.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
No, they all won.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yeah, well, they all won,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
but they had to split the pie 12 ways.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I don't know that price.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Oh, really? That's a great story.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I don't know.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I mean, it's a great story anyway.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's a fine story.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's a funner ending

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
if they all get a million dollars.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I'm so sorry.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I didn't ask to be here.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Fate and fortune...

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Fate and fortune rewarded people

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
who have so little imagination

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
they picked their numbers off of a fucking fortune cookie.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Okay, guys, can you figure out with me,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
can we be less combative and masculine

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
and figure out how to bring a woman up here?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So that we can stoff our cap

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
to the fairer sex

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
and thereby achieve equality?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
How do you pick a woman?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
That's what I'm asking you.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
That's sort of what you do.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I don't recommend we do it by...

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Why don't we let Josh roam the crowd

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and use your...

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I pick my favorite woman?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Use your, like, defining rod

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
to go out there and, like, find...

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Do we have lights that come up?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Oh, my God.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Do I have to pick my favorite woman?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
You seem a bit desperate.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
You look forward.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
What do you think? Should I take the girl

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
that wants to come up?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I sort of want the girl that's been so rejected.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
We had a guy that wanted to come up yesterday

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and that, you know, argument could be made

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
that doesn't pan out.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It's kind of like...

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I don't know. It's like styrofoam peanuts.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It's like, yeah, you want to be on stage, now you're on stage.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Oh, I want to talk about wanting to be on stage.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That's what we did for the last hour.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
That sounds all right.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
That's fine.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
There might be somebody whose hair is smoldering

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and you're like, do you want to come up on stage?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
They're like, I'm not sure.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And if their hair is smoldering, you go, what happened?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
What criteria do you usually use

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
to pick women?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I...

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The size of their dicks.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I've never been good at it.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I...

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Whoever...

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I just go with whoever can be lured

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
by potato chip crumbs arranged in a blanket.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I...

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Low-hanging fruits.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
What I usually do is I'll say something gimmicky,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
like, oh, who's been in a lot of pain tonight

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and someone's handle shoot up and stuff.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But when we go out of Los Angeles,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
what happens is people are here and they're excited.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'll go, who's in pain and someone's handle shoot up

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and go, okay, you.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I'll come up and they'll go, I'm in pain

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
because I stubbed my toe, but I really wanted to be on stage.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And so it's like, why not just say,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
who wants to be on stage, but then the answer is,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
hi, my name's John, I want to be on stage.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Can you help?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I spent this time deciding who I want,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
but I don't want her to feel uncomfortable

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
if she doesn't want to come up.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Is the reason you're bringing her up?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I want the usher, ladies, sitting up there.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
That's who I want.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Of course.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Would you please come up?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I don't want her to.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
That's a wonderful quote.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I want to know, like, the first thing I want...

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Welcome.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I'm sorry, that's just what I wanted.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Pam?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Prepare a place for her.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Pam, the first thing I want to know from you

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
is, like, because you're obliged to be here.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Do you...

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Do you like it?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Do I like working here?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Just this show, in general, or are you, like, stuck?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I had no idea what this show was about,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
but it's perfect.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Have a seat if you could, Pam.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Thank you so much for coming up here.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
We promise in advance that you will not...

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Do you want a drink?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Not allowed.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
You're actually working, so you can't have a drink.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
No.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
You don't want a drink, Pam? Sorry, I didn't mean it.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
No, she's working.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I mean, do you...

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Would you want... If you weren't working, would you want one?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Are you epistemious?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Oh, no, I would want one.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Pam, I don't want a fucking drink.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Are you kidding?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
You put a drink in front of Pam on a Sunday night.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It will be gone.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I don't want to be presumptuous,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
and I don't know what the rules,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
you know, holding your vocation

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
accountable are, but if I order you

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
to have a drink on stage, doesn't that...

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Don't do that.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
If your prime directive is to protect

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
the show, for instance,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
then you have to have a drink.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Well, I need to be protected

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
from the theater manager as well,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
but he's not in here, and he probably can't...

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Here.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Did she say,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I won't tell him?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Pam, Pam...

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
We're gonna get a woman fired tonight.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Pam, you're aware, Pam,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
like, you know, like, captains

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
can marry people at sea.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Like, Dan, as the mayor of Harmontown,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
actually has, this is like a sovereign little nation

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
up here, and there's no jurisdiction

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
that your boss can really affect.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Dan, she doesn't want a glass of vodka.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
No.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Is that what that is? Did you want a glass of vodka?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
No.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Is it a wine or a beer?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Pam's not a fucking pig.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
This is a beautiful woman.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
This is a beautiful woman of God.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Who's on duty.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Offer her something nice.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
A glass of vodka.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
She's not Charles Bukowski.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
She was a cocktail.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I think that's sexist.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Pam, where are you from?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Originally, I'm from Adelaide,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
but I've been in Sydney for longer

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
than I've been in Adelaide.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
You like it?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I love Sydney, yeah.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Better than Adelaide.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
What brought you here to begin with?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
My husband got into acting school,

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
so I followed him over here.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Oh, she's got a husband. Disappointing.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Disappointing.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Sorry, guys.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
What's your job title here, Pam?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Here, I'm a front-of-house worker.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
An usher.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But we call the department front-of-house.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
How long have you been working here?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
18 years.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Did you work when I did my show here?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I haven't seen you do your show here.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
We don't get to see everything.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Last time I was in this theater,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
my dog was here and he did a shit on the stage.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Oh, no.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
In fact, I didn't even hear talk about it afterwards.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
He's very rock and roll, that guy.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
He's the GGL of dogs.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Forgive my ignorance,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
but is it a government job

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
or is it private?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Do you get your paycheck

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
or you might be volunteer for all?

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It's not volunteer.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I know that was a long charge.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Pam charges top dollar.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I know in America, ushers don't get paid.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I wouldn't be surprised if...

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I mean, in the theater,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
it's probably like an intern...

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Most of us like ushering

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
because we're involved somehow

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
rather than in theater.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
We just love theater and we love the versatility

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
of the opera house.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This show.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Yeah, how does that work?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
I could have saw

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
the Australian Ballet tonight,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
but I got a podcast.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
They just draw straws

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
in the lobby at the beginning of the night.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
OK, Pam,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
you're with Herman Toonan?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Actually,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
don't laugh because the other usher

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
and I were saying exactly that.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
It's premium lying,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
so if you get fired for that...

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
We had no idea what this was about tonight

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and we just said,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
OK, we'll keep an open mind about it

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
and here we are and we're both laughing.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
That's very nice.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
CHEERING

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That's all he ever asked

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
an open mind.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It's so great to be here, Pam,

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
for your last night working at the opera house.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Right.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It's a special occasion.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Oh, shit, I have to host the show.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
What did you think about him

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
and the seatbelt?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I thought it was

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
pretty good performing, actually.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I thought so too, but I thought it would be weird to say that.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Pam, is there anything

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
special about Australian butter?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Where did you get that question from?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
My girlfriend's mom,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
who...

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I'm happy if you prove she's nuts tonight.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
She bakes a lot.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Cody said she was in Australia

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
and her mom texted back,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
you've got to try the butter.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Yes.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Americans have bad dairy.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
OK.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
You don't know it because you grew up with it.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Your milk sucks, your butter sucks,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
your cream is not cream.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
It's...

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I don't know what it is.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Cream doesn't come in

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
uncooled plastic tubs.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Cream comes from the fridge

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and it's delicious.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You don't drink cream as a beverage, do you?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
No, you don't drink cream as a beverage.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Well, I do.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
No one in the world does.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Your country thinks that's cream and it's not right.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Wait, are you saying...

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
That's creamer, that's different.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I don't want to start a fight, but you've got fucked dairy.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
It wouldn't start a fight.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Would you also...

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
What did you think about the dairy?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I can't remember, it was a long time ago,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
but I think it's silly that they call cream in coffee cream.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It's not cream?

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Do you know what's delicious?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Do you guys want to have your own fucking show?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Cream is delicious.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Well, I asked them.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I think Australian butter is great.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It's better.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So my girlfriend's mom was right

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
to say try the butter.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
One point would not be so much that Australian butter is good

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
as that your butter is fucked.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Right.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So I think coming from your country

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
to any other country, literally any in the world,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and eating any dairy

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
that products are made out.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
What's really sad is that I love chocolate,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
but our chocolate is crap.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Hershey's is the most fucked?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Like, it's so fucked.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Right?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
And you think you're like, we're number one, America number one,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
and then you put the Hershey's Kisses backstage,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
they're always backstage,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and they taste literally like vomit,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
and I'm not saying that in like a...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Not like a hyperbole way,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
they just taste a bit like vomit.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And it's...

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I don't know, because you have cows.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Right?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Yeah, but we pump our cows

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
probably full of more hormones and chemicals

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
and crap and stuff.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
We also feed them different stuff.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
We feed them bad shit.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Well, you feed them bad shit, I imagine.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You're out giving them acid tabs.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So...

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I didn't hurt seagulls.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
They loved it.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
We all had a great time, and then we went home.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
He almost got hurt

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
by a seagull.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Yeah, I'm the victim.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
No,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
you're the...

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You're the big bad wolf

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
of that Red Riding Hood story. No, no, no.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
You were a boy,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and you had a dick.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And then you were making out with a boy

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
who also had a dick.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Who would you want to have a bigger dick?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I did think of this

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
as you were discussing it.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I think it depends

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
on the relationship.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
You don't want to know the theory.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
All right, a bold stance, Pam.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
No, no, no.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I'm not letting her off the...

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
She's amazing.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
She's going to give us...

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
She's going to give us the spectrum of life.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
What does it matter

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
if you're together for a long time?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
You're either happy because they've got a big dick

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
or you're not happy because they've got a big dick,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
whether it's for two years or...

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
To tell the truth, I haven't really

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
thought about it.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You've just said you thought about it.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I couldn't come up with an answer.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
How about this?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
This is the worst question I've ever asked anybody.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
As a woman.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
If you

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
were instantly a man,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
how big would you want your dick to be?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Would you like to have just an average

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
right down the middle dick?

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Would you want to have a big old porn dick?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Or just something kind of

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
easily concealable?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
This is my new favorite show.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
How long is our visa?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Can we get paid to do this?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I think it's over after she answers this question.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Does it really matter to you?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It matters to me.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Yes, it does.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I want to be clear about that.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
The truth matters. We won't judge you

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
whatever the answer is.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
But also you don't have to answer if you're...

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
You also don't have to answer. You know that, right?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Okay, gosh.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Well, you forced a drink into her hand.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
All right, Mr.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Segal Whisperer is now...

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
It's always like...

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Suddenly you're a good guy.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I'm sorry. I'm right all the time.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I can't help it.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
All right, I'm trying...

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Obviously you do not have to...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
But big, long, expectant pause.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Okay, if I gave an answer,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I wouldn't have a good justification for it.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
So I'd just be giving an answer just to...

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Right.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
It would be arbitrary.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
It would be arbitrary, and what's the point?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Big. She wants a big one.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Exactly.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Because you need a fucking... She'd have a truck.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Right, okay. Okay, Josh.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Whatever you say.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
She wants a big one.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Well, there's reasons why not.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
It's painful.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
But I don't want to be...

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I don't know.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I'm putting the spotlight over it on myself

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
because you could say to a woman

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
if you were instantly a man, pick a dick size.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
But why not just say to a guy, pick a dick size

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
because I have a dick size.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
What would you pick? Well, you've got high five.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Happy with what you've...

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I've got...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I've got incentive to focus on her needs.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
That's what I've got.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I've got the big modern dick

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
called a reason to go down on her.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And I think...

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
But knowing what I know

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
and learning what I've learned,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I guess I'd like to have a medium-sized dick.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And I don't know what that is

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
because every time

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
there's a conversation about dick size,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I mentally flee.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I've never measured it.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
All guys have a story in the States

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
about the time they tried to measure it.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Like, do I start with the balls and all this stuff?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I've never had the

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
quote-unquote balls to

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
take a ruler

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
near my groin.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I'm afraid to see the hard numbers.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
What do you think the average size is?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
No, with your fingers,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
just what do you think an average size penis is?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I think an average size penis.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
From...

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
from the front of the balls...

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
From the top of the...

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
from the top, not the balls.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
No, wait, what do you mean?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Well, this is important.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You're in this, you're in this.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I need a woman's perspective.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I want to know if we mean from the...

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
So it's from the top.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
From the top of the abdomen.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Like, yeah.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Welcome to the show, Pam.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Aren't you happy you're up here?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Yeah.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I'm going to decide on a length

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
that I think is average.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Use my arm.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Use your arm.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
That's like an easy way for the perspective.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It's good.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I must have the worst pickup line ever.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Well, roll up your sleeve and I'll make the marks.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Was there a pen?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
No, Mark.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Just why are you being so awkward about this?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
You're a fucking adult, okay?

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Just what do you think?

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Wait, is it erect or flaccid?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Obviously erect.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Nobody gives a shit about your flaccid dick.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Nobody cares about your flaccid dick.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
My flaccid...

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
If your flaccid dick is long,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
you're weird in a different way.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Well, there's showers and growers.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Everyone knows that.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
If you have an impressively long flaccid dick,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I feel superior to you.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Because you have some weird thing going on.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
You're like an elephant, man.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Not an elephant, man.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
That's not what I meant.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Thank you for holding my arm so tenderly.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
All right, so I'm going to...

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
This is the top of my...

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I'm not...

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I'm just going to start with room to finish.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Dan, can I make a picture?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Just for showbiz sake.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
You draw yours, Pam.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You don't look on Josh's left arm.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
You draw what you think.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Fucking brilliant.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
That's fucking brilliant.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
That's what I do.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That's what I do.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
We got to stay in Australia

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
and start pitching shows.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
All right.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Oh, wait.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
What I'm going to do, Pam,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
just to tell you my technique,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
is I'll imagine this tip being his wrist.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So I'm going to make a mark at his wrist.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Pam, you did that.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
No fair looking.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
You have to be...

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
The control is that you don't know what he's doing.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Pam, while he's doing this,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
you have to be mentally...

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Don't smoke it out with this.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Don't smoke it out with me.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Pam, in your mind,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
what you think is the medium...

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
...mean, median size..

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
This is what you think is average.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
What is exactly average.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Of any man.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
None of them teach women.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
None of them teach women.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Of mankind.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Of mankind.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Mankind. What you would consider

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
right down the middle.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
The average.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Like, just, like, try to really just nail it.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
So he did the hands there.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So that's the end.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So he did the hands there.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And then you go back, Pam, anyway.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I mean, you're getting paid to be here.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I'm doing it for free.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Yeah.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
What am I going to cop after it?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
We're getting a woman's perspective.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Well, it's...

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
No.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I hope...

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I hope, madam, that's the title of this...

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
the title of this episode, a woman's perspective.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
You're both being ridiculous.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
That's true.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
We are not passing the Bechdel test at this current time.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Sorry.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's fine. It's fine.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It's probably...

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I probably deserve it.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
All right.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
You guys are both fucked.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Like, that is not what big things are.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Well, what...

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Okay.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Okay.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Pam has lived a good life.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
That's all we know.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Like...

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Those are both too high.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And I still feel like...

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I don't want to, like...

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I've seen some dicks in my time, right?

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And I would have seen that dick...

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Twice.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Carmen is pretending.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
You mean because I want people to tell me it's...

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
my estimate's too big because that'll make me feel better?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Is that what you mean?

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Because I want to be honest and say...

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
This is outrageous. This is not...

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I don't know.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Well, I don't understand.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
This is why I don't know.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I don't know if you drew it too big out of, like...

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
cockiness.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Like, well, of course, they're this big because I'm this big.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
No.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Or out of some clothing.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I don't know if it's like...

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000
If I were...

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000
He watches a lot of porn.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I'm awful.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
He watches a lot of porn, Josh.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Right, right.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
He's going...

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Is that what's going on with Pam?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
No, Pam apparently went to Italy for a while.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Alright.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
That both...

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
are absurd.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Alright, now...

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I know what Pam's is.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I'm going to roll up my sleeves and...

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I'm going to have Spencer and Josh draw...

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
their ideal clitoris size.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Now are you happy, ma'am?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
What...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Oh, you tell us what you want a woman's perspective on.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
What?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Anything.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Anything.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Not dicks.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I don't know.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Just, like, actually ask her a question and listen to the answer.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
I asked her if she wanted a drink.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
She said no and I got her a drink.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And Brisbane are the backwards ones, that's right.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Are you from Brisbane?

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
No, yeah.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Are you just upset because I said Brisbane is racist

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
and now you're trying to tell me that I'm just touching...

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Somebody give her a shoot if you can.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I was up on stage...

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
in Brisbane.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
These are just cheers.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I did a few tours there.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Dan, you asked me what I would like for the show.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Oh, are you...

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Is it Louise?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Yeah, it is.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Louise.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And the first thing I thought of actually was

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I would like you to be more inclusive of women on stage.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
But you wanted to...

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000
You told them you should lose weight, didn't you?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000
She didn't say lose weight.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
She said take care of herself.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
She said take care of yourself.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Did she tell you to lose weight?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
No, she said take care of yourself.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
That was implied.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
She's a gold star family.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Let's give her some respect.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
No, she's great.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
But she could have said that last time

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and, you know, we would have taken it into account.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
We had two women up on stage that night.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Oh, it was awesome.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I felt like, you know, it felt redundant to say that at the time.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
It seems hard because, like, there's not that many women on stage now,

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
but I'm gay.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
So it's like...

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I'd like to see more racial representation.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Well, yeah.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
I mean, we're SOL fans.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
We're in Sydney.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
It's the home of white people and two honorary Asians.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
But Louise, I will say that's...

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Australians.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
But as you said, the night that you...

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
That was your first thought, it didn't apply

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
because you were one of two women that came up on stage.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And then the...

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Right.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
But it is a thing, like, women get on stage with you.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I'm sorry.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
She's like the Phantom of the Opera.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I guess.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Well, if I asked her to keep talking,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
and then we mock her when she talks to them,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
we're like, kind of...

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
How did you feel about how we treated the dude that was on stage?

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Because I don't feel like I was that nice to him.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
But there's also two different things.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It's like, well, we brought Pam up.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
I thought that was a really inspired choice on Josh's part.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
And we didn't...

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
We didn't, like, look at Pam and go,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
let's talk about dicks, baby.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Like, I don't know.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
We were, like, random drunk.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
But the thing is, we bring Pam up,

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and it's three men who are comedians

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
who are like, just can't wait to get a joke.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And so we're not really giving Pam full, like, time to...

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Yeah.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Ask me something, then.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Yeah.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Well, let's ask Pam stuff.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Yeah.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
About what?

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I said that.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
What are you listening?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Wow.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Is he a chauvinist monster?

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Fuck you.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Yeah, the race for the high road.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Pam, Pam, it gets boring real fast.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
You moved here because your husband was coming

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
to take an acting class.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
So that's ambitious.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Like, you didn't move her because someone had a career.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
He had a possible career.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Yeah.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Did that Pam out for him?

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000
No, he quit after a couple of years.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
But he did acting for a while.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
And then he did what a lot of actors do and became a teacher.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I love that you thought, oh, what?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
We've got to talk about something,

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
and then you asked her about her husband.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
No, no, no.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
That's why I asked it.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Because Pam went.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Because she moved here.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You moved here because of your man.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000
But did you have ambitions when you came to Sydney

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
of your own?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
An equal ambition.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
But it was his getting interneited that decided it,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
that gave us the positive momentum to do it.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
But I was very happy to move to Sydney.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
All right.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I think I can get this up to some higher ground.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It's a long time ago.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Pam, didn't you think it was romantic when Russell Crowe

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:59.000
took Steve Irwin's widow into his own?

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Did he?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I didn't know that.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I thought I read something about that.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
What did he do with her?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
That's not true?

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Russell Crowe and Steve Irwin's wife?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
What?

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
What did he do?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I don't know what Russell Crowe has done lately.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Well, that's interesting.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
What makes it back to the States?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Well, I don't think...

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I didn't hear you say anything.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I didn't hear you describe an action.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I thought he was getting married to her.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
To who?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Steve Irwin's widow.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Oh, okay.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000
No.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I'm happy to be wrong about it.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I think it's disgusting.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I was also...

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I didn't have an opinion about it.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I thought it was a real thing.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
I'm just worried that you think we were talking over Pam

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
because she's a woman.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
But it's just when you bring someone on stage,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
you talk over them so that they don't feel...

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
No, we're...

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I have more questions for Pam.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
We can solve this problem.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Pam.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Yes?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
What do you think of these hotel rooms where the...

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Where you have to have your key in a slot

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
in order for the fucking power to be on...

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Is that green?

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Or is that bullshit?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I haven't stayed in that many hotels where I've had that,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
but it's something you've just got to get used to.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I presume it's for the benefit of energy saving

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
or something or other.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Yeah.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Or that's what the Patriarchy said.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Very reasonable response.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Just going to change your behavior.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Pam, I have a question for you.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
If you were in a room and there was two doors,

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and in front...

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Now I'm going to try and kill you.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I was going to do the labyrinth riddle.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
All right, I have a question.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Pam.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
They know a lot about pop culture.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
No.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
But we don't.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000
No.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Pam.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Yes.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Do you think that passport theft is a thing in hotels?

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Like, if I leave my passport on the end table,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
like, what's somebody going to do?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Take my passport and then they're going to...

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I don't know.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I'd never leave my passport anywhere that I did.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Yeah, I don't want to...

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
What do you think someone's going to do with it if...

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I don't know how to be a traveler like you guys,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
probably are.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You're probably staying in a hotel all the time.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Don't put yourself down like that, Pam.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Quite everywhere I am.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
What is the thing that a passport thief is gaining

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
by stealing the passport?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Does it make fake passports?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Does this have a definite answer or are you just asking my opinion?

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Yeah, just a guess.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Okay.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I don't know.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I guess we're all afraid of identity theft.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Right.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Can't be good for someone to have your passport.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
But is a passport valuable to a stranger?

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yes.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
This guy's got his hand up.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
He's so excited.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
There's a huge...

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I like the idea that someone knows how...

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000
No one's a boy.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
You can't ask a boy.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Got it.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Sorry, you're not allowed.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
We've had too many boys.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Okay.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
All right.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Okay.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Well, okay.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Pam, if you don't have an opinion about this,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
I'll ask that guy, but he'll keep his seat.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Do you really want the boomerang to come back?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
That's...

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
I understand.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Are we being racist here?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
No.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
You can't do anything right today.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I'm safeguarded from this.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
If you internally have those compartments,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I'm just like, ha-ha, Australians.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Australians get very uncomfortable.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I think like, if the boomerang doesn't come back,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
you succeeded, right, if you're a good boomerang thrower?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Yeah.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Is it supposed to hit something and then come back?

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
No.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Really?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000
No.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
The majority said no.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000
How can it come back?

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
So it's like, you have a go, you miss, it comes back,

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
you have a go, you miss, it comes back, you have a go,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
you hit, you don't need to throw it.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So it doesn't come back.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
That's what I was just saying.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
So it's like, doesn't matter if it doesn't come back,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
because you're finished,

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
because you already sell some bills.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
You don't want the boomerang to come back.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
How do boomerangs don't come back?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Huh.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
What do they do with their drone properly?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And if you don't hit something.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
If you made a boomerang with a leading edge of it,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
it was like razor blades, it could go straight through

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
like the neck of a thing and keep coming back.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Pam.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Like odd job at Goldfinger.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
We can move on.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
That's clearly too controversial a topic.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
You're sophisticated people.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
You deserve better.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Pam.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Pam, have you downloaded Mario Run?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Oh, what?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Oh, shit.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
That's not going to come back.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
You're going to kill someone.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
That's not going to come back.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Right.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Yeah, it's not going to come back.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Read the sticker.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
It comes back.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It comes back.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Made by Jimmy James.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Jim learned this craft from his grandfather,

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
who grew up among originally elders in Central Queensland,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
to throw, hold vertically with rounded side facing you.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Throw with a flicking action, 30 degrees to the oncoming wind.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Made in Australia.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Everybody reach under your seat and put your safety goggles on.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
They tell you to throw it in the oncoming wind.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Throw anything into oncoming wind and it'll come back.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I'm not going to do that.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Oh, shit.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Now, you guys just want me to throw, it could be a planted plant.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
It's not going to...

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Well, they said...

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
She's not going to be happy when she finds out about this guy.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Pam, she doesn't better than I do.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Pam, you don't have to have an opinion,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
but you're welcome to have one.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
If I were to have a baby with my girlfriend, Cody,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
what do you... should we name her Forensic Heller

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
or Cody's Baby?

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
We love forensic files.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
What's the last name going to be?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Cody's.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Well, Cody's Baby Harmon, I think, would be...

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
The last name would be Harmon. Let's just say that.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
It's just Cody's.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
You really got to practice saying it.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I'm also a teacher.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And you got to practice saying the name

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
and not end up with a name

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
that the kid's going to be embarrassed by

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and want to change or is very similar to somebody else's.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You got to be unique but not stupid about it.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000
So Cody's Baby.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Pam's?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Very good at not answering questions.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
What do you teach and what level?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I teach high school.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Really? How many years?

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
How many years have I been teaching?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Too many to add up.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You're not teaching math, apparently.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
No, I don't teach math.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Wait, so that...

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Okay, Barry, the lead, you're a teacher.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
We had a teacher up last night.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You didn't just steal his job idea, did you?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
No.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000
So how old is the oldest kid you're teaching?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Probably 17.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000
So you've seen the worst of humanity.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
You've had every reason to turn your back on it.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
No, I don't see it like that.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Well, what's your secret? How do you not see it like that?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Because you're there with them.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Is that the secret? If we knew them, we wouldn't be afraid of them?

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I teach subjects that most kids like learning.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
What do you teach?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I teach design and technology.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Oh, cool.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Which is not learning how to fix computers and stuff.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
It's using technology for design.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Oh, okay.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
So they're coming in in a good mood.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Yeah, they do. They enjoy the lessons.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
But they still disrespect you if they felt lack of...

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
You're dealing with pubescent primates.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Yeah, I'm pretty used to it now.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000
You're quite a hard guest because we really want some pain and some misery.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
But every time I ask a question, it sort of seems quite nice.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
All your answers are really lovely.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
You want me to be in pain and misery?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Probably, yeah.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I have some sort of nitty gritty like,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
oh, no, my husband would be good, wouldn't it?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
He doesn't know I'm here. I know that.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I support him and I like my job.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
It's sort of hard for comedy, isn't it, when someone's happy?

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I might be acting.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Well, usually what we do...

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
I'll go like, oh, who's having a terrible time tonight?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
But we don't want them to come up and talk about how terrible things are.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I think we hope for, like, silver linings and things.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Obviously, the terrible thing that happened is she was yanked up here,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000
and the silver lining is that she's quite happy, so that's already worked.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
It's worked. It provided me with a good job.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
If you want to go, if you don't feel comfortable, you could definitely go.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Yeah, we don't want to make you uncomfortable.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
You should've went somebody else up.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Do you regret me picking you?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
No.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
As it's been a good experience?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Yeah, fine.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I hope so.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
It's not...

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Pam, I hope so.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm pleased to have met you.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
That's amazing.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Pam, Josh and I are gonna...

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
This is how we're gonna...

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
You work in the theatre because you love it.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
You've seen shows here, there's shows you haven't seen here.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Is there a theatrical performance that Josh and Jeff and I can do

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
that would, like, fulfill your fantasies?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Like, what hasn't shown here or whether it's...

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
You can either pitch something new or...

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
You mean you perform it?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Right.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
But don't imagine me performing it.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Imagine what you'd like to see and then I'll ruin it.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
God.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
There's always Shakespeare.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Right, okay.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Done.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Done and done.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
You should know I'm not educated.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
That's because you're from Brisbane.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Oh.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I will clear this opera house.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I will clear this opera house.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I just saw that girl that got so mad at me before climbing.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Yeah.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You guys...

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Yeah, well, yeah.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Anything you like that Pam does, I made happen.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
He's the Phil Spector of Pam.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Right, he discovered her.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
He made her.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
When he found her, she was just over there in the darkness.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
But, you know, anything you would like to see,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
you don't have to...

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Don't try to confine yourself to my dumb game.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
She said Shakespeare.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Right, well, okay.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
You're right.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
She did and I forgot because I'm drunk.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Okay.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Anything specific?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
What's your favorite Shakespeare production?

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Oh, there's been a really good Othello here.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
That one just came.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
That's perfect for Dan.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Oh, yeah.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
You weren't saying that she hasn't seen, right?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
It's like the one that you have seen.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Because, yeah, I know...

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Let's just do Othello.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Okay, I don't know anything about Othello.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Well, I know Josh does.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Josh is a huge Shakespeare buff.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
All right, well, let's do our version of Othello.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
We don't...

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
I'll guess.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Do you know the story?

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
What's that?

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Oh, yeah, Pam.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Yeah, Pam, tell us the story.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Yeah.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
If you give us a log line of Othello, can you?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Can you give us a kind of elevator pitch?

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Oh, it's a quite...

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I can't be quite...

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I'm going to walk Pam back to her seat.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I don't want to have to...

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
She's going to give us the goddamn description of the story,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
and then she's going to take your seat and enjoy the most...

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I think Pam should play Desdemona in this.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I think we should...

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000
No, don't...

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Okay, you want to lead up line.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Yeah, just like set the stage for Othello.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
He can't be trusted.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Othello.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I think he's having it off with my wife.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Okay.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Well, I want to play...

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Let's have a hand for Pam, everybody.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Pam?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Pam?

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
All right.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Oh.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Iago.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
How...

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
How...

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
How beefy on this fine morrow.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I'm good, Othello.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I...

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Ah, she's well met...

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Ah, Desdemona.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Jesus, Jesus Christ.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Desdemona, my beautiful wife.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
The wife...

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
No, I'm not the wife.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Yes.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
The fuck if I say you are my wife.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Yes.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
The wife, true as true can be.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Yeah.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.000
True as true to me, as fidelity can possibly also be...

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I'm going to leave Iago.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Don't be an asshole and fuck shit up for me.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Oh.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So anyway, so...

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Desdemona.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I can't do sex with you

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
because I'm the wife of that guy.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
The wife of that guy.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Yeah.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
A pittance of phrasing.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
For what is of what and of what will have thou?

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Aye.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Will not the moon be of the sun?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Yeah.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Shall not the sun have an earth?

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Will not the body of heaven?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I tell you what, I tell you what.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Did you stop it?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I'll suck it.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Apox is born on this...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Fortnite.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
That's it.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Curse me for loving it so.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Oh!

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Oh!

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Oh, Fi!

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Fi, foul, handkerchief, proof that my...

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
My what?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Are we in the scene or are we...

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I was doing a different scene over here.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Okay, okay, okay.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Over here.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I didn't take...

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I didn't take any proof.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I think he actually knows that one.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
No, fuck it.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Okay.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Do your own scene.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
No, come on, don't!

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
No, come on!

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
It's called a fellow.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
It's not called two dickheads.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Oh, no!

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Come on!

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
What the...

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Come on!

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Guys are being...

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I put my foot in it because I thought...

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Whose name's in the fucking marquee?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Well, there was a scene.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
It's called a fellow.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
All right, so, then, ten years later...

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Am I pregnant?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Not over ten years, probably.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Desdemona!

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Desdemona!

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
You remember me?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
You suck my dick!

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Yeah.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Okay.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I know you can hear me!

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Yeah.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I'm a little garbage man now!

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
You suck my dick!

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Can't you see?

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Ha, ha!

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Leak, leak, leak!

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Ha, ha!

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Leak, leak, leak!

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Wait, I mean...

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
It's an American car.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I apologize for an invisible car.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I don't know what's shining on me.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I feel a bit sort of objectified.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
And I don't...

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It's new for me.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I feel a bit sort of...

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I sucked it.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I remember that happening.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I do.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Oh, my godness, you did!

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
But just because I...

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Keep talking!

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
You were monologue about it!

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Just because I sucked it then

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
doesn't mean I want to suck it now.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Because I'm my own...

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I'm a strong, independent woman.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Hi.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Hi, guys.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Oh, the master approaches.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Yes. Hello.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Oh!

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Foul handkerchief.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Scented with the spilled beer of Pamela.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I can't believe it sat here for ten long years.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Well, I was pushed to the periphery

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
of my own story.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Oh, it's hard keeping the guys at this hair castle.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
All the thundercoats back at you down that under.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Oh, me comic relief will be studied

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
in high school and no one will think it's funny,

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
but I'll be an example of comic relief.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
You'll be taught what I'm doing is comedy.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Oh, Desdemona, I hope I did not break your iPhone

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
when I threw the foul handkerchief.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Okay, it's all good. It's all good.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
No, we quite literally smashed my iPhone,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
but it's been worth it.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
As long as Pam's happy.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Also, I think I'm kind of a black guy as well.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Desdemona!

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Now, honestly, it's all for being a woman.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I get why she's so annoyed.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
It's horrible.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I'm coming up!

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I agree you should make love to me!

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
No, don't assume me.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
It is as the constellations twirl

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:50.000
on the impenetrable finger of the gods of the action.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I am here to permit to myself the duty upon which

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:00.000
is to defile and conquer thee from love.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Where is the recipient of my giant hardon?

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Who will cushion the blow of my burden?

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I, who was born from vagina,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
now cursed to walk the earth as penis,

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
must seek again vagina to take my day.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Forsooth.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
The gods send a man?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I, just a lowly control of that may have to end the show

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
with musical notes.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I'm still pretty sad about my phone, actually.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Were you reimbursed that?

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Yeah, we have insurance.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Did it really get broken?

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
It's not broken.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
He's just being whiny now.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
No, the screen smashed.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
It's not smashed.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
If I look.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Let's not end the night with victim blaming.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I think we'd make great leaps forward tonight.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Gently, gently this time. Please, please gently.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Okay, oh god.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Yeah, it's...

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
It's smashed, okay.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Yeah.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
It's fine, I get them for free.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
I do dance for Optus.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:31.000
I do get them for free, yeah.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Seriously.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I'll send an email.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:42.000
They're in the show with that, or do they?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.000
The Australian Commonwealth is entitled to their rap.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I think so.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
The rhymes for the word Australia, you won't believe.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Failure.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
If the planet was a ball, Australia would be smaller.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Smaller ball, on the ball.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
You're on the ball in Australia, y'all.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Australia, y'all.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Yo, Australia, genitalia.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I'll never fail you.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Put a pin in it.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Fuck New Zealand.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Fuck New Zealand, I assume.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Fuck New Zealand.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Oh, what do they think they're doing?

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
They think they're gonna be down under?

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
They don't understand.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Australia's down under.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Fuck New Zealand.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
They sound weird to you.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I assume, I assume, I assume.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Sydney's been good from coast to coast.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Australia's like a big piece of toast.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
It's got peanut butter on it and chocolate, too.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I fucked your mama so hard, she said,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
how do you do? I said, hello, how are you going?

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
That's what they say down here.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
I fucked your mama, I'm slowing down.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
It's just to fuck her even harder.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I fucked her so hard, they called my dick a yarder too long.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I fucked her for a song with Madonna, Billabong.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I fucked your mama.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I fucked your mama.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Thank you for coming to Harmer's Down, everybody.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Thank you for coming to Harmer's Down.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Let's hear it for Josh Thomas.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.000
The wonderful, the provocative.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000
My good friend Lee Lanay, thank you for coming up on stage.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And the woman of the hour, Pam.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Spencer Crittenden did.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Once again, it's Harmon, Dan Harmon.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Thank you so much. We've really enjoyed our stay here.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
What a wonderful country. We can't wait to come back.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Thank you everyone here at the Sydney Opera House.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Alice, our tour manager, Dustin Marshall on sound.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Kris Boruff, our director of technological wizard.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Drive fast, take chances. We love you.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Did you get any of that?

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:52.000
It's a good show.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I just learned that break a leg here is chukas.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Yes.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Does anyone know the origin of that?

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000
You'll have chicken tonight.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You'll have chicken tonight.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Wait.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
But you call chicken chukas.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Chukas, chukas, chukas.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:39.000
All right, you guys are a country of weirdos.
