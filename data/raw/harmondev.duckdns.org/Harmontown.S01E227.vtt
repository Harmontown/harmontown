13:03.000\nI've wasted your time.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:05.000\nPlease leave me alone.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.000\nAnd Americans, they do the opposite to they tell you how good they are.\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:13.000\nAnd it took me a long time in America to work out that I'm not meant to do that.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nBecause if you go to an American and you say, oh, I'm a slug, they're like, great.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:22.000\nWell, I've wasted my time talking to this slug.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.000\nOr they'll say, we love slugs.\n\n13:25.000 --> 13:26.000\nDo we love slugs?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nLove slugs.\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:34.000\nWe have a hundred slug pile you could sit in and absorb the moisture in the room so\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:35.000\nthey don't feel better.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:37.000\nThey'll play it up.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:38.000\nThey're like, this is huge.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:40.000\nWill Ferrell did this and now look.\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:42.000\nAnyway, just a warning.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:47.000\nJosh, I learned from my friend Lee that's from here of a thing called the tall poppy syndrome.\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:48.000\nYeah.\n\n13:48.000 --> 13:49.000\nDo you know about this, Dan?\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:50.000\nNo.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nTall poppy gets cut, right?\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:52.000\nYeah.\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.000\nLike.\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:54.000\nLike.\n\n13:54.000 --> 14:03.000\nSpenser cutting to the chase.\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.000\nYeah.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:08.000\nLike you are not supposed to be a taller poppy than the rest of the field.\n\n14:08.000 --> 14:11.000\nLike if you are, you're going to get, people want to chop you down.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nLike you don't want to stand out, right?\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:17.000\nDo you not like, to me, that feels so natural.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nDoes that, do you not feel that?\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:20.000\nLike.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:25.000\nI think what you said just before, like in the States, no, like you are rewarded for being\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:26.000\na tall poppy.\n\n14:26.000 --> 14:28.000\nLee, how did you word that?\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:33.000\nYou mean like the Quentin Crisp quote?\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.000\nOh, was it Quentin Crisp?\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:36.000\nWell, we were talking about a couple things.\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nYeah.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nHi, everyone.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:39.000\nWe're quoting.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:42.000\nTell us the Quentin Crisp quote.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:47.000\nIt was the idea that this guy was left, left.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:52.000\nHere, I'm going to give you a mic.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:53.000\nDreams coming true.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nYou're all here for this.\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:01.000\nHey, buddy, it was the idea that Quentin, you have to correct me when I get this incredibly\n\n15:01.000 --> 15:02.000\nwrong.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:09.000\nQuentin Crisp was a socialite and an advocate and an openly gay man in a time when it was\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.000\nnot okay to be gay.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nGross.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nSad.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nMy opinion.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.000\nIt's a hot tick.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nJuicy cock though, so.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:21.000\nHe had that one.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.000\nIt is gross.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nYeah.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:25.000\nIt says gay sex is gross.\n\n15:25.000 --> 15:31.000\nIt says one thing we could all agree on is that gay sex is disgusting.\n\n15:31.000 --> 15:32.000\nPlease continue.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:33.000\nOkay.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:41.000\nThis is so weird, everybody.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:42.000\nAre you gay?\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:43.000\nI'm not.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:44.000\nOkay.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:45.000\nI could learn.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:46.000\nIt's so tight.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nI could teach you.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nWouldn't he be a great guy?\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:57.000\nHe looks like a, like, if Errol Flynn was a hustler.\n\n15:57.000 --> 16:00.000\nHe looks like a faggot.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:02.000\nThat's what he looks like.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:05.000\nI found that, not only does he have the awesome Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:10.000\nmustache, I found that today he's also really good at archery and he's, he can fence.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nSo he is, he's a pirate.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nHe's a, yeah, like, like, if Robin Hood pirate.\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nLet's don't use archery.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nLee.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nLee, just come up here.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:21.000\nCome on.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:22.000\nLee London, everybody.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:26.000\nWelcome, Lee and my friend.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:31.000\nI know I'm a guest here, but I would like to know why do you know this boy?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:34.000\nI know, we used to date.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:40.000\nI know his father, his music producer from London, but he lives in Los Angeles.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nAnd when Lee comes out to visit, we've hung out.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nOkay.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:45.000\nIt's not just you in a suit.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:46.000\nI'm in a suit.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:51.000\nWell, let me tell you a thing, a sexual quote at once.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:54.000\nYou sir, I have a couple of questions about pocket squares.\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nI would like to ask you.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nNo, no, what was the quote?\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:59.000\nI forget how that goes.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:00.000\nOkay.\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:06.000\nHe said, he was being asked about why he, why he left England and went to New York.\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:13.000\nAnd he said, he said in, he said in England, people will hold you back in fear that when\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:16.000\nyou get to the top, you will have forgotten them.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:22.000\nBut in America, people will raise you up knowing you'll be there to lend them a hand when you\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:23.000\nget there.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:24.000\nWow.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:29.000\nBut here, the tall poppy thing is like, that's like, it's...\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:30.000\nFuck that guy.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:31.000\nYeah.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nYeah.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\nHe's shinier than me.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:36.000\nIsn't Milwaukee like that, Dan?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:37.000\nDidn't you see that?\n\n17:37.000 --> 17:40.000\nAren't the people, they don't want you to rise up in the same way?\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:43.000\nYeah, I think, well, I think there's a, yeah.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:48.000\nIf you live in a town where most people make the most money lifting things with their physical\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:55.000\narms, and New York is one of those cities, even though there's so much...\n\n17:55.000 --> 18:04.000\nThere's going to be more antipathy or disconnect between the idea of, it's like the idea that,\n\n18:04.000 --> 18:12.000\nokay, well, as I've always said, if you live in Milwaukee and you don't believe that living\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:17.000\nin warm weather will kill you, why are you living in Milwaukee?\n\n18:17.000 --> 18:22.000\nYou can't, your brain has to make certain justifications, and I'm not saying those are\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.000\nfalse, because it is fucked up to live in Los Angeles.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:28.000\nThere's a million bad reasons to live there, but yeah, I don't know, there's a Harrison\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:35.000\nBergeron kind of like, yeah, like discouragement of exceptionality.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:41.000\nThe poppy thing we're talking about, that's a culture where it's like very wisely, fuck\n\n18:41.000 --> 18:47.000\nthis person, who is this person that keeps obsessing about how good it can get, how close\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.000\nto the sun they can get.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nThey seem like trouble, let's get them out of here.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nThat seems like a wise social policy, but one that would never profit me.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nDo you not feel that way?\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:57.000\nDo I not feel...\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:59.000\nWell, yeah, look at that.\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:02.000\nHe just told you to hate him because he's a genius.\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:06.000\nNo, no, that's a voice I hear in my head all the time.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:09.000\nIt's like you're pretentious, what are you doing?\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:11.000\nGet your head out of your ass.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:14.000\nIf you were going to have sex with a boy, right?\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nI'm listening.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nIt would go a little something.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:22.000\nWould you want him to have like a bigger dick than you or a smaller dick than you?\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:30.000\nOh my God.\n\n19:30.000 --> 19:31.000\nWe'll be right back.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:35.000\nThis show does deserve to be in an opera house.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:37.000\nThis isn't some fucking bullshit podcast.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nThis is amazing.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.000\nIt's the first time I'm 43.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:43.000\nI've never answered that.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:50.000\nDo I want to have the thing in my butt or do I want to...\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nThat's really up to you to decide.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:56.000\nCan I answer a question with a question, but I'll keep the ball in my court.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nBalls.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:00.000\nI do want to know, like, is it...\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:05.000\nIt's politically incorrect to ask questions about who's pitching, who's catching.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:06.000\nThose are distinctions.\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:08.000\nIs there different ways to be gay?\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:09.000\nIs there different ways to be gay?\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:12.000\nYeah, there's different ways to be gay.\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nIs there...\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nCan you be a gay person that hates anal sex?\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nYou can't be, right?\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:22.000\nYou can't love oral sex and hate anal sex and be a gay guy, right?\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:24.000\nYeah.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nI'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nBecause I need to know before I answer my question.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:30.000\nBecause I need to know my options.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:34.000\nCan be anything you want to be.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nYou can, like, decide you don't want to do anal sex.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.000\nYou can decide you don't want to have dicks in it.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:46.000\nI mean, the gay guy who doesn't want to do any anal sex is not going to be a very popular gay guy.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.000\nLike, good luck out there.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:50.000\nI don't have time for him.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:52.000\nI don't know about you, I don't have time for him.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nBut there's definitely gays who don't put dicks in them.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:58.000\nAnd there's gays who don't put their dicks in other boys.\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:00.000\nCan you let people know, can you be gay, can you go like...\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nThis is called Grindr.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:06.000\nAnd that's what's so good about technology is now you get to discuss it.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.000\nYou can say, like, you're a top or a bottom, you know, right?\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:11.000\nAre you a... what are you into?\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nQuestion mark.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nMe?\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nThat's what you say in the app.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:18.000\nIs this... it's actually a bit weird to me that you don't know this,\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:20.000\nbut of course you haven't been on Grindr.\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.000\nIt's weird to me too, just to be clear.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:24.000\nSmaller dick, smaller dick.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nI forget the world isn't...\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nSmaller dick.\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.000\nI figured it out, I've been thinking through it,\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:32.000\nand I asked them dumb questions that were...\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:34.000\nThat made me think, like, what am I doing?\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:37.000\nI don't mean because you're scared of, like, putting a big dick in you.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:40.000\nI mean, like, because it's, you know, obviously it's festive to have a bigger dick.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nLike, that's like a fun...\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:44.000\nThat's like...\n\n21:44.000 --> 21:46.000\nYou can hang decorations off of it.\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:48.000\nIf we know... I wasn't asking you...\n\n21:48.000 --> 21:51.000\nI wasn't asking about your pain thresholds.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:52.000\nI was saying, like...\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:54.000\nWell, I was considering that, I was.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:56.000\nDude, like, if, like, in the spirit of, like,\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:59.000\nobviously presumably it's better to have a big dick,\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.000\nbecause it's so fun.\n\n22:01.000 --> 22:05.000\nDan, you and your gay lover are in the shower,\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:07.000\nyou know, after some horseplay.\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.000\nAnd, uh...\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.000\nAfter the horseplay?\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nYeah.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.000\nAfter the loving? After the loving?\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.000\nOr the first thing in the morning, it doesn't matter, you're in the shower,\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:16.000\nand you're soaping each other up.\n\n22:16.000 --> 22:18.000\nDo you want to look over and go, oh, this guy's got a bigger dick than me?\n\n22:18.000 --> 22:21.000\nOr do you want to go, look, I got big, my fucking dick is compared to this guy?\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:23.000\nYeah, are you like, oh, I've got such...\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:25.000\nDo you want to be, oh, I've got such a big dick, isn't that great?\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:28.000\nOr do you want to be, oh, look how big a dick I found?\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.000\nYeah?\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:36.000\nWe're going to win a fucking Emmy or a Tony for this.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:38.000\nThis is amazing.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:42.000\nUh, I think, well, before he brought up the shower,\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.000\nI was just thinking like, okay, little dick, I'm overthinking it.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.000\nI was just like, little dick, because I have...\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:54.000\nI want to cuddle with a smaller of, like, like, uh...\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nYou want to be...\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:56.000\nI want to be, uh...\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.000\nAs heterosexual as you can be.\n\n22:58.000 --> 22:59.000\nThat's what I...\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:01.000\nCan he have a vagina?\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.000\nYeah, well, but isn't that...\n\n23:03.000 --> 23:06.000\nYou want to be Papa Bear, and by the way, you wouldn't be a bear.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:09.000\nBut then when he brought up the shower, which is like...\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nWe were soaping each other up, but then the idea of the fray...\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nOh, look what a big dick my lover has.\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:17.000\nI was like, oh, well, I mean, yeah, I haven't thought this through this enough.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nI'm not overthinking it.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nI should think really hard about this.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nI should think...\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:23.000\nI should think about this for years.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.000\nBecause there's a version of me that would be like,\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:27.000\noh, I should...\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.000\nI'm like a baby man, and when you're gay,\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nyou don't have to be like, I'm a baby man.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.000\nYou could be like, I'm a baby man.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.000\nLike, I could be like a baby man,\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:41.000\nand a smaller, smarter dude could just let me have it,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:43.000\nand like, own me.\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:44.000\nI definitely want to have it.\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:46.000\nAnd he could have a huge dick.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.000\nAnd I'm like, I could soap it up and go like,\n\n23:48.000 --> 23:50.000\nthis is gigantic, and I'd not be jealous of it.\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.000\nAnd that's a fun time.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nLike, I own this dick.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:54.000\nExactly.\n\n23:54.000 --> 23:55.000\nI get it.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nIt's like a...\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nThere's a...\n\n23:58.000 --> 23:59.000\nWe've been...\n\n23:59.000 --> 24:03.000\nI've been making a mistake of thinking that the dial that...\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:09.000\nwhere at the very top, the misogyny and gayness are like...\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.000\nI thought there was like an oven dial.\n\n24:11.000 --> 24:13.000\nLike, but you could go backwards.\n\n24:13.000 --> 24:14.000\nYou could just go click.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:19.000\nI'm a person that's a narcissist.\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:21.000\nThat reflects itself in misogyny if I'm straight.\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:22.000\nIt could actually...\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:24.000\nThe solution could be being gay.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nWell, I definitely...\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nLike, you wouldn't have to disrespect somebody...\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:28.000\nThe solution is to be gay.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:29.000\nYou're fucking it up.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:30.000\nRight.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:33.000\nSorry, I guess I got excited too long-winded away.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:35.000\nI want them to have the smallest dick.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nI want a micro penis.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:38.000\nI want to be the one with the big dick.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nThat's what I want.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:41.000\nI have a small dick.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nYou want to have a taller poppy.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.000\nI just want to be...\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:47.000\nYeah, I would just be a lot happier if I...\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:48.000\nRight.\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:49.000\nJust that's what I...\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:51.000\nIs it a sense of like a self-esteem thing?\n\n24:51.000 --> 24:53.000\nYes, it's a self-esteem thing.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:54.000\nRight.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:56.000\nBut you kind of...\n\n24:56.000 --> 24:57.000\nYeah.\n\n24:59.000 --> 25:02.000\nYou kind of high-roated me when I had the exact same answer as you.\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:05.000\nNo, but you were just thinking about the mechanics.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:08.000\nI wanted to know spiritually.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:11.000\nYou mean if I go through an entire spiritual journey,\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:15.000\nI'll come around to wanting the same things I do as a gross straight guy?\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nLike, as you're like, you know, do you...\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nI think we finished.\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nYeah, that was right.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nYeah, I should learn to take a...\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\nRead the room.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nThey ended the bit.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nThey're like, great, you did it.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nThat's who's on first.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:28.000\nI mean, obviously...\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:31.000\nObviously, I'd like to talk for another 45 minutes about...\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.000\nYeah.\n\n25:32.000 --> 25:33.000\nWhat about testicles?\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:36.000\nSo, okay, so you're with a girl who really wants to have bigger tits.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:40.000\nDan has talked about at length that he has enormous balls.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nMe too.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nYou've got very large balls.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nWell, I just...\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:45.000\nI need to tell myself that for obvious reasons.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:46.000\nSorry.\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:50.000\nThere's a photo of Dan that his girlfriend took\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nwhere he's laying on his back.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nHe's smiling.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:53.000\nHe's aware that it's happening,\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:56.000\nbut she'd already gotten the camera out because he's wearing boxes\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.000\nand just his balls are out.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:02.000\nAnd they're just this incredible, like...\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.000\nLike, the color is like a...\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:09.000\nLike a tropical sunset kind of pinkish orange.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:10.000\nI don't know what's going on there.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:11.000\nThey're just fucking...\n\n26:11.000 --> 26:12.000\nThey're huge.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nIs this podcast video or just audio?\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nIt's odd.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:19.000\nIt's a shame that they're not going to hear the look in your eyes\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:22.000\nas you talk about his balls.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.000\nIt's a shame they can't hear the glint you had.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nYeah.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:30.000\nFor the subscribers, we could probably put up like imagery.\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nIt would be nice, I think.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nI got lost.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:38.000\nYou got lost in my eyes when I was talking about Dan's balls.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:42.000\nBecause this is going to be the best for some of our lives tonight.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:43.000\nAll right.\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nI think it's hilarious that your friend is still up here.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nI just want to point that out, but I don't want to believe.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nI don't want to believe.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nI think it's funny now.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:51.000\nI think it's funny that he's up here.\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:53.000\nI'm now just listening to the podcast.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.000\nYeah, no.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nThat's what happens.\n\n26:55.000 --> 26:56.000\nThat's what happens.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:57.000\nThat's what I do.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:58.000\nYeah.\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:00.000\nBut I'm going to take a little...\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:06.000\nWatch this genius turn into the dunes of the Australian dunes.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:09.000\nSpencer used to catch seagulls.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\nYeah.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:15.000\nSpencer revealed to us that...\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nIn confidence.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:17.000\nYeah.\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:20.000\nNo, that's a joke.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:21.000\nIt's true.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:22.000\nIt's true.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:23.000\nIt is true.\n\n27:23.000 --> 27:24.000\nI never said that to you.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nIt's fine.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:26.000\nI'm going to talk about it.\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.000\nI just put it right in the thing.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:28.000\nIt's fine.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nActually, Cody told me, you're going to put them...\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nYeah, I'm going to put them...\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.000\nI missed the top of you explaining this.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:41.000\nSpencer, we went to the aquarium today because I love fish and forgot I hate people.\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:47.000\nBut Spencer, at some point, was talking to the group and I was just lost.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:54.000\nBy the time I came into the conversation, Spencer was explaining that during his wayward youth...\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:55.000\nWhere were you?\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:56.000\nSeamy Valley?\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:58.000\nWhere is this taking place?\n\n27:58.000 --> 27:59.000\nMore part.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nWell, we were at the beach.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nYou would go to the beach in your youth.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.000\nYeah.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:06.000\nIt's hard to imagine you at the beach.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:07.000\nRight.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:14.000\nCan you explain this thing that you would do if you don't mind?\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nAll right.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nYou go to the beach.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nYou lay down in the sand.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nYou can go to the beach.\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nI didn't always have this beard.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nWithout a beard, it makes a lot more sense.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:33.000\nIf you go to the beach with that beard, people think you just washed up on shore.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:37.000\nPeople think you're there to reclaim Greece.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nI got shipwrecked.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:41.000\nYou promised me a white bull.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.000\nRelease the Kraken.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nI forgot that's a hack reference.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nI was just saying it mythically.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:49.000\nRelease the Kraken.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nI was going to own it.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:52.000\nAll right.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.000\nI'm at the beach.\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:56.000\nWhat you do is you bury...\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.000\nYou get someone to cover...\n\n28:58.000 --> 29:00.000\nWell, you could do it yourself.\n\n29:00.000 --> 29:06.000\nYou cover your legs and stomach and most of your chest and sand such that you're buried beneath the sand.\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:08.000\nUp to your neck.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\nWell, no.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nI said the parts you cover.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nThe legs and the stomach.\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:18.000\nYour upper chest, your head and your arms stay over the sand,\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:23.000\nbut you have a towel, a beach towel, covering the whole lot.\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:28.000\nSo for all intents and purposes, it looks like someone put someone's head underneath a beach towel.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:33.000\nIt's like that scene in The Virgin where he's trying to convince everyone he's had sex with a woman.\n\n29:33.000 --> 29:38.000\nAnd he's like, you know, when you're having sex with a woman, he's never been to the beach.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:40.000\nAnd then she's coming.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nHe hasn't been.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:46.000\nYou really think the lie he'd pick to tell would be...\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:50.000\nI used to catch seagulls as a teenager.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:51.000\nWait.\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.000\nThis guy's got a band of teenagers out there.\n\n29:53.000 --> 29:56.000\nIs your three quarters covered in sand?\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:57.000\nThank you.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:58.000\nYes.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:01.000\nBut you have a towel covering you that looks like...\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:02.000\nIt's the final quarter.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:06.000\nSomeone just tucked you in like you're in bed with a towel over you.\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:07.000\nBuried up to your waist.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:08.000\nOver my head.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:09.000\nOver your head.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nAnd stomach.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:17.000\nAgain, you're de-clarifying the situation.\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:22.000\nLegs, feet, knees, dick, stomach.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:24.000\nMaybe right under my tits.\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\nYou know, that's where it starts.\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:26.000\nOkay.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nThe rest of it...\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nBut laying understand.\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:29.000\nUnder beach level.\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\nThe rest of it is underneath the towel.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:32.000\nOkay.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:34.000\nArms exposed underneath the towel.\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.000\nArms are under the towel.\n\n30:36.000 --> 30:39.000\nJesus Christ.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nSo look, see this?\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:42.000\nYou see this part?\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:43.000\nYeah.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nAll of this that you see is under a towel.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nBecause beach towels are very large.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nThey could cover this whole area.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:52.000\nIt's amazing.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:55.000\nSo, Google towel.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nWith the beach towel over your face,\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nyou get someone like a brother or a friend\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:02.000\nto put food out on the towel.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nAnd scattered around, you know,\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:07.000\nbecause it's very suspicious.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nEspecially to seagulls.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:10.000\nYeah.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nBecause they've been hurt before.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nRight.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nBecause I do it all the time.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nI did it all the time.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nSo, yeah, with the food in place,\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nyou just wait and then, you know,\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.000\nyou hear them squawking and you hear them\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:24.000\nflapping around.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nDon't yell at me.\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:26.000\nI have a question.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:27.000\nOkay.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:31.000\nIs your head above the towel?\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nI'm not going to answer that because...\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nHe's covered.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.000\nHe's trying to be in disguise from the seagulls.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:39.000\nSo, he's covered.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nSo, nobody in the family is showing.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:42.000\nSo, he's got a towel over his head.\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nI was just thinking maybe part of the fun\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:48.000\nwas that they don't regard a head as a threat.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nThe fun is catching a seagull.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nIt's not...\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:53.000\nIt's not gaslighting this.\n\n31:53.000 --> 32:00.000\nThe fun is watching a guy lost in his...\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.000\nThe fun is physically catching a seagull.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:04.000\nYeah, that's the whole point.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:09.000\nNot mentally circumscribing it with semiotics.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nAll right.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nI think we all have the visual now.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:14.000\nI don't think Dan has...\n\n32:14.000 --> 32:15.000\nWell, I don't.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:18.000\nThe truth is I don't.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:21.000\nAnd there may be a problem with society where\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nat a certain point people like...\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nWhoo!\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:26.000\nAll right.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:27.000\nLike this.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:28.000\nWhere's the sand?\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:30.000\nThe sand goes up to here.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:31.000\nNot my chest.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nDo you see this is the chest?\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nOkay, but is the...\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nI have questions.\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nI know you think I'm doing a bit,\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nbut I swear I have questions.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nCan you imagine a towel fitting...\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:44.000\nNow...\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:48.000\nOkay.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:50.000\nOkay, so, and the rest of it is a mound?\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nWhat sound?\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nThe rest of it is a mound?\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:53.000\nYeah.\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:54.000\nIs that below sand level?\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:56.000\nWell, half and half.\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nYou make a little shallow grave\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nand then you slip into it when you do this.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nRight.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nIf you were a seagull, you didn't know\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nthere was a boy pretending to be at the beach.\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nYeah, the whole point.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:09.000\nThat's all I'm doing.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nTricking them into thinking I'm not there.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nAll right.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:14.000\nI should get up.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:15.000\nYou get it, right?\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nWell, as long as you're down there,\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\ntake us through the process.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nAll right, so I'm laying here\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nand the seagulls...\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:23.000\nAnd your brother or friend, as you said.\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:24.000\nOr friend, yes.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nHas put chips around your head.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nUh-huh.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nOkay.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:30.000\nLike, yeah, it's on my head.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nReal quick, Josh,\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nI think I'd want the guy to have a bigger dick.\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:36.000\nAll right, go ahead.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:38.000\nTo soap it, did you think about the shower\n\n33:38.000 --> 33:39.000\nwhen you thought about it?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nBecause I want to wash it.\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:41.000\nI figured it out.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.000\nIt's all about the soap.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:43.000\nYeah.\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nIt becomes like a Cadillac or a bicycle\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nor anything you treasure.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nA throwing knife, a new blender.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:51.000\nIt's like...\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nI had this epiphany where I was like,\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nwait, all right, all right.\n\n33:55.000 --> 34:03.000\nCome on, Spencer.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nHey, guys.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:11.000\nAll right, we don't take them for granted.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nThat was so awesome.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nI'm not even going to bother to describe that to the listeners.\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:16.000\nYeah, $5 a month.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:21.000\nYeah, $5 a month to see the coolest exit of all time.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nProbably a lot of theatrical people in the audience,\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.000\nSpencer returned to his one.\n\n34:26.000 --> 34:31.000\nAll right, so Spencer, now you are partially sandy,\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:34.000\nyou're partially tiled, you got bits of food,\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.000\nyou got French fries and whatnot on top of you.\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:41.000\nAnd now we're hearing the seagulls coming in.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nBecause my eyes are covered.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:43.000\nI don't see what's happening.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nI have to rely on my ears and my sense of touch.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.000\nBut now your sense of hearing is heightened now\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nbecause you can't see.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.000\nOh, of course.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nI mean, without question.\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:54.000\nThat goes without saying.\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.000\nSo I'm doing that.\n\n34:56.000 --> 34:57.000\nIt's a feeding frenzy.\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nThey're suspicious.\n\n34:58.000 --> 35:01.000\nHowever, will any sensory gift,\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:05.000\neven the score between you and the most dangerous game of all,\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:12.000\na confused, slightly domesticated, urban plight parasite?\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nAll right, they're real parasite.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:16.000\nThey're everywhere in California.\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:17.000\nIt's terrible.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nAnyway, so they're coming in.\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:23.000\nYou feel them getting up on your chest and or body.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:27.000\nAnd they got to get like right on your head area\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:31.000\njust because that's the center of your bear trap action.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:34.000\nSo your arms are out, crucifix styles.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:36.000\nYou can close them like a bear trap.\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:37.000\nYes, I got you.\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:38.000\nYes.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.000\nSo once, you know, and you got to wait\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:44.000\nbecause they know it's something's up.\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:48.000\nBecause again, there's like a giant lump under a towel.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:51.000\nThey're stupid, but it looks weird and they know that.\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:52.000\nSo, okay.\n\n35:52.000 --> 35:53.000\nSo you're being patient.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:56.000\nThey're like, is this, is this how I die?\n\n35:56.000 --> 35:58.000\nOr is this the first day of the rest of my life?\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.000\nRight.\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:02.000\nThose potato chips on a decorative mound.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:03.000\nYeah.\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nBecause usually a semi-circular pattern.\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:06.000\nYeah.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:09.000\nAround a beardy, beardy bulge.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:10.000\nI didn't have a beard.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:14.000\nAnd a bunch of other humans kind of in the middle distance,\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:15.000\nlike giggling.\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:16.000\nYeah.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:19.000\nYeah, because it's a big, like it draws a crowd, certainly.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:20.000\nYeah.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:22.000\nEspecially after the first couple of times.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:25.000\nPeople overselling a transparently perfunctural game of hacky sack\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:29.000\nas they clearly are more invested in the towel.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:34.000\nSo, so they're getting up on my face and I'm waiting for my moment.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:36.000\nAnd then I, you know, I do what I did.\n\n36:36.000 --> 36:37.000\nI go.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:40.000\nAnd then, you know, you use the towel as a crude net\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:44.000\nand then you just try and grab as many as you can.\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:48.000\nIs that the end or is that phase one?\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:49.000\nYeah.\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:50.000\nThat's phase one.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:55.000\nAnd once you have 200, you can fly away.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:58.000\nNo, it's just for fun.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:02.000\nI mean, do you, do you keep them as pets?\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:03.000\nDo you let them go?\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:04.000\nYou like that?\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:07.000\nNo, I snap their necks and toss them into the sea.\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:13.000\nI believe that.\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:14.000\nNo.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:15.000\nSo it's just for fun.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:16.000\nI don't know.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:18.000\nI couldn't tell you what my end game was\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nother than catching seagulls.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nDoes it, does it, does it, doesn't hurt them, does it?\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:22.000\nI hope not.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\nI mean, I never saw them maimed or anything.\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:25.000\nLike they all flew away.\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:28.000\nYou have to mention, you said two things that stick out about the story\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:30.000\nis that you, you'd find that as you did this,\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:32.000\npeople would root for you while you were doing it.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.000\nRight.\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.000\nBut then once you were successful.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nOnce I had a seagull in my grasp,\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:41.000\nit became this whole big animal rights issue.\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:45.000\nAnd then you said you stopped after the experience you had.\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:46.000\nSo, so one of the times,\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nI've probably caught about five seagulls this way.\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:50.000\nIt takes a lot of tries.\n\n37:50.000 --> 37:52.000\nThey were calling you old, old,\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:53.000\nold wispy arms.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nGoal, goal reaver.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:56.000\nThey called you goal reaver.\n\n37:56.000 --> 37:57.000\nGoal reaver.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.000\nAll right.\n\n37:58.000 --> 37:59.000\nI like that.\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:00.000\nDid you invent, like, is this something you,\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:05.000\ndid you invent this or did the guy that invented it?\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:06.000\nDid he?\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:09.000\nI think he got the idea from a Metallica album.\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nI'm certain I didn't invent it.\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:12.000\nThere's no way.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:14.000\nWas this, if it was like a bigger brother,\n\n38:14.000 --> 38:16.000\nthis seems like the kind of thing where it's like,\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:18.000\nI'm going to tell my little brother,\n\n38:18.000 --> 38:20.000\nI'm going to fucking bury him in a beach\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nand get a crowd around.\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:23.000\nWas there like a hat?\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:24.000\nWas he collecting money?\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:25.000\nNo.\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nTo like, you know what I mean?\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nWere you busking by accident?\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:30.000\nI wish.\n\n38:30.000 --> 38:32.000\nNo, I could have made a lot.\n\n38:32.000 --> 38:35.000\nBecause I mean, the crowds cannot be understated.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nIt was hard to hear.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:42.000\nThere's no, there is no overstating the throngs of people.\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:43.000\nYeah.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:44.000\nIt was hard to hear the seagulls.\n\n38:44.000 --> 38:46.000\nAmong their hoots and hollers.\n\n38:46.000 --> 38:48.000\nStop being worried about the seagulls.\n\n38:48.000 --> 38:50.000\nPeople on the beach just cry.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:52.000\nThey're like, like, like, like Thunderdome.\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:55.000\nPeople are like, like, climbing up on things and like.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nI thought you were going to say early,\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:00.000\nI thought you were saying, there is no business,\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:03.000\nlike seagull catching business.\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.000\nAnyways, all right.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:05.000\nSo, all right.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.000\nBut this leads somewhere.\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:09.000\nThis is the Michael Crichton twist.\n\n39:09.000 --> 39:11.000\nAgain, I've only probably caught five.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:12.000\nIt's not easy to do.\n\n39:12.000 --> 39:14.000\nSeason the gold catcher, though.\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:15.000\nYeah.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:20.000\nSo one time I got one and, yeah, I caught it\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:22.000\nand he was flapping around, you know,\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:25.000\nand I, like, got him by his body so he couldn't flap away.\n\n39:25.000 --> 39:27.000\nAnd he's starting to, like, attack at me.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:30.000\nHe's biting at me and he tries to peck.\n\n39:30.000 --> 39:32.000\nHe tries to peck my eye out.\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:35.000\nHe goes, what, bam, with his beak right at my eye.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:39.000\nAnd at the last second, the last fifth is a second I'll say,\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:42.000\nvery short period of time, like it was very close.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:46.000\nIt opens its beak and I can see down its throat.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:50.000\nAnd I got scars, little tiny scars up here\n\n39:50.000 --> 39:53.000\nand then down here above and below my eye\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nto prove that this was a dangerous beak\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\nthat could peck an eye out, but didn't.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:01.000\nAnd I swear to God, it was just because of, like,\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:04.000\nJesus or something that I didn't have my eye pecked out that day.\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:07.000\nOr the devil, because if I had an eye patch and a beard,\n\n40:07.000 --> 40:09.000\nholy shit, look out.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nIf you had an eye patch, if you had an eye patch,\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:20.000\nyou and Lee could really make, this would be a great pirate movie.\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:25.000\nArchery, doing so much archery.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:30.000\nDo you prefer the seagulls have a bigger or smaller beak than you?\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:33.000\nDefinitely real big.\n\n40:33.000 --> 40:35.000\nI like that in Spencer's universe,\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:38.000\nit's possible the devil was responsible\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:40.000\nbecause it left him without an eye patch.\n\n40:40.000 --> 40:41.000\nRight.\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:44.000\nAnd the devil in your universe is just...\n\n40:44.000 --> 40:47.000\nHe wants me to look less ridiculous.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:49.000\nHe's just bad at marketing, right?\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nThe devil is like, he's chaos.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:54.000\nHe doesn't package things right.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:56.000\nBut so he's biting and pecking around.\n\n40:56.000 --> 40:58.000\nI mean, the story kind of trails off here.\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:02.000\nSo I stuff my finger in his mouth so he can't bite or peck.\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:06.000\nAnd at that point, kids were coming up and wanted to pet him\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:09.000\nand people were getting mad and say, you shouldn't do that.\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:11.000\nAnd then eventually, I just let it go\n\n41:11.000 --> 41:14.000\nbecause it's like, you know, seagull doesn't want to be there.\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.000\nI don't know what to do with it.\n\n41:16.000 --> 41:20.000\nOh, you know, my parents told me that their family members did it.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:22.000\nThat's how I got the idea,\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.000\nbecause one of them would tie a string around their foot\n\n41:25.000 --> 41:28.000\nand kind of fly it around for a while.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:30.000\nThat's what... But I never did that.\n\n41:30.000 --> 41:32.000\nWhat kind of weird handbilly...\n\n41:32.000 --> 41:34.000\nYeah, that's what I said.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:36.000\nBut I never did that.\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nYeah, no, I'm normal.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:41.000\nI'm not some weirdo.\n\n41:41.000 --> 41:44.000\nBut yeah, and so people were petting it and then I let it go.\n\n41:44.000 --> 41:45.000\nIt was great.\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.000\nBut after that, it was just...\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:49.000\nI mean, it was very scary.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:50.000\nI was almost pecked out.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:52.000\nLike, it should have been pecked out by all accounts\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nbecause it was trying to bite and peck at me.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:58.000\nYou're gonna have a hard time tying this into, like, a sub-story for you.\n\n41:58.000 --> 42:00.000\nMy aunt was almost...\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:01.000\nYeah.\n\n42:01.000 --> 42:03.000\nNo, I mean, I don't want pity.\n\n42:03.000 --> 42:05.000\nI would love respect.\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:08.000\nUm, he doesn't want...\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:10.000\nHe doesn't want our seagulls to pity him.\n\n42:10.000 --> 42:12.000\nHe wants them to fear him, right?\n\n42:12.000 --> 42:16.000\nHey, Jeff, what if there was a beer commercial\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:20.000\nthat Sam Elliott was doing a voiceover for?\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:22.000\nA beer commercial?\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:24.000\nAnd it involved...\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.000\nWell, I didn't want to pimp you and say,\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:29.000\ncan Sam Elliott sell seagull catching,\n\n42:29.000 --> 42:32.000\nbut I like your Sam Elliott impression.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:34.000\nLet's see, what would...\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:36.000\nBut it could be like a beer that's...\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:38.000\nthat they're using seagull catching the way that a beer...\n\n42:38.000 --> 42:45.000\nHello, I'm Sam Elliott for the 2017 seagull catching competition.\n\n42:45.000 --> 42:49.000\nThis year, it's an Australian Bondi beach,\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:52.000\nbut they don't have seagulls here, right?\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nYeah.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:54.000\nBut fuck seagulls.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:57.000\nWe're going to kill a bunch of those greasy-ass ibises.\n\n43:02.000 --> 43:05.000\nFuck ibises.\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:07.000\nThose things are gross.\n\n43:07.000 --> 43:09.000\nI mean, I saw one in the park,\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nwhat's the Hyde Park, right?\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:14.000\nAnd there's a crazy-ass, like, awesome, exotic bird,\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:16.000\nand then they just, like, they were just...\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:19.000\nThey're just, like, raccoons, they're just in the trash,\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:21.000\nand they're all covered in shit, and they're just...\n\n43:21.000 --> 43:26.000\nThey sound like somebody punched a baby.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:29.000\nCan you tell me who Sam Elliott is?\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:31.000\nDo you ever see...\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.000\nOkay.\n\n43:32.000 --> 43:34.000\nDo you ever see Big Lebowski?\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:35.000\nOh, friends here.\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nDid you see Big Lebowski, Josh?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nYeah.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:39.000\nNo.\n\n43:39.000 --> 43:40.000\nDid you see Mask with Cher?\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:43.000\nWell, I think probably if you keep listing things that he's in,\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.000\nthen I'm going to keep saying no.\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:50.000\nWell, obviously, it's still now.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:53.000\nNo, he's a character actor who has a big mustache.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:55.000\nOkay, yeah.\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:57.000\nIs it good impression, I guess?\n\n43:57.000 --> 43:58.000\nNah.\n\n43:58.000 --> 43:59.000\nI've done better.\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nI was struggling with the material.\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nThat was a curveball.\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nI didn't set him up to succeed.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.000\nI trust him, though.\n\n44:07.000 --> 44:09.000\nI mean, it was...\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:11.000\nSam Elliott.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:14.000\nJosh, there's one line from a movie called Frogs.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nIt's a terrible movie with him and Ray Maland.\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:17.000\nYeah.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:19.000\nAnd on the poster of the movie Frogs,\n\n44:19.000 --> 44:22.000\nthere's a frog the size of a Volkswagen Beetle\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:24.000\nwith a human arm hanging out of its mouth.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:25.000\nOkay.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:28.000\nAnd that doesn't happen in the movie.\n\n44:28.000 --> 44:30.000\nThere's never giant frogs.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nIn fact, most of the frogs aren't even in the movie\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:33.000\nbecause when they shot this movie,\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:35.000\nthey had a bunch of frogs brought in on the set.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:36.000\nThey let him out.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:37.000\nAnd guess what?\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:40.000\nThe frog's just fucked off into the night.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:43.000\nAnd so while they're shooting the movie,\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nguess what?\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:45.000\nThey're two things.\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:46.000\nThey don't have frogs.\n\n44:46.000 --> 44:47.000\nYeah.\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\nBut you could hear a million frogs.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:54.000\nSo they had audio issues and third act problems.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.000\nWell, as long as you have Sam Elliott,\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:57.000\nyou can get through that.\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.000\nBut Sam Elliott doesn't have a mustache in this one.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:01.000\nAnd you kind of see why he always has the mustache.\n\n45:01.000 --> 45:04.000\nHe's got kind of a weird lip that hangs down real far like that.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:07.000\nYou never saw Tombstone with Kurt Russell?\n\n45:07.000 --> 45:09.000\nSo I don't know if I can repeat this again.\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:11.000\nAnything you mentioned with Sam Elliott in it,\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\nI haven't seen.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:15.000\nOK, I'm going to do what I say is a fairly OK impression\n\n45:15.000 --> 45:18.000\nof Sam Elliott doing one line from the movie Frogs,\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.000\nSam Elliott and Rainbow Land.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.000\nI don't think we're going to see any of them again.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nNot live, anyway.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:32.000\nAnd, awesomely, if you can find it,\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:35.000\nbecause Rob Schrab has the VHS of it,\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:40.000\nthe trailer is the worst syntax like set in structure.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:43.000\nIt goes, Frogs is coming.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:50.000\nAnd there's a big-ass frog in the poster.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:51.000\nYou never see.\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:53.000\nWell, it's hard because if it's Frogs,\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:55.000\nif it's the animal, ah, coming.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.000\nBut if it's Frogs, the name of the movie, then it is coming.\n\n45:57.000 --> 45:59.000\nYeah, Frogs is coming to a theater to you,\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.000\nbut it doesn't work.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:02.000\nYeah, it doesn't.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:05.000\nBirds is coming.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:10.000\nThey thought it was going to be the birds of amphibians.\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:15.000\nSpencer, what would your tactic be to catch a wild frog?\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:16.000\nOh, no.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:17.000\nYou just...\n\n46:17.000 --> 46:18.000\nYou go out in the rain.\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nThey always come out in the rain.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:24.000\nBut they're easy to catch.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:25.000\nSo...\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.000\nI dated a girl very briefly who was Italian\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:31.000\nand her family was supposedly in the mob\n\n46:31.000 --> 46:35.000\nand she had, for real, an Uncle Vinny, Uncle Vince.\n\n46:35.000 --> 46:38.000\nAnd he was a real lunatic.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:41.000\nAnd he was a property manager in an apartment building.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:44.000\nHe slept with a.357 under his pillow, loaded.\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:48.000\nAnd when he would see pigeons in his backyard\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.000\nat the apartment complex,\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.000\nhe would catch them in a pillowcase,\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:55.000\ntie the pillowcase in a knot, and throw it in the pool.\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:56.000\nOh.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:57.000\nAll right.\n\n46:57.000 --> 46:58.000\nWell, let's just...\n\n46:58.000 --> 46:59.000\nHe's jealous.\n\n46:59.000 --> 47:01.000\nWhy didn't I think of that?\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:03.000\nAll right.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.000\nSo, getting back to Australian politics...\n\n47:08.000 --> 47:10.000\nJosh, before I...\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:15.000\nI only have so much more time where I care about this stuff.\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:18.000\nI have Australian questions that I couldn't Google.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:20.000\nIs there a president?\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nThere is, right?\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:23.000\nAnd there's none.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:24.000\nOkay.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\nBut there's a prime minister...\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nThat's a prime minister.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:27.000\nBut then there's something else.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:28.000\nThe states have premiers.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:30.000\nOh, but the Queen is just the Queen of England, right?\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:31.000\nYeah.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:32.000\nOkay.\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:33.000\nBut...\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:34.000\nOkay.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nI think he was asking me.\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:37.000\nOkay?\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:39.000\nI've got a cupboard.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:41.000\nI've got a cupboard.\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:45.000\nThe prime minister who is, like, the head of the country.\n\n47:45.000 --> 47:46.000\nAnd then there's the governor general,\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:48.000\nbut he doesn't do all she, I guess.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:50.000\nHe doesn't do nothing.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.000\nSo that guy wants me to do nothing.\n\n47:52.000 --> 47:55.000\nSo, prime ministers...\n\n47:55.000 --> 47:59.000\nWell, those other people are, like, they're federal.\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nThey're Australia-wide.\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:02.000\nWhat?\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:03.000\nTheir office is...\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:04.000\nThe government?\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.000\nYeah, it's Australia-wide.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:09.000\nI mean, that's not...\n\n48:09.000 --> 48:11.000\nThese offices aren't state-level.\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:12.000\nThey're...\n\n48:12.000 --> 48:13.000\nThey're the same.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:16.000\nYou guys have, like, your electoral states,\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nand then there's people.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:19.000\nIt's the same.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:20.000\nDon't worry about it.\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.000\nAll right, don't worry about it.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:22.000\nWe have, like...\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:25.000\nWe have Donald Trump, but she's a woman.\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:26.000\nPauline Hansen?\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:27.000\nAnd she's not as popular.\n\n48:27.000 --> 48:29.000\nBut she's so pretty popular.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:31.000\nYeah, but I can get through every show\n\n48:31.000 --> 48:32.000\nby shitting on her for half an hour.\n\n48:32.000 --> 48:34.000\nYeah, fuck Pauline Hansen.\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:35.000\nYeah, I learned...\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nI learned to grip that hang glider\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:39.000\nfirst night in Brisbane, man.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:40.000\nI was like...\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:41.000\nWell, they love her in Brisbane.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:43.000\nWell, that's not saying anything bad about Pauline Hansen\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:44.000\nin Brisbane.\n\n48:44.000 --> 48:45.000\nNot my fans, no.\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nWell, they're laughing very nervously.\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:48.000\nThey're all taking you home.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:49.000\nThey were stuck.\n\n48:49.000 --> 48:50.000\nOh, shit.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:55.000\nI'm from Brisbane, and I'm not going to argue with you.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:58.000\nYeah, I don't like her, but Brisbane likes her.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:01.000\nWe're not going to pretend like Brisbane's not racist.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.000\nI'm not going to sit here like,\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.000\nyou're a person, I'm a person.\n\n49:05.000 --> 49:06.000\nWe're looking at each other's eyes,\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:07.000\nall I can see is black,\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:08.000\nbut you can see my eyes.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nWe're going to lie to each other.\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nBrisbane is racist.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nLook at that.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nIt definitely is.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:17.000\nYeah.\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:18.000\nWe're not...\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:19.000\nHello.\n\n49:19.000 --> 49:20.000\nI mean, the world...\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:21.000\nI lived there.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:22.000\nI lived there.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:25.000\nI left, because they're so racist.\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:30.000\nYou left, you're here.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nThey don't...\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:34.000\nOh, shit.\n\n49:34.000 --> 49:36.000\nOh, fuck.\n\n49:36.000 --> 49:37.000\nSee?\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:40.000\nSee, they hate others.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nThey can't be tolerance.\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:43.000\nWe were in Brisbane,\n\n49:43.000 --> 49:45.000\nand there wasn't a single problem.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:47.000\nWhen we landed on Ipswich,\n\n49:47.000 --> 49:50.000\neveryone was like, they were stoked about shooting on Ipswich.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:52.000\nI'd love to do a show on Ipswich before we leave here\n\n49:52.000 --> 49:56.000\njust to verify that this is all a cycle of bullshit.\n\n49:56.000 --> 49:59.000\nBecause, like, we filled a theater there.\n\n49:59.000 --> 50:02.000\nIt was fucking weird and rowdy.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:03.000\nDid you actually do a gig in Ipswich?\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nYeah.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:05.000\nAnd they were smart and great.\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\nNo, no, Brisbane, we did.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:07.000\nBrisbane.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:08.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:09.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n50:09.000 --> 50:10.000\nI was too busy answering the question\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:11.000\nbefore you finished asking it.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:12.000\nI'm like, yeah.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:13.000\nYeah.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:14.000\nNo, we didn't do a show on Ipswich.\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.000\nFuck those fucking stump-humping rednecks.\n\n50:16.000 --> 50:21.000\nI'll do anything to regain control.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:24.000\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:25.000\nI know.\n\n50:25.000 --> 50:28.000\nWhen they talk, you just say yes, ma'am, and continue\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:31.000\narguing with them.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:34.000\nIs this what you do in your gay TV show?\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:37.000\nI can't believe it's legal.\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:39.000\nWait, is gay marriage legal here?\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:40.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:41.000\nWhat is this?\n\n50:41.000 --> 50:42.000\nYeah, I didn't think so.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:43.000\nNo, it's not at all.\n\n50:43.000 --> 50:45.000\nYou can get arrested just for getting married?\n\n50:45.000 --> 50:46.000\nThey're getting married.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:47.000\nYou just can't get married.\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:48.000\nIt's just off the table.\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:49.000\nYou're not in prison.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.000\nThere's not these prisons filled with gay men who\n\n50:51.000 --> 50:53.000\ntry to get married who would then actually...\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nWell, this is the best life I've ever had\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:58.000\nstuck in prison.\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:01.000\nIt's not Singapore.\n\n51:01.000 --> 51:03.000\nI never asked that question before.\n\n51:03.000 --> 51:06.000\nAll this conversation about gay marriage in America\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.000\nwas never like, well, they're not going to arrest people\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.000\nif they get married, right?\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:10.000\nBut no, yeah, you're just taking a license from them.\n\n51:10.000 --> 51:11.000\nNo, they just can't.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:12.000\nThey just won't.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:13.000\nYou just feel like, I'm going to get married.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:14.000\nThey'd be like, no.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:15.000\nNo, go and get married.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:16.000\nYou can't have like...\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:19.000\nThat's a shame because that's how weddings became romantic.\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:22.000\nBefore, they were arranged, and then it became romantic,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:25.000\nthe idea that you'd slip off into the woods with a priest\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:27.000\nwho would say, you two, in this forest clearing\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\namong your friends, like you're...\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:30.000\nThis is official.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:31.000\nIt's, you know, that's...\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:34.000\nMarriage became like a sacred thing that was about two people\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:36.000\nlike being into each other.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:37.000\nAnd it's funny.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:38.000\nIt's funny.\n\n51:38.000 --> 51:39.000\nWhat?\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:40.000\nWhat happened?\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:41.000\nIt's funny.\n\n51:41.000 --> 51:43.000\nWhat happens with the priest?\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:47.000\nYou know, like Robin Hood times, like, come on.\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:48.000\nOkay.\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:51.000\nHe thinks you meant you go and fuck the priest in the woods.\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:52.000\nIs that...\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:53.000\nOh, no, no.\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:54.000\nThat's what I had.\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:55.000\nYeah.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:56.000\nIn my head, you won't think it by a priest.\n\n51:56.000 --> 51:57.000\nYou won't want to think that.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:58.000\nYeah.\n\n51:58.000 --> 51:59.000\nIt's like, the idea that the ceremony is romantic,\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:01.000\nthat it's an expression of true love,\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:02.000\nthat it has something other...\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:04.000\nIt has something to do with anything other than, like...\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:05.000\nThe government.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:06.000\nGovernment.\n\n52:06.000 --> 52:08.000\nIt's like, it's kind of ironic, isn't it?\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:10.000\nBecause it truly is a government...\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:12.000\nNow you want the contract for something.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:13.000\nI don't know.\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:14.000\nI don't...\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:15.000\nWell, because it's about health benefits now.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:16.000\nIt's about being treated...\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:17.000\nIt's not my fault.\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nI just got swept up in the gay marriage thing.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:20.000\nThere's nothing I can do about it here.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:21.000\nI am in the center of it.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:22.000\nThey won't let me get married.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nI have to feel passionate about it.\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:25.000\nI don't really care.\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:26.000\nI don't want to get married.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.000\nI've got a boyfriend that's terrified of commitments.\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.000\nSo I'm like, I vote for that.\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:32.000\nLuck for that party.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:33.000\nIt'll keep me...\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:35.000\nBut personally, that's not something you'd ever do.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\nIt's not really...\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:37.000\nWhy do I want to get married?\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:38.000\nYou're going to get married?\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:39.000\nYour girlfriend's here.\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:40.000\nI got married.\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:41.000\nAnd then I...\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:42.000\nYou got divorced.\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:43.000\nI don't think...\n\n52:43.000 --> 52:44.000\nAnd now I'm in love.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:45.000\nLike, I...\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:46.000\nIt's...\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:47.000\nI...\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:48.000\nIt...\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nIt...\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:52.000\nI think you reacted wrong.\n\n52:52.000 --> 52:56.000\nI'm not going to...\n\n52:56.000 --> 53:02.000\nI understand I can connect those dots, but you're making candor difficult.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:05.000\nAnd that makes you the bad people.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nI'm going to stick with that.\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:13.000\nIt doesn't seem very romantic to me to sign a contract that says I'm going to love you forever.\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:14.000\nThat just seems a bit fucked.\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:17.000\nSo can you agree of my observation of the irony drunk as I am?\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:18.000\nBut it's like, that's the thing.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:20.000\nLike, it's not romantic.\n\n53:20.000 --> 53:23.000\nThe exact issues that make it a political issue.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:24.000\nI'm going to love you forever.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:25.000\nDecide that morning.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:27.000\nDon't decide 10 years ago.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:28.000\nNo?\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:32.000\nI hate the idea of waking up next to someone and they've signed some...\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:33.000\nYeah.\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:35.000\nIf it becomes a legal document, then it's just a legal document.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:38.000\nUntil I have to go to the rallies and...\n\n53:38.000 --> 53:40.000\nI think we're on the same page, I think.\n\n53:40.000 --> 53:45.000\nBecause we're equal and we're equal to you and that's important.\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:46.000\nLeah, are you going to get married?\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.000\nAre you a married type?\n\n53:48.000 --> 53:50.000\nHe's talking me out of it.\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:51.000\nWhat?\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:52.000\nI'm not going to marry you.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nShe's freaking out.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:55.000\nIs that your girlfriend?\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:56.000\nIt is.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:58.000\nVery careful that you have to...\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:00.000\nOh, shit.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:01.000\nMaybe you should propose right now.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:04.000\nWhat a beautiful opportunity.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:05.000\nPull the trigger, Lee.\n\n54:05.000 --> 54:07.000\nPull the goddamn trigger.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:10.000\nThe tech team is not playing songbird.\n\n54:10.000 --> 54:14.000\nYou can get down on your knee and make her so happy.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:16.000\nWhy don't you want to make her happy?\n\n54:16.000 --> 54:17.000\nAlly and Lee...\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:18.000\nMake her happy.\n\n54:18.000 --> 54:19.000\nHave you guys ever discussed it?\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nYou guys talk about it or is it something that you guys never talk about?\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:23.000\nI feel like I'm being bullied.\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.000\nThat's all I can say.\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:29.000\nYou know, being bullied, the woman that you love is sitting in front of a thousand people\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nsaying, why won't you keep me forever?\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:35.000\nAnd you're saying, because you're a witch.\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nThat's what I saw.\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:39.000\nIs that what you saw?\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:44.000\nOh, well, I'm looking at my coach.\n\n54:44.000 --> 54:48.000\nWhat a beautiful opportunity to make a lovely moment.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:53.000\nWho's with me?\n\n54:53.000 --> 54:55.000\nI'm so sorry.\n\n54:55.000 --> 54:56.000\nSo there's no press.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:59.000\nI didn't even know if I meant to acknowledge you.\n\n54:59.000 --> 55:03.000\nDid you know that what I learned today is that penguins propose,\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:04.000\nthey propose to each other.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:07.000\nThe male brings the smoothest rock he can find up to the female penguin.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nWe didn't learn this together.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.000\nNo, I'm telling you...\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.000\nOh, I think I got away with that.\n\n55:12.000 --> 55:13.000\nWe went to the aquarium.\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:15.000\nWhat do you mean they propose to each other?\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:17.000\nThat's what it said on the sign outside the penguin cage\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:20.000\nat what Jeff calls the fish prison.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:21.000\nHow do they propose?\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:23.000\nThe quays are fucking fish jails.\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.000\nI'm not going to fucking fish jail.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:29.000\nIt says, they get to swim in the fucking biggest part of our planet\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:32.000\nand we go, ah, fuck it, get in the box.\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:36.000\nSo we can look at you like perverse fucking cynical douchebag.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:38.000\nYeah, a lot of those tanks are pretty small.\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:40.000\nThere are some that are pretty big sized,\n\n55:40.000 --> 55:41.000\nbut a lot of them

01:16:22.000\nbut I think it's silly that they call cream in coffee cream.\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000\nIt's not cream?\n\n01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000\nDo you know what's

your butter is fucked.\n\n01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000\nRight.\n\n01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nSo I think coming from your country\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000\nto any other country, literally any in the world,\n\n01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000\nand eating any dairy\n\n01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000\nthat products are made out.\n\n01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000\nWhat's really sad is that I

the Hershey's Kisses backstage,\n\n01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000\nthey're always backstage,\n\n01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000\nand they taste literally like vomit,\n\n01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000\nand I'm not saying that in like a...\n\n01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000\nNot like a hyperbole way,\n\n01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000\nthey just taste a bit like vomit.\n\n01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000\nAnd it's...\n\n01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000\nI don't know, because you have cows.\n\n01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000\nRight?\n\n01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000\nYeah, but we pump our cows\n\n01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000\nprobably full of more hormones and chemicals\n\n01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nand crap and stuff.\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000\nWe also feed them different stuff.\n\n01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000\nWe feed them bad shit.\n\n01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000\nWell, you feed them bad shit, I imagine.\n\n01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000\nYou're out giving them acid tabs.\n\n01:17:38.000

we went home.\n\n01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000\nHe almost got hurt\n\n01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000\nby a seagull.\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000\nYeah, I'm the victim.\n\n01:17:52.000 -->

01:21:32.000\nthere's a conversation about dick size,\n\n01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000\nI mentally flee.\n\n01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000\nI've never measured it.\n\n01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000\nAll

01:21:50.000\nnear my groin.\n\n01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000\nI'm afraid to see the hard numbers.\n\n01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000\nWhat do you think the average size is?\n\n01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000\nNo, with your fingers,\n\n01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000\njust what do you think an average size penis is?\n\n01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000\nI think an average size penis.\n\n01:22:02.000

the balls.\n\n01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000\nNo, wait, what do you mean?\n\n01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000\nWell, this is important.\n\n01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000\nYou're in this, you're in this.\n\n01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000\nI need a woman's perspective.\n\n01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000\nI want to know if we mean from the...\n\n01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000\nSo it's from the top.\n\n01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000\nFrom the top of the abdomen.\n\n01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000\nWelcome to the show, Pam.\n\n01:22:28.000 -->

is average.\n\n01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000\nUse my arm.\n\n01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000\nUse your arm.\n\n01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000\nThat's like an easy way for the perspective.\n\n01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000\nIt's good.\n\n01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000\nI must have the worst pickup line ever.\n\n01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000\nWell, roll up your sleeve and I'll make the marks.\n\n01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000\nWas there a pen?\n\n01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000\nNo, Mark.\n\n01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000\nJust why are you being so awkward about this?\n\n01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000\nYou're a fucking adult, okay?\n\n01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000\nJust what do you think?\n\n01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000\nWait, is it erect or flaccid?\n\n01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000\nObviously erect.\n\n01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000\nNobody gives a shit about your flaccid dick.\n\n01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000\nNobody cares about your flaccid dick.\n\n01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000\nMy flaccid...\n\n01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000\nIf your flaccid dick is long,\n\n01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000\nyou're weird in a different way.\n\n01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000\nWell, there's showers and growers.\n\n01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000\nEveryone knows that.\n\n01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000\nIf you have an impressively long flaccid dick,\n\n01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000\nI feel superior to you.\n\n01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000\nBecause you have some weird thing going on.\n\n01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000\nYou're like an elephant, man.\n\n01:23:30.000

doing this,\n\n01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000\nyou have to be mentally...\n\n01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000\nDon't smoke it out with this.\n\n01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000\nDon't smoke it out with

stage.\n\n01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000\nOh.\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000\nBut you wanted to...\n\n01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000\nYou told them you should lose weight, didn't you?\n\n01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nShe didn't say lose weight.\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nShe said take care of herself.\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nShe said take care of yourself.\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nDid she tell you to lose weight?\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nNo, she said take care of yourself.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000\nThat was implied.\n\n01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nShe's a gold star family.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nLet's give her some respect.\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000\nNo, she's great.\n\n01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nBut she could have said that last time\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000\nand, you know, we would have taken it into account.\n\n01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nWe had two women up on stage that night.\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nOh, it was awesome.\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nI felt like, you know, it felt redundant to say that at the time.\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000\nIt seems hard because, like, there's not that many women on stage now,\n\n01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nbut I'm gay.\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nSo it's like...\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nI'd like to see more racial representation.\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nI mean, we're SOL fans.\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nWe're in Sydney.\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nIt's the home of white people and two honorary Asians.\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000\nBut Louise, I will say that's...\n\n01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nAustralians.\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nBut as you said, the night that you...\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nThat was your first thought, it didn't apply\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nbecause you were one of two women that came up on stage.\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nAnd then the...\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nRight.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000\nBut it is a thing, like, women get on stage with you.\n\n01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000\nShe's like the Phantom of the Opera.\n\n01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000\nI guess.\n\n01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000\nWell, if I asked her to keep talking,\n\n01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nand then we mock her when she talks to them,\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000\nwe're like, kind of...\n\n01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nHow did you feel about how we treated the dude that was on stage?\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nBecause I don't feel like I was that nice to him.\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nBut there's also two different things.\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000\nIt's like, well, we brought Pam up.\n\n01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nI thought that was a really inspired choice on Josh's part.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000\nAnd we didn't...\n\n01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nWe didn't, like, look at Pam and go,\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nlet's talk about dicks, baby.\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nLike, I don't know.\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000\nWe were, like, random drunk.\n\n01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000\nBut the thing is, we bring Pam up,\n\n01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000\nand it's three men who are comedians\n\n01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nwho are like, just can't wait to get a joke.\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000\nAnd so we're not really giving Pam full, like, time to...\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nAsk me something, then.\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nWell, let's ask Pam stuff.\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nYeah.\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nAbout what?\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nI said that.\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nWhat are you listening?\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nWow.\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000\nIs he a chauvinist monster?\n\n01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000\nFuck you.\n\n01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nYeah, the race for the high road.\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000\nPam, Pam, it gets boring real fast.\n\n01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000\nYou moved here because your husband was coming\n\n01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nto take an acting class.\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000\nYeah, that's right.\n\n01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nSo that's ambitious.\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000\nLike, you didn't move her because someone had a career.\n\n01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000\nHe had a possible career.\n\n01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nYeah.\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nDid that Pam out for him?\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.000\nNo, he quit after a couple of years.\n\n01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000\nBut he did acting for a while.\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nAnd then he did what a lot of actors do and became a teacher.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nI love that you thought, oh, what?\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000\nWe've got to talk about something,\n\n01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nand then you asked her about her husband.\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000\nThat's why I asked it.\n\n01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nBecause Pam went.\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nBecause she moved here.\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nYou moved here because of your man.\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.000\nBut did you have ambitions when you came to Sydney\n\n01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nof your own?\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nAn equal ambition.\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nBut it was his getting interneited that decided it,\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nthat gave us the positive momentum to do it.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nBut I was very happy to move to Sydney.\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000\nAll right.\n\n01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000\nI think I can get this up to some higher ground.\n\n01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nIt's a long time ago.\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nPam, didn't you think it was romantic when Russell Crowe\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:59.000\ntook Steve Irwin's widow into his own?\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000\nDid he?\n\n01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nI didn't know that.\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nI thought I read something about that.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000\nWhat did he do with her?\n\n01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nThat's not true?\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000\nRussell Crowe and Steve Irwin's wife?\n\n01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nWhat?\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nWhat did he do?\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nI don't know what Russell Crowe has done lately.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nWell, that's interesting.\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nWhat makes it back to the States?\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000\nWell, I don't think...\n\n01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000\nI didn't hear you say anything.\n\n01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nI didn't hear you describe an action.\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nI thought he was getting married to her.\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000\nTo who?\n\n01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000\nSteve Irwin's widow.\n\n01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000\nNo.\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000\nI'm happy to be wrong about it.\n\n01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000\nI think it's disgusting.\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000\nI was also...\n\n01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nI didn't have an opinion about it.\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nI thought it was a real thing.\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nI'm just worried that you think we were talking over Pam\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000\nbecause she's a woman.\n\n01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000\nBut it's just when you bring someone on stage,\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nyou talk over them so that they don't feel...\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000\nNo, we're...\n\n01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nI have more questions for Pam.\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000\nWe can solve this problem.\n\n01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nPam.\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000\nYes?\n\n01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nWhat do you think of these hotel rooms where the...\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000\nWhere you have to have your key in a slot\n\n01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nin order for the fucking power to be on...\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nIs that green?\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:02.000\nOr is that bullshit?\n\n01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nI haven't stayed in that many hotels where I've had that,\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\nbut it's something you've just got to get used to.\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\nI presume it's for the benefit of energy saving\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000\nor something or other.\n\n01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000\nYeah.\n\n01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nOr that's what the Patriarchy said.\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nVery reasonable response.\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nJust going to change your behavior.\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000\nPam, I have a question for you.\n\n01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000\nIf you were in a room and there was two doors,\n\n01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nand in front...\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.000\nNow I'm going to try and kill you.\n\n01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000\nI was going to do the labyrinth riddle.\n\n01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000\nAll right, I have a question.\n\n01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nPam.\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nThey know a lot about pop culture.\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000\nNo.\n\n01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nBut we don't.\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000\nNo.\n\n01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nPam.\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000\nYes.\n\n01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nDo you think that passport theft is a thing in hotels?\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nLike, if I leave my passport on the end table,\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nlike, what's somebody going to do?\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nTake my passport and then they're going to...\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000\nI'd never leave my passport anywhere that I did.\n\n01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nYeah, I don't want to...\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nWhat do you think someone's going to do with it if...\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nI don't know how to be a traveler like you guys,\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000\nprobably are.\n\n01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nYou're probably staying in a hotel all the time.\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000\nDon't put yourself down like that, Pam.\n\n01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nQuite everywhere I am.\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nWhat is the thing that a passport thief is gaining\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nby stealing the passport?\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nDoes it make fake passports?\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nDoes this have a definite answer or are you just asking my opinion?\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000\nYeah, just a guess.\n\n01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nOkay.\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nI don't know.\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000\nI guess we're all afraid of identity theft.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nRight.\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nCan't be good for someone to have your passport.\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nBut is a passport valuable to a stranger?\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nYes.\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000\nThis guy's got his hand up.\n\n01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000\nHe's so excited.\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000\nThere's a huge...\n\n01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nI like the idea that someone knows how...\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000\nNo one's a boy.\n\n01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nYou can't ask a boy.\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000\nOh, oh, oh, okay.\n\n01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nGot it.\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nSorry, you're not allowed.\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000\nWe've had too many boys.\n\n01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000\nOkay.\n\n01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000\nAll right.\n\n01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nOkay.\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000\nWell, okay.\n\n01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000\nPam, if you don't have an opinion about this,\n\n01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000\nI'll ask that guy, but he'll keep his seat.\n\n01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nDo you really want the boomerang to come back?\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000\nThat's...\n\n01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000\nI understand.\n\n01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000\nAre we being racist here?\n\n01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000\nNo.\n\n01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nYou can't do anything right today.\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000\nI'm safeguarded from this.\n\n01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nIf you internally have those compartments,\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000\nI'm just like, ha-ha, Australians.\n\n01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nAustralians get very uncomfortable.\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000\nI think like, if the boomerang doesn't come back,\n\n01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nyou succeeded, right, if you're a good boomerang thrower?\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000\nYeah.\n\n01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000\nIs it supposed to hit something and then come back?\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nReally?\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nThe majority said no.\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.000\nHow can it come back?\n\n01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000\nSo it's like, you have a go, you miss, it comes back,\n\n01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nyou have a go, you miss, it comes back, you have a go,\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nyou hit, you don't need to throw it.\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000\nSo it doesn't come back.\n\n01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nThat's what I was just saying.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nSo it's like, doesn't matter if it doesn't come back,\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nbecause you're finished,\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000\nbecause you already sell some bills.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nYou don't want the boomerang to come back.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000\nHow do boomerangs don't come back?\n\n01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nHuh.\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000\nWhat do they do with their drone properly?\n\n01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nAnd if you don't hit something.\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000\nIf you made a boomerang with a leading edge of it,\n\n01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nit was like razor blades, it could go straight through\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000\nlike the neck of a thing and keep coming back.\n\n01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nPam.\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nLike odd job at Goldfinger.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nWe can move on.\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nThat's clearly too controversial a topic.\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nYou're sophisticated people.\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nYou deserve better.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000\nPam.\n\n01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nPam, have you downloaded Mario Run?\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nOh, what?\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nThat's not going to come back.\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nYou're going to kill someone.\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000\nThat's not going to come back.\n\n01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nRight.\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nYeah, it's not going to come back.\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nRead the sticker.\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nIt comes back.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nIt comes back.\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000\nMade by Jimmy James.\n\n01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nJim learned this craft from his grandfather,\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000\nwho grew up among originally elders in Central Queensland,\n\n01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nto throw, hold vertically with rounded side facing you.\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000\nThrow with a flicking action, 30 degrees to the oncoming wind.\n\n01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nMade in Australia.\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.000\nEverybody reach under your seat and put your safety goggles on.\n\n01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nThey tell you to throw it in the oncoming wind.\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000\nThrow anything into oncoming wind and it'll come back.\n\n01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nOh, shit.\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000\nNow, you guys just want me to throw, it could be a planted plant.\n\n01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nIt's not going to...\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nWell, they said...\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nDo you have a girlfriend?\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nShe's not going to be happy when she finds out about this guy.\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000\nPam, she doesn't better than I do.\n\n01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nPam, you don't have to have an opinion,\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nbut you're welcome to have one.\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nIf I were to have a baby with my girlfriend, Cody,\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000\nwhat do you... should we name her Forensic Heller\n\n01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000\nor Cody's Baby?\n\n01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000\nWe love forensic files.\n\n01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000\nWhat's the last name going to be?\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000\nCody's.\n\n01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000\nWell, Cody's Baby Harmon, I think, would be...\n\n01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000\nThe last name would be Harmon. Let's just say that.\n\n01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000\nIt's just Cody's.\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nYou really got to practice saying it.\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nI'm also a teacher.\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nAnd you got to practice saying the name\n\n01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000\nand not end up with a name\n\n01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000\nthat the kid's going to be embarrassed by\n\n01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000\nand want to change or is very similar to somebody else's.\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nYou got to be unique but not stupid about it.\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000\nSo Cody's Baby.\n\n01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000\nPam's?\n\n01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nVery good at not answering questions.\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000\nWhat do you teach and what level?\n\n01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000\nI teach high school.\n\n01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000\nReally? How many years?\n\n01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000\nHow many years have I been teaching?\n\n01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000\nToo many to add up.\n\n01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000\nYou're not teaching math, apparently.\n\n01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000\nNo, I don't teach math.\n\n01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000\nWait, so that...\n\n01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000\nOkay, Barry, the lead, you're a teacher.\n\n01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000\nWe had a teacher up last night.\n\n01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000\nYou didn't just steal his job idea, did you?\n\n01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000\nNo.\n\n01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000\nSo how old is the oldest kid you're teaching?\n\n01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000\nProbably 17.\n\n01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000\nSo you've seen the worst of humanity.\n\n01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000\nYou've had every reason to turn your back on it.\n\n01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000\nNo, I don't see it like that.\n\n01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000\nWell, what's your secret? How do you not see it like that?\n\n01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000\nBecause you're there with them.\n\n01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000\nIs that the secret? If we knew them, we wouldn't be afraid of them?\n\n01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000\nI teach subjects that most kids like learning.\n\n01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000\nWhat do you teach?\n\n01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000\nI teach design and technology.\n\n01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000\nOh, cool.\n\n01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000\nWhich is not learning how to fix computers and stuff.\n\n01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000\nIt's using technology for design.\n\n01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000\nOh, okay.\n\n01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000\nSo they're coming in in a good mood.\n\n01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000\nYeah, they do. They enjoy the lessons.\n\n01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000\nBut they still disrespect you if they felt lack of...\n\n01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000\nYou're dealing with pubescent primates.\n\n01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000\nYeah, I'm pretty used to it now.\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000\nYou're quite a hard guest because we really want some pain and some misery.\n\n01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000\nBut every time I ask a question, it sort of seems quite nice.\n\n01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000\nAll your answers are really lovely.\n\n01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000\nYou want me to be in pain and misery?\n\n01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000\nProbably, yeah.\n\n01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000\nI have some sort of nitty gritty like,\n\n01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000\noh, no, my husband would be good, wouldn't it?\n\n01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000\nHe doesn't know I'm here. I know that.\n\n01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000\nI support him and I like my job.\n\n01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000\nIt's sort of hard for comedy, isn't it, when someone's happy?\n\n01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000\nI might be acting.\n\n01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000\nWell, usually what we do...\n\n01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000\nI'll go like, oh, who's having a terrible time tonight?\n\n01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000\nBut we don't want them to come up and talk about how terrible things are.\n\n01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000\nI think we hope for, like, silver linings and things.\n\n01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000\nObviously, the terrible thing that happened is she was yanked up here,\n\n01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.000\nand the silver lining is that she's quite happy, so that's already worked.\n\n01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000\nIt's worked. It provided me with a good job.\n\n01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000\nIf you want to go, if you don't feel comfortable, you could definitely go.\n\n01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000\nYeah, we don't want to make you uncomfortable.\n\n01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000\nYou should've went somebody else up.\n\n01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000\nDo you regret me picking you?\n\n01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000\nNo.\n\n01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000\nAs it's been a good experience?\n\n01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000\nYeah, fine.\n\n01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000\nI hope so.\n\n01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000\nIt's not...\n\n01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000\nPam, I hope so.\n\n01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000\nYeah, yeah, I'm pleased to have met you.\n\n01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000\nPam, Josh and I are gonna...\n\n01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000\nThis is how we're gonna...\n\n01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000\nYou work in the theatre because you love it.\n\n01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000\nYou've seen shows here, there's shows you haven't seen here.\n\n01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000\nIs there a theatrical performance that Josh and Jeff and I can do\n\n01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000\nthat would, like, fulfill your fantasies?\n\n01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000\nLike, what hasn't shown here or whether it's...\n\n01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000\nYou can either pitch something new or...\n\n01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000\nYou mean you perform it?\n\n01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000\nRight.\n\n01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000\nBut don't imagine me performing it.\n\n01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000\nImagine what you'd like to see and then I'll ruin it.\n\n01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000\nGod.\n\n01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000\nThere's always Shakespeare.\n\n01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000\nRight, okay.\n\n01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000\nDone.\n\n01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000\nDone and done.\n\n01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000\nYou should know I'm not educated.\n\n01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000\nThat's because you're from Brisbane.\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000\nOh.\n\n01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000\nI will clear this opera house.\n\n01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000\nI will clear this opera house.\n\n01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000\nI just saw that girl that got so mad at me before climbing.\n\n01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000\nYeah.\n\n01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000\nYou guys...\n\n01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000\nYeah, well, yeah.\n\n01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000\nAnything you like that Pam does, I made happen.\n\n01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000\nHe's the Phil Spector of Pam.\n\n01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000\nRight, he discovered her.\n\n01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000\nHe made her.\n\n01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000\nWhen he found her, she was just over there in the darkness.\n\n01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000\nBut, you know, anything you would like to see,\n\n01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000\nyou don't have to...\n\n01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000\nDon't try to confine yourself to my dumb game.\n\n01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000\nShe said Shakespeare.\n\n01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000\nRight, well, okay.\n\n01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000\nYou're right.\n\n01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000\nShe did and I forgot because I'm drunk.\n\n01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000\nOkay.\n\n01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000\nAnything specific?\n\n01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000\nWhat's your favorite Shakespeare production?\n\n01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000\nOh, there's been a really good Othello
