00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello, one and all, from beautiful uptown Burbank Harmontown is now in session.

00:18.000 --> 00:42.000
Hello, gang, please welcome to the stage the Game Master extraordinaire Spencer Crittenden and the mayor of Saffa Faire, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you. Thanks. Hello, Dan. Hi. You're looking good. I told you backstage, but I'm going to say it again. You're looking good.

00:52.000 --> 01:06.000
Thank you. I'm wearing a head to toe bomb fell. They're a sponsor. Really? Clothes from the mail. For the mail. They don't have women's clothes. It's not controversial.

01:06.000 --> 01:20.000
You can wear them if you're women. I'm assuming. I wouldn't stop you. It's not yental. I got no beef with women dressed like guys. I applaud them.

01:20.000 --> 01:31.000
Especially in the shoe department. I don't like high heel shoes. If I find myself distracted by high heel shoes, I worry about the woman's comfort. It's not because I'm a good person. I just worry about it.

01:31.000 --> 01:44.000
I was in a little bit of a bad mood last week. The reason why you said were you guys here for the show last week, even if they were, they have to pretend they weren't because I told them I hated them.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
So if they admit that they were here in the back, they have to admit to low self-esteem.

01:50.000 --> 02:07.000
As somebody who's at the show live, obviously, it's a different experience to watch it than to hear it, but I heard that one. I could imagine what it was like there. You seem a little grumpy that last show.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
Was there anything particular that happened or were you just in one of those moods that happens because the world is a crazy place right now?

02:14.000 --> 02:28.000
There are several theories. A lot of people go with Occam's razor, no pun intended, and they think it's the mustache. They think the mustache has changed me.

02:28.000 --> 02:46.000
But I think it's Twitter withdrawal. I was talking to my therapist about it. I had a similar thing during the divorce. It was through no fault of Aaron's and no statement about the marriage at all because my therapist warned me.

02:46.000 --> 02:59.000
He said, it doesn't matter when you divorce one thing that you should be aware of. You're going to find yourself hyper-vigilant about injustice. I've talked about this in a podcast. I was like, okay, I'll keep an eye on that.

02:59.000 --> 03:21.000
It was like sending these insane text messages to the guy who cleans my fish tank. I'm accusing him of making my life into an Edward Albee play. I'm like, this is some Virginia Wolf shit. You need to tell me how to work this light.

03:21.000 --> 03:35.000
It was crazy. It was erratic behavior because there was a detachment. Twitter, we don't want to admit, or I don't want to admit, I'll speak for myself. A lot of healthy people are using Twitter very healthily.

03:35.000 --> 03:53.000
But as you probably know, I was really fixated on it. So I quit it for a little bit. I stopped having that outlet for that justice stuff. I find myself snapping particularly.

03:53.000 --> 04:16.000
Now it's about the world. I'm scared of burps, but fuck you, I don't care what you think. The delivery guy from Booze Philly, Cheese Steak didn't bring both raspberry iced tea snapples, and I just went all Paddy Chayefsky about it.

04:16.000 --> 04:30.000
I just fucking like Robert DuVall out. Only to Cody though. And because Cody is like, the amazing thing is, there's like a scientific experiment here where you can say, Dan, are you crazy?

04:30.000 --> 04:50.000
Maybe we can test it if you have, let's say, a perfect girlfriend. Or let's not say perfection doesn't, we don't look for perfect people. We don't want to be with perfect people. But I'm saying a relationship, which there's nothing on the Wheel of Fortune credit.

04:50.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm like, what a metaphor. That was my favorite thing about the last week's show, and Eddie Pepper said, that metaphor didn't work.

05:01.000 --> 05:22.000
Eddie, don't, no, you're not allowed to. But Spencer goes, wait, you can say that? We could just say that metaphor doesn't scan? No, you cannot. Not if you want the family to stay together. That's like, no, no, we don't talk about dad's drinking or his metaphors.

05:22.000 --> 05:31.000
I mean, if you want to move forward and have to molt, but it could end up with you spending your uncle's place for a while. Try to fix the Wheel of Fortune thing you were talking about.

05:31.000 --> 05:42.000
Well, I was just like, in Wheel of Fortune, they would spin the wheel, and then sometimes they would put something on a count or something. They would say, can I put that on a count?

05:42.000 --> 05:56.000
And then Pat Sajek would say, yeah. And then I'd go, what the fuck was that? And then they'd just keep spinning, and then they'd say, I don't know what the hell it was. They would put shit on a count. I'm telling you, it was like an old, tiny grocery store, like in a Coen Brothers movie.

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't remember that at all. I don't watch that show. They just had some shit on a count back there. I'm looking it up later. You know what, I'll do it right now. No.

06:05.000 --> 06:14.000
You know what's crazy? I saw the wheel. That wheel's tiny. It seems huge. The wheel's, like, it's this big.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, you know, this goes with Sajek's, what Sajek said on Letterman back in the 80s when the Wheel of Fortune, the country had Wheel of Fortune media.

06:22.000 --> 06:33.000
Some other things that we fell in love with for like two weeks was like Australia for a while. There were like eight movies about a guy named Crocodile Dundee, and then because it was the only Australian we could find that was like famous,

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
then we tried something with a guy named Yahoo Sirius and everything just collapsed like Enron. Wait, you're selling something that doesn't exist now.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
That's just a big desert. There's no famous people down there.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
We live in a Yahoo Sirius and Jaco-based economy.

06:48.000 --> 07:04.000
Jaco, yeah. There was a guy in Duracell commercials whose catchphrase and soul phrase was Oi. That's all he said. You'd say Oi, and then you'd be at a battery store and you'd go, oh, Energizer, Oi.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
There was an eight-year scare where barbecues were Barbies.

07:08.000 --> 07:16.000
But yeah. Foster's is Australia for beer. All that stuff. Hey, I think Foster's kind of snuck in on that wave and hung out. That's the one thing.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
But they don't even drink that in Australia. That's bullshit.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
What are you telling me?

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
They don't call them shrimps. They call them prawns.

07:25.000 --> 07:50.000
Look, so the delivery guy brings one raspberry iced tea snapple. I didn't know. I thought that that meant I thought because I knew I ordered one. I didn't know. Kordi ordered one. Kordi ordered one. Get your shit together.

07:50.000 --> 08:03.000
Have you ever noticed all those guys that can't speak English? They can't spell. The Republicans. They have no mastery of their mother tongue. And they're yelling at immigrants.

08:03.000 --> 08:12.000
It's like the immigrants are like, I had to learn eight presidents to just trim your bush. This fucking sucks. One of them's bush. That's my mnemonic device.

08:12.000 --> 08:22.000
Two of them are bush. And then you guys raised it to nine presidents because you said that was too easy.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
It was almost too Clinton.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
Almost. And then we had an influx of unqualified bush trimmers.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Snapple.

08:34.000 --> 08:49.000
Snapple. And so I start going. I was happy all day. And then I go get the food. I'm with my perfect girlfriend. I come back up with the paper bag. You can already see the dark spots on the bottom so you know it's going to be good.

08:49.000 --> 08:59.000
It's coming through the bag. The dogs are freaking out. I think there might be a dead skunk in that bag. No, it's Philly cheese steaks.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
And they take them out. One raspberry snapple. That's how much we ordered. Cody says, there's not two iced tea raspberry snapples? No.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
Did they? Are you fucking kidding me? God damn it. What is with this fucking world?

09:13.000 --> 09:31.000
And I just talked for 20 minutes at the top of my voice and that would be charming. But here's something that I do. I kept saying because this is how desperate I was to abuse that I couldn't just share.

09:31.000 --> 09:44.000
I couldn't get at least to just be in a bad mood and share it with my partner. So I just kept saying, but I had nothing to bitch at Cody about. I was just tabulating all the injustices that had happened to me that week.

09:44.000 --> 09:55.000
And because Cody hadn't done anything wrong, I just kept saying, this guy does this to me. This guy. The raspberry snapple. What is with you people?

09:55.000 --> 10:08.000
I just kept saying you people to Cody. You people being the human race. You know all of you. You ate billion of you. You're just always conspiring to fuck with me.

10:08.000 --> 10:18.000
And then she was like, okay, cool. And then we watched the rest of Gremlins 2 or whatever the hell. Everyone's around. You gotta just go check back and check it out.

10:18.000 --> 10:26.000
There was a whole kogan in that. Is it good? Was Gremlins 2 worth a rewatch?

10:26.000 --> 10:37.000
Yeah, yeah. It's worth a rewatch. I don't know about your first question. I don't know. Is anything good? I don't know. It wasn't Citizen Kane. It wasn't even the Citizen Kane of Gremlin moves.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The Gremlins got really specific.

10:39.000 --> 10:50.000
Let me ask you this. When's the last time you watched the first Gremlins? Because I told Cody, I was like, you gotta watch Gremlins 2. She's like, what, 2? I'm like, Jesus, I'm really robbing the Cradle.

10:50.000 --> 11:00.000
And I'm like, well, Gremlins 2. She's like, I ain't seen no Gremlins 1. And I was like, okay, well, great. We'll start with this holiday classic. But then you gotta see Gremlins 2.

11:00.000 --> 11:11.000
So I put in Gremlins 1, 5 minutes in, I'm like, what the shit, and fuck, this movie is garbage. It is amazing. We have a serious problem in this society.

11:11.000 --> 11:29.000
And you can see the thermometer for our sickness is rotten tomatoes. It's like any movie that had some claim on the box office pulse when a certain demographic was 10 years old, it just automatically is way above a 70%.

11:29.000 --> 11:41.000
It's just garbage. There's no comparing this shit. What is it? Solar babies 98%. Because people are like, man, solar babies, man, custody weekend, it was great.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Does solar babies really have a 90 years old?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
No, but I can't think of any examples.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
That would be amazing.

11:47.000 --> 11:58.000
But then you watch something. I know I've talked about this. Lockout. Come on. It's diehard in space. It's great. It has like a 20% or something. It's ridiculous. They worked hard on that movie.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
It's good.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Was it called Lockout?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I don't know Lockout.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
I'm writing that down.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
That's a crime.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
And you know, and tomorrow is...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Charity remember Lockout. We're watching Lockout.

12:11.000 --> 12:22.000
Anyways, like there's a lot of movies with like 80% of rotten tomatoes. They're just crap. And it's just like, it's just people just like, they're just like, I will defend my legacy.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
You gotta go back and watch. If you can't look into your soul, gentlemen, at least rewatch some of these pieces of shit.

12:31.000 --> 12:40.000
You're okay to be nostalgic. Just stop pretending that it makes it a good movie that you liked it. You were a little itty-bitty little dummy.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
I almost said the R word.

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
That last sentence, if you rewind it, you go like, yeah, it seems like Dan's gonna get a little less his famous articulate charm.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Because I was just the whole time. I was like, ah, my sister's retarded.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Okay.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
But now you can just use do-tard.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Do-tard?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Wait, what's do-tard?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Kim Jong-un went 14th century on Trump and called him a do-dard.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh, a do-dard?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah, and everybody was like, what's a do-tard?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I mean, I saw that not on Twitter.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
A do-dard is a great word.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
Like, look, I gotta be honest, 0.1 for fucking Kim Jong-un.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
That's fucking good.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Well, again, these guys have to learn English in schools. He didn't.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Is there a Korean word for do-dard?

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
Did somebody translate that and go, well, he's talking about a senile bewildered old fucker.

13:32.000 --> 13:42.000
In Korean, we have a word for that, but the closest I can get in English is do-dard, which no one has used since Jane Austen.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
But that's fucking good, so fucking yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Like, I like Kim Jong-un a little bit more than our president right now.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:59.000
Because either he spent, he paid a little more attention in English class, or he just, he listens to some of his advisors.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
Also, his haircut, he's one guitar away from being the lead singer of a very successful rock and billy band.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
He looks at me.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I wish he'd go gray, but only in the middle.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
No, he'd be fucking Brian Sesser. He'd be fucking sexy as shit.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That would be incredible.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
He would, yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Okay.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Anyways, he's almost like, you know, he's going to start looking like in his old age.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Kim Jong-un?

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah, he's going to look like Korean Steve Van Sant from the Sopranos.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
Whatever that character, Pauliwal, not Pauliwal, and that's the other guy.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
What was it?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Joey bag of tits.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
I don't know.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, whatever.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
That was, that's half the characters.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
No, he's getting a lip.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Oh yeah, that guy, I know what you're talking about.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Yeah.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And he's been played in Bruce Beakstein's band.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
But that guy doesn't get the lip.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Anyways, god damn it.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Your impressions never cease to amaze me, but...

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't care what you think.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I like him.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Oh, thank you.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Dan, this is not going to be one of those nights where you're feeling persecuted.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
This is a night where you feel safe and you feel happy and protected.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Well anyways, thank you for, this is a sponsor, Bomfell.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm wearing head to toe Bomfell.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
You look good in it.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
It fits you nice.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Lee.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
The pants came, the first pair of pants, they were a number off.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
They didn't get the number off.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I was in the room when he tried them on.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
He actually took his pants off, went down to his skivvies.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Put them in a bag, sent them back, like a Netflix DVD of Gremlin's 2.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Said, this is one Gremlin number off.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
They sent back these Gremlin 1 pants.

15:36.000 --> 15:44.000
And like Gremlins 1, you remember them as being twice as good as the other pair,

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
but inside, it's a mess.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
That movie is a goddamn mess.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
The Gremlins in your head is like a fucking like...

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
It's one of the guild with a sense of wonder.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
It's a Spielberg production, for God's sake.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
And it's a Christmas movie.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
It's a great Christmas classic.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh, and it's just like, oh, the performances and it's just like, oh, it gets you right here

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and then the Gremlins are scary and all the things.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And you just start watching it from the first frame.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
You're like, what kind of weird driver's ed movie is this?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
How many beginnings are we going to do?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
How are you explaining this shit for you fucking idiots?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You shouldn't have made a movie.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Fucking terrible people.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
All right, so here's your billion dollars.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
What are you going to do?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
They make Gremlins 2.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
When are we going to listen?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I tell you I hate you.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You come right back.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I'm like, I'm gremlining you.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm das...

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Gremlining you.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
You're gremlining.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm like, gremlining.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Please don't let that be the title of this episode.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yeah.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Gremlining doesn't really work.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Anyways.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm going to invoke the pepitone.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
That doesn't work.

16:53.000 --> 17:01.000
Anyways, look, I'm not going to say I'm sorry for last week because I am and I'm ashamed.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
But he's not going to another liar.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
If I make an apology, I want to make it the official one where it's like the three parts.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
You acknowledge your crime.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
I told the audience I hated them.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
You express remorse.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I feel bad.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Wait.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Are you allowed to make that face after you say it number two?

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
I feel bad if it made anyone feel bad.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
But that's not one of those apologists.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
I'm sorry you felt bad.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm not doing that.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
I'm saying I do feel bad if anyone felt bad for it because it was the first part is a lie.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I don't hate the audience.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
You make me feel wonderful and you're wonderful people, especially the people that are closest to the people that do come here.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
It was obviously just as with Cody.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
It's like I'm just saying you people to a bunch of people who bother to be close to me when I'm having some kind of like fucking moment of turmoil.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
But I'm also a clown on stage and I don't get the impression that anyone got hurt.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
If you got hurt, I do feel of course bad that it hurt you because it would be a terrible reason to hurt someone because it was a lie.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
And so then the third part is the commitment to change.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
So all right.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
I'm not going to stop drinking.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
When I yelled at Cody because I quit Twitter because I'm like, well, I'm not going to stop drinking.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
I got to change something or this isn't a real apology.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I quit Twitter.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
That wasn't that wasn't that mixing those two things up.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
But I was I did quit Twitter because I was being mean to the people around me on Twitter.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I was like, which is like from what I will see on intervention.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm like, oh, you're a junkie.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
You're like being mean to people because you're like so focused on this fucking thing.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
So then I quit Twitter and then I'm like, now I'm like, now I'm having like these weird highs where I'm like, let's go look at shirts.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
And then and then like these weird lows where I'm like, you people in your iced tea.

18:51.000 --> 19:03.000
And but I'm but I feel like it's like it's it's it's better than what I it's happening because I was having a I was having a problem.

19:03.000 --> 19:13.000
So even though it's resulting in half of the time I'm like a fucking like crazy or the whole time I'm crazy person half of the time I'm an unprofitably crazy person.

19:13.000 --> 19:26.000
Like it still it seems like, OK, well, I'm going to wait and see if that goes like this, like and then what what then I'll be a person that's not on Twitter, but it's also saying.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, it's a weird thing.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Like I just was on tour with, you know, Ryan Stiles and Proups and Joel Murray and the gang.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
And like, we, you know, we have fun and we, you know, we go do comedy shows.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
But on the bus, all we do is vent about what was in the news that day and we get off our chest.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
But then we have to like, like I'm a moody person.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
I go up and down to like, but I feel like my downs are more regular than they used to be.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
Like I'm like I'm in a bad mood more just because of, you know, like just the way things are going right now.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
And it's nice to be able to go out and do comedy shows and make people laugh and tell stupid jokes and stuff like that.

19:59.000 --> 20:07.000
But sometimes it feels almost like disingenuous or dishonest to find any humor in anything.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Like you feel like you're forcing it.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
That's why I was, I was like, yeah, I'm not even being funny anymore.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I'm just like arguing with people about shit.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Like I used to be able to keep my humor about it.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I was like, like that was my rule.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
Like, well, if I can be funny while still letting someone know they're a piece of shit, you know, like,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
then that proves they're a piece of shit.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
If they can't be funnier than me, if they're a piece of shit, then they're like, you know, if I swear, I want to tread lightly here.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
But I say this as an observation of how unfunny they are.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
If a Nazi could ever make anyone laugh, you know, like if there was, if it was possible for them to be remotely entertaining,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
that would be a really dangerous demographic.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
Because they'd be like, they don't, they're, have you ever, ever, ever...

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
They can't smile. They don't have pets.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Hitler had a dog.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
They can't smile.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Hitler had a dog.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Fucking Trump doesn't have a dog.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
He doesn't have a dog.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And so Nazis don't have pets?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Well, Hitler loved his dog more than people.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I know that.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
A lot of people, I mean, a lot of misanthropes are big animal people.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Rob Schrab.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
He's not misanthropic.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh, dude, yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Oh, no, he loves people.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
All right, let's just not, let's not get derailed.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
He loves animals.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I don't think he's...

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Oh, Jesus.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, no, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's get our guest up here.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Oh, fuck yeah.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
My good friend Duncan Tressel.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Duncan Tressel!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It might take him a...

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
Could have used him last week to bring the, is he here?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
He might have to walk in through the other door.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Duncan Tressel.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Oh, yeah.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Oh, oh boy.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Sorry about that.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Sorry about what?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
I lost track of time.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
So that's okay, that means you're doing God's work.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Whoa.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
See, I already made the whole room happier.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Nitrous is always doing God's work.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Well, no, a lot of people used to think that.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
They used to think you could use nitrous oxide to commune with spirits.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
It's, it was actually in, in that book, the brief history of nearly everything.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
Like if you run out of fuel in your ear-beating cannon and you want to really like fuel up

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
and have shit to talk about to just, just beat people's ears into a bloody pulp.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Read that book and apparently some famous scientist was really into nitrous oxide

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
and like used it to commune with angels and stuff.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
So yeah, it is doing God's work to do nitrous oxide.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
I was right.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I had a friend in high school.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
He was the best dungeon master ever.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Was it Graham?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Yeah.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Well, yeah, but if he said, I don't know if he's, he might be lit.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I know.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
You live in the shadow.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
It's fine.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
It's fine.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
But I don't, I don't want to embarrass.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't want to, if Graham was listening, I don't want to embarrass him.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
But, but like he, I, you know, I lost track of him forever.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
And then he like, I was like an adult in Milwaukee and he showed up and he had like a big tank

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
of nitrous in a plastic hefty bag.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And I just, and it was like, we just-

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
The best day of your life.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Sucking on a garbage bag and talking about how I'm destined to lead people or something.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
Is there any deleterious brain holes?

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Oh yeah, it'll fuck you up.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
It's not.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Does it hurt your brain?

23:23.000 --> 23:31.000
Well, what happens is people will make the terrible mistake of putting a nitrous tank

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
in their fucking van, right?

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
They're like, let's go in the van and do nitrous, man.

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
But they leave the tank on while they're doing balloons and they pass out and the van

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
fills up with nitrous oxide.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
They don't die.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
Their bodies vibrate into infinity and they vanish.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
They level up, kids.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
They level up.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
It sounds like dying.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Did you ever see-

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
It sounds like dying.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Did you ever see like a van in van?

24:00.000 --> 24:07.000
Well, I mean, I would say, I would say just to start off, don't have a van.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
But just doing nitrous like hurt your brain and kill brain cells or anything bad?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I mean, dentists give it to you.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
There's competing research.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, but you go to the dentist once or twice a year.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
Am I just a child of Nancy Reagan or just assuming that it gives you brain damage

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
because I heard that somewhere?

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
There's some isolated cases of brain holes.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
It's not like all these people are getting brain holes.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
It's an empathetic. People have been doing nitrous for fucking ever.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
And there's not like brain holes all over the place.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
There's a few isolated cases.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
It's definitely bad to deprive your brain and body of oxygen.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
And I would not be surprised if it did cause, but also that depends on the mixture

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
because if you go like half air and half nitrous, I don't know how bad that is for your brain.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
You know what you sound like?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
A nitrous oxide dealer.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
Oh, no.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I definitely don't have three canisters.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Can we?

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
You sound like I'm negotiating a nitrous oxide deal with a nitrous oxide.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I don't know, man.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
I mean, maybe if we go half your brain will be okay.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
It's $5 a balloon, baby.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
Is it irresponsible podcasting for us to get a tank of some balloons for our next show?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
No.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
No, no.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Let's do it.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh, man.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Oh, I know how to do it too.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I know how to get a tank.

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
Let me answer that question with a question, which is an irresponsible society to elect a rapist Nazi

25:36.000 --> 25:45.000
and then just hang out and watch the world fall apart without doing nitrous publicly?

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
So it's not irresponsible.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
We can do it then.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes, I'm saying this.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
You're signing off on it.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yes, home is burning.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
Let's try Yahtzee if you haven't.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
My advice to everyone, try everything.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yahtzee.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Anything but Yahtzee.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
I got that covered.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Yahtzee.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
You don't need to try Yahtzee.

26:04.000 --> 26:13.000
There's only one lemonade you can get from the lemon of social upheaval, deterioration,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
whatever we think we're experiencing.

26:14.000 --> 26:21.000
The only lemonade is people popping like popcorn, having a little controllable nervous breakdown

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
and going, well, if this shit's happening, I'm going to try making that birdhouse.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Let's talk.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Okay.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
And that guy turning out to be the Frank Lloyd Wright of birdhouses and didn't know it because

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
he was just like, if I keep voting Republican, I'll get rewarded.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
And then he's just like, wait, he said what to who?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm the birdhouse.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Boom.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm a genius.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
I never needed to.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm a Democrat now.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
But the problem, the problem with Frank Lloyd Wright birdhouses is that they look great,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
but they're really uncomfortable.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Well, also the birds hate him.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
The birds hate him because Frank Lloyd Wright's gimmick was like trying to like, you know,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
can you make a home merge with nature?

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
And the bird's like, what the fuck do you think I'm moving in here for?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I wanted a birdhouse.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I want to say the N word so bad.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I want the bird to like sit punctually with the N word.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Just say it.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
No, no.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Wait, look, you just said that you could try anything now that a Nazi maybe isn't one of them.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But you know, I want to talk to you about this.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I'm not going to try.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yatsi.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I want to talk to you about this idea of like Rome burning.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
All right.

27:20.000 --> 27:32.000
I was thinking about today, and I was thinking like, okay, if you have to pick an evil monster to deal with in your life,

27:32.000 --> 27:41.000
would you rather that evil monster to be smart or would you rather that evil monster to be Donald Trump?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Right.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
But I think we've all agreed.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean, we've all had this conversation on each other's podcasts and we've all, we've had nine months to talk about this.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
We've arrived at it.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
It's not really him that's bumming us out.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
It's the reveal of the engine underneath our country that made it possible for him to be elected.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Yeah.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And it's the reaction that everyone's having.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
This is good.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
No, he's swell.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
No, I agree with you.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Yeah, I think we all agree with that.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
But we're like, yeah, if you're going to like, oh, he's like Hitler, but he hasn't done anything yet.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
No, I don't mean that.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
He's funny.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
He's got like clown hair and he's running around.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
But he probably doesn't fart.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
But the fact that we had to move his sphincter to the crown of his head for his weird experimental hair.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
Every time, remember the time when he got up and didn't sign the executive order and he was supposed to sign some shit?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
And he just got up and walked out.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Oh, yeah.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Motherfucker, no, you got to do the thing.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
He clearly pooped his pants.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
He made chocolate poopies and had to get the fuck out of there.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Probably right.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, no.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
At his age, I mean, I shit my pants all the time.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Yeah.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
On the reg, as the kids say.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
On the reg, fam.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Oh, grandpa.

28:53.000 --> 29:01.000
If you get me high enough and I cough and then walk away.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Be glad we weren't carpooling.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
Oh, dear Christ.

29:08.000 --> 29:17.000
But no, I mean, if we thought that we could have just him, but it's what he represents and all that shit.

29:17.000 --> 29:34.000
I think most of us even, we're like, you know what, now it doesn't even matter what if we, if the blue side of this weird two-headed beast now takes advantage of the nauseating.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Right.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
But whatever happens next, we all agree, we're more, we're going to be more bummed out about it.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Universal healthcare.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
But, but it's universal healthcare.

29:42.000 --> 29:57.000
That's what happens is you get this bumbling guy who freaks out all of his underlings into the point of trying to jam through these rotten fucking healthcare bills, alerting everyone in the country.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
This is what happens when you let super wealthy people be in control.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
They don't care about you.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
This isn't a new idea that's been happening since the fucking industrial revolution.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
So you have this nice reminder, look what happens when they start running shit.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
They don't care if you die.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Now everyone knows it.

30:12.000 --> 30:20.000
And then because John McCain has this brain tumor and he doesn't care about getting reelected and he's not in it for politics anymore.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
This guy stops the whole fucking thing, which means we're one step closer to universal healthcare.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
So I'm not saying this is because Trump is like meaning that to happen or good.

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
He's obviously just this, he's exactly what you would imagine the Antichrist would look like.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
But still in that, no really, you know, like if you're really...

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
Don't you, do you guys, does anyone here look at the Bible and check to see if like anyone's the Antichrist?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Because Trump might be the Antichrist.

30:50.000 --> 30:57.000
Well, yeah, last time I checked the Antichrist had a fatal head wound that he recovered from.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
It's like a description.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Is that true?

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah, I tweeted it to you because you were talking about something and I was like...

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Oh.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Because we always, you know...

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I don't always check my Twitter.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
Everybody always thinks the book of revelations is talking about Bill Clinton or whatever.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
You know, like they always update who it's talking about.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Right, yeah, everyone thought Obama was the Antichrist.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
But one thing's for sure, because I was always going like, well, I've read revelations.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
I'm waiting for a guy who gets shot in the head in like a war, but he survives.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
And then everyone, he's like a war hero because it kind of says, I looked and he had a wound in his head.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
And yet he lived or something like that.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I was like, oh God, it's his scalp surgery.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
It's his fucking...

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh, no!

31:34.000 --> 31:41.000
Like if you could, if you were looking at Donald Trump, but you had the X-ray vision provided you by Christ,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
you wouldn't see his fake hair and anything.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
You'd see him as a ghost and aura.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
And you'd see at the top of his head just like Darth Vader.

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
There'd be this like amazing, like fucking weird symbol or something like where this weird doctor tried to twist his head

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
like a fucking end of a sausage to make his sideburns turn into his hair.

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
Something that hurt him enough that he ran into his wife's bedroom and pulled her hair out and yelled at her.

32:09.000 --> 32:17.000
And as she put it, had sex with his semi-hard penis.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Yeah!

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
And then she wouldn't cry in her mom's room for two days and when she came back her hair was still spread on the bed

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
and he was laying there in his bathroom and he said, does it hurt?

32:28.000 --> 32:35.000
So logistically, if we want to do nitrous, do we get tanks and balloons up here?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I know how to do it.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
I know how to do it.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
I know how to get nitrous.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I looked it up, I know how to get nitrous.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
Are we breaking any kind of criminal codes by doing it?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
I know how to do it.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Not if there's a dentist present.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
No.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
You don't need a dentist.

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
So what you do is you apply for a catering license in LA.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
For real?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Yeah.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
And if you apply for a catering license because they have to, I guess caterers are like always making whipped cream or something.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Oh yeah, always.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
They can't get it.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
You can buy a tank of nitrous up here.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
We're talking about how to score, not how to make it legal.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
No, let's say you can buy it.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
You can just buy it.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
I can buy, I can go right now and buy some whipped cream chargers.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
Yeah, you can go buy nitrous little canisters and do whippets.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah, but those are annoying.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
You get these silver things all over your pocket.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I'm just saying, it's not impossible.

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
Legally, we're probably not allowed to do a podcast where we get a few recreational purposes.

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
But if you get arrested for that, that's the coolest way to get arrested.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
There's cool ways to get arrested.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I just, I want to make sure we know who we're getting into.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
I want to get arrested for doing nitrous oxide on harm intent.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
All right, let's fucking do it.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
I want to get dragged downtown.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Like the Van Halen video.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
We're in towels for no reason.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Panama!

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Look it up.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
And look up that thing where he pulled his wife's hair out of her head.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
They wore towels in Panama in the video?

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
I think, yeah, there was like a shot of David Lee Roth being like,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
and I don't know if it was fake or, it was probably fake.

34:16.000 --> 34:25.000
But it was like David Lee Roth in a towel being pulled from a hotel by cops or something.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Oh boy, that's a score.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I think it was Panama, yeah.

34:29.000 --> 34:36.000
Anyways, look, what about that girl in intervention who inhaled the keyboard cleaner stuff?

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Is that, what's the keyboard cleaner?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
That's not the same as doing nitrous.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
No, that's got to be some kind of other chemical.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So she was fucking herself up.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
She still made it through.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
She emerged, you know, I watched the reunion specials.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Yeah, right, but yeah, I wonder where she's at now, man.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
That's like the top, that's all the intervention fans' favorite episode because she's just...

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
I'm living the dream!

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
There's a gif of her where she's like,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I feel like I'm walking on sunshine.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
It's so disturbing.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
There's a cleaner specific to keyboards?

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
Well, it's like circumference keyboards.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Oh wait, I've got a great story about this, man.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
Computer cleaner, like a blast scare.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Oh, I got you, yeah.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
I have some friends in New York who sublet their apartment to somebody

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
and they got a call from their landlord and their landlord's like,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
hey, you need to come back and they're like, why?

35:36.000 --> 35:43.000
And he's like, well, because the person you sublet your apartment to is dead on your couch.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
And so they come back to the fucking apartment

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
and this guy is surrounded by keyboard cleaner.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
Like, he went to Target and bought, I guess,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
a thousand dollars worth of keyboard cleaner

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
and committed suicide via keyboard cleaner

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
and he had melted into their couch.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
So it's just this like purple, bloated, melted corpse

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
surrounded by Target bags and keyboard fucking cleaner.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
What a dick!

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
That's bad subletting.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
That's like, come on.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Whatever happens, it matters.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
There's so many better ways to live.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
You're a guest in their house.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Asimov's four laws of subletting.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
First, do no cleaners.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
How do you do?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Clean.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
You just inhale it?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Yeah, I guess you inhale it.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
You would, I don't know, maybe they put it in a bag

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
and breathe it out of the bag, I'm not sure.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
She was just sucking on a straw.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And she had burns on her lips.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
I think you want the propellant or whatever that liquid stuff is.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I think it's that chemical that they're into.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
But who knows?

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
They're bottom lines of the intervention episode

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
that they were going to call the animal control

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
because she had cats that she loved

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
but they were worried about her cats.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
So I was like, you know, an intervention,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
you had to try to find these bottom lines and leverage and stuff.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
So they pull the trigger on it

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
because she walks out of the intervention

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and they're like, all right, call the cops,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
call the animal people, but the cats,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
the cops come to her door

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
and she's like hanging out in her bedroom with her sister

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
and then someone says like, hey, the police are here

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
and she goes like, the po-po?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Hey, can I say something kind of self-indulgent

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
just to add to something that you said before I came out?

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
You said this thing, and you're not on Twitter anymore,

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
you said this thing, I don't even...

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I'm not going to quote you right to forgive me,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
but you said something else, I don't feel like making people laugh.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I'm down more than I'm up.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
And you know, man, this is really cheesy.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Maybe somebody could play the national anthem while I say this,

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
but I feel like the moment people like you and you

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
start getting like that,

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
then if there really was some kind of nefarious cobble

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
of evil people who wanted to destroy art on planet Earth

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
by making artists feel completely hopeless,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
then the moment you guys are like,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I'm not going to go on Twitter anymore,

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm not going to do this shit anymore, they fucking win.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
They're really winning then,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and then the thing that you guys put out in the universe

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
gets thwarted by what?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Some fucking like, what?

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Like really, that's depressing to me.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That's part of the bummer of walking away for a minute,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
and it's also part of the hook that keeps you there,

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
but the nice different split is just began off the white

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
and like go away, evolve, come back.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
I'm not going to... I didn't delete my account.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Twitter doesn't have to be a factor in it.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
The beauty of being on tour,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I was on the road for the last couple of weeks,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
is that when you wake up in a bad mood and you turn on the news

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
and it's just like, it's shocking and it goes against everything you believe in.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
Just simple things like his ties and his fucking, you know,

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
like the misuse of the English language and all that shit.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Forget about the hatred of women and people of color

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and fucking every fucking other thing.

39:20.000 --> 39:26.000
The great news is that we have to like stay focused enough

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
to go on stage and still be funny,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
and then the fact that we get to go do that is awesome.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
And because when we're on stage, that's the easiest part of the day.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Like then to go out there and you know, just tell a dick joke.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Make the world happy.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Sure, yeah.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
We can't just all descend into sadness and darkness.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
No, you have to double fight.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
It's like that's the thing.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
It's like not only do you have to like not descend into sadness and darkness,

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
you have to like triple activate.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Like the whole point is like to go the opposite direction,

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
even though it is bleak and horrible.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
I mean, it's always seems like God forgive me, man,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
because there's no job of a comedian or job of anybody else

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
or job of comedy or any of that bullshit.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
But just from a basic like when the darkness grows,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
then that's when you're really supposed to be shining the light.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Praise God.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
And if you're not fucking doing that, then what are you doing?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Exactly, I agree.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
The thing about like now, like if you're going to be a comedian,

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
community should stick to comedy and leave politics to the experts.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Well, there are no fucking experts.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
Like politicians should stick to politics and not do comedy.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
But when you go on stage and you tell a joke, it's really funny.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Like we were in Indianapolis.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
You can talk shit about Mike Pence because they hate him in Indianapolis.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
You go outside of Indianapolis, they love, it's a red state.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
They love him there.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
But you can hammer on fucking Mike Pence in Indianapolis.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
But the thing is when you tell of really,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
let's say it's not even a political joke,

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
you just mention him or say something stupid.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
People don't feel comfortable laughing about anything political.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
I know that like no one wants to hear Dan and I or our guests or Spencer

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
and us talk politics about Trump.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
We don't have anything new to say.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's just us grousing about the same old shit.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
But when you do a show like, we go out and do improv and do comedy,

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
you can tell some neutral joke and mention Donald Trump or mention Nancy DeVos

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
and mention whoever.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
People that might have laughed don't know who they're sitting next to

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
and they don't know if the person next to them is going to be really into that

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
or not into that or whatever.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
Everyone is just kind of neutralized and things don't get to be as funny

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
because no one knows if their parents are going to be pissed off

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
or the neighbor is sitting next to them or whatever.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Like comedy, you either have to be not talking about politics at all

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
and be hilarious or be Lenny Bruce and be punk rock and George Carlin and shit

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
and like fucking be so, so active.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
You're a comedian.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I mean, that's the idea.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
It's like fucking.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
The idea is like, okay, fine.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
My instincts are telling me this is funny.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
And I'm in some stupid time period where people are incredibly confused.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Okay, fine.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
We'll still blast it out there, man, blast it out there

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
because the moment any of us stop blasting it out there,

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
then if they're, then they win.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
Right, but they win if you keep blasting and you, in my opinion,

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
at least this goes for me.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
There's people out there that are good at being angry

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
and we want them to be angry.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
But I, like if I've lost my humor,

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
then what am I going to fall back on my political science degree?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Look what Jimmy Kimmel just did.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
No, Jimmy Kimmel, what he did is he either read,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
he fucking researched and it was like, that's my point.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
Like it was like, that's why I'm like,

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
I need to fucking step out of this professional wrestling ring,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
stop running around with a folding chair

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
that looks identical to everyone else's

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
and just being part of the general melee

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
because part of what the enemy wants you to think is that life sucks

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
and that it's chaotic and stupid and all that stuff.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.000
So that is why when Lauren Ducca tweets,

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
when my hero's on Twitter right now,

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
they're the people that are like, they have this insight

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
but then they're also like, they have this grace

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
and then you go like, oh, that's an advertisement

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
for being on the good guy's side

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
because it's not that this stuff isn't important

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
and shouldn't make you angry,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
it's that if you're a billboard,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
you can't be a billboard dripping with shit

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
because then everyone's like, well, I don't want to buy that razor,

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
it's covered in shit.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Like that person's not happy.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Like that person keeps telling me,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
people give me advice all the time,

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
like for 40 years, the reason why I haven't quit drinking yet

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
is because everyone that's ever asserted it

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
with any degree of assertion is they're miserable.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It's always a deal breaker.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm like, look, man, come up to me.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Chris Hardwick's like the biggest billboard for sobriety

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
I've ever encountered.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
He's genuinely a happy, seeming guy.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
But behind his eyes, I think maybe he goes home

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
and does stuff to...

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
There's fucking...

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
That's none of my business.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
I've been to his place and there's target bags

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
fucking everywhere.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
But he...

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I'm just saying, I don't know what's in those bags.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
But he's like the most pleasant...

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Anyway, I'm just saying,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
if you're telling people to lighten up

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
or if you're telling people to...

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
You really ought to know your facts.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Whenever you're telling somebody else what to do,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
like, holy shit, you better be happier than them.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Yeah, but with comedy, man,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
the thing I always love about it is not so much,

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
it's like ethical compass or moral compass.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
What I love about it is the way it warps reality.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And I love the way that, like with comedy

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
and a really great, great comedians,

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
what they do is, regardless of anything other than just this,

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
and now this is not to say, this is how we should act.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
Comedians should only be funny or comedians should not be funny now or whatever.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
I'm just saying, the moment you encounter great art,

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
whether it's comedy or a painting or a movie,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
you feel hope.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Because you're like, humans are fucking cool.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
That's amazing.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
You start watching comedians warp what's happening right now

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
in any kind of way at all that's successful.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
No matter how lofty or how mundane,

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
I think it adds to the sum total of joy in the world.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
And the more joy there is in the world,

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
I just got back from Burning Man.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
The more joy there is in the world,

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
the more chance we have to make sure that we don't do this again.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
And that's why it's important to fucking fight.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Thank you.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Thank you.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
I said Nancy Divos, I meant Betsy Divos.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I'm still wondering if it's Lauren Duca.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
Half the time I say Lauren DeLuca.

45:50.000 --> 45:58.000
No, I don't think we're disagreeing on any important points, right?

45:58.000 --> 46:05.000
I mean, you're saying it's important to be,

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
you're saying it's important to be, for entertainers,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
that word seems cringe-worthy,

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
but like, they become important.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I mean, this Kimmel thing, the fact that I'm not on Twitter

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
and I heard about the Kimmel thing,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
is why Jimmy Kimmel did a good thing.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
It raises all this awareness.

46:27.000 --> 46:34.000
It's particularly great that it wasn't just some quip.

46:34.000 --> 46:40.000
It was also, on top of it, he was passionate in a funny way.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
It's like making this part of the sideshow,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
the now front and center.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
That's why it's so important.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I agree with all that, and that's exactly why.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
I'm just sitting there, arguing with fucking Nazis,

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
and going like, I block you, I'm gonna block you.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I can't believe over the last couple of days,

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
I started to like Kim Jong-un, the NFL, and Jimmy Kimmel.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Yes, it's the apocalypse, baby!

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
When did quarterbacks become agitators?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
It's fucking amazing.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Glory. That's fucked up.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I can't believe it turns out James Woods,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
when he played Roy Cohn, apparently, was doing it

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
because he thought he was a cool guy.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
I didn't know James Woods was a fucking monster.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
I always think of guys playing monsters

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
when you're casting a monster.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
We need a monster.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Ah, let's get that guy.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Is that an actual monster that shows up?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
A monster performance?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Here we go!

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
You need to do this cocaine, you need to do this cocaine.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Cut! Jimmy, great!

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Wow, you're amazing.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I'm conditioned by Hollywood to expect that guy

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
to act like Tom Hanks as soon as they call cut.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Where's a baby? Let me kiss it.

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
But he's just like fucking slime in a human-shaped cup.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
What you're saying, I think what we're all saying,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
is you can't just be a comedian

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
and go out and tell jokes and have fun now.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
You have to do two things at once now.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
You have to be doing squats and push-ups at the same time.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
You have to still be fighting for what you believe in,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
which is not always going to be funny.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
And then you still have to smile

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and help other people laugh and do that, too.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
It just depends on where you land, man,

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
because it's like some of us believe that like...

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
God damn it, what do they say in Game of Thrones?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Chaos is a ladder!

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
What do they say? Is that the word?

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
But some people just believe that it's like,

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
yes, if you can...

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
What I always loved about comedians

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
is that comedians get to do whatever they want.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
That means that if you want to be completely shallow,

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
have nothing to do with politics

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
and just blurt out some ridiculous thing,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
you can do that, it's okay.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
Also, if you feel like you have some

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
heady thing to say that has no punchline,

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
you can say that, too.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
You're a fucking comedian.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
You represent the part of the human spirit

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
that is unconquerable by the gods,

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
which means that you are ultimately free.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
You can do whatever you want,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
no matter who the president is

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
or who the president isn't.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
No comedian has a moral obligation.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
No comedian doesn't have a moral obligation.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
But any time a comedian successfully pulls off real comedy,

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
they're bending space, if you ask me.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
And that bending of space and time and the paradigm

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
and the Gestalt and the archetypes is a fucking miracle.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
And whenever it happens, people are like,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
holy shit, this is a pretty good universe.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Hurricanes, earthquakes and all.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
And that makes people feel a little more excited about being alive.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And that means that my friend's couch

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
is up with a fucking rotting corpse on it.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Somebody's sucking back nitrous oxide.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I feel like we're just only a couple years away

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
from when art and politics beautifully merge

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
when we have Senator Kid Rock for a guy that's really...

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Because that's where I get back on board.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
We're great. People are great.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
We don't need them.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
That's the main thing. We don't need them.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
We're fine. We're going to be fine no matter what.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
This is fucking Harmontown.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
We're fine. This is supposed to be a cult.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
What happened? We're going to be fucking fine.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Well, we proved it last week.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
Dan told everyone to go fuck themselves and they're still here.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
That's exactly what a cult leader does. Come on.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
Next week, I started revealing that I somehow

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
need to sow the seeds of the...

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
And according to the book of whatever I'm reading,

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
it just shakes out that the age of the girl

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
has to be...

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
It was like 10 years from now

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
because now that we're on live stream and stuff like that,

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
the shots of the audience, you just start noticing

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
that everyone starts wearing the same color.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
We're all wearing white outfits all of a sudden.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Let's do it. Let's all wear white outfits

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
and do nitrous oxide and move to the next level of the show.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
Let's build...

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
We'll do a big art installation

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and we'll build the world's biggest van.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
We'll all get in that van.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
We'll all just start doing nitrous together.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah, I'm glad it all happened.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I'm a big piece of shit in a fucking blowhard.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I've been wrong about everything.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
It's good to start there. It's like a second childhood now.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
I'm like, oh, man, I didn't know what any of that shit meant.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Also, another side of that thing that you're talking about,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
where comedians are like...

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It's good that comedians were basically, after the election,

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
they were like, look, man, I can't...

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
What do you mean, get back to work?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Get back to work doing what?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
What I was doing before was...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
But then, as they're explaining that

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
and having to defend themselves,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
for me, there was this valve in my head

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
where I was like, wait, what's the rest of that sentence?

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Because you need to acknowledge that what you're really saying

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
is that you were kind of happy with the way society was before.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
You know, you did a lot of fucking complaining.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
You constantly acted like you were above everything.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
And because that was like an easier way to...

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I don't know, it was just easier in general.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
It was easier to live that way, easier to be funny.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
And so now, that's another good reason why this happened,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
because I think comics are like...

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Listen, my flowchart, it wasn't...

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
When I woke up in the morning and looked at a newspaper,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
then put it out of my head and put my clown shoes on,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
my whole thing was that I lived in the world

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
that we were living in together

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
and also was entertaining you

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and was able to say whatever I wanted.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Don't tell me to get back to work and ignore what's going on.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
But there is that interesting part.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
It's like, oh, because you weren't talking about politics before.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Not that you should have,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
but it's interesting then to retroactively go like,

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
oh, jeez, I guess I liked my bipartisan fucking technocracy.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
I liked my oligarchy.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
I liked my thinly veiled or thickly veiled fascism.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
I liked my right of center...

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Well, I'm glad you have made that at least.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
...first world empire where my toilet paper was soft

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
because somehow indirectly it was softened with air of blood.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
It was like, oh, man, this feels so extra.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's never been proven. It's never been proven.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
But somehow there's a way to prove it.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
I'm sure there was a time when British colonists here

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
were like, this is great.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
You know, we're paying a lot of taxes.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
This is okay.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Oh, man, can you imagine the fucking arguments back then?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Because it's like you were committing treason for real

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
if you were patriotic.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Yeah, you were a terrorist.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
But you realize it's like, okay, so you and I are the same age,

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
which means that we have lived for our entire lives

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
without the fear of the draft.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
So we've lived our entire lives with these kind of like

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
outrageous American wars that happen.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
American wars are really interesting because in most other places

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
when there's a war, it's like an actual bar fight.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You hit the person, they hit you back.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
An American war, we hit the person, they don't hit us back.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
And when they do hit us back, if they don't hit us back

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
in a way that we've deemed the right way to hit us back,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
then we call them terrorists.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
So that's an American war.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
So we've been living in a time period where every single city

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
that we've lived in, thank God, has not been bombed.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I guarantee you don't know what a bomb smells like.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
I sure as fuck don't.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Don't fucking high road me.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
I'm gonna high road you bitch!

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
I grew up in Milwaukee.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
That's like the Belfast of Wisconsin.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Okay, you know what a bomb smells like.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
You know what an M80 is?

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
My friend Tony Schumacher almost took his thumb off.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
Just imagine a lot of M80s. That's what a bomb smells like.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
Well, you also probably don't know what it smells like.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
None of us know, thank God.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Many of us don't know.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
I hope most of us, all of us don't know what it smells like

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
when a bunch of people are on fire together.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
We don't know that.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
That's an American war.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
We set people on fire.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
We blow them up.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
We disintegrate them.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
We're doing it for a very, very long time.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
So now what's happening is that shit's getting weird for us.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
And we don't want it to be weird

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
because we don't want to get pushed into actual action.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Exactly.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
That sucks.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
But guess what?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
You've got to fucking do it, man.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
No.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
You got to.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
You have to.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
I'm old.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
I was almost retired.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
So was George Washington.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
He was a soldier when he was young.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
He couldn't tell a lie.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
I can tell them.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
I still have my teeth.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
I could just slip at almost 45.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
It's like a right age to just shut up

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
and sneak away with your Trey Parker money

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
and just fucking make your cartoon

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
maybe write a Broadway play.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
You're not going to do that with your money, man.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
You're going to use that money for better things.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
And you're going to use that money, first of all,

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
to shelter all of us in some kind of beautiful compound somewhere.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
I have $30,000 in my checking account that is not a lie.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
I have spent all of my money on my shitty cartoon studio.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
But I'm probably going to be a millionaire in a couple weeks

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
because it's just...

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
He looked at his watch.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
He looked at his...

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
He looked at his fucking Apple iWatch

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
because he has the stocks app.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
Come on.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Tesla stocks going up.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I don't have a car, but I invested in Tesla.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Give him some credit.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Cody's still got the Tesla stock.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Wait, wait.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Is that illegal to tell?

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
No.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
That's not insider trading.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't work at Tesla.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
I don't know.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Cody's got Tesla stock.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
He keeps going up, but it's weird when you have a stock in something.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
You hear all these...

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
That's not an interesting topic.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
How many stocks?

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Three.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
I don't...

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
What the fuck?

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Also, you guys, Cody really likes Blue Bonnet at Santa Anita

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
in the second race.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
The Saturdays.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Blue Bonnet.

57:00.000 --> 57:05.000
I got the horse right here.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
The name is Paul Rutherford.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Wait, what were we talking about?

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
What the fuck?

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
I'm sorry.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Fucking revolution, baby.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
We're talking about revolution.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
We're talking about the idea that at some point in history, whether you like it or not,

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
things change.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
This is like...

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
It's no point being a-historic.

57:22.000 --> 57:29.000
If you look at history itself inevitably, black plagues, World War IIs, World War Is,

57:29.000 --> 57:36.000
Vietnam's, things happen, shit changes, and when shit changes, then it's up to us, the

57:36.000 --> 57:44.120
people, to do something about it and to not be so decimated by the reality of history,

57:44.120 --> 57:49.500
which is that sometimes bad people get in the office and do rotten fucking things, and

57:49.500 --> 57:55.760
our job is not to pay attention to whatever the current laws of the land are, our job

57:55.760 --> 58:03.240
is to get a fucking catering license and to buy fucking as much nitrous oxide as we

58:03.240 --> 58:04.240
can, man.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.440
Man, we gotta do it!

58:06.440 --> 58:10.760
And I would also add, I would also add, if you're still at this late date using toilet

58:10.760 --> 58:12.760
paper with air of blood in it, stop doing that.

58:12.760 --> 58:13.760
You know, just try to do it.

58:13.760 --> 58:16.000
Just get regular toilet paper.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.360
It doesn't really affect the white.

58:19.360 --> 58:23.000
It just irritates our allies and our enemies abroad.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.840
Yeah, no, I mean, thank you.

58:28.840 --> 58:29.840
It's good of you to...

58:29.840 --> 58:32.840
This is a good time to get this boost.

58:32.840 --> 58:35.440
It's like you're running a marathon.

58:35.440 --> 58:40.400
We're very lucky, and realizing that we're lucky is exhausting.

58:40.400 --> 58:42.320
That's how lucky we are.

58:42.320 --> 58:45.360
It's strenuous realizing how lucky we are.

58:45.360 --> 58:46.440
That's hard work.

58:46.440 --> 58:51.520
It's like when I do a little dance, when I rap, and then I'm like two days later, I'm

58:51.520 --> 58:55.600
out of breath, and my doctor's like, what have you done?

58:55.600 --> 58:58.840
You gotta start somewhere, and somewhere is like, holy shit, my whole...

58:58.840 --> 58:59.840
And that's what it is.

58:59.840 --> 59:06.240
It's been, it's almost been a year, and it's like, not everybody's hitting exhaustion points

59:06.240 --> 59:07.240
at the same time.

59:07.240 --> 59:12.680
It's like, I'm just pulling, I pulled into the Twitter pit stop thing, and was like,

59:12.680 --> 59:17.040
I'm doing something wrong out there, like I'm not, because I'm not really doing anything

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
to...

59:18.040 --> 59:23.600
I'm getting angry, and I'm like, for all I know, on some chart somewhere, I'm like actually

59:23.600 --> 59:27.080
helping the bad guy, because I'm just sort of like driving and angry and like screaming

59:27.080 --> 59:28.080
around.

59:28.080 --> 59:32.000
It doesn't hurt that much to pull over for a second, and go like, okay, why am I out

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
there?

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
What am I doing?

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Change the tires?

59:35.000 --> 59:37.560
Go back out there with a fucking monster car.

59:37.560 --> 59:41.840
Some crazy monster mobile or something, that's like you assembled, because you thought about

59:41.840 --> 59:44.640
it for a second.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.640
No promises there.

59:45.640 --> 59:49.440
I'll probably just go back and promote Rick and Morty, but hey.

59:49.440 --> 59:50.840
That's fine too.

59:50.840 --> 59:53.000
A guy like me gets really rich.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.520
I can always be one of those Casablanca guys that's like funding stuff under the table

59:57.520 --> 59:58.520
or something.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.520
Lots of people do that, man.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.400
This venue could be like some kind of like...

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400
Like Rick's Cafe?

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.000
I could just be like, come on, I don't do nothing, give me a loan, you Nazi goofs.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.440
And then like a comic goes up and goes like, fuck, I don't think you should burn people,

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440
because they're not white.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.600
And then they're like, how do you explain this observation comedy?

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.760
Hey, Reggie Watts does what he's going to do.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.760
He's just...

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.760
That's hilarious.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.760
He thinks off the top of his head, but guys, do you think they give me a script beforehand?

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760
I feel...

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760
I feel...

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760
Pardon me, Mr. Harmon.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.480
I find your impression of Humphrey Bogart a little, a little, a little tune New York

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480
Jew.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.080
I feel like I kind of sound like that Nazi from the Vice Video.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.760
I'm like, man, the Jews, ain't got nothing to drink, Jews, except for a son of a lot

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.760
of Jew.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760
I got the Jews in the blanks.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.760
What was that guy doing?

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760
He sounded like Bob Hope.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760
All right.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.760
Sorry, what were you...

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.760
I was going to say that you guys know Dr. Bronner's soap, right?

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760
Yeah.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760
So, yeah, what's really cool about them is...

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760
It's made of Arabs.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760
Dr. Bronner's Stoke?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760
The soap.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760
Dr. Stoke.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.760
Dr. Bronner's soap?

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.760
The shit they sell at like...

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.760
The soap that has like a political treatise written on the back of it.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760
Yeah.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760
I know nothing about this, but continue.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.760
It's fascinating.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760
The story's fascinating.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.240
So like Dr. Bronner, Emmanuel Bronner, his entire family died in the Holocaust.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:30.160
And he came to the United States, and he like had this like vision basically, he had this

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.160
like message that he wanted to send, and he was like writing, I guess, little pamphlets

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.200
that he was trying to give to people, but he was also making soap, and everybody wanted

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.440
the soap, but nobody wanted the fucking pamphlet with the weird shit written on it.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.760
So he realized, oh, I'll just put the fucking, the things that I'm saying on the...

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760
It's awesome.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760
On the soap.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760
It's pretty awesome.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.120
The interesting thing about that family, the Bronner's family, is they put salary caps

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.360
on themselves, and then they give everything over that salary cap.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360
All right.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360
I don't like where this is going.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360
Where?

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360
Where?

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.360
It's cool.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360
I have $30,000 in my checking account.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.360
I'm 44 years old.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.000
So you're saying that you're getting like $30,000.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
That's where you're at.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I'm saying when there's a million dollars in that account, I'm not going to put a cap

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
on it yet.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.680
I want to see if it can be two.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680
Just for a second.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:27.040
But the point is, the moment you do start figuring out ways to harness money energy

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.040
and not using it just for yourself, you can start doing shit.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.600
What they do is they give money to psychedelic therapy.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.520
They've given, I think, over a million dollars to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.440
Studies just to work on MDMA with PTSD, and they give money to all kinds of groups like

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440
that.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.680
And that is like one form of being revolutionary is actually using your talent to get a bunch

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:56.160
of dough, and then instead of keeping that money, giving that money to implicitly subversive

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.760
organizations that are going to like transform society in their own way.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.440
That's how you really would start creating cool ripples, you know?

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440
There's also-

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440
Give your money away, you pig!

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.440
Tell him to give his money away, people!

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.440
Take it from him!

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.440
I don't have it yet!

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440
I don't have it yet!

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440
I don't have it yet!

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.440
I don't have it yet!

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440
Take it from him!

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440
I'll tweet his address!

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440
You can go to his house!

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.440
He just told us in a week he's going to be a millionaire, so fuckin' yeah.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.440
Can I be one for a week then after that?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440
How do you-

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.440
You have 19 TV shows.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.440
How do you have $30,000?

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.440
I'm paying for all of them!

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.440
You think when you go pitch a show and they say, we'll take it, they give you money?

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440
They take money!

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.440
You have to go develop the show now!

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.940
It's a fuck-up business, man!

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.440
I did a really dumb thing opening a studio.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440
It's like opening a restaurant.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440
It's like, wait, what are you doing?

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.440
You don't see any other restaurants around here?

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440
What are you trying to be?

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440
Sony?

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440
You fuckin' moron?

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440
They owe people money!

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.440
They're Sonyed!

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:59.440
The studios report a loss every year!

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.940
But along the way, I've hooked up with some cool people.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.440
Not hooked up in the millennial sense, I don't know.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.440
I've met some cool people and I like to think there will be shows now coming that I'm excited

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.440
about that maybe wouldn't have existed if I didn't go put my big pumpkin on the table

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.440
or TBS and go like, plus I'll be there!

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.440
Aren't you making that big Rick and Morty money?

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440
Isn't that a thing?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
That's why I'm going to be a millionaire soon.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.440
Can I see your watch?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440
What do you have on there?

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.440
What does it say, an alert?

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.440
It's just a pentagram.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:40.440
It keeps looking at a pentagram, what is that?

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440
A minute ago it was 9-11?

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.440
Yeah, that's what it says, 9-12.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.440
You're one of those guests that they gave the ultimate compliment to.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.440
9-11 came and they didn't say anything.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440
They kind of did.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.440
We were making noise at the time.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.440
What kind of noise?

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.440
General cheers.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:11.440
General cheers are part of a duty.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.440
How's your testicle?

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440
You beat cancer.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.440
Still gone.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.440
Do you still have to go in every six months and make sure they're not coming back or anything?

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.440
No.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.440
They eventually just go, you're free and clear or do they just keep it lengthened?

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440
You can make a decision about that.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.440
You can make the decision based on statistics.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440
You can go in for a certain number of scans.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.440
You can go in for a bunch of scans.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.440
You can go in for as many as you want.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:46.440
Every scan you go for, they're looking at your body to see if the thing is spreading.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:55.440
At one point I realized, I just don't want to keep getting like fucking MRIs and CAT scans and stuff and lung x-rays.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.440
I'm just going to see what happens.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.440
If I die, then I'm going to die of that, I guess.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.440
So far I feel great and everything's fine.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440
If I kick the bucket, forgive me.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440
I told that to him.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440
I'm sorry.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.440
I think if you kick the bucket, the general rule is you're forgiven.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.440
Not all the time, man.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.440
It's a couple of people.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440
Everyone just kind of spits.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.440
The way cancer really fucked me up was not the physical stuff.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.440
The way it fucks you up is it teaches you about impermanence.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.440
That's a really rough thing because it's like we live in a society that doesn't really understand impermanence.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:40.440
I remember before cancer, I'll go and look at my podcast before cancer and I'll just think about the way I was before cancer.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.440
And it's awesome because you're like running around.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.440
You're like, I'm fucking going to live forever.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440
You're reading Ray Kurzweil.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.440
You're like, shit man, I think I really might be one of the people who lived with me a thousand.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.440
They're going to turn racks into computers in 2040.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.440
You believe it.

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:05.440
So it's kind of what's really funny about fucking cancer is it does the exact same thing to you that the IRS does your bank account.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.440
Because everybody has a temporal bank account.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:18.440
So everybody has this like, if you haven't really tasted death, you probably have a bank account filled with all these years.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:23.440
And you run around acting like a fucking trust fund kid because you're like, man, I got this bank account.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.440
It's fucking stocked with years.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.440
You go to the ATM.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.440
You're like, look at all those fucking years, man.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440
That's awesome.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.440
I'm fucking got so many years.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:39.440
And then when you get cancer, you're like, oh fuck, I might overdraft.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.440
I owe 40 years.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:54.440
And what that does to you is simultaneously obviously tragic, but one of the most beautiful gifts of all time.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:08.440
And because what it gives you is this like incredible connection with the now because you're like, you realize like, oh my God, this big fucking lie about how long I think I'm going to live or how long people think they're going to live.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.440
This is just another fucking lie, man.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:24.440
They want you to believe you're going to live to 70, 80 years because if you believe that and you're starting investing in like 401ks and responsible living and you're going to be like, but really the reality of it is, is like, lots of you aren't going to live past tonight.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:30.440
And this is fucking shit.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.440
And there are no doors.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440
That's a cheap joke.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.440
Of course, there's always my way.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:49.440
Yeah, I watched a Jones house documentary and I realized what they did wrong is they didn't just have the they used Kool-Aid.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.440
They didn't just have an open bar.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.440
So good night.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.440
Would have been so much easier for him.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:05.440
You know, you hear those Jones house recordings and you're like, dude, why didn't you just, Jesus, if you really want these people dead that bad and you don't have to do this soft shoe.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440
Yeah, just kill them.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.440
My God, he had to do so much explaining.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440
He's like, come on, don't cry.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440
It's going to be okay.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440
The line.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
You're just dying.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440
That's all the line that gets to me.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.440
This is the line that gets to me.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.440
Mothers, mothers, mothers, stop your children from crying.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.440
We are merely crossing over to the other side.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440
Them first.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440
Yeah.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.440
They can't do you.

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.440
Yeah, that is fucking insane.

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.440
I know somebody who's, wait, who was I just talking to?

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.440
He's like working on a Jones top thing and like, God, now my mind is such a fucking fart.

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.440
Anyways, but yeah, there's documents.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.440
I mean, like, I'm not recommending you go to like a horrible green place, but it's okay.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:10:00.440
I guess, you know what, watch the Ken Burns Vietnam thing too, because I'm going to, because that's one of the things too, is like not to normalize what's happening now, but it actually is a little uplifting to remember or rather know.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.440
I was a little child in 19, I was a baby in 1973.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.440
So, but it's like, they were fucking like, there's a lot of parallels, like just in terms of the national psyche.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:20.440
Like they kind of, people back then were as groovy as they were, because they too, like us, felt like every day could be the last day of America.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440
And they really felt that that's what was at stake.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440
They had a lot of reasons to feel that way.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:30.440
And yeah, and I just watched Network again too, which is taking place at that time.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.440
Network is kind of a gay romp.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:43.440
The jokes that they're doing in the background about how, you know, President Ford's life has been threatened by this and that, they're kind of like, they're just setting the time and place.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.440
It's like, oh God, yeah, we were, the 70s were like a crazy time.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440
Sure.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.440
It's not to say that it's not to normalize.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.440
It's to feel a sisterhood with the 70s.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440
Watch the Ken Burns thing.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440
Watch that.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.440
There's a great documentary on the weather underground that you should watch.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.440
It's really fucking cool.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440
And these guys, they're...

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440
Yeah, you know what else you should watch?

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.440
Spider-Man!

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.440
Something by Jane Austen or something.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.440
No, they're...

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.440
You guys are dumb.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.440
You guys aren't dumb.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440
You should watch.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440
What were you watching?

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.440
Guardians too.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440
Yeah.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.440
Jane Austen didn't write it.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.440
I finally saw Guardians too.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440
I really liked it.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440
Was it good?

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.440
Because I famously kind of, I think I may have let it slip then.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.440
I didn't get the fucking hysteria about Guardians 1.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440
I liked it.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:43.440
So I put off watching Guardians 2 for a long time because I was like, these people are nuts about the Guardians thing.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:50.440
So I don't want to watch the sequel because I felt like there were just so many purple people yelling and I couldn't tell the difference between any of the characters.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440
Sounds like DMT.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.440
Rocket Raccoon deserves more than to have a camera push on him and then say, yeah.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440
That's not clever.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.440
The camera pushes us and you say more than yeah.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.440
So I was like, I don't get this.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.440
This movie isn't like Citizen King.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440
So I watched the second one.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440
I was like, oh man, I love this Drax guy.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440
He's so great.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.440
I love this Raccoon.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.440
I was like, this is really cool.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.440
Wasn't Steve Agee in the second one?

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440
Yeah, he was.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Which I forgot.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.440
And then all of a sudden Steve Agee's just like, amazing.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440
Yeah, that's great.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:25.440
If the apocalypse needed to happen for Steve Agee to be in Marvel movies.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.440
Yeah.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440
Fine, I'll take it.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.440
I'd love to be around Steve Agee in the apocalypse.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440
I don't want Steve Agee to be in every Marvel movie from now on.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440
I hope so.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.440
I haven't seen it yet, but like the stills I've seen, he looks fucking awesome.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.440
Yeah, he's a little space pirate.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:47.440
Oh, but the weather underground, not to be like too preachy or something, but like definitely check it out because it's cool because there's the weather underground.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:54.440
Like Obama would actually get in trouble because he was friends with one of the members, but their motto was bring the war back home.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:00.440
So they actually decided that they were going to start blowing up buildings and they did.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.440
And the way they did it is they would call the building and make sure no one was there because they didn't want them to get killed.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:13.440
But it was an example of an American revolutionary movement that was like maybe a little fueled by psychedelics.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.440
Like they're just like in the documentary, they talk about being in their van, no nitrous, but like fucking...

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440
Here we go again.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:30.440
Like just being in the van, they're all like having an orgy in a van as they're driving to like put explosives in a government building to blow up, to protest the Vietnam War.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:41.440
And when you look at that and just throw your moral compass away, but just when you look at that, you realize how great people really are.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.440
Because you really, because you realize like these people don't need to do that.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.440
They could just fucking ignore the Vietnam War like anybody else.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.440
They could just ignore it, ignore it, go to your job.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.440
We're all doing fine, man. We're fine.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.440
You guys have money. I don't have much you have. You have a little bit. You're not starved. We're fine.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.440
So it's easy to ignore, which is what they want.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.440
So it's kind of cool when people are like, fuck this, we're not ignoring anymore.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:14.440
And then they go to this extreme place, which I obviously am not advocating in any way, but still it represents what can be done.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:21.440
And it's a really inspirational thing to watch because you realize like shit, man, we could be doing a lot more than we're doing.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.440
You know, we can be doing lots, lots more. And if we all start doing lots...

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.440
We can also build a birdhouse. You don't have to blow anything up.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440
Blow up a birdhouse.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.440
There were a lot less people in the world back then. There was probably an easier...

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440
And the Vietnam War?

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440
It was easier to blow up a building with no one in it.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440
I would say these days.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.440
I'm not saying blow up buildings. I'm not advocating that level of violence.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:50.440
And also, and I will admit this, when the Antifos started punching people, I was definitely having conversations like, you know, I think they've gone too far.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.440
But one of the things, then I started researching them a little bit, and this will get me in trouble on the internet,

01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:02.440
because anytime you do any kind of emphasis on like, maybe that's not so bad, you will immediately get a bunch of tweets like,

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.440
you fucking idiot, do you know what you've done?

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.440
Well, I'm not on Twitter. Maybe Antifa is not so bad. Like, very happy to say that.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.440
Well, one of the cool things that they... Oh, maybe some of them are here.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:21.440
One of the cool things that they say, or one of the cool... You know, so people break windows in these protests.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.440
And they break these windows, and people are like, how could you break windows of local businesses?

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.440
And Antifa, they call those people window protectors.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:36.440
They're like, oh, you want to protect windows? That's what you're worried about, fucking windows?

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.440
Maybe we can form an alliance at some point. In my world, all the windows are going to break.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440
Yes, exactly.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:50.440
The ones that aren't broken will be polished by Nazis, so I'm breaking a couple windows to get you talking, or whatever.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:57.440
I'm not going to justify their stuff. I'm so... I'm just, as I said on your podcast, I'm just so fucking grateful that, like,

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:04.440
that not all kids are just... All kids are hooligans, right?

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.440
So I'm so grateful to my hooligan kids who are like, I'm going to be a hooligan today.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:17.440
Where do I direct my hooliganism? Towards fucking... Towards the man.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:24.440
Towards Nazis. I'm going to fucking... If they didn't do that, then we'd be extra fucked.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440
I'm definitely going to complain about them last.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.440
We'll complain about them last. And I will admit, man, I did complain about them in the beginning.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.440
Anybody in the Antifa listening, I'm sorry, they don't forgive, so I guess they're going to hate me.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440
But like, the...

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.440
I want to have somebody from Antifa. It's someone from Antifa, I think.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.440
Isn't that kind of a silly thing? They don't have a letterhead, right?

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.440
I think they're decentralized.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.440
We've got somebody from Antifa here. Steve Levy to stage. Steve Levy is going up there.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.440
Are you serious?

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.440
One of the...

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.440
He's the spokesman.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.440
From the public chapter of Antifa.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440
I want to have also...

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.440
Anybody listening who cares about this stuff, who's like the platform and all the stuff and how you're using it.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.440
I had Gotham Girl come on, she's an Eleanor Democrat.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.440
She talked about believing in the system and the election was fraudulent.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:23.440
I wanted her to have her signal boosted for that reason. I also want to have, therefore, somebody from the DSA,

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.440
people have been tweeting me and stuff, and somebody from Antifa.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.440
You guys have always been so kind to...

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:36.440
I want to sprinkle those folks in because it's like turbulent times.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.440
I just wanted to say that out loud so you didn't think that I was like...

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.440
Biast.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.440
Well, I don't care if I'm biased. I don't know anything. I don't know enough.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.440
I want to have people on that talk about what to do because I don't know what to do.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.440
So I want to talk to the people that are like...

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.440
I don't care if they're doing shit that's ugly, whatever.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440
I want to talk to them.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.440
Anyways, wait, what?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.440
What?

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440
Nothing.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.440
How you doing Levy? How's things?

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440
Things are good.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.440
Yeah?

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.440
Last time I saw you a couple weeks ago, you were a little down on the dumps.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440
Yeah, you know, it happens.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440
Why?

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440
How why do people get down on the dumps? What happened?

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.440
Oh, I guess I have my heart broken.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.440
Oh, that's the worst.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.440
There we go. Here we go again.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.440
Oh, boy. I guess I had my heart broken.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.440
Can you talk about what happened?

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.440
Well, you know hearts.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:45.440
Yeah, an old friend of mine, we started seeing each other for the first time, really,

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.440
and trying to make it work.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:53.440
She was in New York, and we were seeing each other back and forth a little bit.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.440
And then the last time I saw her, we parted ways.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:04.440
You guys went there after a lifetime of childhood, sweet, hearty,

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
Fox in the Hound shit.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.440
I guess, as you would say, we had a real will they won't they?

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440
Right.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.440
And now the question has been answered, and they won't.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.440
You don't know that.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.440
Well, no, I do know. That's what he's saying happened.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440
I'm not trying to...

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:30.440
Yeah, well, after all those years, I guess they will, and now they won't.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.440
Right. Well, they did.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.440
They did.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440
No, they won't.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440
Now they don't.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440
Wait, no.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.440
That's the question. That's more of a did they don't they?

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:45.440
No, they didn't. They did. Now they're not, but they might again.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440
Is there a might they could there?

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.440
I don't know.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440
And I don't want to...

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.440
I'm a totally unbiased objective observer.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.440
I have no agenda about like setting you up or wingmaning you or anything.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.440
I just, I heard through the grapevine that the reason it didn't work.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.440
She complained about something like, like your penis was naturally ribbed and...

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.440
Yeah, I heard that too.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.440
And giant.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.440
And then it was not...

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.440
It was self lubricating.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.440
Yeah, and it vibrated.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440
That's what I heard.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.440
I heard this crazy thing like you can't control how fast it vibrates.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.440
She didn't like that it happened.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.440
It also had a little prong that came out, which is right on the clip.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.440
Yeah.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.440
Is that true?

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.440
It's a curse.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.440
It's shaped like a rabbit.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.440
Yeah.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.440
Right on the top, there was like a, right on the back of the helmet, there's like a pair

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.440
of rabbit ears that come out and go like that.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.440
You got a crazy cock, man.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.440
A little too crazy for some unlucky woman.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.440
Some girls aren't ready for the perfect cock.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.440
Cause that's what we're finding out.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:01.440
And your dick just come back from Texas where it was helping move sandbags for flood victims?

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.440
I thought it was Puerto Rico.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.440
With Ryan Gosling and...

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.440
I thought the problem was whenever there was a disaster in the world, your cock would

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.440
detach and slide to the disaster.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:19.440
And those are right now a restoring cell service in Puerto Rico.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:26.440
Oh, can I ask, I want to say, I have a question.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.440
Like, don't you think, I was telling Cody, cause I was like hungover.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:37.440
I don't know how to share my, you guys don't want to picture me having sex, but I was like,

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.440
I was having this conversation where I was like, I just, I made some observation where

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:47.440
I was like, cause I was, I was like, don't you think it takes a lot of water to, to result

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:50.440
in a load of cock?

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.440
And she was like, what are you talking about?

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440
It's like, it's as much water as there is.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.440
I'm like, no, it's not like a recipe.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.440
You don't like put a little bit of, your body doesn't put a little bit of water in a, in

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:03.440
your balls and then put a little bit of, of sperm powder.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.440
And like, there's a process.

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.440
Like, and don't you, don't you think it takes a certain amount of water and a certain amount

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.440
of sandwiches?

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:18.440
Like how many, like, what do you think like a load of, a load of, of, of ejaculate, of,

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.440
like, which is like, I think it's like 500 million sperm are in a, in an ejaculate.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.440
So there's this whole process that you've, you know, the sperm,

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.440
I just read it's 1.2 terabytes of data.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440
Wait, shut up.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440
Wait, I actually did see this too.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.440
You mean genetically?

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440
Yeah, genetically.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440
The DNA in a sperm equals.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:39.440
It was like one sperm is equivalent to 35 megabytes.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.440
I don't know if it's really.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440
It's 1.2 terabytes.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.440
One sperm is half the information that takes to make a person.

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.440
How much, how much, how much data is in a person's DNA?

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.440
I expect it to be more than 1.2 terabytes.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.440
It's amazing that it's just 1.2 terabytes.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.440
Doesn't it imply that a full human being is 2.4 terabytes?

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.440
No, it implies when you're downloading stuff into your computer, it's having orgasm.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440
Sorry.

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440
Say what?

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440
What is?

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:10.440
We have either a computer science major or a chronic masturbator.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440
The two can happen together.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440
I don't know which it could be.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.440
The two can happen at once, Dan.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.440
It's impossible for it to be both.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.440
You're saying it's 124 terabytes.

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.440
Are you correcting the data of the sperm?

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440
124 terabytes?

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.440
Yeah, right.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.440
Just so you know, I did my doctoral thesis on college cum.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.440
And it's 1.2.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.440
Okay, well, so, yeah, well, that's, I mean, that really is like we're coming up on the,

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.440
I mean, because the, they're coming up on them.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.440
Like we're getting, so we're getting close to like, you know, well, wait, well,

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440
what we have, what is it, petabytes is next?

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.440
Like, that's the next highest thing.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.440
We, obviously we have the, whatever, we've mapped the human genome.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.440
I'm not, what am I, my grandpa?

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.440
I'm just like, like pretty soon teleportation, man.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440
Once you can store everything.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.440
I don't, teleportation is bad news, man.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.440
You know about like, once you teleport, you're dead, you know?

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.440
I mean, that philosophical thing.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.440
Yeah, that's true though.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440
Cause like, you can't prove it.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.440
I can't prove it's me.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.440
Yeah.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.440
Let me ask you this.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.440
If, if you could, if you could pick, but like, so you got to fly across the country.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:35.440
And if you could pick teleportation, but you've got to get kicked in the balls.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.440
Or like flying on an airplane.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440
What do you pick?

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:44.440
I never want to teleport because it'll be, that's like going in a suicide booth.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.440
It kills you.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.440
That would be the amazing thing when they invent teleportation.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.440
Eventually there'll be a society, I think we'll be dead, but there will be this like

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.440
concept of like, virgins, you know, people who haven't been teleported.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440
That's right.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440
And people will start saying like, oh, you should talk to Gary.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.440
When Gary talks, you can kind of sense that he was using the cells that he was born with.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.440
Yeah, cause we can't even fucking print.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.440
I only date teleporters.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440
Black and white ink.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.440
We can't print anything without fucking errors.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.440
You think we can print people back out of a fucking...

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440
Not yet!

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.440
You can't even copy a fucking jpeg.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.440
No, we'll be so fucked.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.440
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.440
And that's your brain.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.440
It's like, you come out and you're like, I don't know Spanish anymore.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.440
And it's like, that's if you're lucky.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.440
You'll be so fucked.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.440
And you know who's going to say, you never knew Spanish?

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.440
The fucking dipshit that works behind the teleporter.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440
Yeah.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440
That's teleported himself a million times a day.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.440
And he's just like, no, it's great.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:41.440
But you're assuming the mechanism of teleportation is based on the disintegration, reintegration

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440
of the human like atomic structure.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440
What if it's some kind of like...

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.440
Like wormhole?

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.440
Pestoract.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440
What if it's some kind of wrinkle in time shit?

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.440
I'm down with that.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.440
So yeah, it's cool.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440
It's got teleporting.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440
That's what's scary.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.440
Yeah.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440
Yeah, no.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.440
Oh, portals like walking through a door into another place.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440
That's safer.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440
Yeah.

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440
Have you read Ringworld?

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440
No, no.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440
It's great.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.440
But Ringworld is super cool because it's like Larry Niven and it's like way in the fucking future.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.440
But in this world, there is teleportation.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.440
I don't know if it's like bending the time space continuum or like destroying your atomic

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.440
self and reintegrating it or whatever.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.440
But what's interesting about it is like, there's no such thing as like any one city.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:29.440
All cities have become one massive city because there's no longer any kind of like distance

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440
between cities.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:36.440
So what happens on this like super futuristic earth, which is really cool, is that...

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.440
And also they've gotten to the level where they can like change their skin pigment.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:46.440
So suddenly the fashions on the planet change like day to day because everyone's so super

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440
connected.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:53.440
And then one day people just start glowing or like certain like star patterns will appear

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.440
in people's faces and stuff because they become so interconnected that like...

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440
I guess I'm petty.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440
I just keep saying...

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.440
I've been like, come on, that's not imaginative.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440
What the fuck, Carmen?

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440
Yeah, no, I'm listening.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.440
I'm like, oh yeah, cities get bigger and then they all turn into one big city.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:09.440
Did you think of it?

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.440
And then everybody can change their skin.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.440
I'm like, come on.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440
Did you think of it?

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440
You didn't think of it?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440
Well, I didn't bother.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440
Wait a minute.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.440
I was thinking of crazy shit, man.

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:28.440
I was like, what if a sandwich could make you come?

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.440
By the way, man, when you were talking about that, it was really funny because I kept thinking

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440
of like an awesome cooking show.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440
You got hungry, that's what you're saying.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440
Where it's God.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.440
Where God's like, today we're going to be whipping up just basic cum.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.440
We're going to make three club sandwiches, two gallons of water.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.440
We're going to put it into Tyler and we're going to wait 20 days.

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.440
On a very special episode of Chopped Junior.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.440
But that's all I'm saying is you have to take in all this.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.440
We were talking about the biological process, spermatogenesis.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:10.440
By the way, I started doing this thing where I'm like researching cum a lot.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:19.440
It's like after I masturbate and or have sex and or intentional, sex with me is weird.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.440
But sometimes you're laying there and you're like, man, I don't know if I'll ever get out of bed.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.440
And then that's why I get on my iPad and I'm like, tell me how sperm is made.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.440
Because then I think if I watch it, then I'm like, maybe the sperm will start getting made

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.440
and then I can get out of bed.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.440
Wait.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.440
It doesn't make any sense.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.440
Your mobility is sperm based?

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440
Well, I don't know.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.440
I'm like a caveman when I'm in that mode.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.440
I'm like, I don't know.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.440
The only scientific thing that I know is different is that I came a bunch and now I can't get out of bed.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.440
I knew somebody who worked in porn and they were on a set when Peter North finished a scene.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.440
And then Peter North, who's famous for coming a bunch, he finished coming.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:07.440
And then I was like, so what does he do after he finishes?

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.440
He watched Peter North come.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.440
What happens after?

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440
He has four pina coladas.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.440
He turns into a little boy and he goes like, oh man, I need some cereal.

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.440
Wow, that's awesome.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.440
It's so Dirk Diggler.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.440
He's like Jethro Baudin.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.440
But who are we going to trust if not him?

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.440
Some kind of comologist?

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.440
Like maybe Peter North is, maybe he's just joyfully wrong, but maybe he's like expertly right.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:44.440
He's just eating fucking frosted mini-wheats and milk because it kind of reminds him of cum when he looks at it.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.440
He's like, that must make cum.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.440
I'm going to cum more later.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440
Somebody told me it was golden grams.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.440
That was his thing.

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.440
He liked golden grams cereal.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:54.440
I bet, yeah.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.440
That makes sense.

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440
That was his Popeye's spinach.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.440
I love the idea that it's just based on the milk.

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:06.440
But I swear, sometimes when you cum a lot, don't you sometimes you go like, man, this has been great.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.440
I love this feeling, but also can I get some motivation back?

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440
Can I start living in denial again?

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440
What do I got to do to do that?

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:18.440
And you think like, well, the refractory period must be based on your balls start.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.440
I just have to assume that your balls start making, I don't know.

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440
You know the idea about the refractory period?

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.440
It's really, really, you had Chris Ryan on the show before.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.440
Father, sex, and time.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:33.440
So one of the ideas about the refractory period is that from an evolutionary perspective,

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.440
it's better for a woman to have multiple mates.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.440
So like, because then the strongest sperm is going to survive.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.440
That's why I don't want rom-coms.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.440
That's the reason.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.440
Because there's like that height of romance.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.440
But I know it's probably true though, because it's like, I've read stuff like,

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.440
You're making love to your lover in the primordial past.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.440
You're making love. You come inside of her.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440
You're like, I love you. I'm going to go to bed.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.440
And then you like start going to bed.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.440
And then your friend is like, can I start fucking her now?

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.440
And either you're like, yeah, man, more than that.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440
Or she's like, yeah, let's do it or not.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.440
Or she's chippy toeing out.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.440
But the idea is like, yeah, so the idea is the refractory period is actually designed

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.440
to make sure that a...

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.440
So the question is, why can women have multiple orgasms?

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.440
Why are multiple mates important though?

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.440
What does that...

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440
So the idea is like, if you had some kind of like, I don't know,

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:32.440
something was going on with you and you weren't like making like powerful loads,

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.440
whatever that may be.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440
And you're crazy like, what if...

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.440
But the question is like, why would it be?

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.440
The big question is...

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.440
Like a golden graham shortage.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.440
I go away for two weeks to come back to the jizz show.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.440
I love talking about cum.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.440
But the question is...

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440
I really do.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.440
I go on come town, come in town.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.440
The question is, a woman can have multiple orgasms with a...

01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.440
That's not true.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.440
That's not true.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.440
That's a myth.

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.440
We'll be right back.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.440
That's not...

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.440
You hear it all the time, but it's not true.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.440
It's something they're saying.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.440
They were talking about it at the Wonder Woman premiere,

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.440
but you couldn't get in.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440
It's not true.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.440
It's not fair.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.440
It's not true.

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.440
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.440
No, you're right.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440
It's not true.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.440
No, come on.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.440
Finish your thought.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.440
Finish your thought.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.440
I'm sorry.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.440
No, I mean, the idea is like the question is just like,

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.440
why would it be that a man has like this really intense reaction

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.440
to orgasm, which we call the refractory period,

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.440
whereas a woman can have multiple orgasms.

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.440
And the implication, according to Chris Ryan,

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.440
is that well, this is clearly like created with the idea

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.440
of like a multiplicity of love.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.440
I mean, that's what's interesting about Chris Ryan,

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.440
because he's a well-needed like update to Desmond Morris,

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.440
who's in the 60s.

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.440
But Desmond Morris' theory about that was that,

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.440
but I don't want to be part of a patriarchy.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.440
But the Desmond Morris theory was that,

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:06.440
yeah, men fall asleep because then you bond emotionally

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.440
with your lover.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.440
Bullshit.

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.440
But here's the thing.

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440
It's because we get sleepy.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.440
But there is a scientifically...

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:20.440
It goes back to, it all has to do with human babies

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.440
being more biologically vulnerable than tiger babies,

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.440
deer babies, and cactus babies.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440
I don't know.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440
I mean, I don't know.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440
I think like Chris Ryan makes it pretty great.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.440
That's why I don't want to...

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.440
That's why I just claim the fuck out of it.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.440
But I do think that it's delight...

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.440
I really prefer that Desmond Morris' theory,

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.440
like all of the biological quirks about us

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440
are all designed for pair bonding

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440
because our babies need two parents.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.440
Well, you can still pair bond.

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.440
You can't...

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440
The idea isn't that you...

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.440
By the way, I'm like severely embarrassingly monogamous.

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.440
So don't get me wrong.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.440
I'm not some kind of like,

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.440
just got back from Burning Man, Dan,

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.440
and now I've learned we got to be non-monogamous.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Your girlfriend's pretty.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.440
I'm not like that.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440
Don't worry, man.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440
That's not fucking happening.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440
I'm severely, desperately,

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.440
and based on insecurity, completely fucking monogamous.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.440
So don't get me wrong.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440
But like, from a perspective of like,

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.440
yeah, like that idea kind of would be...

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.440
And again, this is not my idea.

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.440
Like, I couldn't do this.

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.440
But the idea would be if you really love somebody,

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440
wouldn't you want them to come a lot?

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.440
No!

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.440
Not with you.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.440
Dan...

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.440
I'd have to love you and not them.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.440
Dan, if you really love Cody,

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.440
let Duncan fuck tonight, man.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.440
Listen, man.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440
Listen, I didn't say it like that.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440
Listen, I didn't say it like that.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:45.440
We're sitting right next to Steve Perfectcock Levy over here.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.440
Let her have a good Saturday night.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.440
It's Saturday night.

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.440
Let her live a little.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.440
Oh, well, look, I don't want to forbid

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.440
Steve and Duncan to fuck Cody.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.440
Now you're talking!

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.440
I want Cody to not want that.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.440
Right.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.440
Well, again, I made a dumb joke.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.440
Wait, let me just say this very quickly.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440
I just made a stupid dumb joke.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440
I don't mean that at all.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440
What I'm saying is, it's like,

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.440
from my POV in the society that I was born into,

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440
because of my own levels of insecurity

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.440
and where I'm at in my life,

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.440
I want to be monogamous,

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.440
and I will continue to be monogamous.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.440
I'm not changing that.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440
That's me.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.440
That's who I am.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.440
I've always been like that.

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.440
I can't change it.

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.440
But if you look like...

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.440
If you zoom out...

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440
Right.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.440
And you look at what evolution wants.

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440
Right.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.440
You realize monogamy itself is a cultural...

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.440
It's like a new imposition.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.440
Well, it dovetails with this whole thing

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.440
about anarchy versus capitalism,

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440
because it's like...

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.440
It's like, oh, you know what?

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.440
I get to pretend I was born into this stainless steel,

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440
concrete jungle,

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.440
and that, hey, it wasn't my idea to do this,

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.440
but hey, will you be my girlfriend?

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.440
And all that stuff.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440
At the same time, I'm like, hey,

01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.440
it wasn't my idea to have the American dollar

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.440
be the standard of the entire planet.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.440
But hey, what are you going to do?

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.440
But then push comes to shove as in cultural upheaval,

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.440
and right now, capitalistically,

01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440
we're going like, yeah, again,

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.440
but theoretically, anarchy is the...

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440
Not theoretically.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.440
It's not the more popular way to do it,

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440
but it is the way that we would...

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440
And I think you're saying the same thing

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.440
about polyamory or whatever they call it,

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.440
these kids.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.440
You could just say,

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.440
if you go to the bathroom here, it's disgusting.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.440
It was a joke, or maybe not.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.440
I have a special bathroom upstairs.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:45.440
It's rhinestones and just all the cultist daughters.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.440
But yeah, I think you're saying the same thing I am,

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.440
which is theoretically, intellectually,

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.440
not wanting to be guilty of dishonesty,

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440
one should acknowledge it.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.440
Yeah, probably there's a freer human kind.

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.440
That functions better and healthier.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.440
But then also, it's important then to go,

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.440
just as I did before I quit smoking,

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.440
where I was like, I like smoking.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.440
My therapist says, awareness, acceptance, change.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.440
People skip acceptance.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.440
You're like, oh, I'm aware.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440
I'm doing this.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.440
I'm going to stop doing it.

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.440
And then you just ping pong back and forth.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440
That's why I don't quit drinking.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.440
I have to accept it first.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:31.440
I've become aware I drink a lot.

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.440
I'm still working on accepting it.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.440
Then I'll change it later.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.440
I've seen you accept a lot of drinks.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440
Me too.

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440
Especially, especially.

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440
Yeah, but that guy with the boy,

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.440
oh, it's all one big city.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.440
Speaking of drinks, we never shout them out.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.440
Matt, the bartender over here.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.440
Matt, our bartender.

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:53.440
Yeah, give them big tips.

01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.440
Truly the hardest working person in Harmontown.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.440
Keeping his bunch of fucking reprobates happy.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440
I apologize to Spencer.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440
I know he's going to say he doesn't give a fuck,

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440
but that's because he's my son.

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440
Yeah, whatever.

01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.440
We'll talk about it later.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.440
All these jokes about fucking my mom,

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440
all of a sudden, a line.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.440
And my fascination with cum.

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.440
Right.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440
Wait, wait.

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:24.440
Yeah, I always just roll off your fascination with cum as normal.

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.440
But I just, Duncan was making me feel better,

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:34.440
so I kept him in my mouth like one of those ring pops.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.440
Like one of those levy cocks.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:45.440
That's delicious.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440
You know what?

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440
It's not that.

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.440
Why am I making the diameter?

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.440
No, it's like a nice broomstick diameter.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.440
And it's like, it's gentle, but firm.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.440
And it's there when you need it.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.440
And if you get thirsty afterwards,

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.440
it gets you a glass of water without you asking.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440
Whoa.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440
So you can make the diameter.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440
Also a cum.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.440
Steve Levy's dick is something you almost know that dick does.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.440
In the morning, it makes you the best avocado toast you've ever fucking had.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440
Wow.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440
It's a little basil, a little feta on it,

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440
some olive oil, fucking perfect.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440
I did get an argument.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.440
I got in an argument with this dick, though.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.440
Oh, no.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.440
Because I said to it, this is just a sandwich, man.

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.440
Avocado toast is just a sandwich.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440
All right, forget it.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.440
That's for another party.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440
Well, let Duncan know you wanted to come back

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.440
by thanking him with your hands.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:48.440
Thank you, Duncan.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440
Thank you.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.440
See you soon.

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.440
Duncan Trussell.

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.440
I feel like...

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.440
He just makes everything a little bit better, doesn't he?

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.440
Yeah, he does.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.440
Yeah, he's like walking serotonin.

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440
All right, why don't you marry him?

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.440
He's probably back there fucking my girlfriend.

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.440
In the beginning of that rant, I thought you were going to say you wanted,

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.440
just sound like you're going towards, you wanted like an incremental

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.440
cum clicker, like cookie collector, where like you get the air workings.

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.440
That would be amazing.

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.440
And you'd like manufacture your own sperm

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440
and finally you'd have understanding of it.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440
Like, yeah.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.440
I swear to God, I'm really a fan.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.440
Can we stop saying loads?

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.440
Well, I don't know what to, ejaculate batches.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.440
There is no, the language fails.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.440
It is a truly fascinating thing that as mammals,

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.440
we take in energy and then we have a little factory

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440
that has to dangle between our legs

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.440
because it requires like a degree cooler environment

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.440
just for the chemical process of making them, not storing them.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.440
Once they're made, they're fine in summer, you know, whatever.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.440
Like, they're going to get made one degree cooler.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.440
And they're just little fucking missiles that are just loaded with the need

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.440
to hit an egg and they're like simultaneously geniuses and idiots

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440
and they're just disposable

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.440
and we're just constantly making them until the day they bury us.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.440
But like, women's eggs are like, they're finite

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440
and they're like, they're giant.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:21.440
Like, they're the size of the sun compared to a sperm's rocket.

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.440
And like, it's just like this amazing,

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440
I'm just so fascinated with all of it.

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.440
All right, let's, let's, let's help.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.440
I don't know whether we have enough time.

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.440
We, we, we found, we found out tonight.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.440
Okay, well, we should have, we should have come.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.440
No, it's fine.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.440
We have time, come on.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.440
I don't know.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.440
Let's give the audience some D&D.

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.440
We only got, we started a little late.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.440
We've only got like 11, we've only got like 11 minutes tops.

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.440
That's what I'm saying.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.440
We found out tonight that you'd love to come.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.440
Spencer's the game master.

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.440
Like, like, like, he makes the rule.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.440
Like we can't, we can't announce Cliff Hanger endings and things like that.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440
Spencer is in charge of the thing.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440
So if he says, like, yeah, it's not.

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440
We should get Duncan back.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.440
Let's see.

01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.440
Hey, Duncan, are you back?

01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.440
Duncan, come back.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.440
He probably left.

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440
We're not going to play, play D&D.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440
What was that?

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440
I'll just pretend to.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.440
Well, how about this Spencer?

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.440
Because I was not here.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.440
Let's just, let's just recap.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.440
So we, we, we...

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.440
Duncan's back.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.440
Oh, shit.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.440
Thank you for having me back.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.440
He's on court.

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440
He fucked all of our girlfriends that quickly?

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.440
Yeah.

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.440
Which was a really long time for me.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.440
That's part of his appeal.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.440
That's how he gets them.

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.440
Hey, man, this won't take a lot of time.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440
I'm not going to put you out, man.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.440
The thing is...

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.440
I got a cheesy thing to say.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440
Uh-oh.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.440
To cut off whatever you were going to say was probably the funny thing.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.440
It was, it was going to be trenchant and hilarious, but go ahead.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.440
Oh, no.

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440
Leave me.

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440
I had to tell you this thing.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.440
Okay.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.440
Because like, you know, Jack Kornfield, the Buddhist teacher, you know...

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.440
You don't know Jack Kornfield?

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.440
He owes me 10 bucks.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.440
He's not here, right?

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440
So he tells this great story.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.440
And guaranteed that, think about having a broken heart.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.440
Guaranteed there's a bunch of people here right now with a fucking broken heart,

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.440
because that's what it means to be human.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.440
But there's a...

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.440
Jack Kornfield talks about how there's a story in Judaism

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:27.440
where there was a rabbi that made his students hold the...

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.440
You know, Teflon, you know what that is?

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440
Yeah.

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440
To Phelan?

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440
To Phelan, yeah.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.440
To Phelan.

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.440
Eggs don't stick to it.

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440
NASA invented it.

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:43.440
Don't tell me the Jews made that.

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.440
That was NASA.

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440
You're right, dude.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.440
It is one of the weird mysteries of the universe is the eggs don't stick to it.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.440
What is Teflon?

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.440
What?

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.440
Do you remember that?

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.440
Take it away, Steve.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440
It's like the shit they cook eggs.

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440
I know Teflon.

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.440
What's Teflon?

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.440
What's the thing you're talking about?

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.440
No, we talked about this earlier in the year.

01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:02.440
Remember, I got accosted in Beverly Hills by...

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440
Oh, right.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.440
They put a Parker Brothers thing on your head.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440
That's Teflon where they wrap it around your arms.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440
Okay, gotcha.

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.440
You saw it.

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.440
The point is, like, inside this box are these scrolls.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.440
I don't know what's written on them, but there's something amazing written on them.

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.440
So, Jack Kornfield tells a story.

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.440
How, like, I already know you're going to fucking make fun of this man.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.440
I know you're going to, like, got some already.

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440
But, like, Jack Kornfield tells a story.

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.440
Is he a Jewish Buddhist?

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:34.440
He might have started off Jewish and then became Buddhist.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:39.440
Like, a lot of people that I learned from are, like, they started off Jewish and then became, like, Buddhist or Hindu.

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.440
But it doesn't, the whole thing is, like, the whole, like...

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.440
Because of those robes.

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440
It's ridiculous saying what you already were.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.440
The point is...

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.440
I'm not going to say it.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.440
You know what Jewish Buddhist says?

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440
What?

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:51.440
Oym.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440
Yes!

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:57.440
God damn you!

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.440
Wait, you didn't, you didn't, you heard that somewhere.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.440
Wait a minute.

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:09.440
Wait, wait, what if he heard that somewhere?

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.440
What if he got that out of a bazooka joe?

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.440
Oym.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.440
Did you, did you just make that up?

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:19.440
Yes.

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440
That's not fair.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440
Mazel tov.

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440
Mazel tov.

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.440
Oym is the title.

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.440
That's the title.

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.440
Oym?

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.440
Is that what it would be?

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440
Let me warm my way out of this thing, please.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.440
No, no, no.

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:39.440
So, so, the idea is, like, this rabbi, it, like, makes his students hold the teff to fill in,

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.440
to fill in against their heart when they're, when they're, like, saying prayers.

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.440
And one of them said to him,

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.440
Why do you make us hold this against our heart when we're saying prayers?

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:50.440
And he said,

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.440
So that maybe when your heart breaks, the prayers will fall inside.

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:59.440
That's cool, right?

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.440
It's a nice thought.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:07.440
So heart, heartbreak is a, yeah, it's a thing, it's a, it's like, yeah, it's a crack, cracking, and then, like, yeah.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.440
It's a crack that prayers can fill.

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.440
Yeah, and it doesn't stay open.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.440
It cracks like an egg and it falls into the phone.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.440
No, it's like, it's a sacred moat.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.440
The thing is, like, if you get your fucking heart broken,

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.440
which is a very rare occurrence in a human incarnation,

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.440
it really doesn't happen all that much.

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440
When you finally get your fucking heart broken,

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.440
you are walking through the kingdom of heaven.

01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.440
Like, you are in heaven right now.

01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.440
You don't realize it.

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:38.440
You don't realize it because, like, everybody thinks heaven is, like, just, like, you know, infinite blowjobs or what.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440
I don't know what people think heaven is,

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.440
but that, but that's not what heaven is.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.440
Heaven is direct contact with reality.

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.440
So right now you're having direct contact with eternity,

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
and that's a, like, a holy moment.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.440
And so, like, you want, the window shuts.

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440
That's what I'm saying, man.

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440
Like, your heartbreak window.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.440
You probably got, like, another, like, I don't know, 20 years,

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.440
and then you'll start, stop suffering.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440
No, you probably have, like,

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440
I got, I thought of something.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:09.440
I can, I can, I can beat, I can beat.

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.440
I can be smarter than this philosopher guy.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.440
You met him!

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.440
Don't talk shit about Jack Kornfield!

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.440
Get off Twitter!

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440
No, I can beat him, I can beat him.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440
You, you, you, okay.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.440
Your heart, your heart, so your heart's broken.

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.440
You know what else is broken?

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440
A baby's skull.

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.440
You know why?

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.440
So it can grow into an adult skull.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.440
Oh.

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.440
There you go.

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440
That's basically the same thing.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.440
I think I could, I think I could top that.

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.440
So there's this ancient Japanese art of pottery.

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.440
You know, sometimes their pots break,

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.440
and they actually have this, this method of,

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.440
of reforging the pottery pieces with gold inlay.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:50.440
Yeah.

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.440
And it's actually, it's more beautiful

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.440
than it was before it was broken.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.440
And that's you.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.440
You're going to be all ribboned with gold,

01:47:57.440 --> 01:47:58.440
and it'll be better.

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440
Thank you, Spencer.

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.440
Bitch!

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.440
Cliff Hanger!

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.440
Let's hear it for Steve Levy, everybody.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:13.440
With a broken heart of gold.

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.440
Also, Duncan Tressel,

01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:18.440
for making everything alright.

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.440
Let's thank Zach, Church, Sarah, Kevin, Chris, Noah,

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.440
Matt at the bar.

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:30.440
Spencer Crittenden in your Game Master.

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440
Although we didn't play, but

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:36.440
we found out that Dan loves jizz.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.440
I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:38.440
Thank you for having me back.

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:59.440
Your Mayor is Dan Harmon, everybody.

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.440
Did you get any of that?

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:08.440
It's a good show.
