{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.000\nHello, one and all, from beautiful uptown Burbank Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:42.000\nHello, gang, please welcome to the stage the Game Master extraordinaire Spencer Crittenden and the mayor of Saffa Faire, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.\n\n00:42.000 --> 00:52.000\nThank you. Thanks. Hello, Dan. Hi. You're looking good. I told you backstage, but I'm going to say it again. You're looking good.\n\n00:52.000 --> 01:06.000\nThank you. I'm wearing a head to toe bomb fell. They're a sponsor. Really? Clothes from the mail. For the mail. They don't have women's clothes. It's not controversial.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:20.000\nYou can wear them if you're women. I'm assuming. I wouldn't stop you. It's not yental. I got no beef with women dressed like guys. I applaud them.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:31.000\nEspecially in the shoe department. I don't like high heel shoes. If I find myself distracted by high heel shoes, I worry about the woman's comfort. It's not because I'm a good person. I just worry about it.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:44.000\nI was in a little bit of a bad mood last week. The reason why you said were you guys here for the show last week, even if they were, they have to pretend they weren't because I told them I hated them.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:50.000\nSo if they admit that they were here in the back, they have to admit to low self-esteem.\n\n01:50.000 --> 02:07.000\nAs somebody who's at the show live, obviously, it's a different experience to watch it than to hear it, but I heard that one. I could imagine what it was like there. You seem a little grumpy that last show.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:14.000\nWas there anything particular that happened or were you just in one of those moods that happens because the world is a crazy place right now?\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:28.000\nThere are several theories. A lot of people go with Occam's razor, no pun intended, and they think it's the mustache. They think the mustache has changed me.\n\n02:28.000 --> 02:46.000\nBut I think it's Twitter withdrawal. I was talking to my therapist about it. I had a similar thing during the divorce. It was through no fault of Aaron's and no statement about the marriage at all because my therapist warned me.\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:59.000\nHe said, it doesn't matter when you divorce one thing that you should be aware of. You're going to find yourself hyper-vigilant about injustice. I've talked about this in a podcast. I was like, okay, I'll keep an eye on that.\n\n02:59.000 --> 03:21.000\nIt was like sending these insane text messages to the guy who cleans my fish tank. I'm accusing him of making my life into an Edward Albee play. I'm like, this is some Virginia Wolf shit. You need to tell me how to work this light.\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:35.000\nIt was crazy. It was erratic behavior because there was a detachment. Twitter, we don't want to admit, or I don't want to admit, I'll speak for myself. A lot of healthy people are using Twitter very healthily.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:53.000\nBut as you probably know, I was really fixated on it. So I quit it for a little bit. I stopped having that outlet for that justice stuff. I find myself snapping particularly.\n\n03:53.000 --> 04:16.000\nNow it's about the world. I'm scared of burps, but fuck you, I don't care what you think. The delivery guy from Booze Philly, Cheese Steak didn't bring both raspberry iced tea snapples, and I just went all Paddy Chayefsky about it.\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:30.000\nI just fucking like Robert DuVall out. Only to Cody though. And because Cody is like, the amazing thing is, there's like a scientific experiment here where you can say, Dan, are you crazy?\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:50.000\nMaybe we can test it if you have, let's say, a perfect girlfriend. Or let's not say perfection doesn't, we don't look for perfect people. We don't want to be with perfect people. But I'm saying a relationship, which there's nothing on the Wheel of Fortune credit.\n\n04:50.000 --> 05:01.000\nI'm like, what a metaphor. That was my favorite thing about the last week's show, and Eddie Pepper said, that metaphor didn't work.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:22.000\nEddie, don't, no, you're not allowed to. But Spencer goes, wait, you can say that? We could just say that metaphor doesn't scan? No, you cannot. Not if you want the family to stay together. That's like, no, no, we don't talk about dad's drinking or his metaphors.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:31.000\nI mean, if you want to move forward and have to molt, but it could end up with you spending your uncle's place for a while. Try to fix the Wheel of Fortune thing you were talking about.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:42.000\nWell, I was just like, in Wheel of Fortune, they would spin the wheel, and then sometimes they would put something on a count or something. They would say, can I put that on a count?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:56.000\nAnd then Pat Sajek would say, yeah. And then I'd go, what the fuck was that? And then they'd just keep spinning, and then they'd say, I don't know what the hell it was. They would put shit on a count. I'm telling you, it was like an old, tiny grocery store, like in a Coen Brothers movie.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:05.000\nI don't remember that at all. I don't watch that show. They just had some shit on a count back there. I'm looking it up later. You know what, I'll do it right now. No.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:14.000\nYou know what's crazy? I saw the wheel. That wheel's tiny. It seems huge. The wheel's, like, it's this big.\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:22.000\nWell, you know, this goes with Sajek's, what Sajek said on Letterman back in the 80s when the Wheel of Fortune, the country had Wheel of Fortune media.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:33.000\nSome other things that we fell in love with for like two weeks was like Australia for a while. There were like eight movies about a guy named Crocodile Dundee, and then because it was the only Australian we could find that was like famous,\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:41.000\nthen we tried something with a guy named Yahoo Sirius and everything just collapsed like Enron. Wait, you're selling something that doesn't exist now.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.000\nThat's just a big desert. There's no famous people down there.\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:48.000\nWe live in a Yahoo Sirius and Jaco-based economy.\n\n06:48.000 --> 07:04.000\nJaco, yeah. There was a guy in Duracell commercials whose catchphrase and soul phrase was Oi. That's all he said. You'd say Oi, and then you'd be at a battery store and you'd go, oh, Energizer, Oi.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.000\nThere was an eight-year scare where barbecues were Barbies.\n\n07:08.000 --> 07:16.000\nBut yeah. Foster's is Australia for beer. All that stuff. Hey, I think Foster's kind of snuck in on that wave and hung out. That's the one thing.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:19.000\nBut they don't even drink that in Australia. That's bullshit.\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:21.000\nWhat are you telling me?\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nThey don't call them shrimps. They call them prawns.\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:50.000\nLook, so the delivery guy brings one raspberry iced tea snapple. I didn't know. I thought that that meant I thought because I knew I ordered one. I didn't know. Kordi ordered one. Kordi ordered one. Get your shit together.\n\n07:50.000 --> 08:03.000\nHave you ever noticed all those guys that can't speak English? They can't spell. The Republicans. They have no mastery of their mother tongue. And they're yelling at immigrants.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:12.000\nIt's like the immigrants are like, I had to learn eight presidents to just trim your bush. This fucking sucks. One of them's bush. That's my mnemonic device.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:22.000\nTwo of them are bush. And then you guys raised it to nine presidents because you said that was too easy.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt was almost too Clinton.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:33.000\nAlmost. And then we had an influx of unqualified bush trimmers.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nSnapple.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:49.000\nSnapple. And so I start going. I was happy all day. And then I go get the food. I'm with my perfect girlfriend. I come back up with the paper bag. You can already see the dark spots on the bottom so you know it's going to be good.\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:59.000\nIt's coming through the bag. The dogs are freaking out. I think there might be a dead skunk in that bag. No, it's Philly cheese steaks.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:06.000\nAnd they take them out. One raspberry snapple. That's how much we ordered. Cody says, there's not two iced tea raspberry snapples? No.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:13.000\nDid they? Are you fucking kidding me? God damn it. What is with this fucking world?\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:31.000\nAnd I just talked for 20 minutes at the top of my voice and that would be charming. But here's something that I do. I kept saying because this is how desperate I was to abuse that I couldn't just share.\n\n09:31.000 --> 09:44.000\nI couldn't get at least to just be in a bad mood and share it with my partner. So I just kept saying, but I had nothing to bitch at Cody about. I was just tabulating all the injustices that had happened to me that week.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:55.000\nAnd because Cody hadn't done anything wrong, I just kept saying, this guy does this to me. This guy. The raspberry snapple. What is with you people?\n\n09:55.000 --> 10:08.000\nI just kept saying you people to Cody. You people being the human race. You know all of you. You ate billion of you. You're just always conspiring to fuck with me.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:18.000\nAnd then she was like, okay, cool. And then we watched the rest of Gremlins 2 or whatever the hell. Everyone's around. You gotta just go check back and check it out.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:26.000\nThere was a whole kogan in that. Is it good? Was Gremlins 2 worth a rewatch?\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:37.000\nYeah, yeah. It's worth a rewatch. I don't know about your first question. I don't know. Is anything good? I don't know. It wasn't Citizen Kane. It wasn't even the Citizen Kane of Gremlin moves.\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:39.000\nThe Gremlins got really specific.\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:50.000\nLet me ask you this. When's the last time you watched the first Gremlins? Because I told Cody, I was like, you gotta watch Gremlins 2. She's like, what, 2? I'm like, Jesus, I'm really robbing the Cradle.\n\n10:50.000 --> 11:00.000\nAnd I'm like, well, Gremlins 2. She's like, I ain't seen no Gremlins 1. And I was like, okay, well, great. We'll start with this holiday classic. But then you gotta see Gremlins 2.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:11.000\nSo I put in Gremlins 1, 5 minutes in, I'm like, what the shit, and fuck, this movie is garbage. It is amazing. We have a serious problem in this society.\n\n11:11.000 --> 11:29.000\nAnd you can see the thermometer for our sickness is rotten tomatoes. It's like any movie that had some claim on the box office pulse when a certain demographic was 10 years old, it just automatically is way above a 70%.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:41.000\nIt's just garbage. There's no comparing this shit. What is it? Solar babies 98%. Because people are like, man, solar babies, man, custody weekend, it was great.\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nDoes solar babies really have a 90 years old?\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nNo, but I can't think of any examples.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nThat would be amazing.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:58.000\nBut then you watch something. I know I've talked about this. Lockout. Come on. It's diehard in space. It's great. It has like a 20% or something. It's ridiculous. They worked hard on that movie.\n\n11:58.000 --> 12:02.000\nIt's good.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:03.000\nWas it called Lockout?\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.000\nYeah.\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:05.000\nI don't know Lockout.\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:06.000\nYeah.\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.000\nI'm writing that down.\n\n12:07.000 --> 12:08.000\nThat's a crime.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:09.000\nAnd you know, and tomorrow is...\n\n12:09.000 --> 12:11.000\nCharity remember Lockout. We're watching Lockout.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:22.000\nAnyways, like there's a lot of movies with like 80% of rotten tomatoes. They're just crap. And it's just like, it's just people just like, they're just like, I will defend my legacy.\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:31.000\nYou gotta go back and watch. If you can't look into your soul, gentlemen, at least rewatch some of these pieces of shit.\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:40.000\nYou're okay to be nostalgic. Just stop pretending that it makes it a good movie that you liked it. You were a little itty-bitty little dummy.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:45.000\nI almost said the R word.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:53.000\nThat last sentence, if you rewind it, you go like, yeah, it seems like Dan's gonna get a little less his famous articulate charm.\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:57.000\nBecause I was just the whole time. I was like, ah, my sister's retarded.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:58.000\nOkay.\n\n12:58.000 --> 13:01.000\nBut now you can just use do-tard.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:02.000\nDo-tard?\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:03.000\nWait, what's do-tard?\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:06.000\nKim Jong-un went 14th century on Trump and called him a do-dard.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:07.000\nOh, a do-dard?\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:09.000\nYeah, and everybody was like, what's a do-tard?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:11.000\nI mean, I saw that not on Twitter.\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:13.000\nA do-dard is a great word.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:18.000\nLike, look, I gotta be honest, 0.1 for fucking Kim Jong-un.\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:19.000\nThat's fucking good.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:23.000\nWell, again, these guys have to learn English in schools. He didn't.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:26.000\nIs there a Korean word for do-dard?\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:32.000\nDid somebody translate that and go, well, he's talking about a senile bewildered old fucker.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:42.000\nIn Korean, we have a word for that, but the closest I can get in English is do-dard, which no one has used since Jane Austen.\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nYeah.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:45.000\nBut that's fucking good, so fucking yeah.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:50.000\nLike, I like Kim Jong-un a little bit more than our president right now.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:51.000\nYeah.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:59.000\nBecause either he spent, he paid a little more attention in English class, or he just, he listens to some of his advisors.\n\n13:59.000 --> 14:00.000\nYeah.\n\n14:00.000 --> 14:06.000\nAlso, his haircut, he's one guitar away from being the lead singer of a very successful rock and billy band.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:07.000\nHe looks at me.\n\n14:07.000 --> 14:09.000\nI wish he'd go gray, but only in the middle.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nYeah.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.000\nNo, he'd be fucking Brian Sesser. He'd be fucking sexy as shit.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nThat would be incredible.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nHe would, yeah.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:19.000\nOkay.\n\n14:19.000 --> 14:24.000\nAnyways, he's almost like, you know, he's going to start looking like in his old age.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:25.000\nKim Jong-un?\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:30.000\nYeah, he's going to look like Korean Steve Van Sant from the Sopranos.\n\n14:30.000 --> 14:35.000\nWhatever that character, Pauliwal, not Pauliwal, and that's the other guy.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:36.000\nWhat was it?\n\n14:36.000 --> 14:37.000\nJoey bag of tits.\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:38.000\nI don't know.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:41.000\nYeah, whatever.\n\n14:41.000 --> 14:44.000\nThat was, that's half the characters.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.000\nNo, he's getting a lip.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:48.000\nOh yeah, that guy, I know what you're talking about.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.000\nYeah.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.000\nAnd he's been played in Bruce Beakstein's band.\n\n14:51.000 --> 14:53.000\nBut that guy doesn't get the lip.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:54.000\nAnyways, god damn it.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nYour impressions never cease to amaze me, but...\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nI don't care what you think.\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.000\nI like him.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:02.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n15:02.000 --> 15:04.000\nDan, this is not going to be one of those nights where you're feeling persecuted.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:07.000\nThis is a night where you feel safe and you feel happy and protected.\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nWell anyways, thank you for, this is a sponsor, Bomfell.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nI'm wearing head to toe Bomfell.\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:14.000\nYou look good in it.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:15.000\nIt fits you nice.\n\n15:15.000 --> 15:16.000\nLee.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:20.000\nThe pants came, the first pair of pants, they were a number off.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:22.000\nThey didn't get the number off.\n\n15:22.000 --> 15:23.000\nI was in the room when he tried them on.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nHe actually took his pants off, went down to his skivvies.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:30.000\nPut them in a bag, sent them back, like a Netflix DVD of Gremlin's 2.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:32.000\nSaid, this is one Gremlin number off.\n\n15:32.000 --> 15:36.000\nThey sent back these Gremlin 1 pants.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:44.000\nAnd like Gremlins 1, you remember them as being twice as good as the other pair,\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:48.000\nbut inside, it's a mess.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:52.000\nThat movie is a goddamn mess.\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:56.000\nThe Gremlins in your head is like a fucking like...\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:58.000\nIt's one of the guild with a sense of wonder.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:01.000\nIt's a Spielberg production, for God's sake.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:02.000\nAnd it's a Christmas movie.\n\n16:02.000 --> 16:03.000\nIt's a great Christmas classic.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:07.000\nOh, and it's just like, oh, the performances and it's just like, oh, it gets you right here\n\n16:07.000 --> 16:09.000\nand then the Gremlins are scary and all the things.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:11.000\nAnd you just start watching it from the first frame.\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:16.000\nYou're like, what kind of weird driver's ed movie is this?\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:19.000\nHow many beginnings are we going to do?\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:23.000\nHow are you explaining this shit for you fucking idiots?\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.000\nYou shouldn't have made a movie.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.000\nFucking terrible people.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:28.000\nAll right, so here's your billion dollars.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:30.000\nThey make Gremlins 2.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.000\nWhen are we going to listen?\n\n16:31.000 --> 16:32.000\nI tell you I hate you.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nYou come right back.\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.000\nI'm like, I'm gremlining you.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nI'm das...\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:41.000\nGremlining you.\n\n16:41.000 --> 16:42.000\nYou're gremlining.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.000\nI'm like, gremlining.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.000\nYeah.\n\n16:44.000 --> 16:46.000\nPlease don't let that be the title of this episode.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:47.000\nYeah.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:49.000\nGremlining doesn't really work.\n\n16:49.000 --> 16:50.000\nAnyways.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:52.000\nI'm going to invoke the pepitone.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:53.000\nThat doesn't work.\n\n16:53.000 --> 17:01.000\nAnyways, look, I'm not going to say I'm sorry for last week because I am and I'm ashamed.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nBut he's not going to another liar.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:05.000\nNo.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:10.000\nIf I make an apology, I want to make it the official one where it's like the three parts.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:11.000\nYou acknowledge your crime.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:12.000\nOkay.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nI told the audience I hated them.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:17.000\nYou express remorse.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:20.000\nI feel bad.\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nWait.\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:26.000\nAre you allowed to make that face after you say it number two?\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:30.000\nI feel bad if it made anyone feel bad.\n\n17:30.000 --> 17:32.000\nBut that's not one of those apologists.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:33.000\nI'm sorry you felt bad.\n\n17:33.000 --> 17:34.000\nI'm not doing that.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:39.000\nI'm saying I do feel bad if anyone felt bad for it because it was the first part is a lie.\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:40.000\nI don't hate the audience.\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:45.000\nYou make me feel wonderful and you're wonderful people, especially the people that are closest to the people that do come here.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:47.000\nIt was obviously just as with Cody.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:53.000\nIt's like I'm just saying you people to a bunch of people who bother to be close to me when I'm having some kind of like fucking moment of turmoil.\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:58.000\nBut I'm also a clown on stage and I don't get the impression that anyone got hurt.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:06.000\nIf you got hurt, I do feel of course bad that it hurt you because it would be a terrible reason to hurt someone because it was a lie.\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:09.000\nAnd so then the third part is the commitment to change.\n\n18:09.000 --> 18:10.000\nSo all right.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:15.000\nI'm not going to stop drinking.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:21.000\nWhen I yelled at Cody because I quit Twitter because I'm like, well, I'm not going to stop drinking.\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nI got to change something or this isn't a real apology.\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:26.000\nI quit Twitter.\n\n18:26.000 --> 18:28.000\nThat wasn't that wasn't that mixing those two things up.\n\n18:28.000 --> 18:33.000\nBut I was I did quit Twitter because I was being mean to the people around me on Twitter.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nI was like, which is like from what I will see on intervention.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nI'm like, oh, you're a junkie.\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:39.000\nYou're like being mean to people because you're like so focused on this fucking thing.\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:45.000\nSo then I quit Twitter and then I'm like, now I'm like, now I'm having like these weird highs where I'm like, let's go look at shirts.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:51.000\nAnd then and then like these weird lows where I'm like, you people in your iced tea.\n\n18:51.000 --> 19:03.000\nAnd but I'm but I feel like it's like it's it's it's better than what I it's happening because I was having a I was having a problem.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:13.000\nSo even though it's resulting in half of the time I'm like a fucking like crazy or the whole time I'm crazy person half of the time I'm an unprofitably crazy person.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:26.000\nLike it still it seems like, OK, well, I'm going to wait and see if that goes like this, like and then what what then I'll be a person that's not on Twitter, but it's also saying.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nYeah, it's a weird thing.\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:31.000\nLike I just was on tour with, you know, Ryan Stiles and Proups and Joel Murray and the gang.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:35.000\nAnd like, we, you know, we have fun and we, you know, we go do comedy shows.\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:40.000\nBut on the bus, all we do is vent about what was in the news that day and we get off our chest.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:43.000\nBut then we have to like, like I'm a moody person.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:49.000\nI go up and down to like, but I feel like my downs are more regular than they used to be.\n\n19:49.000 --> 19:54.000\nLike I'm like I'm in a bad mood more just because of, you know, like just the way things are going right now.\n\n19:54.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd it's nice to be able to go out and do comedy shows and make people laugh and tell stupid jokes and stuff like that.\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:07.000\nBut sometimes it feels almost like disingenuous or dishonest to find any humor in anything.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:10.000\nLike you feel like you're forcing it.\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:13.000\nThat's why I was, I was like, yeah, I'm not even being funny anymore.\n\n20:13.000 --> 20:15.000\nI'm just like arguing with people about shit.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nLike I used to be able to keep my humor about it.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.000\nI was like, like that was my rule.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:23.000\nLike, well, if I can be funny while still letting someone know they're a piece of shit, you know, like,\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nthen that proves they're a piece of shit.\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:31.000\nIf they can't be funnier than me, if they're a piece of shit, then they're like, you know, if I swear, I want to tread lightly here.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:37.000\nBut I say this as an observation of how unfunny they are.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:43.000\nIf a Nazi could ever make anyone laugh, you know, like if there was, if it was possible for them to be remotely entertaining,\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:46.000\nthat would be a really dangerous demographic.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:52.000\nBecause they'd be like, they don't, they're, have you ever, ever, ever...\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.000\nThey can't smile. They don't have pets.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:55.000\nHitler had a dog.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nThey can't smile.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nHitler had a dog.\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:59.000\nFucking Trump doesn't have a dog.\n\n20:59.000 --> 21:02.000\nHe doesn't have a dog.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:04.000\nAnd so Nazis don't have pets?\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:06.000\nWell, Hitler loved his dog more than people.\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:07.000\nI know that.\n\n21:07.000 --> 21:08.000\nYeah.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:12.000\nA lot of people, I mean, a lot of misanthropes are big animal people.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nRob Schrab.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:15.000\nHe's not misanthropic.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:16.000\nOh, dude, yeah.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.000\nOh, no, he loves people.\n\n21:19.000 --> 21:23.000\nAll right, let's just not, let's not get derailed.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nHe loves animals.\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nI don't think he's...\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nOh, Jesus.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:29.000\nYeah, no, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's get our guest up here.\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:30.000\nOh, fuck yeah.\n\n21:30.000 --> 21:31.000\nMy good friend Duncan Tressel.\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nDuncan Tressel!\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:36.000\nIt might take him a...\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:41.000\nCould have used him last week to bring the, is he here?\n\n21:41.000 --> 21:43.000\nHe might have to walk in through the other door.\n\n21:43.000 --> 21:45.000\nDuncan Tressel.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:50.000\nOh, oh boy.\n\n21:50.000 --> 21:52.000\nSorry about that.\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:53.000\nSorry about what?\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:54.000\nI lost track of time.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:57.000\nSo that's okay, that means you're doing God's work.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:58.000\nWhoa.\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:03.000\nSee, I already made the whole room happier.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.000\nNitrous is always doing God's work.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.000\nWell, no, a lot of people used to think that.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:11.000\nThey used to think you could use nitrous oxide to commune with spirits.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nIt's, it was actually in, in that book, the brief history of nearly everything.\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:20.000\nLike if you run out of fuel in your ear-beating cannon and you want to really like fuel up\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:25.000\nand have shit to talk about to just, just beat people's ears into a bloody pulp.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:30.000\nRead that book and apparently some famous scientist was really into nitrous oxide\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.000\nand like used it to commune with angels and stuff.\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:36.000\nSo yeah, it is doing God's work to do nitrous oxide.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:40.000\nI was right.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:42.000\nI had a friend in high school.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nHe was the best dungeon master ever.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:45.000\nWas it Graham?\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:46.000\nYeah.\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:49.000\nWell, yeah, but if he said, I don't know if he's, he might be lit.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:50.000\nI know.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nYou live in the shadow.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nIt's fine.\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nIt's fine.\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nYeah.\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nBut I don't, I don't want to embarrass.\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nI don't want to, if Graham was listening, I don't want to embarrass him.\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nBut, but like he, I, you know, I lost track of him forever.\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:04.000\nAnd then he like, I was like an adult in Milwaukee and he showed up and he had like a big tank\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nof nitrous in a plastic hefty bag.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:08.000\nAnd I just, and it was like, we just-\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.000\nThe best day of your life.\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.000\nYeah.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:15.000\nSucking on a garbage bag and talking about how I'm destined to lead people or something.\n\n23:15.000 --> 23:19.000\nIs there any deleterious brain holes?\n\n23:19.000 --> 23:21.000\nOh yeah, it'll fuck you up.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nIt's not.\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nDoes it hurt your brain?\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:31.000\nWell, what happens is people will make the terrible mistake of putting a nitrous tank\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.000\nin their fucking van, right?\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.000\nThey're like, let's go in the van and do nitrous, man.\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:42.000\nBut they leave the tank on while they're doing balloons and they pass out and the van\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:45.000\nfills up with nitrous oxide.\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.000\nThey don't die.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:51.000\nTheir bodies vibrate into infinity and they vanish.\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.000\nThey level up, kids.\n\n23:53.000 --> 23:55.000\nThey level up.\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:56.000\nIt sounds like dying.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:57.000\nDid you ever see-\n\n23:57.000 --> 23:58.000\nIt sounds like dying.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:00.000\nDid you ever see like a van in van?\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:07.000\nWell, I mean, I would say, I would say just to start off, don't have a van.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nYeah.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:14.000\nBut just doing nitrous like hurt your brain and kill brain cells or anything bad?\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nI mean, dentists give it to you.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:17.000\nThere's competing research.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:20.000\nYeah, but you go to the dentist once or twice a year.\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:25.000\nAm I just a child of Nancy Reagan or just assuming that it gives you brain damage\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:26.000\nbecause I heard that somewhere?\n\n24:26.000 --> 24:30.000\nThere's some isolated cases of brain holes.\n\n24:30.000 --> 24:34.000\nIt's not like all these people are getting brain holes.\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:38.000\nIt's an empathetic. People have been doing nitrous for fucking ever.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:41.000\nAnd there's not like brain holes all over the place.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:43.000\nThere's a few isolated cases.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:47.000\nIt's definitely bad to deprive your brain and body of oxygen.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:52.000\nAnd I would not be surprised if it did cause, but also that depends on the mixture\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:57.000\nbecause if you go like half air and half nitrous, I don't know how bad that is for your brain.\n\n24:57.000 --> 24:58.000\nYou know what you sound like?\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:00.000\nA nitrous oxide dealer.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:03.000\nOh, no.\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:05.000\nI definitely don't have three canisters.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nCan we?\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:10.000\nYou sound like I'm negotiating a nitrous oxide deal with a nitrous oxide.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:11.000\nI don't know, man.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:14.000\nI mean, maybe if we go half your brain will be okay.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:18.000\nIt's $5 a balloon, baby.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:24.000\nIs it irresponsible podcasting for us to get a tank of some balloons for our next show?\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.000\nNo.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:26.000\nNo, no.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nLet's do it.\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nOh, man.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nOh, I know how to do it too.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nI know how to get a tank.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:36.000\nLet me answer that question with a question, which is an irresponsible society to elect a rapist Nazi\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:45.000\nand then just hang out and watch the world fall apart without doing nitrous publicly?\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nSo it's not irresponsible.\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:49.000\nWe can do it then.\n\n25:49.000 --> 25:50.000\nYes, I'm saying this.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nYou're signing off on it.\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nYes, home is burning.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:56.000\nLet's try Yahtzee if you haven't.\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:59.000\nMy advice to everyone, try everything.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.000\nYahtzee.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:01.000\nAnything but Yahtzee.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:02.000\nI got that covered.\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.000\nYahtzee.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:04.000\nYou don't need to try Yahtzee.\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:13.000\nThere's only one lemonade you can get from the lemon of social upheaval, deterioration,\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:14.000\nwhatever we think we're experiencing.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:21.000\nThe only lemonade is people popping like popcorn, having a little controllable nervous breakdown\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:24.000\nand going, well, if this shit's happening, I'm going to try making that birdhouse.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:25.000\nLet's talk.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:26.000\nOkay.\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:30.000\nAnd that guy turning out to be the Frank Lloyd Wright of birdhouses and didn't know it because\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:33.000\nhe was just like, if I keep voting Republican, I'll get rewarded.\n\n26:33.000 --> 26:36.000\nAnd then he's just like, wait, he said what to who?\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.000\nI'm the birdhouse.\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:38.000\nBoom.\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:39.000\nI'm a genius.\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nI never needed to.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:42.000\nI'm a Democrat now.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:46.000\nBut the problem, the problem with Frank Lloyd Wright birdhouses is that they look great,\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nbut they're really uncomfortable.\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:50.000\nWell, also the birds hate him.\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:54.000\nThe birds hate him because Frank Lloyd Wright's gimmick was like trying to like, you know,\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:56.000\ncan you make a home merge with nature?\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:59.000\nAnd the bird's like, what the fuck do you think I'm moving in here for?\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.000\nI wanted a birdhouse.\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\nI want to say the N word so bad.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:05.000\nI want the bird to like sit punctually with the N word.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:06.000\nJust say it.\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:07.000\nNo, no.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:12.000\nWait, look, you just said that you could try anything now that a Nazi maybe isn't one of them.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:14.000\nBut you know, I want to talk to you about this.\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:15.000\nI'm not going to try.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:16.000\nYatsi.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:19.000\nI want to talk to you about this idea of like Rome burning.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:20.000\nAll right.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:32.000\nI was thinking about today, and I was thinking like, okay, if you have to pick an evil monster to deal with in your life,\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:41.000\nwould you rather that evil monster to be smart or would you rather that evil monster to be Donald Trump?\n\n27:41.000 --> 27:42.000\nRight.\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:43.000\nBut I think we've all agreed.\n\n27:43.000 --> 27:48.000\nI mean, we've all had this conversation on each other's podcasts and we've all, we've had nine months to talk about this.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nWe've arrived at it.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nIt's not really him that's bumming us out.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:59.000\nIt's the reveal of the engine underneath our country that made it possible for him to be elected.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:00.000\nYeah.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:02.000\nAnd it's the reaction that everyone's having.\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:03.000\nThis is good.\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:04.000\nNo, he's swell.\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:06.000\nNo, I agree with you.\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:08.000\nYeah, I think we all agree with that.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:13.000\nBut we're like, yeah, if you're going to like, oh, he's like Hitler, but he hasn't done anything yet.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nNo, I don't mean that.\n\n28:14.000 --> 28:15.000\nHe's funny.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nHe's got like clown hair and he's running around.\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:20.000\nBut he probably doesn't fart.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:26.000\nBut the fact that we had to move his sphincter to the crown of his head for his weird experimental hair.\n\n28:26.000 --> 28:31.000\nEvery time, remember the time when he got up and didn't sign the executive order and he was supposed to sign some shit?\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:33.000\nAnd he just got up and walked out.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nMotherfucker, no, you got to do the thing.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:37.000\nHe clearly pooped his pants.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:41.000\nHe made chocolate poopies and had to get the fuck out of there.\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:42.000\nProbably right.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:43.000\nYeah, no.\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nAt his age, I mean, I shit my pants all the time.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:46.000\nYeah.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:49.000\nOn the reg, as the kids say.\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:52.000\nOn the reg, fam.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:53.000\nOh, grandpa.\n\n28:53.000 --> 29:01.000\nIf you get me high enough and I cough and then walk away.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:04.000\nBe glad we weren't carpooling.\n\n29:04.000 --> 29:08.000\nOh, dear Christ.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:17.000\nBut no, I mean, if we thought that we could have just him, but it's what he represents and all that shit.\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:34.000\nI think most of us even, we're like, you know what, now it doesn't even matter what if we, if the blue side of this weird two-headed beast now takes advantage of the nauseating.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nRight.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:39.000\nBut whatever happens next, we all agree, we're more, we're going to be more bummed out about it.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.000\nUniversal healthcare.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:42.000\nBut, but it's universal healthcare.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:57.000\nThat's what happens is you get this bumbling guy who freaks out all of his underlings into the point of trying to jam through these rotten fucking healthcare bills, alerting everyone in the country.\n\n29:57.000 --> 30:01.000\nThis is what happens when you let super wealthy people be in control.\n\n30:01.000 --> 30:02.000\nThey don't care about you.\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:05.000\nThis isn't a new idea that's been happening since the fucking industrial revolution.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:09.000\nSo you have this nice reminder, look what happens when they start running shit.\n\n30:09.000 --> 30:11.000\nThey don't care if you die.\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:12.000\nNow everyone knows it.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:20.000\nAnd then because John McCain has this brain tumor and he doesn't care about getting reelected and he's not in it for politics anymore.\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:26.000\nThis guy stops the whole fucking thing, which means we're one step closer to universal healthcare.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:32.000\nSo I'm not saying this is because Trump is like meaning that to happen or good.\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:39.000\nHe's obviously just this, he's exactly what you would imagine the Antichrist would look like.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.000\nBut still in that, no really, you know, like if you're really...\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:48.000\nDon't you, do you guys, does anyone here look at the Bible and check to see if like anyone's the Antichrist?\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:50.000\nBecause Trump might be the Antichrist.\n\n30:50.000 --> 30:57.000\nWell, yeah, last time I checked the Antichrist had a fatal head wound that he recovered from.\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:58.000\nIt's like a description.\n\n30:58.000 --> 30:59.000\nIs that true?\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:03.000\nYeah, I tweeted it to you because you were talking about something and I was like...\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:04.000\nOh.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:05.000\nBecause we always, you know...\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.000\nI don't always check my Twitter.\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:10.000\nEverybody always thinks the book of revelations is talking about Bill Clinton or whatever.\n\n31:10.000 --> 31:12.000\nYou know, like they always update who it's talking about.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:14.000\nRight, yeah, everyone thought Obama was the Antichrist.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:17.000\nBut one thing's for sure, because I was always going like, well, I've read revelations.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:22.000\nI'm waiting for a guy who gets shot in the head in like a war, but he survives.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:27.000\nAnd then everyone, he's like a war hero because it kind of says, I looked and he had a wound in his head.\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:30.000\nAnd yet he lived or something like that.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:32.000\nI was like, oh God, it's his scalp surgery.\n\n31:32.000 --> 31:33.000\nIt's his fucking...\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:34.000\nOh, no!\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:41.000\nLike if you could, if you were looking at Donald Trump, but you had the X-ray vision provided you by Christ,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:44.000\nyou wouldn't see his fake hair and anything.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nYou'd see him as a ghost and aura.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:50.000\nAnd you'd see at the top of his head just like Darth Vader.\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:57.000\nThere'd be this like amazing, like fucking weird symbol or something like where this weird doctor tried to twist his head\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:03.000\nlike a fucking end of a sausage to make his sideburns turn into his hair.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:09.000\nSomething that hurt him enough that he ran into his wife's bedroom and pulled her hair out and yelled at her.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:17.000\nAnd as she put it, had sex with his semi-hard penis.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.000\nYeah!\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:23.000\nAnd then she wouldn't cry in her mom's room for two days and when she came back her hair was still spread on the bed\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:28.000\nand he was laying there in his bathroom and he said, does it hurt?\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:35.000\nSo logistically, if we want to do nitrous, do we get tanks and balloons up here?\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nI know how to do it.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nI know how to do it.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nI know how to get nitrous.\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:40.000\nI looked it up, I know how to get nitrous.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:45.000\nAre we breaking any kind of criminal codes by doing it?\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nI know how to do it.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nNot if there's a dentist present.\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nNo.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\nYou don't need a dentist.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:54.000\nSo what you do is you apply for a catering license in LA.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.000\nFor real?\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:56.000\nYeah.\n\n32:56.000 --> 33:02.000\nAnd if you apply for a catering license because they have to, I guess caterers are like always making whipped cream or something.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nOh yeah, always.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:04.000\nThey can't get it.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.000\nYou can buy a tank of nitrous up here.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:10.000\nWe're talking about how to score, not how to make it legal.\n\n33:10.000 --> 33:12.000\nNo, let's say you can buy it.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:13.000\nYou can just buy it.\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:17.000\nI can buy, I can go right now and buy some whipped cream chargers.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:21.000\nYeah, you can go buy nitrous little canisters and do whippets.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nYeah, but those are annoying.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nYou get these silver things all over your pocket.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:26.000\nI'm just saying, it's not impossible.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:32.000\nLegally, we're probably not allowed to do a podcast where we get a few recreational purposes.\n\n33:32.000 --> 33:37.000\nBut if you get arrested for that, that's the coolest way to get arrested.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nThere's cool ways to get arrested.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nI just, I want to make sure we know who we're getting into.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:44.000\nI want to get arrested for doing nitrous oxide on harm intent.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:47.000\nAll right, let's fucking do it.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:50.000\nI want to get dragged downtown.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:54.000\nLike the Van Halen video.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:58.000\nWe're in towels for no reason.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:01.000\nPanama!\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nLook it up.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:07.000\nAnd look up that thing where he pulled his wife's hair out of her head.\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:10.000\nThey wore towels in Panama in the video?\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:13.000\nI think, yeah, there was like a shot of David Lee Roth being like,\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nand I don't know if it was fake or, it was probably fake.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:25.000\nBut it was like David Lee Roth in a towel being pulled from a hotel by cops or something.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nOh boy, that's a score.\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\nI think it was Panama, yeah.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:36.000\nAnyways, look, what about that girl in intervention who inhaled the keyboard cleaner stuff?\n\n34:36.000 --> 34:39.000\nIs that, what's the keyboard cleaner?\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:42.000\nThat's not the same as doing nitrous.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:45.000\nNo, that's got to be some kind of other chemical.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nSo she was fucking herself up.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nShe still made it through.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:52.000\nShe emerged, you know, I watched the reunion specials.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nYeah, right, but yeah, I wonder where she's at now, man.\n\n34:55.000 --> 35:01.000\nThat's like the top, that's all the intervention fans' favorite episode because she's just...\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nI'm living the dream!\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:07.000\nThere's a gif of her where she's like,\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nI feel like I'm walking on sunshine.\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nIt's so disturbing.\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:14.000\nThere's a cleaner specific to keyboards?\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:17.000\nWell, it's like circumference keyboards.\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:20.000\nOh wait, I've got a great story about this, man.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.000\nComputer cleaner, like a blast scare.\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:25.000\nOh, I got you, yeah.\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:29.000\nI have some friends in New York who sublet their apartment to somebody\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:33.000\nand they got a call from their landlord and their landlord's like,\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:36.000\nhey, you need to come back and they're like, why?\n\n35:36.000 --> 35:43.000\nAnd he's like, well, because the person you sublet your apartment to is dead on your couch.\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:48.000\nAnd so they come back to the fucking apartment\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:53.000\nand this guy is surrounded by keyboard cleaner.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:57.000\nLike, he went to Target and bought, I guess,\n\n35:57.000 --> 36:00.000\na thousand dollars worth of keyboard cleaner\n\n36:00.000 --> 36:04.000\nand committed suicide via keyboard cleaner\n\n36:04.000 --> 36:07.000\nand he had melted into their couch.\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:11.000\nSo it's just this like purple, bloated, melted corpse\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:16.000\nsurrounded by Target bags and keyboard fucking cleaner.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:18.000\nWhat a dick!\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:24.000\nThat's bad subletting.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:26.000\nThat's like, come on.\n\n36:26.000 --> 36:29.000\nWhatever happens, it matters.\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nThere's so many better ways to live.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nYou're a guest in their house.\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:38.000\nAsimov's four laws of subletting.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:41.000\nFirst, do no cleaners.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:42.000\nHow do you do?\n\n36:42.000 --> 36:43.000\nClean.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:44.000\nYou just inhale it?\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.000\nYeah, I guess you inhale it.\n\n36:46.000 --> 36:49.000\nYou would, I don't know, maybe they put it in a bag\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nand breathe it out of the bag, I'm not sure.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nShe was just sucking on a straw.\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nAnd she had burns on her lips.\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:58.000\nI think you want the propellant or whatever that liquid stuff is.\n\n36:58.000 --> 37:00.000\nI think it's that chemical that they're into.\n\n37:00.000 --> 37:02.000\nBut who knows?\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:07.000\nThey're bottom lines of the intervention episode\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:10.000\nthat they were going to call the animal control\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:12.000\nbecause she had cats that she loved\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:14.000\nbut they were worried about her cats.\n\n37:14.000 --> 37:16.000\nSo I was like, you know, an intervention,\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.000\nyou had to try to find these bottom lines and leverage and stuff.\n\n37:18.000 --> 37:19.000\nSo they pull the trigger on it\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:20.000\nbecause she walks out of the intervention\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.000\nand they're like, all right, call the cops,\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.000\ncall the animal people, but the cats,\n\n37:24.000 --> 37:26.000\nthe cops come to her door\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:29.000\nand she's like hanging out in her bedroom with her sister\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:33.000\nand then someone says like, hey, the police are here\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:36.000\nand she goes like, the po-po?\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nHey, can I say something kind of self-indulgent\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:43.000\njust to add to something that you said before I came out?\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:46.000\nYou said this thing, and you're not on Twitter anymore,\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:49.000\nyou said this thing, I don't even...\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nI'm not going to quote you right to forgive me,\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nbut you said something else, I don't feel like making people laugh.\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nI'm down more than I'm up.\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:58.000\nAnd you know, man, this is really cheesy.\n\n37:58.000 --> 38:01.000\nMaybe somebody could play the national anthem while I say this,\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:06.000\nbut I feel like the moment people like you and you\n\n38:06.000 --> 38:08.000\nstart getting like that,\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:12.000\nthen if there really was some kind of nefarious cobble\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:16.000\nof evil people who wanted to destroy art on planet Earth\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:20.000\nby making artists feel completely hopeless,\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.000\nthen the moment you guys are like,\n\n38:22.000 --> 38:24.000\nI'm not going to go on Twitter anymore,\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:27.000\nI'm not going to do this shit anymore, they fucking win.\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.000\nThey're really winning then,\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nand then the thing that you guys put out in the universe\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:33.000\ngets thwarted by what?\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.000\nSome fucking like, what?\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:38.000\nLike really, that's depressing to me.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:40.000\nThat's part of the bummer of walking away for a minute,\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:43.000\nand it's also part of the hook that keeps you there,\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:47.000\nbut the nice different split is just began off the white\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.000\nand like go away, evolve, come back.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:53.000\nI'm not going to... I didn't delete my account.\n\n38:53.000 --> 38:55.000\nTwitter doesn't have to be a factor in it.\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:57.000\nThe beauty of being on tour,\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.000\nI was on the road for the last couple of weeks,\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:02.000\nis that when you wake up in a bad mood and you turn on the news\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:06.000\nand it's just like, it's shocking and it goes against everything you believe in.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:11.000\nJust simple things like his ties and his fucking, you know,\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nlike the misuse of the English language and all that shit.\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:18.000\nForget about the hatred of women and people of color\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.000\nand fucking every fucking other thing.\n\n39:20.000 --> 39:26.000\nThe great news is that we have to like stay focused enough\n\n39:26.000 --> 39:28.000\nto go on stage and still be funny,\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:31.000\nand then the fact that we get to go do that is awesome.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:34.000\nAnd because when we're on stage, that's the easiest part of the day.\n\n39:34.000 --> 39:37.000\nLike then to go out there and you know, just tell a dick joke.\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.000\nMake the world happy.\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:40.000\nSure, yeah.\n\n39:40.000 --> 39:42.000\nYeah, you're absolutely right.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:45.000\nWe can't just all descend into sadness and darkness.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:47.000\nNo, you have to double fight.\n\n39:47.000 --> 39:48.000\nIt's like that's the thing.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:51.000\nIt's like not only do you have to like not descend into sadness and darkness,\n\n39:51.000 --> 39:53.000\nyou have to like triple activate.\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:56.000\nLike the whole point is like to go the opposite direction,\n\n39:56.000 --> 39:58.000\neven though it is bleak and horrible.\n\n39:58.000 --> 40:01.000\nI mean, it's always seems like God forgive me, man,\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:04.000\nbecause there's no job of a comedian or job of anybody else\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:08.000\nor job of comedy or any of that bullshit.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:14.000\nBut just from a basic like when the darkness grows,\n\n40:14.000 --> 40:17.000\nthen that's when you're really supposed to be shining the light.\n\n40:17.000 --> 40:18.000\nPraise God.\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.000\nAnd if you're not fucking doing that, then what are you doing?\n\n40:21.000 --> 40:22.000\nExactly, I agree.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:25.000\nThe thing about like now, like if you're going to be a comedian,\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:30.000\ncommunity should stick to comedy and leave politics to the experts.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:31.000\nWell, there are no fucking experts.\n\n40:31.000 --> 40:34.000\nLike politicians should stick to politics and not do comedy.\n\n40:34.000 --> 40:37.000\nBut when you go on stage and you tell a joke, it's really funny.\n\n40:37.000 --> 40:38.000\nLike we were in Indianapolis.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:42.000\nYou can talk shit about Mike Pence because they hate him in Indianapolis.\n\n40:42.000 --> 40:45.000\nYou go outside of Indianapolis, they love, it's a red state.\n\n40:45.000 --> 40:46.000\nThey love him there.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:49.000\nBut you can hammer on fucking Mike Pence in Indianapolis.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nBut the thing is when you tell of really,\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nlet's say it's not even a political joke,\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:56.000\nyou just mention him or say something stupid.\n\n40:56.000 --> 41:01.000\nPeople don't feel comfortable laughing about anything political.\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:05.000\nI know that like no one wants to hear Dan and I or our guests or Spencer\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:07.000\nand us talk politics about Trump.\n\n41:07.000 --> 41:08.000\nWe don't have anything new to say.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:10.000\nIt's just us grousing about the same old shit.\n\n41:10.000 --> 41:14.000\nBut when you do a show like, we go out and do improv and do comedy,\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:18.000\nyou can tell some neutral joke and mention Donald Trump or mention Nancy DeVos\n\n41:18.000 --> 41:20.000\nand mention whoever.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:23.000\nPeople that might have laughed don't know who they're sitting next to\n\n41:23.000 --> 41:26.000\nand they don't know if the person next to them is going to be really into that\n\n41:26.000 --> 41:28.000\nor not into that or whatever.\n\n41:28.000 --> 41:33.000\nEveryone is just kind of neutralized and things don't get to be as funny\n\n41:33.000 --> 41:36.000\nbecause no one knows if their parents are going to be pissed off\n\n41:36.000 --> 41:38.000\nor the neighbor is sitting next to them or whatever.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:42.000\nLike comedy, you either have to be not talking about politics at all\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:46.000\nand be hilarious or be Lenny Bruce and be punk rock and George Carlin and shit\n\n41:46.000 --> 41:49.000\nand like fucking be so, so active.\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:50.000\nYou're a comedian.\n\n41:50.000 --> 41:51.000\nI mean, that's the idea.\n\n41:51.000 --> 41:52.000\nIt's like fucking.\n\n41:52.000 --> 41:54.000\nThe idea is like, okay, fine.\n\n41:54.000 --> 41:56.000\nMy instincts are telling me this is funny.\n\n41:56.000 --> 42:00.000\nAnd I'm in some stupid time period where people are incredibly confused.\n\n42:00.000 --> 42:02.000\nOkay, fine.\n\n42:02.000 --> 42:05.000\nWe'll still blast it out there, man, blast it out there\n\n42:05.000 --> 42:08.000\nbecause the moment any of us stop blasting it out there,\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:11.000\nthen if they're, then they win.\n\n42:11.000 --> 42:16.000\nRight, but they win if you keep blasting and you, in my opinion,\n\n42:16.000 --> 42:17.000\nat least this goes for me.\n\n42:17.000 --> 42:19.000\nThere's people out there that are good at being angry\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:21.000\nand we want them to be angry.\n\n42:21.000 --> 42:26.000\nBut I, like if I've lost my humor,\n\n42:26.000 --> 42:30.000\nthen what am I going to fall back on my political science degree?\n\n42:30.000 --> 42:31.000\nI don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.\n\n42:31.000 --> 42:33.000\nLook what Jimmy Kimmel just did.\n\n42:33.000 --> 42:36.000\nNo, Jimmy Kimmel, what he did is he either read,\n\n42:36.000 --> 42:39.000\nhe fucking researched and it was like, that's my point.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:43.000\nLike it was like, that's why I'm like,\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:48.000\nI need to fucking step out of this professional wrestling ring,\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nstop running around with a folding chair\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:52.000\nthat looks identical to everyone else's\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:54.000\nand just being part of the general melee\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:57.000\nbecause part of what the enemy wants you to think is that life sucks\n\n42:57.000 --> 43:00.000\nand that it's chaotic and stupid and all that stuff.\n\n43:00.000 --> 43:05.000\nSo that is why when Lauren Ducca tweets,\n\n43:05.000 --> 43:08.000\nwhen my hero's on Twitter right now,\n\n43:08.000 --> 43:12.000\nthey're the people that are like, they have this insight\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:14.000\nbut then they're also like, they have this grace\n\n43:14.000 --> 43:17.000\nand then you go like, oh, that's an advertisement\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:19.000\nfor being on the good guy's side\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:22.000\nbecause it's not that this stuff isn't important\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:23.000\nand shouldn't make you angry,\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.000\nit's that if you're a billboard,\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nyou can't be a billboard dripping with shit\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.000\nbecause then everyone's like, well, I don't want to buy that razor,\n\n43:29.000 --> 43:30.000\nit's covered in shit.\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nLike that person's not happy.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nLike that person keeps telling me,\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\npeople give me advice all the time,\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:38.000\nlike for 40 years, the reason why I haven't quit drinking yet\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:40.000\nis because everyone that's ever asserted it\n\n43:40.000 --> 43:45.000\nwith any degree of assertion is they're miserable.\n\n43:45.000 --> 43:47.000\nIt's always a deal breaker.\n\n43:47.000 --> 43:49.000\nI'm like, look, man, come up to me.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:52.000\nChris Hardwick's like the biggest billboard for sobriety\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:54.000\nI've ever encountered.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.000\nHe's genuinely a happy, seeming guy.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:59.000\nBut behind his eyes, I think maybe he goes home\n\n43:59.000 --> 44:01.000\nand does stuff to...\n\n44:01.000 --> 44:03.000\nThere's fucking...\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\nThat's none of my business.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:08.000\nI've been to his place and there's target bags\n\n44:08.000 --> 44:10.000\nfucking everywhere.\n\n44:10.000 --> 44:12.000\nBut he...\n\n44:12.000 --> 44:14.000\nI'm just saying, I don't know what's in those bags.\n\n44:14.000 --> 44:16.000\nBut he's like the most pleasant...\n\n44:16.000 --> 44:18.000\nAnyway, I'm just saying,\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:21.000\nif you're telling people to lighten up\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:23.000\nor if you're telling people to...\n\n44:23.000 --> 44:25.000\nYou really ought to know your facts.\n\n44:25.000 --> 44:27.000\nWhenever you're telling somebody else what to do,\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:30.000\nlike, holy shit, you better be happier than them.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.000\nYeah, but with comedy, man,\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.000\nthe thing I always love about it is not so much,\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:37.000\nit's like ethical compass or moral compass.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:40.000\nWhat I love about it is the way it warps reality.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:42.000\nAnd I love the way that, like with comedy\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nand a really great, great comedians,\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:48.000\nwhat they do is, regardless of anything other than just this,\n\n44:48.000 --> 44:51.000\nand now this is not to say, this is how we should act.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:54.000\nComedians should only be funny or comedians should not be funny now or whatever.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:57.000\nI'm just saying, the moment you encounter great art,\n\n44:57.000 --> 45:00.000\nwhether it's comedy or a painting or a movie,\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.000\nyou feel hope.\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nBecause you're like, humans are fucking cool.\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:09.000\nYou start watching comedians warp what's happening right now\n\n45:09.000 --> 45:12.000\nin any kind of way at all that's successful.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nNo matter how lofty or how mundane,\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:19.000\nI think it adds to the sum total of joy in the world.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:21.000\nAnd the more joy there is in the world,\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:24.000\nI just got back from Burning Man.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:28.000\nThe more joy there is in the world,\n\n45:28.000 --> 45:32.000\nthe more chance we have to make sure that we don't do this again.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:35.000\nAnd that's why it's important to fucking fight.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.000\nThank you.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:39.000\nThank you.\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:42.000\nI said Nancy Divos, I meant Betsy Divos.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nI'm still wondering if it's Lauren Duca.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:50.000\nHalf the time I say Lauren DeLuca.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:58.000\nNo, I don't think we're disagreeing on any important points, right?\n\n45:58.000 --> 46:05.000\nI mean, you're saying it's important to be,\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:09.000\nyou're saying it's important to be, for entertainers,\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:12.000\nthat word seems cringe-worthy,\n\n46:12.000 --> 46:16.000\nbut like, they become important.\n\n46:16.000 --> 46:18.000\nI mean, this Kimmel thing, the fact that I'm not on Twitter\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:20.000\nand I heard about the Kimmel thing,\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:23.000\nis why Jimmy Kimmel did a good thing.\n\n46:23.000 --> 46:27.000\nIt raises all this awareness.\n\n46:27.000 --> 46:34.000\nIt's particularly great that it wasn't just some quip.\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:40.000\nIt was also, on top of it, he was passionate in a funny way.\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:43.000\nIt's like making this part of the sideshow,\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:45.000\nthe now front and center.\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:47.000\nThat's why it's so important.\n\n46:47.000 --> 46:49.000\nI agree with all that, and that's exactly why.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:53.000\nI'm just sitting there, arguing with fucking Nazis,\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:56.000\nand going like, I block you, I'm gonna block you.\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:58.000\nI can't believe over the last couple of days,\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:02.000\nI started to like Kim Jong-un, the NFL, and Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:06.000\nYes, it's the apocalypse, baby!\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:09.000\nWhen did quarterbacks become agitators?\n\n47:09.000 --> 47:11.000\nIt's fucking amazing.\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:13.000\nGlory. That's fucked up.\n\n47:13.000 --> 47:15.000\nI can't believe it turns out James Woods,\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:17.000\nwhen he played Roy Cohn, apparently, was doing it\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:19.000\nbecause he thought he was a cool guy.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:23.000\nI didn't know James Woods was a fucking monster.\n\n47:23.000 --> 47:26.000\nI always think of guys playing monsters\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:28.000\nwhen you're casting a monster.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:29.000\nWe need a monster.\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:30.000\nAh, let's get that guy.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.000\nIs that an actual monster that shows up?\n\n47:32.000 --> 47:34.000\nA monster performance?\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.000\nHere we go!\n\n47:36.000 --> 47:39.000\nYou need to do this cocaine, you need to do this cocaine.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:41.000\nCut! Jimmy, great!\n\n47:41.000 --> 47:42.000\nWow, you're amazing.\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:44.000\nI'm conditioned by Hollywood to expect that guy\n\n47:44.000 --> 47:47.000\nto act like Tom Hanks as soon as they call cut.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.000\nWhere's a baby? Let me kiss it.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:56.000\nBut he's just like fucking slime in a human-shaped cup.\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:59.000\nWhat you're saying, I think what we're all saying,\n\n47:59.000 --> 48:01.000\nis you can't just be a comedian\n\n48:01.000 --> 48:03.000\nand go out and tell jokes and have fun now.\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:05.000\nYou have to do two things at once now.\n\n48:05.000 --> 48:08.000\nYou have to be doing squats and push-ups at the same time.\n\n48:08.000 --> 48:11.000\nYou have to still be fighting for what you believe in,\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:13.000\nwhich is not always going to be funny.\n\n48:13.000 --> 48:16.000\nAnd then you still have to smile\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:18.000\nand help other people laugh and do that, too.\n\n48:18.000 --> 48:20.000\nIt just depends on where you land, man,\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:23.000\nbecause it's like some of us believe that like...\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:26.000\nGod damn it, what do they say in Game of Thrones?\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\nChaos is a ladder!\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.000\nWhat do they say? Is that the word?\n\n48:30.000 --> 48:33.000\nBut some people just believe that it's like,\n\n48:33.000 --> 48:35.000\nyes, if you can...\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nWhat I always loved about comedians\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:40.000\nis that comedians get to do whatever they want.\n\n48:40.000 --> 48:43.000\nThat means that if you want to be completely shallow,\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:46.000\nhave nothing to do with politics\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:48.000\nand just blurt out some ridiculous thing,\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:50.000\nyou can do that, it's okay.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:54.000\nAlso, if you feel like you have some\n\n48:54.000 --> 48:57.000\nheady thing to say that has no punchline,\n\n48:57.000 --> 48:59.000\nyou can say that, too.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:01.000\nYou're a fucking comedian.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:04.000\nYou represent the part of the human spirit\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.000\nthat is unconquerable by the gods,\n\n49:06.000 --> 49:08.000\nwhich means that you are ultimately free.\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:10.000\nYou can do whatever you want,\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nno matter who the president is\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nor who the president isn't.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.000\nNo comedian has a moral obligation.\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:18.000\nNo comedian doesn't have a moral obligation.\n\n49:18.000 --> 49:21.000\nBut any time a comedian successfully pulls off real comedy,\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:24.000\nthey're bending space, if you ask me.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:27.000\nAnd that bending of space and time and the paradigm\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:30.000\nand the Gestalt and the archetypes is a fucking miracle.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:32.000\nAnd whenever it happens, people are like,\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:35.000\nholy shit, this is a pretty good universe.\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:37.000\nHurricanes, earthquakes and all.\n\n49:37.000 --> 49:40.000\nAnd that makes people feel a little more excited about being alive.\n\n49:40.000 --> 49:42.000\nAnd that means that my friend's couch\n\n49:42.000 --> 49:44.000\nis up with a fucking rotting corpse on it.\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:46.000\nSomebody's sucking back nitrous oxide.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.000\nI feel like we're just only a couple years away\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:51.000\nfrom when art and politics beautifully merge\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nwhen we have Senator Kid Rock for a guy that's really...\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:57.000\nBecause that's where I get back on board.\n\n49:57.000 --> 50:00.000\nWe're great. People are great.\n\n50:00.000 --> 50:02.000\nWe don't need them.\n\n50:02.000 --> 50:04.000\nThat's the main thing. We don't need them.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nWe're fine. We're going to be fine no matter what.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nThis is fucking Harmontown.\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nWe're fine. This is supposed to be a cult.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:13.000\nWhat happened? We're going to be fucking fine.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:17.000\nWell, we proved it last week.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:20.000\nDan told everyone to go fuck themselves and they're still here.\n\n50:20.000 --> 50:23.000\nThat's exactly what a cult leader does. Come on.\n\n50:23.000 --> 50:27.000\nNext week, I started revealing that I somehow\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:30.000\nneed to sow the seeds of the...\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:35.000\nAnd according to the book of whatever I'm reading,\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:39.000\nit just shakes out that the age of the girl\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:41.000\nhas to be...\n\n50:44.000 --> 50:48.000\nIt was like 10 years from now\n\n50:48.000 --> 50:50.000\nbecause now that we're on live stream and stuff like that,\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:52.000\nthe shots of the audience, you just start noticing\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:54.000\nthat everyone starts wearing the same color.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:57.000\nWe're all wearing white outfits all of a sudden.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:59.000\nLet's do it. Let's all wear white outfits\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:04.000\nand do nitrous oxide and move to the next level of the show.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:07.000\nLet's build...\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nWe'll do a big art installation\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nand we'll build the world's biggest van.\n\n51:13.000 --> 51:15.000\nWe'll all get in that van.\n\n51:15.000 --> 51:18.000\nWe'll all just start doing nitrous together.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nYeah, I'm glad it all happened.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:29.000\nI'm a big piece of shit in a fucking blowhard.\n\n51:29.000 --> 51:31.000\nI've been wrong about everything.\n\n51:31.000 --> 51:34.000\nIt's good to start there. It's like a second childhood now.\n\n51:34.000 --> 51:37.000\nI'm like, oh, man, I didn't know what any of that shit meant.\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nAlso, another side of that thing that you're talking about,\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nwhere comedians are like...\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:44.000\nIt's good that comedians were basically, after the election,\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:47.000\nthey were like, look, man, I can't...\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.000\nWhat do you mean, get back to work?\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:51.000\nGet back to work doing what?\n\n51:51.000 --> 51:53.000\nWhat I was doing before was...\n\n51:53.000 --> 51:55.000\nBut then, as they're explaining that\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nand having to defend themselves,\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.000\nfor me, there was this valve in my head\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:02.000\nwhere I was like, wait, what's the rest of that sentence?\n\n52:02.000 --> 52:05.000\nBecause you need to acknowledge that what you're really saying\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:08.000\nis that you were kind of happy with the way society was before.\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nYou know, you did a lot of fucking complaining.\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:15.000\nYou constantly acted like you were above everything.\n\n52:15.000 --> 52:18.000\nAnd because that was like an easier way to...\n\n52:18.000 --> 52:20.000\nI don't know, it was just easier in general.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:22.000\nIt was easier to live that way, easier to be funny.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:24.000\nAnd so now, that's another good reason why this happened,\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:26.000\nbecause I think comics are like...\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:29.000\nListen, my flowchart, it wasn't...\n\n52:29.000 --> 52:33.000\nWhen I woke up in the morning and looked at a newspaper,\n\n52:33.000 --> 52:36.000\nthen put it out of my head and put my clown shoes on,\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nmy whole thing was that I lived in the world\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:40.000\nthat we were living in together\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:42.000\nand also was entertaining you\n\n52:42.000 --> 52:44.000\nand was able to say whatever I wanted.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.000\nDon't tell me to get back to work and ignore what's going on.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.000\nBut there is that interesting part.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:51.000\nIt's like, oh, because you weren't talking about politics before.\n\n52:51.000 --> 52:53.000\nNot that you should have,\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:55.000\nbut it's interesting then to retroactively go like,\n\n52:55.000 --> 53:00.000\noh, jeez, I guess I liked my bipartisan fucking technocracy.\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:01.000\nI liked my oligarchy.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:05.000\nI liked my thinly veiled or thickly veiled fascism.\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:08.000\nI liked my right of center...\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.000\nWell, I'm glad you have made that at least.\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.000\n...first world empire where my toilet paper was soft\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:16.000\nbecause somehow indirectly it was softened with air of blood.\n\n53:16.000 --> 53:19.000\nIt was like, oh, man, this feels so extra.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.000\nIt's never been proven. It's never been proven.\n\n53:21.000 --> 53:23.000\nBut somehow there's a way to prove it.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:28.000\nI'm sure there was a time when British colonists here\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.000\nwere like, this is great.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.000\nYou know, we're paying a lot of taxes.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nThis is okay.\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:37.000\nOh, man, can you imagine the fucking arguments back then?\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:39.000\nBecause it's like you were committing treason for real\n\n53:39.000 --> 53:41.000\nif you were patriotic.\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:43.000\nYeah, you were a terrorist.\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:47.000\nBut you realize it's like, okay, so you and I are the same age,\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:52.000\nwhich means that we have lived for our entire lives\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:54.000\nwithout the fear of the draft.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:58.000\nSo we've lived our entire lives with these kind of like\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:01.000\noutrageous American wars that happen.\n\n54:01.000 --> 54:03.000\nAmerican wars are really interesting because in most other places\n\n54:03.000 --> 54:06.000\nwhen there's a war, it's like an actual bar fight.\n\n54:06.000 --> 54:08.000\nYou hit the person, they hit you back.\n\n54:08.000 --> 54:12.000\nAn American war, we hit the person, they don't hit us back.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\nAnd when they do hit us back, if they don't hit us back\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:17.000\nin a way that we've deemed the right way to hit us back,\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nthen we call them terrorists.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:21.000\nSo that's an American war.\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:25.000\nSo we've been living in a time period where every single city\n\n54:25.000 --> 54:29.000\nthat we've lived in, thank God, has not been bombed.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:31.000\nI guarantee you don't know what a bomb smells like.\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:32.000\nI sure as fuck don't.\n\n54:32.000 --> 54:33.000\nDon't fucking high road me.\n\n54:33.000 --> 54:35.000\nI'm gonna high road you bitch!\n\n54:35.000 --> 54:37.000\nI grew up in Milwaukee.\n\n54:37.000 --> 54:40.000\nThat's like the Belfast of Wisconsin.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:43.000\nOkay, you know what a bomb smells like.\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:45.000\nYou know what an M80 is?\n\n54:45.000 --> 54:48.000\nMy friend Tony Schumacher almost took his thumb off.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:51.000\nJust imagine a lot of M80s. That's what a bomb smells like.\n\n54:51.000 --> 54:54.000\nWell, you also probably don't know what it smells like.\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.000\nNone of us know, thank God.\n\n54:56.000 --> 54:57.000\nMany of us don't know.\n\n54:57.000 --> 55:00.000\nI hope most of us, all of us don't know what it smells like\n\n55:00.000 --> 55:02.000\nwhen a bunch of people are on fire together.\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:03.000\nWe don't know that.\n\n55:03.000 --> 55:04.000\nThat's an American war.\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:05.000\nWe set people on fire.\n\n55:05.000 --> 55:06.000\nWe blow them up.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:07.000\nWe disintegrate them.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:09.000\nWe're doing it for a very, very long time.\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:14.000\nSo now what's happening is that shit's getting weird for us.\n\n55:14.000 --> 55:16.000\nAnd we don't want it to be weird\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:19.000\nbecause we don't want to get pushed into actual action.\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:20.000\nExactly.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:21.000\nThat sucks.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:22.000\nBut guess what?\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:24.000\nYou've got to fucking do it, man.\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:25.000\nNo.\n\n55:25.000 --> 55:26.000\nYou got to.\n\n55:26.000 --> 55:27.000\nYou have to.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:28.000\nI'm old.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:29.000\nI was almost retired.\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:31.000\nSo was George Washington.\n\n55:31.000 --> 55:33.000\nHe was a soldier when he was young.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:35.000\nHe couldn't tell a lie.\n\n55:35.000 --> 55:36.000\nI can tell them.\n\n55:36.000 --> 55:39.000\nI still have my teeth.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:42.000\nI could just slip at almost 45.\n\n55:42.000 --> 55:44.000\nIt's like a right age to just shut up\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:46.000\nand sneak away with your Trey Parker money\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:49.000\nand just fucking make your cartoon\n\n55:49.000 --> 55:51.000\nmaybe write a Broadway play.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nYou're not going to do that with your money, man.\n\n55:53.000 --> 55:55.000\nYou're going to use that money for better things.\n\n55:55.000 --> 55:58.000\nAnd you're going to use that money, first of all,\n\n55:58.000 --> 56:02.000\nto shelter all of us in some kind of beautiful compound somewhere.\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:05.000\nI have $30,000 in my checking account that is not a lie.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:10.000\nI have spent all of my money on my shitty cartoon studio.\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:12.000\nBut I'm probably going to be a millionaire in a couple weeks\n\n56:12.000 --> 56:14.000\nbecause it's just...\n\n56:14.000 --> 56:16.000\nHe looked at his watch.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:18.000\nHe looked at his...\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:22.000\nHe looked at his fucking Apple iWatch\n\n56:22.000 --> 56:25.000\nbecause he has the stocks app.\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:26.000\nCome on.\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:28.000\nTesla stocks going up.\n\n56:28.000 --> 56:30.000\nI don't have a car, but I invested in Tesla.\n\n56:30.000 --> 56:31.000\nGive him some credit.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:33.000\nCody's still got the Tesla stock.\n\n56:33.000 --> 56:34.000\nWait, wait.\n\n56:34.000 --> 56:35.000\nIs that illegal to tell?\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:36.000\nNo.\n\n56:36.000 --> 56:37.000\nThat's not insider trading.\n\n56:37.000 --> 56:38.000\nI don't work at Tesla.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:39.000\nI don't know.\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:40.000\nCody's got Tesla stock.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:46.000\nHe keeps going up, but it's weird when you have a stock in something.\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:47.000\nYou hear all these...\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:48.000\nThat's not an interesting topic.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:49.000\nHow many stocks?\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:50.000\nThree.\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:51.000\nI don't...\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:55.000\nAlso, you guys, Cody really likes Blue Bonnet at Santa Anita\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:58.000\nin the second race.\n\n56:58.000 --> 56:59.000\nThe Saturdays.\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:00.000\nBlue Bonnet.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:05.000\nI got the horse right here.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.000\nThe name is Paul Rutherford.\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:09.000\nWait, what were we talking about?\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:10.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:11.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:12.000\nFucking revolution, baby.\n\n57:12.000 --> 57:13.000\nWe're talking about revolution.\n\n57:13.000 --> 57:19.000\nWe're talking about the idea that at some point in history, whether you like it or not,\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:20.000\nthings change.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:21.000\nThis is like...\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.000\nIt's no point being a-historic.\n\n57:22.000 --> 57:29.000\nIf you look at history itself inevitably, black plagues, World War IIs, World War Is,\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:36.000\nVietnam's, things happen, shit changes, and when shit changes, then it's up to us, the\n\n57:36.000 --> 57:44.120\npeople, to do something about it and to not be so decimated by the reality of history,\n\n57:44.120 --> 57:49.500\nwhich is that sometimes bad people get in the office and do rotten fucking things, and\n\n57:49.500 --> 57:55.760\nour job is not to pay attention to whatever the current laws of the land are, our job\n\n57:55.760 --> 58:03.240\nis to get a fucking catering license and to buy fucking as much nitrous oxide as we\n\n58:03.240 --> 58:04.240\ncan, man.\n\n58:04.240 --> 58:06.440\nMan, we gotta do it!\n\n58:06.440 --> 58:10.760\nAnd I would also add, I would also add, if you're still at this late date using toilet\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:12.760\npaper with air of blood in it, stop doing that.\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:13.760\nYou know, just try to do it.\n\n58:13.760 --> 58:16.000\nJust get regular toilet paper.\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:19.360\nIt doesn't really affect the white.\n\n58:19.360 --> 58:23.000\nIt just irritates our allies and our enemies abroad.\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:28.840\nYeah, no, I mean, thank you.\n\n58:28.840 --> 58:29.840\nIt's good of you to...\n\n58:29.840 --> 58:32.840\nThis is a good time to get this boost.\n\n58:32.840 --> 58:35.440\nIt's like you're running a marathon.\n\n58:35.440 --> 58:40.400\nWe're very lucky, and realizing that we're lucky is exhausting.\n\n58:40.400 --> 58:42.320\nThat's how lucky we are.\n\n58:42.320 --> 58:45.360\nIt's strenuous realizing how lucky we are.\n\n58:45.360 --> 58:46.440\nThat's hard work.\n\n58:46.440 --> 58:51.520\nIt's like when I do a little dance, when I rap, and then I'm like two days later, I'm\n\n58:51.520 --> 58:55.600\nout of breath, and my doctor's like, what have you done?\n\n58:55.600 --> 58:58.840\nYou gotta start somewhere, and somewhere is like, holy shit, my whole...\n\n58:58.840 --> 58:59.840\nAnd that's what it is.\n\n58:59.840 --> 59:06.240\nIt's been, it's almost been a year, and it's like, not everybody's hitting exhaustion points\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:07.240\nat the same time.\n\n59:07.240 --> 59:12.680\nIt's like, I'm just pulling, I pulled into the Twitter pit stop thing, and was like,\n\n59:12.680 --> 59:17.040\nI'm doing something wrong out there, like I'm not, because I'm not really doing anything\n\n59:17.040 --> 59:18.040\nto...\n\n59:18.040 --> 59:23.600\nI'm getting angry, and I'm like, for all I know, on some chart somewhere, I'm like actually\n\n59:23.600 --> 59:27.080\nhelping the bad guy, because I'm just sort of like driving and angry and like screaming\n\n59:27.080 --> 59:28.080\naround.\n\n59:28.080 --> 59:32.000\nIt doesn't hurt that much to pull over for a second, and go like, okay, why am I out\n\n59:32.000 --> 59:33.000\nthere?\n\n59:33.000 --> 59:34.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n59:34.000 --> 59:35.000\nChange the tires?\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:37.560\nGo back out there with a fucking monster car.\n\n59:37.560 --> 59:41.840\nSome crazy monster mobile or something, that's like you assembled, because you thought about\n\n59:41.840 --> 59:44.640\nit for a second.\n\n59:44.640 --> 59:45.640\nNo promises there.\n\n59:45.640 --> 59:49.440\nI'll probably just go back and promote Rick and Morty, but hey.\n\n59:49.440 --> 59:50.840\nThat's fine too.\n\n59:50.840 --> 59:53.000\nA guy like me gets really rich.\n\n59:53.000 --> 59:57.520\nI can always be one of those Casablanca guys that's like funding stuff under the table\n\n59:57.520 --> 59:58.520\nor something.\n\n59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.520\nLots of people do that, man.\n\n01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.400\nThis venue could be like some kind of like...\n\n01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.400\nLike Rick's Cafe?\n\n01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.400\nYeah, exactly.\n\n01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.000\nI could just be like, come on, I don't do nothing, give me a loan, you Nazi goofs.\n\n01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.440\nAnd then like a comic goes up and goes like, fuck, I don't think you should burn people,\n\n01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.440\nbecause they're not white.\n\n01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:21.600\nAnd then they're like, how do you explain this observation comedy?\n\n01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.760\nHey, Reggie Watts does what he's going to do.\n\n01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.760\nHe's just...\n\n01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.760\nThat's hilarious.\n\n01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.760\nHe thinks off the top of his head, but guys, do you think they give me a script beforehand?\n\n01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.760\nI feel...\n\n01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:33.760\nI feel...\n\n01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760\nPardon me, Mr. Harmon.\n\n01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.480\nI find your impression of Humphrey Bogart a little, a little, a little tune New York\n\n01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480\nJew.\n\n01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:44.080\nI feel like I kind of sound like that Nazi from the Vice Video.\n\n01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.760\nI'm like, man, the Jews, ain't got nothing to drink, Jews, except for a son of a lot\n\n01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.760\nof Jew.\n\n01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760\nI got the Jews in the blanks.\n\n01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.760\nWhat was that guy doing?\n\n01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760\nHe sounded like Bob Hope.\n\n01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760\nAll right.\n\n01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.760\nSorry, what were you...\n\n01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.760\nI was going to say that you guys know Dr. Bronner's soap, right?\n\n01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.760\nYeah.\n\n01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760\nSo, yeah, what's really cool about them is...\n\n01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760\nIt's made of Arabs.\n\n01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760\nDr. Bronner's Stoke?\n\n01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760\nThe soap.\n\n01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760\nDr. Stoke.\n\n01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.760\nDr. Bronner's soap?\n\n01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.760\nThe shit they sell at like...\n\n01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.760\nThe soap that has like a political treatise written on the back of it.\n\n01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760\nYeah.\n\n01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.760\nI know nothing about this, but continue.\n\n01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.760\nIt's fascinating.\n\n01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760\nThe story's fascinating.\n\n01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.240\nSo like Dr. Bronner, Emmanuel Bronner, his entire family died in the Holocaust.\n\n01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:30.160\nAnd he came to the United States, and he like had this like vision basically, he had this\n\n01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.160\nlike message that he wanted to send, and he was like writing, I guess, little pamphlets\n\n01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.200\nthat he was trying to give to people, but he was also making soap, and everybody wanted\n\n01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.440\nthe soap, but nobody wanted the fucking pamphlet with the weird shit written on it.\n\n01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.760\nSo he realized, oh, I'll just put the fucking, the things that I'm saying on the...\n\n01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760\nIt's awesome.\n\n01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.760\nOn the soap.\n\n01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.760\nIt's pretty awesome.\n\n01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.120\nThe interesting thing about that family, the Bronner's family, is they put salary caps\n\n01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.360\non themselves, and then they give everything over that salary cap.\n\n01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.360\nAll right.\n\n01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.360\nI don't like where this is going.\n\n01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.360\nWhere?\n\n01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360\nWhere?\n\n01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.360\nIt's cool.\n\n01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360\nI have $30,000 in my checking account.\n\n01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.360\nI'm 44 years old.\n\n01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.000\nSo you're saying that you're getting like $30,000.\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000\nThat's where you're at.\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nI'm saying when there's a million dollars in that account, I'm not going to put a cap\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000\non it yet.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.680\nI want to see if it can be two.\n\n01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680\nJust for a second.\n\n01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:27.040\nBut the point is, the moment you do start figuring out ways to harness money energy\n\n01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.040\nand not using it just for yourself, you can start doing shit.\n\n01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.600\nWhat they do is they give money to psychedelic therapy.\n\n01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.520\nThey've given, I think, over a million dollars to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic\n\n01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.440\nStudies just to work on MDMA with PTSD, and they give money to all kinds of groups like\n\n01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.440\nthat.\n\n01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.680\nAnd that is like one form of being revolutionary is actually using your talent to get a bunch\n\n01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:56.160\nof dough, and then instead of keeping that money, giving that money to implicitly subversive\n\n01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.760\norganizations that are going to like transform society in their own way.\n\n01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.440\nThat's how you really would start creating cool ripples, you know?\n\n01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440\nThere's also-\n\n01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.440\nGive your money away, you pig!\n\n01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.440\nTell him to give his money away, people!\n\n01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.440\nTake it from him!\n\n01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.440\nI don't have it yet!\n\n01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.440\nI don't have it yet!\n\n01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440\nI don't have it yet!\n\n01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.440\nI don't have it yet!\n\n01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440\nTake it from him!\n\n01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440\nI'll tweet his address!\n\n01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440\nYou can go to his house!\n\n01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.440\nHe just told us in a week he's going to be a millionaire, so fuckin' yeah.\n\n01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.440\nCan I be one for a week then after that?\n\n01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440\nHow do you-\n\n01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.440\nYou have 19 TV shows.\n\n01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.440\nHow do you have $30,000?\n\n01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.440\nI'm paying for all of them!\n\n01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.440\nYou think when you go pitch a show and they say, we'll take it, they give you money?\n\n01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440\nThey take money!\n\n01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.440\nYou have to go develop the show now!\n\n01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.940\nIt's a fuck-up business, man!\n\n01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.440\nI did a really dumb thing opening a studio.\n\n01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440\nIt's like opening a restaurant.\n\n01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.440\nIt's like, wait, what are you doing?\n\n01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.440\nYou don't see any other restaurants around here?\n\n01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440\nWhat are you trying to be?\n\n01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440\nSony?\n\n01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440\nYou fuckin' moron?\n\n01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440\nThey owe people money!\n\n01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.440\nThey're Sonyed!\n\n01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:59.440\nThe studios report a loss every year!\n\n01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.940\nBut along the way, I've hooked up with some cool people.\n\n01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.440\nNot hooked up in the millennial sense, I don't know.\n\n01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.440\nI've met some cool people and I like to think there will be shows now coming that I'm excited\n\n01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.440\nabout that maybe wouldn't have existed if I didn't go put my big pumpkin on the table\n\n01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.440\nor TBS and go like, plus I'll be there!\n\n01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.440\nAren't you making that big Rick and Morty money?\n\n01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.440\nIsn't that a thing?\n\n01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440\nThat's why I'm going to be a millionaire soon.\n\n01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.440\nCan I see your watch?\n\n01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440\nWhat do you have on there?\n\n01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.440\nWhat does it say, an alert?\n\n01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.440\nIt's just a pentagram.\n\n01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:40.440\nIt keeps looking at a pentagram, what is that?\n\n01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440\nA minute ago it was 9-11?\n\n01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.440\nYeah, that's what it says, 9-12.\n\n01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.440\nYou're one of those guests that they gave the ultimate compliment to.\n\n01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.440\n9-11 came and they didn't say anything.\n\n01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440\nThey kind of did.\n\n01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.440\nWe were making noise at the time.\n\n01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.440\nWhat kind of noise?\n\n01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.440\nGeneral cheers.\n\n01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:11.440\nGeneral cheers are part of a duty.\n\n01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.440\nHow's your testicle?\n\n01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440\nYou beat cancer.\n\n01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.440\nStill gone.\n\n01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.440\nDo you still have to go in every six months and make sure they're not coming back or anything?\n\n01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.440\nNo.\n\n01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.440\nThey eventually just go, you're free and clear or do they just keep it lengthened?\n\n01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.440\nYou can make a decision about that.\n\n01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.440\nYou can make the decision based on statistics.\n\n01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.440\nYou can go in for a certain number of scans.\n\n01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.440\nYou can go in for a bunch of scans.\n\n01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.440\nYou can go in for as many as you want.\n\n01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:46.440\nEvery scan you go for, they're looking at your body to see if the thing is spreading.\n\n01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:55.440\nAt one point I realized, I just don't want to keep getting like fucking MRIs and CAT scans and stuff and lung x-rays.\n\n01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.440\nI'm just going to see what happens.\n\n01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.440\nIf I die, then I'm going to die of that, I guess.\n\n01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.440\nSo far I feel great and everything's fine.\n\n01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.440\nIf I kick the bucket, forgive me.\n\n01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.440\nI told that to him.\n\n01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:08.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:11.440\nI think if you kick the bucket, the general rule is you're forgiven.\n\n01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.440\nNot all the time, man.\n\n01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.440\nIt's a couple of people.\n\n01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.440\nEveryone just kind of spits.\n\n01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.440\nThe way cancer really fucked me up was not the physical stuff.\n\n01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.440\nThe way it fucks you up is it teaches you about impermanence.\n\n01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.440\nThat's a really rough thing because it's like we live in a society that doesn't really understand impermanence.\n\n01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:40.440\nI remember before cancer, I'll go and look at my podcast before cancer and I'll just think about the way I was before cancer.\n\n01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.440\nAnd it's awesome because you're like running around.\n\n01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.440\nYou're like, I'm fucking going to live forever.\n\n01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440\nYou're reading Ray Kurzweil.\n\n01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.440\nYou're like, shit man, I think I really might be one of the people who lived with me a thousand.\n\n01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.440\nThey're going to turn racks into computers in 2040.\n\n01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.440\nYou believe it.\n\n01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:05.440\nSo it's kind of what's really funny about fucking cancer is it does the exact same thing to you that the IRS does your bank account.\n\n01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:09.440\nBecause everybody has a temporal bank account.\n\n01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:18.440\nSo everybody has this like, if you haven't really tasted death, you probably have a bank account filled with all these years.\n\n01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:23.440\nAnd you run around acting like a fucking trust fund kid because you're like, man, I got this bank account.\n\n01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.440\nIt's fucking stocked with years.\n\n01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.440\nYou go to the ATM.\n\n01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.440\nYou're like, look at all those fucking years, man.\n\n01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.440\nThat's awesome.\n\n01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:32.440\nI'm fucking got so many years.\n\n01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:39.440\nAnd then when you get cancer, you're like, oh fuck, I might overdraft.\n\n01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:45.440\nI owe 40 years.\n\n01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:54.440\nAnd what that does to you is simultaneously obviously tragic, but one of the most beautiful gifts of all time.\n\n01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:08.440\nAnd because what it gives you is this like incredible connection with the now because you're like, you realize like, oh my God, this big fucking lie about how long I think I'm going to live or how long people think they're going to live.\n\n01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.440\nThis is just another fucking lie, man.\n\n01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:24.440\nThey want you to believe you're going to live to 70, 80 years because if you believe that and you're starting investing in like 401ks and responsible living and you're going to be like, but really the reality of it is, is like, lots of you aren't going to live past tonight.\n\n01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:30.440\nAnd this is fucking shit.\n\n01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.440\nAnd there are no doors.\n\n01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440\nThat's a cheap joke.\n\n01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.440\nOf course, there's always my way.\n\n01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:49.440\nYeah, I watched a Jones house documentary and I realized what they did wrong is they didn't just have the they used Kool-Aid.\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:51.440\nThey didn't just have an open bar.\n\n01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.440\nSo good night.\n\n01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.440\nWould have been so much easier for him.\n\n01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:05.440\nYou know, you hear those Jones house recordings and you're like, dude, why didn't you just, Jesus, if you really want these people dead that bad and you don't have to do this soft shoe.\n\n01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440\nYeah, just kill them.\n\n01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.440\nMy God, he had to do so much explaining.\n\n01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440\nHe's like, come on, don't cry.\n\n01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440\nIt's going to be okay.\n\n01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440\nThe line.\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440\nYou're just dying.\n\n01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.440\nThat's all the line that gets to me.\n\n01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.440\nThis is the line that gets to me.\n\n01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.440\nMothers, mothers, mothers, stop your children from crying.\n\n01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.440\nWe are merely crossing over to the other side.\n\n01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440\nThem first.\n\n01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440\nYeah.\n\n01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.440\nThey can't do you.\n\n01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.440\nYeah, that is fucking insane.\n\n01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.440\nI know somebody who's, wait, who was I just talking to?\n\n01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.440\nHe's like working on a Jones top thing and like, God, now my mind is such a fucking fart.\n\n01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.440\nAnyways, but yeah, there's documents.\n\n01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:49.440\nI mean, like, I'm not recommending you go to like a horrible green place, but it's okay.\n\n01:09:49.440 --> 01:10:00.440\nI guess, you know what, watch the Ken Burns Vietnam thing too, because I'm going to, because that's one of the things too, is like not to normalize what's happening now, but it actually is a little uplifting to remember or rather know.\n\n01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.440\nI was a little child in 19, I was a baby in 1973.\n\n01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.440\nSo, but it's like, they were fucking like, there's a lot of parallels, like just in terms of the national psyche.\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:20.440\nLike they kind of, people back then were as groovy as they were, because they too, like us, felt like every day could be the last day of America.\n\n01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440\nAnd they really felt that that's what was at stake.\n\n01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440\nThey had a lot of reasons to feel that way.\n\n01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:30.440\nAnd yeah, and I just watched Network again too, which is taking place at that time.\n\n01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.440\nNetwork is kind of a gay romp.\n\n01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:43.440\nThe jokes that they're doing in the background about how, you know, President Ford's life has been threatened by this and that, they're kind of like, they're just setting the time and place.\n\n01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.440\nIt's like, oh God, yeah, we were, the 70s were like a crazy time.\n\n01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.440\nSure.\n\n01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.440\nIt's not to say that it's not to normalize.\n\n01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.440\nIt's to feel a sisterhood with the 70s.\n\n01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.440\nWatch the Ken Burns thing.\n\n01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440\nWatch that.\n\n01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:57.440\nThere's a great documentary on the weather underground that you should watch.\n\n01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.440\nIt's really fucking cool.\n\n01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440\nAnd these guys, they're...\n\n01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.440\nYeah, you know what else you should watch?\n\n01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.440\nSpider-Man!\n\n01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.440\nSomething by Jane Austen or something.\n\n01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.440\nNo, they're...\n\n01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.440\nYou guys are dumb.\n\n01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.440\nYou guys aren't dumb.\n\n01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.440\nYou should watch.\n\n01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440\nWhat were you watching?\n\n01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.440\nGuardians too.\n\n01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.440\nYeah.\n\n01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.440\nJane Austen didn't write it.\n\n01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.440\nI finally saw Guardians too.\n\n01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440\nI really liked it.\n\n01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440\nWas it good?\n\n01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.440\nBecause I famously kind of, I think I may have let it slip then.\n\n01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.440\nI didn't get the fucking hysteria about Guardians 1.\n\n01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440\nI liked it.\n\n01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:43.440\nSo I put off watching Guardians 2 for a long time because I was like, these people are nuts about the Guardians thing.\n\n01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:50.440\nSo I don't want to watch the sequel because I felt like there were just so many purple people yelling and I couldn't tell the difference between any of the characters.\n\n01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440\nSounds like DMT.\n\n01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.440\nRocket Raccoon deserves more than to have a camera push on him and then say, yeah.\n\n01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440\nThat's not clever.\n\n01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.440\nThe camera pushes us and you say more than yeah.\n\n01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.440\nSo I was like, I don't get this.\n\n01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.440\nThis movie isn't like Citizen King.\n\n01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440\nSo I watched the second one.\n\n01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440\nI was like, oh man, I love this Drax guy.\n\n01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440\nHe's so great.\n\n01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.440\nI love this Raccoon.\n\n01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.440\nI was like, this is really cool.\n\n01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.440\nWasn't Steve Agee in the second one?\n\n01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.440\nYeah, he was.\n\n01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440\nWhich I forgot.\n\n01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.440\nAnd then all of a sudden Steve Agee's just like, amazing.\n\n01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440\nYeah, that's great.\n\n01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:25.440\nIf the apocalypse needed to happen for Steve Agee to be in Marvel movies.\n\n01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.440\nYeah.\n\n01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440\nFine, I'll take it.\n\n01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.440\nI'd love to be around Steve Agee in the apocalypse.\n\n01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440\nI don't want Steve Agee to be in every Marvel movie from now on.\n\n01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440\nI hope so.\n\n01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.440\nI haven't seen it yet, but like the stills I've seen, he looks fucking awesome.\n\n01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.440\nYeah, he's a little space pirate.\n\n01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:47.440\nOh, but the weather underground, not to be like too preachy or something, but like definitely check it out because it's cool because there's the weather underground.\n\n01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:54.440\nLike Obama would actually get in trouble because he was friends with one of the members, but their motto was bring the war back home.\n\n01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:00.440\nSo they actually decided that they were going to start blowing up buildings and they did.\n\n01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.440\nAnd the way they did it is they would call the building and make sure no one was there because they didn't want them to get killed.\n\n01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:13.440\nBut it was an example of an American revolutionary movement that was like maybe a little fueled by psychedelics.\n\n01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.440\nLike they're just like in the documentary, they talk about being in their van, no nitrous, but like fucking...\n\n01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440\nHere we go again.\n\n01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:30.440\nLike just being in the van, they're all like having an orgy in a van as they're driving to like put explosives in a government building to blow up, to protest the Vietnam War.\n\n01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:41.440\nAnd when you look at that and just throw your moral compass away, but just when you look at that, you realize how great people really are.\n\n01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.440\nBecause you really, because you realize like these people don't need to do that.\n\n01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.440\nThey could just fucking ignore the Vietnam War like anybody else.\n\n01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.440\nThey could just ignore it, ignore it, go to your job.\n\n01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.440\nWe're all doing fine, man. We're fine.\n\n01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.440\nYou guys have money. I don't have much you have. You have a little bit. You're not starved. We're fine.\n\n01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.440\nSo it's easy to ignore, which is what they want.\n\n01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.440\nSo it's kind of cool when people are like, fuck this, we're not ignoring anymore.\n\n01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:14.440\nAnd then they go to this extreme place, which I obviously am not advocating in any way, but still it represents what can be done.\n\n01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:21.440\nAnd it's a really inspirational thing to watch because you realize like shit, man, we could be doing a lot more than we're doing.\n\n01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.440\nYou know, we can be doing lots, lots more. And if we all start doing lots...\n\n01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.440\nWe can also build a birdhouse. You don't have to blow anything up.\n\n01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.440\nBlow up a birdhouse.\n\n01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.440\nThere were a lot less people in the world back then. There was probably an easier...\n\n01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.440\nAnd the Vietnam War?\n\n01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440\nIt was easier to blow up a building with no one in it.\n\n01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440\nI would say these days.\n\n01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.440\nI'm not saying blow up buildings. I'm not advocating that level of violence.\n\n01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:50.440\nAnd also, and I will admit this, when the Antifos started punching people, I was definitely having conversations like, you know, I think they've gone too far.\n\n01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.440\nBut one of the things, then I started researching them a little bit, and this will get me in trouble on the internet,\n\n01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:02.440\nbecause anytime you do any kind of emphasis on like, maybe that's not so bad, you will immediately get a bunch of tweets like,\n\n01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.440\nyou fucking idiot, do you know what you've done?\n\n01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.440\nWell, I'm not on Twitter. Maybe Antifa is not so bad. Like, very happy to say that.\n\n01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.440\nWell, one of the cool things that they... Oh, maybe some of them are here.\n\n01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:21.440\nOne of the cool things that they say, or one of the cool... You know, so people break windows in these protests.\n\n01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.440\nAnd they break these windows, and people are like, how could you break windows of local businesses?\n\n01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.440\nAnd Antifa, they call those people window protectors.\n\n01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:36.440\nThey're like, oh, you want to protect windows? That's what you're worried about, fucking windows?\n\n01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.440\nMaybe we can form an alliance at some point. In my world, all the windows are going to break.\n\n01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.440\nYes, exactly.\n\n01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:50.440\nThe ones that aren't broken will be polished by Nazis, so I'm breaking a couple windows to get you talking, or whatever.\n\n01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:57.440\nI'm not going to justify their stuff. I'm so... I'm just, as I said on your podcast, I'm just so fucking grateful that, like,\n\n01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:04.440\nthat not all kids are just... All kids are hooligans, right?\n\n01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.440\nSo I'm so grateful to my hooligan kids who are like, I'm going to be a hooligan today.\n\n01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:17.440\nWhere do I direct my hooliganism? Towards fucking... Towards the man.\n\n01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:24.440\nTowards Nazis. I'm going to fucking... If they didn't do that, then we'd be extra fucked.\n\n01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440\nI'm definitely going to complain about them last.\n\n01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.440\nWe'll complain about them last. And I will admit, man, I did complain about them in the beginning.\n\n01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.440\nAnybody in the Antifa listening, I'm sorry, they don't forgive, so I guess they're going to hate me.\n\n01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440\nBut like, the...\n\n01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.440\nI want to have somebody from Antifa. It's someone from Antifa, I think.\n\n01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.440\nIsn't that kind of a silly thing? They don't have a letterhead, right?\n\n01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.440\nI think they're decentralized.\n\n01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.440\nWe've got somebody from Antifa here. Steve Levy to stage. Steve Levy is going up there.\n\n01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.440\nAre you serious?\n\n01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.440\nOne of the...\n\n01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.440\nHe's the spokesman.\n\n01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.440\nFrom the public chapter of Antifa.\n\n01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440\nI want to have also...\n\n01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.440\nAnybody listening who cares about this stuff, who's like the platform and all the stuff and how you're using it.\n\n01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.440\nI had Gotham Girl come on, she's an Eleanor Democrat.\n\n01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.440\nShe talked about believing in the system and the election was fraudulent.\n\n01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:23.440\nI wanted her to have her signal boosted for that reason. I also want to have, therefore, somebody from the DSA,\n\n01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.440\npeople have been tweeting me and stuff, and somebody from Antifa.\n\n01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.440\nYou guys have always been so kind to...\n\n01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:36.440\nI want to sprinkle those folks in because it's like turbulent times.\n\n01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.440\nI just wanted to say that out loud so you didn't think that I was like...\n\n01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.440\nBiast.\n\n01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.440\nWell, I don't care if I'm biased. I don't know anything. I don't know enough.\n\n01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.440\nI want to have people on that talk about what to do because I don't know what to do.\n\n01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.440\nSo I want to talk to the people that are like...\n\n01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.440\nI don't care if they're doing shit that's ugly, whatever.\n\n01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440\nI want to talk to them.\n\n01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.440\nAnyways, wait, what?\n\n01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.440\nWhat?\n\n01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440\nNothing.\n\n01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.440\nHow you doing Levy? How's things?\n\n01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440\nThings are good.\n\n01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.440\nYeah?\n\n01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.440\nLast time I saw you a couple weeks ago, you were a little down on the dumps.\n\n01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440\nYeah, you know, it happens.\n\n01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440\nWhy?\n\n01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440\nHow why do people get down on the dumps? What happened?\n\n01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.440\nOh, I guess I have my heart broken.\n\n01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.440\nOh, that's the worst.\n\n01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:25.440\nThere we go. Here we go again.\n\n01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.440\nOh, boy. I guess I had my heart broken.\n\n01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.440\nCan you talk about what happened?\n\n01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.440\nWell, you know hearts.\n\n01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:45.440\nYeah, an old friend of mine, we started seeing each other for the first time, really,\n\n01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.440\nand trying to make it work.\n\n01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:53.440\nShe was in New York, and we were seeing each other back and forth a little bit.\n\n01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.440\nAnd then the last time I saw her, we parted ways.\n\n01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:04.440\nYou guys went there after a lifetime of childhood, sweet, hearty,\n\n01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440\nFox in the Hound shit.\n\n01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.440\nI guess, as you would say, we had a real will they won't they?\n\n01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440\nRight.\n\n01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.440\nAnd now the question has been answered, and they won't.\n\n01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.440\nYou don't know that.\n\n01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.440\nWell, no, I do know. That's what he's saying happened.\n\n01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440\nI'm not trying to...\n\n01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:30.440\nYeah, well, after all those years, I guess they will, and now they won't.\n\n01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.440\nRight. Well, they did.\n\n01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.440\nThey did.\n\n01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440\nNo, they won't.\n\n01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440\nNow they don't.\n\n01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440\nWait, no.\n\n01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.440\nThat's the question. That's more of a did they don't they?\n\n01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:45.440\nNo, they didn't. They did. Now they're not, but they might again.\n\n01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440\nIs there a might they could there?\n\n01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440\nAnd I don't want to...\n\n01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.440\nI'm a totally unbiased objective observer.\n\n01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.440\nI have no agenda about like setting you up or wingmaning you or anything.\n\n01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.440\nI just, I heard through the grapevine that the reason it didn't work.\n\n01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:03.440\nShe complained about something like, like your penis was naturally ribbed and...\n\n01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.440\nYeah, I heard that too.\n\n01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.440\nAnd giant.\n\n01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.440\nAnd then it was not...\n\n01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.440\nIt was self lubricating.\n\n01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.440\nYeah, and it vibrated.\n\n01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:13.440\nThat's what I heard.\n\n01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.440\nI heard this crazy thing like you can't control how fast it vibrates.\n\n01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.440\nShe didn't like that it happened.\n\n01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.440\nIt also had a little prong that came out, which is right on the clip.\n\n01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.440\nYeah.\n\n01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.440\nIs that true?\n\n01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.440\nIt's a curse.\n\n01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:25.440\nIt's shaped like a rabbit.\n\n01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.440\nYeah.\n\n01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:30.440\nRight on the top, there was like a, right on the back of the helmet, there's like a pair\n\n01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.440\nof rabbit ears that come out and go like that.\n\n01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.440\nYou got a crazy cock, man.\n\n01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.440\nA little too crazy for some unlucky woman.\n\n01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.440\nSome girls aren't ready for the perfect cock.\n\n01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.440\nCause that's what we're finding out.\n\n01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:01.440\nAnd your dick just come back from Texas where it was helping move sandbags for flood victims?\n\n01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.440\nI thought it was Puerto Rico.\n\n01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.440\nWith Ryan Gosling and...\n\n01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.440\nI thought the problem was whenever there was a disaster in the world, your cock would\n\n01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.440\ndetach and slide to the disaster.\n\n01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:19.440\nAnd those are right now a restoring cell service in Puerto Rico.\n\n01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:26.440\nOh, can I ask, I want to say, I have a question.\n\n01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.440\nLike, don't you think, I was telling Cody, cause I was like hungover.\n\n01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:37.440\nI don't know how to share my, you guys don't want to picture me having sex, but I was like,\n\n01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.440\nI was having this conversation where I was like, I just, I made some observation where\n\n01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:47.440\nI was like, cause I was, I was like, don't you think it takes a lot of water to, to result\n\n01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:50.440\nin a load of cock?\n\n01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.440\nAnd she was like, what are you talking about?\n\n01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440\nIt's like, it's as much water as there is.\n\n01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.440\nI'm like, no, it's not like a recipe.\n\n01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.440\nYou don't like put a little bit of, your body doesn't put a little bit of water in a, in\n\n01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:03.440\nyour balls and then put a little bit of, of sperm powder.\n\n01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.440\nAnd like, there's a process.\n\n01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.440\nLike, and don't you, don't you think it takes a certain amount of water and a certain amount\n\n01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.440\nof sandwiches?\n\n01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:18.440\nLike how many, like, what do you think like a load of, a load of, of, of ejaculate, of,\n\n01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:23.440\nlike, which is like, I think it's like 500 million sperm are in a, in an ejaculate.\n\n01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.440\nSo there's this whole process that you've, you know, the sperm,\n\n01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.440\nI just read it's 1.2 terabytes of data.\n\n01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440\nWait, shut up.\n\n01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440\nWait, I actually did see this too.\n\n01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.440\nYou mean genetically?\n\n01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440\nYeah, genetically.\n\n01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440\nThe DNA in a sperm equals.\n\n01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:39.440\nIt was like one sperm is equivalent to 35 megabytes.\n\n01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.440\nI don't know if it's really.\n\n01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440\nIt's 1.2 terabytes.\n\n01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.440\nOne sperm is half the information that takes to make a person.\n\n01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.440\nHow much, how much, how much data is in a person's DNA?\n\n01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.440\nI expect it to be more than 1.2 terabytes.\n\n01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.440\nIt's amazing that it's just 1.2 terabytes.\n\n01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.440\nDoesn't it imply that a full human being is 2.4 terabytes?\n\n01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.440\nNo, it implies when you're downloading stuff into your computer, it's having orgasm.\n\n01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:00.440\nSorry.\n\n01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440\nSay what?\n\n01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440\nWhat is?\n\n01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:10.440\nWe have either a computer science major or a chronic masturbator.\n\n01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440\nThe two can happen together.\n\n01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440\nI don't know which it could be.\n\n01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.440\nThe two can happen at once, Dan.\n\n01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.440\nIt's impossible for it to be both.\n\n01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.440\nYou're saying it's 124 terabytes.\n\n01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.440\nAre you correcting the data of the sperm?\n\n01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.440\n124 terabytes?\n\n01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.440\nYeah, right.\n\n01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.440\nJust so you know, I did my doctoral thesis on college cum.\n\n01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.440\nAnd it's 1.2.\n\n01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.440\nOkay, well, so, yeah, well, that's, I mean, that really is like we're coming up on the,\n\n01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.440\nI mean, because the, they're coming up on them.\n\n01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.440\nLike we're getting, so we're getting close to like, you know, well, wait, well,\n\n01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440\nwhat we have, what is it, petabytes is next?\n\n01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.440\nLike, that's the next highest thing.\n\n01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.440\nWe, obviously we have the, whatever, we've mapped the human genome.\n\n01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.440\nI'm not, what am I, my grandpa?\n\n01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.440\nI'm just like, like pretty soon teleportation, man.\n\n01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.440\nOnce you can store everything.\n\n01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.440\nI don't, teleportation is bad news, man.\n\n01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.440\nYou know about like, once you teleport, you're dead, you know?\n\n01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.440\nI mean, that philosophical thing.\n\n01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.440\nYeah, that's true though.\n\n01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440\nCause like, you can't prove it.\n\n01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.440\nI can't prove it's me.\n\n01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.440\nYeah.\n\n01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.440\nLet me ask you this.\n\n01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:28.440\nIf, if you could, if you could pick, but like, so you got to fly across the country.\n\n01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:35.440\nAnd if you could pick teleportation, but you've got to get kicked in the balls.\n\n01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.440\nOr like flying on an airplane.\n\n01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440\nWhat do you pick?\n\n01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:44.440\nI never want to teleport because it'll be, that's like going in a suicide booth.\n\n01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.440\nIt kills you.\n\n01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.440\nThat would be the amazing thing when they invent teleportation.\n\n01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.440\nEventually there'll be a society, I think we'll be dead, but there will be this like\n\n01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.440\nconcept of like, virgins, you know, people who haven't been teleported.\n\n01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440\nThat's right.\n\n01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440\nAnd people will start saying like, oh, you should talk to Gary.\n\n01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.440\nWhen Gary talks, you can kind of sense that he was using the cells that he was born with.\n\n01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.440\nYeah, cause we can't even fucking print.\n\n01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.440\nI only date teleporters.\n\n01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440\nBlack and white ink.\n\n01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.440\nWe can't print anything without fucking errors.\n\n01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.440\nYou think we can print people back out of a fucking...\n\n01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440\nNot yet!\n\n01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.440\nYou can't even copy a fucking jpeg.\n\n01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.440\nNo, we'll be so fucked.\n\n01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.440\nYeah, yeah, for sure.\n\n01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.440\nAnd that's your brain.\n\n01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.440\nIt's like, you come out and you're like, I don't know Spanish anymore.\n\n01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.440\nAnd it's like, that's if you're lucky.\n\n01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.440\nYou'll be so fucked.\n\n01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:28.440\nAnd you know who's going to say, you never knew Spanish?\n\n01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.440\nThe fucking dipshit that works behind the teleporter.\n\n01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440\nYeah.\n\n01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440\nThat's teleported himself a million times a day.\n\n01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.440\nAnd he's just like, no, it's great.\n\n01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:41.440\nBut you're assuming the mechanism of teleportation is based on the disintegration, reintegration\n\n01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440\nof the human like atomic structure.\n\n01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440\nWhat if it's some kind of like...\n\n01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.440\nLike wormhole?\n\n01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.440\nPestoract.\n\n01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440\nWhat if it's some kind of wrinkle in time shit?\n\n01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.440\nI'm down with that.\n\n01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.440\nSo yeah, it's cool.\n\n01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440\nIt's got teleporting.\n\n01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440\nThat's what's scary.\n\n01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.440\nYeah.\n\n01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.440\nYeah, no.\n\n01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.440\nOh, portals like walking through a door into another place.\n\n01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440\nThat's safer.\n\n01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440\nYeah.\n\n01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.440\nHave you read Ringworld?\n\n01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440\nNo, no.\n\n01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.440\nIt's great.\n\n01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.440\nBut Ringworld is super cool because it's like Larry Niven and it's like way in the fucking future.\n\n01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:10.440\nBut in this world, there is teleportation.\n\n01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.440\nI don't know if it's like bending the time space continuum or like destroying your atomic\n\n01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.440\nself and reintegrating it or whatever.\n\n01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.440\nBut what's interesting about it is like, there's no such thing as like any one city.\n\n01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:29.440\nAll cities have become one massive city because there's no longer any kind of like distance\n\n01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440\nbetween cities.\n\n01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:36.440\nSo what happens on this like super futuristic earth, which is really cool, is that...\n\n01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.440\nAnd also they've gotten to the level where they can like change their skin pigment.\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:46.440\nSo suddenly the fashions on the planet change like day to day because everyone's so super\n\n01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440\nconnected.\n\n01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:53.440\nAnd then one day people just start glowing or like certain like star patterns will appear\n\n01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.440\nin people's faces and stuff because they become so interconnected that like...\n\n01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440\nI guess I'm petty.\n\n01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440\nI just keep saying...\n\n01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.440\nI've been like, come on, that's not imaginative.\n\n01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440\nWhat the fuck, Carmen?\n\n01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440\nYeah, no, I'm listening.\n\n01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.440\nI'm like, oh yeah, cities get bigger and then they all turn into one big city.\n\n01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:09.440\nDid you think of it?\n\n01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:10.440\nAnd then everybody can change their skin.\n\n01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.440\nI'm like, come on.\n\n01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.440\nDid you think of it?\n\n01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.440\nYou didn't think of it?\n\n01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440\nWell, I didn't bother.\n\n01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440\nWait a minute.\n\n01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.440\nI was thinking of crazy shit, man.\n\n01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:28.440\nI was like, what if a sandwich could make you come?\n\n01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.440\nBy the way, man, when you were talking about that, it was really funny because I kept thinking\n\n01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440\nof like an awesome cooking show.\n\n01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440\nYou got hungry, that's what you're saying.\n\n01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440\nWhere it's God.\n\n01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:41.440\nWhere God's like, today we're going to be whipping up just basic cum.\n\n01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.440\nWe're going to make three club sandwiches, two gallons of water.\n\n01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.440\nWe're going to put it into Tyler and we're going to wait 20 days.\n\n01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.440\nOn a very special episode of Chopped Junior.\n\n01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.440\nBut that's all I'm saying is you have to take in all this.\n\n01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.440\nWe were talking about the biological process, spermatogenesis.\n\n01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:10.440\nBy the way, I started doing this thing where I'm like researching cum a lot.\n\n01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:19.440\nIt's like after I masturbate and or have sex and or intentional, sex with me is weird.\n\n01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.440\nBut sometimes you're laying there and you're like, man, I don't know if I'll ever get out of bed.\n\n01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.440\nAnd then that's why I get on my iPad and I'm like, tell me how sperm is made.\n\n01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.440\nBecause then I think if I watch it, then I'm like, maybe the sperm will start getting made\n\n01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.440\nand then I can get out of bed.\n\n01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.440\nWait.\n\n01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.440\nIt doesn't make any sense.\n\n01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.440\nYour mobility is sperm based?\n\n01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440\nWell, I don't know.\n\n01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.440\nI'm like a caveman when I'm in that mode.\n\n01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.440\nI'm like, I don't know.\n\n01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.440\nThe only scientific thing that I know is different is that I came a bunch and now I can't get out of bed.\n\n01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.440\nI knew somebody who worked in porn and they were on a set when Peter North finished a scene.\n\n01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.440\nAnd then Peter North, who's famous for coming a bunch, he finished coming.\n\n01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:07.440\nAnd then I was like, so what does he do after he finishes?\n\n01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.440\nHe watched Peter North come.\n\n01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.440\nWhat happens after?\n\n01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440\nHe has four pina coladas.\n\n01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.440\nHe turns into a little boy and he goes like, oh man, I need some cereal.\n\n01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.440\nWow, that's awesome.\n\n01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.440\nIt's so Dirk Diggler.\n\n01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.440\nHe's like Jethro Baudin.\n\n01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.440\nBut who are we going to trust if not him?\n\n01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.440\nSome kind of comologist?\n\n01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.440\nLike maybe Peter North is, maybe he's just joyfully wrong, but maybe he's like expertly right.\n\n01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:44.440\nHe's just eating fucking frosted mini-wheats and milk because it kind of reminds him of cum when he looks at it.\n\n01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.440\nHe's like, that must make cum.\n\n01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.440\nI'm going to cum more later.\n\n01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440\nSomebody told me it was golden grams.\n\n01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.440\nThat was his thing.\n\n01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.440\nHe liked golden grams cereal.\n\n01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:54.440\nI bet, yeah.\n\n01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.440\nThat makes sense.\n\n01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440\nThat was his Popeye's spinach.\n\n01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:01.440\nI love the idea that it's just based on the milk.\n\n01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:06.440\nBut I swear, sometimes when you cum a lot, don't you sometimes you go like, man, this has been great.\n\n01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.440\nI love this feeling, but also can I get some motivation back?\n\n01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440\nCan I start living in denial again?\n\n01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440\nWhat do I got to do to do that?\n\n01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:18.440\nAnd you think like, well, the refractory period must be based on your balls start.\n\n01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.440\nI just have to assume that your balls start making, I don't know.\n\n01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.440\nYou know the idea about the refractory period?\n\n01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.440\nIt's really, really, you had Chris Ryan on the show before.\n\n01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:27.440\nFather, sex, and time.\n\n01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:33.440\nSo one of the ideas about the refractory period is that from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:36.440\nit's better for a woman to have multiple mates.\n\n01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:41.440\nSo like, because then the strongest sperm is going to survive.\n\n01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.440\nThat's why I don't want rom-coms.\n\n01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.440\nThat's the reason.\n\n01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.440\nBecause there's like that height of romance.\n\n01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.440\nBut I know it's probably true though, because it's like, I've read stuff like,\n\n01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.440\nYou're making love to your lover in the primordial past.\n\n01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.440\nYou're making love. You come inside of her.\n\n01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440\nYou're like, I love you. I'm going to go to bed.\n\n01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.440\nAnd then you like start going to bed.\n\n01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:04.440\nAnd then your friend is like, can I start fucking her now?\n\n01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.440\nAnd either you're like, yeah, man, more than that.\n\n01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440\nOr she's like, yeah, let's do it or not.\n\n01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.440\nOr she's chippy toeing out.\n\n01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.440\nBut the idea is like, yeah, so the idea is the refractory period is actually designed\n\n01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.440\nto make sure that a...\n\n01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.440\nSo the question is, why can women have multiple orgasms?\n\n01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.440\nWhy are multiple mates important though?\n\n01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.440\nWhat does that...\n\n01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440\nSo the idea is like, if you had some kind of like, I don't know,\n\n01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:32.440\nsomething was going on with you and you weren't like making like powerful loads,\n\n01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.440\nwhatever that may be.\n\n01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440\nAnd you're crazy like, what if...\n\n01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.440\nBut the question is like, why would it be?\n\n01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:40.440\nThe big question is...\n\n01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.440\nLike a golden graham shortage.\n\n01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.440\nI go away for two weeks to come back to the jizz show.\n\n01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.440\nI love talking about cum.\n\n01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.440\nBut the question is...\n\n01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440\nI really do.\n\n01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.440\nI go on come town, come in town.\n\n01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.440\nThe question is, a woman can have multiple orgasms with a...\n\n01:31:58.440 --> 01:31:59.440\nThat's not true.\n\n01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.440\nThat's not true.\n\n01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.440\nThat's a myth.\n\n01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.440\nWe'll be right back.\n\n01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.440\nThat's not...\n\n01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.440\nYou hear it all the time, but it's not true.\n\n01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.440\nIt's something they're saying.\n\n01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.440\nThey were talking about it at the Wonder Woman premiere,\n\n01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.440\nbut you couldn't get in.\n\n01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440\nIt's not true.\n\n01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.440\nIt's not fair.\n\n01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.440\nIt's not true.\n\n01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.440\nSorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.440\nNo, you're right.\n\n01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.440\nIt's not true.\n\n01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.440\nNo, come on.\n\n01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.440\nFinish your thought.\n\n01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.440\nFinish your thought.\n\n01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.440\nNo, I mean, the idea is like the question is just like,\n\n01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.440\nwhy would it be that a man has like this really intense reaction\n\n01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.440\nto orgasm, which we call the refractory period,\n\n01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.440\nwhereas a woman can have multiple orgasms.\n\n01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.440\nAnd the implication, according to Chris Ryan,\n\n01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.440\nis that well, this is clearly like created with the idea\n\n01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.440\nof like a multiplicity of love.\n\n01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.440\nI mean, that's what's interesting about Chris Ryan,\n\n01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.440\nbecause he's a well-needed like update to Desmond Morris,\n\n01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.440\nwho's in the 60s.\n\n01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.440\nBut Desmond Morris' theory about that was that,\n\n01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.440\nbut I don't want to be part of a patriarchy.\n\n01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.440\nBut the Desmond Morris theory was that,\n\n01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:06.440\nyeah, men fall asleep because then you bond emotionally\n\n01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:07.440\nwith your lover.\n\n01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.440\nBullshit.\n\n01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.440\nBut here's the thing.\n\n01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440\nIt's because we get sleepy.\n\n01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.440\nBut there is a scientifically...\n\n01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:20.440\nIt goes back to, it all has to do with human babies\n\n01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.440\nbeing more biologically vulnerable than tiger babies,\n\n01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.440\ndeer babies, and cactus babies.\n\n01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440\nI mean, I don't know.\n\n01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440\nI think like Chris Ryan makes it pretty great.\n\n01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.440\nThat's why I don't want to...\n\n01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.440\nThat's why I just claim the fuck out of it.\n\n01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.440\nBut I do think that it's delight...\n\n01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.440\nI really prefer that Desmond Morris' theory,\n\n01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.440\nlike all of the biological quirks about us\n\n01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440\nare all designed for pair bonding\n\n01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440\nbecause our babies need two parents.\n\n01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.440\nWell, you can still pair bond.\n\n01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.440\nYou can't...\n\n01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440\nThe idea isn't that you...\n\n01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:47.440\nBy the way, I'm like severely embarrassingly monogamous.\n\n01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.440\nSo don't get me wrong.\n\n01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.440\nI'm not some kind of like,\n\n01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.440\njust got back from Burning Man, Dan,\n\n01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.440\nand now I've learned we got to be non-monogamous.\n\n01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440\nYour girlfriend's pretty.\n\n01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.440\nI'm not like that.\n\n01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440\nDon't worry, man.\n\n01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440\nThat's not fucking happening.\n\n01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440\nI'm severely, desperately,\n\n01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.440\nand based on insecurity, completely fucking monogamous.\n\n01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.440\nSo don't get me wrong.\n\n01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440\nBut like, from a perspective of like,\n\n01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.440\nyeah, like that idea kind of would be...\n\n01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.440\nAnd again, this is not my idea.\n\n01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.440\nLike, I couldn't do this.\n\n01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.440\nBut the idea would be if you really love somebody,\n\n01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440\nwouldn't you want them to come a lot?\n\n01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.440\nNo!\n\n01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.440\nNot with you.\n\n01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:29.440\nDan...\n\n01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.440\nI'd have to love you and not them.\n\n01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.440\nDan, if you really love Cody,\n\n01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.440\nlet Duncan fuck tonight, man.\n\n01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.440\nListen, man.\n\n01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.440\nListen, I didn't say it like that.\n\n01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.440\nListen, I didn't say it like that.\n\n01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:45.440\nWe're sitting right next to Steve Perfectcock Levy over here.\n\n01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.440\nLet her have a good Saturday night.\n\n01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.440\nIt's Saturday night.\n\n01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.440\nLet her live a little.\n\n01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.440\nOh, well, look, I don't want to forbid\n\n01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:59.440\nSteve and Duncan to fuck Cody.\n\n01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.440\nNow you're talking!\n\n01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.440\nI want Cody to not want that.\n\n01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.440\nRight.\n\n01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.440\nWell, again, I made a dumb joke.\n\n01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.440\nWait, let me just say this very quickly.\n\n01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440\nI just made a stupid dumb joke.\n\n01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440\nI don't mean that at all.\n\n01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.440\nWhat I'm saying is, it's like,\n\n01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.440\nfrom my POV in the society that I was born into,\n\n01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440\nbecause of my own levels of insecurity\n\n01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.440\nand where I'm at in my life,\n\n01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.440\nI want to be monogamous,\n\n01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:25.440\nand I will continue to be monogamous.\n\n01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.440\nI'm not changing that.\n\n01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.440\nThat's me.\n\n01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.440\nThat's who I am.\n\n01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:29.440\nI've always been like that.\n\n01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.440\nI can't change it.\n\n01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.440\nBut if you look like...\n\n01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.440\nIf you zoom out...\n\n01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440\nRight.\n\n01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.440\nAnd you look at what evolution wants.\n\n01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:37.440\nRight.\n\n01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.440\nYou realize monogamy itself is a cultural...\n\n01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.440\nIt's like a new imposition.\n\n01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.440\nWell, it dovetails with this whole thing\n\n01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:43.440\nabout anarchy versus capitalism,\n\n01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440\nbecause it's like...\n\n01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.440\nIt's like, oh, you know what?\n\n01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.440\nI get to pretend I was born into this stainless steel,\n\n01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440\nconcrete jungle,\n\n01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.440\nand that, hey, it wasn't my idea to do this,\n\n01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.440\nbut hey, will you be my girlfriend?\n\n01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.440\nAnd all that stuff.\n\n01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440\nAt the same time, I'm like, hey,\n\n01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.440\nit wasn't my idea to have the American dollar\n\n01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.440\nbe the standard of the entire planet.\n\n01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:04.440\nBut hey, what are you going to do?\n\n01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.440\nBut then push comes to shove as in cultural upheaval,\n\n01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.440\nand right now, capitalistically,\n\n01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:10.440\nwe're going like, yeah, again,\n\n01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.440\nbut theoretically, anarchy is the...\n\n01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.440\nNot theoretically.\n\n01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.440\nIt's not the more popular way to do it,\n\n01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440\nbut it is the way that we would...\n\n01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440\nAnd I think you're saying the same thing\n\n01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.440\nabout polyamory or whatever they call it,\n\n01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.440\nthese kids.\n\n01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:27.440\nYou could just say,\n\n01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.440\nif you go to the bathroom here, it's disgusting.\n\n01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.440\nIt was a joke, or maybe not.\n\n01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.440\nI have a special bathroom upstairs.\n\n01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:45.440\nIt's rhinestones and just all the cultist daughters.\n\n01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.440\nBut yeah, I think you're saying the same thing I am,\n\n01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.440\nwhich is theoretically, intellectually,\n\n01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.440\nnot wanting to be guilty of dishonesty,\n\n01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440\none should acknowledge it.\n\n01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.440\nYeah, probably there's a freer human kind.\n\n01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.440\nThat functions better and healthier.\n\n01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.440\nBut then also, it's important then to go,\n\n01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.440\njust as I did before I quit smoking,\n\n01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.440\nwhere I was like, I like smoking.\n\n01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.440\nMy therapist says, awareness, acceptance, change.\n\n01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.440\nPeople skip acceptance.\n\n01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.440\nYou're like, oh, I'm aware.\n\n01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440\nI'm doing this.\n\n01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.440\nI'm going to stop doing it.\n\n01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.440\nAnd then you just ping pong back and forth.\n\n01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440\nThat's why I don't quit drinking.\n\n01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.440\nI have to accept it first.\n\n01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:31.440\nI've become aware I drink a lot.\n\n01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.440\nI'm still working on accepting it.\n\n01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.440\nThen I'll change it later.\n\n01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.440\nI've seen you accept a lot of drinks.\n\n01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440\nMe too.\n\n01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440\nEspecially, especially.\n\n01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440\nYeah, but that guy with the boy,\n\n01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:45.440\noh, it's all one big city.\n\n01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.440\nSpeaking of drinks, we never shout them out.\n\n01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.440\nMatt, the bartender over here.\n\n01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.440\nMatt, our bartender.\n\n01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:53.440\nYeah, give them big tips.\n\n01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.440\nTruly the hardest working person in Harmontown.\n\n01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.440\nKeeping his bunch of fucking reprobates happy.\n\n01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440\nI apologize to Spencer.\n\n01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440\nI know he's going to say he doesn't give a fuck,\n\n01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440\nbut that's because he's my son.\n\n01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.440\nYeah, whatever.\n\n01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:09.440\nWe'll talk about it later.\n\n01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.440\nAll these jokes about fucking my mom,\n\n01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440\nall of a sudden, a line.\n\n01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.440\nAnd my fascination with cum.\n\n01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.440\nRight.\n\n01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.440\nWait, wait.\n\n01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:24.440\nYeah, I always just roll off your fascination with cum as normal.\n\n01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:27.440\nBut I just, Duncan was making me feel better,\n\n01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:34.440\nso I kept him in my mouth like one of those ring pops.\n\n01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.440\nLike one of those levy cocks.\n\n01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:45.440\nThat's delicious.\n\n01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.440\nYou know what?\n\n01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.440\nIt's not that.\n\n01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.440\nWhy am I making the diameter?\n\n01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.440\nNo, it's like a nice broomstick diameter.\n\n01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.440\nAnd it's like, it's gentle, but firm.\n\n01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.440\nAnd it's there when you need it.\n\n01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:59.440\nAnd if you get thirsty afterwards,\n\n01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.440\nit gets you a glass of water without you asking.\n\n01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440\nWhoa.\n\n01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440\nSo you can make the diameter.\n\n01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440\nAlso a cum.\n\n01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:08.440\nSteve Levy's dick is something you almost know that dick does.\n\n01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.440\nIn the morning, it makes you the best avocado toast you've ever fucking had.\n\n01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440\nWow.\n\n01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440\nIt's a little basil, a little feta on it,\n\n01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440\nsome olive oil, fucking perfect.\n\n01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440\nI did get an argument.\n\n01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:19.440\nI got in an argument with this dick, though.\n\n01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.440\nOh, no.\n\n01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.440\nBecause I said to it, this is just a sandwich, man.\n\n01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.440\nAvocado toast is just a sandwich.\n\n01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440\nAll right, forget it.\n\n01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:32.440\nThat's for another party.\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440\nWell, let Duncan know you wanted to come back\n\n01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.440\nby thanking him with your hands.\n\n01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:48.440\nThank you, Duncan.\n\n01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440\nThank you.\n\n01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.440\nSee you soon.\n\n01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.440\nDuncan Trussell.\n\n01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.440\nI feel like...\n\n01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.440\nHe just makes everything a little bit better, doesn't he?\n\n01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.440\nYeah, he does.\n\n01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:06.440\nYeah, he's like walking serotonin.\n\n01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440\nAll right, why don't you marry him?\n\n01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:12.440\nHe's probably back there fucking my girlfriend.\n\n01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.440\nIn the beginning of that rant, I thought you were going to say you wanted,\n\n01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.440\njust sound like you're going towards, you wanted like an incremental\n\n01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.440\ncum clicker, like cookie collector, where like you get the air workings.\n\n01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.440\nThat would be amazing.\n\n01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.440\nAnd you'd like manufacture your own sperm\n\n01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440\nand finally you'd have understanding of it.\n\n01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.440\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.440\nI swear to God, I'm really a fan.\n\n01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.440\nCan we stop saying loads?\n\n01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.440\nWell, I don't know what to, ejaculate batches.\n\n01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:37.440\nThere is no, the language fails.\n\n01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.440\nIt is a truly fascinating thing that as mammals,\n\n01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.440\nwe take in energy and then we have a little factory\n\n01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440\nthat has to dangle between our legs\n\n01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.440\nbecause it requires like a degree cooler environment\n\n01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.440\njust for the chemical process of making them, not storing them.\n\n01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:58.440\nOnce they're made, they're fine in summer, you know, whatever.\n\n01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.440\nLike, they're going to get made one degree cooler.\n\n01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.440\nAnd they're just little fucking missiles that are just loaded with the need\n\n01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:08.440\nto hit an egg and they're like simultaneously geniuses and idiots\n\n01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440\nand they're just disposable\n\n01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.440\nand we're just constantly making them until the day they bury us.\n\n01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.440\nBut like, women's eggs are like, they're finite\n\n01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440\nand they're like, they're giant.\n\n01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:21.440\nLike, they're the size of the sun compared to a sperm's rocket.\n\n01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.440\nAnd like, it's just like this amazing,\n\n01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440\nI'm just so fascinated with all of it.\n\n01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.440\nAll right, let's, let's, let's help.\n\n01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.440\nI don't know whether we have enough time.\n\n01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.440\nWe, we, we found, we found out tonight.\n\n01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.440\nOkay, well, we should have, we should have come.\n\n01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.440\nNo, it's fine.\n\n01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.440\nWe have time, come on.\n\n01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.440\nLet's give the audience some D&D.\n\n01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.440\nWe only got, we started a little late.\n\n01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.440\nWe've only got like 11, we've only got like 11 minutes tops.\n\n01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.440\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:44.440\nWe found out tonight that you'd love to come.\n\n01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.440\nSpencer's the game master.\n\n01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.440\nLike, like, like, he makes the rule.\n\n01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.440\nLike we can't, we can't announce Cliff Hanger endings and things like that.\n\n01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440\nSpencer is in charge of the thing.\n\n01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440\nSo if he says, like, yeah, it's not.\n\n01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440\nWe should get Duncan back.\n\n01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.440\nLet's see.\n\n01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.440\nHey, Duncan, are you back?\n\n01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.440\nDuncan, come back.\n\n01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.440\nHe probably left.\n\n01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440\nWe're not going to play, play D&D.\n\n01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440\nWhat was that?\n\n01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440\nI'll just pretend to.\n\n01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:07.440\nWell, how about this Spencer?\n\n01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.440\nBecause I was not here.\n\n01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.440\nLet's just, let's just recap.\n\n01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:12.440\nSo we, we, we...\n\n01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.440\nDuncan's back.\n\n01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.440\nOh, shit.\n\n01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.440\nThank you for having me back.\n\n01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.440\nHe's on court.\n\n01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440\nHe fucked all of our girlfriends that quickly?\n\n01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.440\nYeah.\n\n01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.440\nWhich was a really long time for me.\n\n01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.440\nThat's part of his appeal.\n\n01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.440\nThat's how he gets them.\n\n01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.440\nHey, man, this won't take a lot of time.\n\n01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440\nI'm not going to put you out, man.\n\n01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.440\nThe thing is...\n\n01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.440\nI got a cheesy thing to say.\n\n01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.440\nUh-oh.\n\n01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.440\nTo cut off whatever you were going to say was probably the funny thing.\n\n01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.440\nIt was, it was going to be trenchant and hilarious, but go ahead.\n\n01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.440\nOh, no.\n\n01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440\nLeave me.\n\n01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440\nI had to tell you this thing.\n\n01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.440\nOkay.\n\n01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.440\nBecause like, you know, Jack Kornfield, the Buddhist teacher, you know...\n\n01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.440\nYou don't know Jack Kornfield?\n\n01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.440\nHe owes me 10 bucks.\n\n01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.440\nHe's not here, right?\n\n01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440\nSo he tells this great story.\n\n01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.440\nAnd guaranteed that, think about having a broken heart.\n\n01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.440\nGuaranteed there's a bunch of people here right now with a fucking broken heart,\n\n01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:13.440\nbecause that's what it means to be human.\n\n01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.440\nBut there's a...\n\n01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:20.440\nJack Kornfield talks about how there's a story in Judaism\n\n01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:27.440\nwhere there was a rabbi that made his students hold the...\n\n01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.440\nYou know, Teflon, you know what that is?\n\n01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440\nYeah.\n\n01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440\nTo Phelan?\n\n01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440\nTo Phelan, yeah.\n\n01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.440\nTo Phelan.\n\n01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.440\nEggs don't stick to it.\n\n01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440\nNASA invented it.\n\n01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:43.440\nDon't tell me the Jews made that.\n\n01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.440\nThat was NASA.\n\n01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:45.440\nYou're right, dude.\n\n01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.440\nIt is one of the weird mysteries of the universe is the eggs don't stick to it.\n\n01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:49.440\nWhat is Teflon?\n\n01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.440\nWhat?\n\n01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:51.440\nDo you remember that?\n\n01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.440\nTake it away, Steve.\n\n01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440\nIt's like the shit they cook eggs.\n\n01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.440\nI know Teflon.\n\n01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.440\nWhat's Teflon?\n\n01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.440\nWhat's the thing you're talking about?\n\n01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.440\nNo, we talked about this earlier in the year.\n\n01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:02.440\nRemember, I got accosted in Beverly Hills by...\n\n01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440\nOh, right.\n\n01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.440\nThey put a Parker Brothers thing on your head.\n\n01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440\nThat's Teflon where they wrap it around your arms.\n\n01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440\nOkay, gotcha.\n\n01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.440\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.440\nYou saw it.\n\n01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.440\nThe point is, like, inside this box are these scrolls.\n\n01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.440\nI don't know what's written on them, but there's something amazing written on them.\n\n01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.440\nSo, Jack Kornfield tells a story.\n\n01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.440\nHow, like, I already know you're going to fucking make fun of this man.\n\n01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.440\nI know you're going to, like, got some already.\n\n01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440\nBut, like, Jack Kornfield tells a story.\n\n01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.440\nIs he a Jewish Buddhist?\n\n01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:34.440\nHe might have started off Jewish and then became Buddhist.\n\n01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:39.440\nLike, a lot of people that I learned from are, like, they started off Jewish and then became, like, Buddhist or Hindu.\n\n01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.440\nBut it doesn't, the whole thing is, like, the whole, like...\n\n01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.440\nBecause of those robes.\n\n01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440\nIt's ridiculous saying what you already were.\n\n01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.440\nThe point is...\n\n01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.440\nI'm not going to say it.\n\n01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.440\nYou know what Jewish Buddhist says?\n\n01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440\nWhat?\n\n01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:51.440\nOym.\n\n01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440\nYes!\n\n01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:57.440\nGod damn you!\n\n01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.440\nWait, you didn't, you didn't, you heard that somewhere.\n\n01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.440\nWait a minute.\n\n01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:09.440\nWait, wait, what if he heard that somewhere?\n\n01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.440\nWhat if he got that out of a bazooka joe?\n\n01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.440\nOym.\n\n01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:18.440\nDid you, did you just make that up?\n\n01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:19.440\nYes.\n\n01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440\nThat's not fair.\n\n01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440\nMazel tov.\n\n01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440\nMazel tov.\n\n01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.440\nOym is the title.\n\n01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.440\nThat's the title.\n\n01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:27.440\nOym?\n\n01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:28.440\nIs that what it would be?\n\n01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440\nLet me warm my way out of this thing, please.\n\n01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.440\nNo, no, no.\n\n01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:39.440\nSo, so, the idea is, like, this rabbi, it, like, makes his students hold the teff to fill in,\n\n01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.440\nto fill in against their heart when they're, when they're, like, saying prayers.\n\n01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.440\nAnd one of them said to him,\n\n01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:49.440\nWhy do you make us hold this against our heart when we're saying prayers?\n\n01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:50.440\nAnd he said,\n\n01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:55.440\nSo that maybe when your heart breaks, the prayers will fall inside.\n\n01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:59.440\nThat's cool, right?\n\n01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.440\nIt's a nice thought.\n\n01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:07.440\nSo heart, heartbreak is a, yeah, it's a thing, it's a, it's like, yeah, it's a crack, cracking, and then, like, yeah.\n\n01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.440\nIt's a crack that prayers can fill.\n\n01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:11.440\nYeah, and it doesn't stay open.\n\n01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.440\nIt cracks like an egg and it falls into the phone.\n\n01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.440\nNo, it's like, it's a sacred moat.\n\n01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:19.440\nThe thing is, like, if you get your fucking heart broken,\n\n01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.440\nwhich is a very rare occurrence in a human incarnation,\n\n01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.440\nit really doesn't happen all that much.\n\n01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440\nWhen you finally get your fucking heart broken,\n\n01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.440\nyou are walking through the kingdom of heaven.\n\n01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.440\nLike, you are in heaven right now.\n\n01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.440\nYou don't realize it.\n\n01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:38.440\nYou don't realize it because, like, everybody thinks heaven is, like, just, like, you know, infinite blowjobs or what.\n\n01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440\nI don't know what people think heaven is,\n\n01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.440\nbut that, but that's not what heaven is.\n\n01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.440\nHeaven is direct contact with reality.\n\n01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.440\nSo right now you're having direct contact with eternity,\n\n01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440\nand that's a, like, a holy moment.\n\n01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.440\nAnd so, like, you want, the window shuts.\n\n01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440\nThat's what I'm saying, man.\n\n01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.440\nLike, your heartbreak window.\n\n01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.440\nYou probably got, like, another, like, I don't know, 20 years,\n\n01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.440\nand then you'll start, stop suffering.\n\n01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440\nNo, you probably have, like,\n\n01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.440\nI got, I thought of something.\n\n01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:09.440\nI can, I can, I can beat, I can beat.\n\n01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.440\nI can be smarter than this philosopher guy.\n\n01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.440\nYou met him!\n\n01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.440\nDon't talk shit about Jack Kornfield!\n\n01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.440\nGet off Twitter!\n\n01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440\nNo, I can beat him, I can beat him.\n\n01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440\nYou, you, you, okay.\n\n01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.440\nYour heart, your heart, so your heart's broken.\n\n01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.440\nYou know what else is broken?\n\n01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440\nA baby's skull.\n\n01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.440\nYou know why?\n\n01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.440\nSo it can grow into an adult skull.\n\n01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.440\nOh.\n\n01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.440\nThere you go.\n\n01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440\nThat's basically the same thing.\n\n01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.440\nI think I could, I think I could top that.\n\n01:47:37.440 -->
