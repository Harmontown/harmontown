00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Make some noise and I'm here, you're at home.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Yeah, how are you tonight?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Yeah!

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harmontown.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm here for Jeff Davis.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
We miss you, Jeff Davis.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I am Brandon Johnson.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I am so happy to see you.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Let's get started.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Welcome to the stage.

00:25.000 --> 00:34.000
The master commander, Spencer Krypton.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
That dude ain't no joke.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
That's the real deal, y'all.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
We couldn't do the show without this man, please.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmontown,

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Mr. Dan Harmon.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah!

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Thank you for coming out.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It's October.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It's officially October.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, the idea was that maybe I would have wrapped.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I forgot.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
I didn't even think about it at this point.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yo, how you doing?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm a doom doom.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm a doom doom.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm a doom doom.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm a doom doom.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm a doom doom.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Wrapping, wrapping all the time

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
is the name of the game.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Like a bucket mama, so harder.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Here's like a mane.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
OK.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
And leopards come round and round.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I have to do it.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Wait to do it.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And your booty got found in the treasure chest

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
at the bottom of the sea.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
And I said, who's that pussy?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
It belongs to me.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Break down like a robot dancer.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Break down, I'm never taking chances, sir.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm going to your papa's pussy in a bus.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And, OK.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I agree.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I agree.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
So out of breath and so fat.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
And for any of the ladies that happen to be joining us

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
for the first time tonight, that's not,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
the pussies aren't for driving into.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
At least of all with a bus.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
There's nothing.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
How did this begin?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't know.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
We've been doing the podcast for about seven years.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Our guest tonight has been doing,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
it's basically like a sister podcast.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
I look at it as, because we like to feminize our enemies.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
No.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know why that is why.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I think that's our worshipfulness of the feminine

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
generally with sister cities and sister productions.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
When we call things, I think it's like a battleship as a she.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
I think that's us trying to be flattering to women.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
I hope so.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I do hope so.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
It's a good thing.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So it must be a girl.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Because it's soft.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Like one thing that makes us better than we can be.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Like a battleship with big guns.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Look at her big guns.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Look at those big guns that girls got.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
She's going to blow the fuck out of our enemy city.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Our brother city that we hate.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
We're going to ally with our sister country

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
and fucking shoot our tits all over that fucking enemy country.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Because we're better.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
So we're women.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't know what we're doing.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I wish, man.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
I really do wish that was true.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And then some people come along and go,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
hey, maybe I want to do some weird shit with pronouns.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
And we're like, fuck you.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
That's crazy.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
We're crazy with pronouns.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
We are crazy with pronouns.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
We do weird shit with pronouns.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It's weird.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
We're still trying to figure out what we should do to not offend each other

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
when we speak to each other.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
That's going to take a little while.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Human race is like a little,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
thinks it's smarter than it is.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So we're like, fuck, we've got language and shit.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
This is how you talk.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And so far it hasn't really worked out.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
So we're still working our way through pronouns, I think.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
And is that how English works?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
English is a garbage dump.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That's why it's successful.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
English is the language that said,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
polystyrene is welcome.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
We've been over this.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I've listened to four podcasts about the history of English.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
So I'm an expert.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
I don't know.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
It dominated the planet because it's content with the lowest of places.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
It'll take a fucking inlet from any river.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
It doesn't matter.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
It's just like a diarrhea canal that connects the earth.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And that's why it dominates.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Also, it's spoken by first world empires.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I can blow you up if you don't speak right.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Anyways, I'm fat.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I got fat.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm becoming now this person.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm like, I'm fat because I'm working out.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And now I'm in the thing.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm in the atonement with the father chapter of Amy Schumer's,

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
I Feel Pretty, where I felt good for a while.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
So I met with the goddess.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I was like, yeah, I did it.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm exercising every other day.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
And I feel good.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
I feel the feeling that you feel.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
It's an interesting movie.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
Actually, I can understand why it wasn't like a swish,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
nothing but net kind of perfect.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
The times we're going through right now,

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
how could you fucking hoop is on the move?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
But it's definitely worth watching because there's some actually profound

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
grounded shit that happens in that movie because the concede is just that she hits her head

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
and she doesn't, they show her looking at her body when she wakes up.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
But they don't do the fan, her point of view is that her arms,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
instead of looking like this, look like that.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
They don't use a model instead of her.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
They use her.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And she doesn't say, look at my boobs.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
They're so blank shaped.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
She doesn't say, look how much blanker my legs are.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
She just says, my legs are amazing.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
She doesn't, and so it's like a nuanced thing because it's like,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
what if the way you looked, which is fine,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
what if you could believe that?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
What if you just believed that the way we think we would believe that if we looked

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
like so and so on the cover of whatever magazine?

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And the answer is a lot of confusing jokes because to me,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
that movie's one flaw is that the world doesn't,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I don't know what the world feels like.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Sometimes the world is trying to talk people into thinking they're ugly in that movie.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And then, but then there's like these beauty,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
like I think the scene where she meets the guy,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
like the meet cute of that scene is actually really interesting

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
because it's very realistic, like the what if of like what if,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
what if Amy Schumer thought she was like gorgeous and then she's like,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
oh, is this how it happens?

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Like a guy starts talking to her and then he's just confused by how aggressive she is.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
But in a way that I was watching as a guy, I was like, that is attractive behavior.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Like no matter, and that does make all the difference,

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
like which is what people are always telling us.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Like you just have to think that you blah blah blah and act like you look how you,

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
all this stuff like it's very complicated stuff to me.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
People are really big on like confidence in other people

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
because we're kind of fascinated by how you can see.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
We love confident people.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
We definitely, but we also love to like hit them in the face with bats.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Like we don't like, we like to warm our hands over them,

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
but then we will also like put our cigarettes out in them, pour our beer into them, kick them.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Like, and that's another interesting thing about I Feel Pretty is they do go,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
it does track, there's like unlike a lot of movies that have a simpler concept,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
like it does take you around the wheel where you're like, oh yeah, okay.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
So one of the fantasy about feeling pretty is like we all have this thing in our head

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
that's like if I looked like so-and-so and you pick whoever, like you might not pick Tom Cruise.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
You might pick somebody for a totally different reason,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
but whatever that person is in your head, if I looked like this person,

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
then the reason that would be great is because then I would be able to blank

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
and I think blank is pretty much universally stop worrying so much about everybody else,

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
which we think is a service to other people because we tend to be toxically insecure.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Like me coming out telling you I feel fat, like what are you supposed to do with that?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
That's me wiping my ass on you.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
You're like, I just have your fat shit on my face.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Like what am I, you know, you look great.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
What am I doing?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Why am I doing this for you?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I have shit to do at home.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Like I have dogs that need me.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Like why are you the famous rich guy?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
I'm fat.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Like no, you're not.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Fuck you.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Anyways, but also your friend can do that too.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
You do that to other people.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
We are most familiar with insecurity as a thing that if it was gone,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
we would be like super people.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
But the anxiety is why we are good people.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And so it seems like a no-brainer to talk about this,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
but it's a pretty good job in that movie of like she starts like,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
she becomes a prick like in all the right ways,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
like where she's sort of like, yeah, she's like,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
okay, she's like trying to help her friends,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
whom she now thinks are her less attractive friends.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And she's like trying to help them,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
like hot people help ugly people in movies,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
where it's like, come on, just let it out.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
You're gonna fucking do it.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
And they're like to them, they're like,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
why are you being such an asshole?

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
It's kind of fun to think about it anyways.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Two Harmons Up.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Watch that and Mandy and maybe, I don't know,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
something about ants.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Keep it educational.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Two Harmons Up.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
They don't make stuff about insects anymore.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Like when I was a kid, I just want to watch.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
They did.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Don't ask for that back.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Remember the bees with the Jerry Seinfelds and the ants?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
No, no, no, no, no.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
I don't mean like when you find out,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
bees take the bee subway and have bee relations.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
I got bee laid off and the, yeah.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I mean like actual like British guy,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
like no music and just like 20 minutes

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
of just watching fucking writhing insect bodies

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
like moving around and then a John Cleese guy going like,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
the yellow jacket has returned with news from the colony.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Using an intricate wag of its abdomen,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
its thorax moving in shapes so precise

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
that MIT departments were unable to decode it all the way.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
This intricate alphabet, if it were in English,

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
would have 550 letters and be 700,000 words long

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
or something.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
You're like, what?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
The wiggle butt language.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And then they explain everything.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh, new queen is on the way.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And so it's time to sting her competitors to death.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And like they show everything.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Like they show ants like walking through the tunnels

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
and like, how can we do that in the 70s and we can't do it now?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
We can.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
We just don't want to anymore.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
We're like, oh, we get ants.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I want to take this big foot.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
What's his name?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Attenborough guys.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Get those cameras out in the middle of the North Pole.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Let's watch these seals have a wet dream.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Like, I don't care if that's more rare.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I like the ant stuff.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I like ants.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Notice how the seal rolls on its back and humps the air.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I don't know why I'm so whiny.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't know what part of the other thing is like,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
by the way, I'm happy.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I don't know why I've come out of the part of it

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
is like, what are you supposed to whine about?

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm not a whiny person.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
I don't like that kind of laugh.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
That was so clearly involuntary that...

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Was that...

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, that was you.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Okay.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Wait, are you...

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Someone just wanted to play a new TV.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Are you Nova's dad?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Oh, okay.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
I thought...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I thought...

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
You know, Nova's very young and like her dad,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
she probably doesn't want people to know.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
She...

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
They...

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
God damn it.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
And Harmon,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
they don't make a big deal out of the pronoun thing

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
because that's also a thing that you do.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You fucking wipe your ass all over people.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Just fucking...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Harmon,

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
you stop talking about it.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
You saw which side I was on.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
All right.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I got my notes.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Okay.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Here are my notes.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
And then we're going to bring out our guest.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Okay.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Here's the thing.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
All right.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
So, well, this belongs in a segment.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
It's called things that I'm not allowed to complain about

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
because I'm...

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Actually, honestly,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
four people are allowed to complain about what I'm going to complain about.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
But play a little music cue like it's a segment.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Like...

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
Things I can't complain about.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Oh, yeah.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm a British in the 80s.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Dan Harmon's not allowed to complain about this.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
The same way I'm not allowed to have angst

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
because it's 1981.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
Everyone is doing fine.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
We're going to learn 30 years from now how poor you can be.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
Right now, poor means living in the goondocks.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Okay.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Come on.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Knock it off.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Read my mind.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Living in the goondocks was the cue.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Who would fuck that up?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
What do you think?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
What do you think I'm going to sing about the goonies for 40 minutes?

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
What kind of podcast do you think this is?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
The goondocks.

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
Some shit your old grandfather says before he has a stroke.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
They called it the goondocks and the goonies.

13:54.000 --> 14:02.000
Look, when we order the food now, you get it brought to your house.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Are you familiar with this?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
They get the styrofoam cups.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
We're all taking a hit for Mother Gaia.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Put it in some styrofoam.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Put a plastic lid on it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
All of us are humans.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Sorry, Earth.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Payback's a bitch.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
You fucking tried as hard as you could to kill us forever.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Ever since we were amoeba,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
you were like, better be a better amoeba

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
or you're going to get eaten by a bigger amoeba.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And we're like, we would rather just hang out.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
And God's like, Earth, I'm sorry, Earth.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Earth was like, fine, be a regular amoeba.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Have fun being studied by the people that evolve out of you

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
a billion years from now.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
And we were like, all right, I think your math's wrong.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
All right.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
So we make these things.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I'm sorry, our guests are waiting.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
One guest.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Why are you not allowed to complain about these things?

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Because, listen, you'll know when I complain about it.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
When they deliver the liquids, the soft drinks,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
and they have taken the time at the restaurant.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Because, hey, we're all on the same team, right?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Nobody wants your drinks spilled.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
And it's moving on the go.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It's being delivered to you.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
But they're not thinking about us.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
They don't give a fuck what happens after they leave,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
which is why they put a big piece of scotch tape over the hole,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
the straw hole.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
These lids are designed for transport.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
I knew I wouldn't have your sympathy.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I called your silence in advance.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You silver-leg fucks.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
You judgemental.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
I said I'm not allowed to complain about it.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Now let me complain.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
These lids should either have holes in them or not.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Why are you going that they're putting scotch tape?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Did you get the drink and you're like,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
ah, the food's here.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Thank God.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
And they're like, yeah, thank God.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I got a million orders to do.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Everybody's got priorities.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Everyone's got better things to do

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
than to make sure your drink doesn't spill.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
And their technique, the shit rolls downhill.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
They're like, you get the thing and you're like,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
ah, time to put the straw in.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
What the fuck?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
There's a fucking scotch tape.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Do they have a dispenser on the shelf above the thing?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Or do they make a shift if people take a box

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and they go like, this will be for deliveries.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Just buy, just buy the whole list lids

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
and say to people, or make a collector's item thing

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
and be like, we don't want anything to ever spill

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and you should benefit from that too.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Here's a football-shaped cup that you can throw

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
and it won't spill, but it like,

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
it fucking converts into a thing

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
and you can believe it on your portrait.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
We'll give you a refund.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I'll, I'll, I'll, let me wet my beak

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
in this like, efficiency thing.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
It just feels a little bit like a fuck you.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
You're like, well, all I know is if I spill something,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
if your liquid gets anywhere, then that's on me.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And so, here, I solved my problem.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Good luck.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Like, because you can't take a bag

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
and I saw you roll your eyes at me, sir.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I know you think I'm petty.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
I know you think I'm petty, but I said I was petty.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
So this is not pettiness.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
He was like, I can't believe this motherfucker's bitching

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
about a sippy cup.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
It would serve them right if when you got your food,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
you like said, hold on a second,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
and you looked in as if to count your tacos,

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
but you don't even care about the accurate taco count.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
You actually go, oh, hey, could you,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
could you untape the straw holes?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
God damn it.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Because it usually takes me about 20 minutes.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Because I don't know if you've ever put scotch tape

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
on a fucking lid.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
You guys, look, nobody gets me.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm telling you, if I was running this world,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
oh boy.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Yeah, before childhood hunger,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
we got to fix that tape shit.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
I bet half of childhood hunger is somehow related to this.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Okay, one more thing, and then I'll bring out our guests.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Here's, okay, a genius idea.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
This is like, you can have it, I got enough to do.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Somebody go write this up

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
and get the people attached and do it.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
So, Tom Hanks,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
beloved actor,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
been with us for a long time.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
We've been with him when he was a young whippersnapper,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
a bosom buddy, a maze monster,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
all the way up through Philadelphia,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
all the way to Captain Robert Phillips,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
and beyond.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
His road to perdition led him to, he's lived a full life.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
One of his many roles was a child

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
who wished he was a little older.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I'm saying now, it's time, you can use him,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
we can do this, big two colon, small.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Let's go. Let's fucking go.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I actually got the idea from the Amy Schumer movie.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
What is this? Let's go.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
This sounds amazing.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
In the Amy Schumer movie, they reference the big movie

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
because they're like, well, cite your references

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
because she's wishing she was pretty,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
and then I was explaining to Cody,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
oh, they're doing the big reference because of the thing,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and then I was like, I'm old.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
They should do one of these called I Feel Young.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
And then I was like, oh, reverse big.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Oh, big two, colon, small.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
My audience is gonna love this.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
And she's like, you have an audience?

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm like, what are the people that show up on Monday?

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
Like, I don't know what you call them, friends, frenemies?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Now, judges.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't want you to give.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
My judges.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Oh, you like that?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
That's it.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Maybe we can get along.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Ah, my judges are here.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That feels like a healthy, honest description

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
of this relationship.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Your honors.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
My next guest might make you like me,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
but I can't help it if you don't,

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
because you're out of order.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
At the end of this podcast,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I will throw myself on your mercy,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
as I always do,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
and we'll see what you decide at some point.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
And I will stop you from doing that,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
because I am the bailiff.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah, well, I'm like a crazy, I don't know,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I'm like the Senate.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
No, I just control everything.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Now I made us depressed.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Oh, am I guilty of that?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Fuck you, people.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
I mean, if it pleases you.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
All right, our next guest, sister podcast.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I mean, like, I've been doing it forever.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I mentioned this a couple of episodes ago,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
where I was like, you know,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I did my impression of him,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
and I said mid-impression,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
because I knew that somehow this connection

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
was made, and I really did not want it

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
to reach him in an offensive way.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I said, hey, I'll fly you out,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
come out, do a thing.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I don't know if he took me up on that,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
or if he was here anyway, or whatever,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
but leave you put it together.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It was like the next day or something,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
it was like, they're coming.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
And this podcast has been on

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
at least as long as this one.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
I'm fascinated with it.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I fall asleep to it every night,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
in spite of the titular warning not to,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
uh, brag that you're not going to.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Uh, please welcome

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
the creator and host

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
of, uh, award-winning

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
podcast, The No-Sleep Podcast,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Mr. David Cummings!

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Hi, everybody.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I'm sorry about how long I made you wait.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I said the same thing I say to every guest.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
I said, oh, and then I come out and I talk for five,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
maybe ten minutes.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
It's probably been twenty.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm just thrilled to be on the episode

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
about fat people with big tits.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Yeah!

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Get right at home.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
I was on a podcast

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
that tingled me to the bone.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Oh, it's my, sorry.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Okay, you've been listening to me

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
do my impression of you all day today,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
because we hung out all day, really.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Dan and I are BFFs now.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Is it okay to tell people

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
that we did some recording today?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Yes, absolutely.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
You, uh, had me on.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
You have two podcasts.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
The other one you ordered,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
or is it just you affiliated with it,

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
and it's, are you a mogul?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I'm, uh, I'm what they call in L.A., Dan.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm an E.P.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Darkest Night. Darkest Night.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Created by the genius Alex Aldea,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
who's here tonight.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Yay!

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
The Phil Spector of podcasts.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Yeah, we recorded at Capital Records,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
which was really impressive.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
That was kind of a power move.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, I was pretty impressed too.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I felt, uh, all I wanted to do

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
was take photos of all the sound boots

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
and the mics and everything.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, and we spoke into a crazy

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
binaural, uh, microphone

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
and all those ASMR, uh, things on YouTube,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
and the people are like,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
let me rub a hairbrush on you.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
Uh, and they,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
they, they, they're talking,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
or some of them are talking into.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
It's like the expensive one,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
looks like a mannequin had made of onyx,

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and it has ears and a nose.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
They have a, why does it have a nose?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
That's crazy.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Uh, sorry, anyways, but, uh,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
and then, and then you have me play a part

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
in a, in a, in a no sleep.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Yes, that's right.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
On the next episode, and the current episode

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
that just came out on the weekend,

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
we started a three part series,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
and Dan is going to be in part two

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
and part three.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
So make sure you listen to that.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It was really hard

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
in the first thing we did,

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
because it was like a dramatic, uh,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
kind of radio show piece and like listening to you.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
By the way, you're what,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
when you, when you're just talking normally,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
when you're like, I wouldn't,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I wouldn't have this like,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
like you, it's, you, you,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
you do this like performance voice

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
that sounds so distinct,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
but then you sound completely like a

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
normal,

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
do you, do you,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
are you aware of that shift?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Do you like put a clutch pedal in

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and go like time to give it to them,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
to the max?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Well, you always talk about me sounding

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
like a Canadian, so normally,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
like I sort of talk to a person.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Kind of Canadian.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I tone that down.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah, I guess you want to get in front of the mic.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I sort of, you know, brace yourself

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
for the No Sleep podcast.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Go down low.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Do the, well, do it, do the intro

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
as you, as you, do it, do it,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
do your intro just sort of like what you,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
what you say at the beginning.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
And I, yeah, I never remember it.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Here, I'll do it for you.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Fell for it.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I also don't remember it, but

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
just never stop me.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It's time

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
for you

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
to lose

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
sleep.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
That's not, that can't be it.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
That can't be it.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
For the dark hours when you dare not close

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
your eyes,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
tales

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
to frighten and disturb.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
For tonight

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
there will be

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
No Sleep.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
That's it.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Wow.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Uh,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
we've got

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
six chilling, spying,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
tingling terror tales for you

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
tonight.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
But first, a few matters of

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
finance.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Our

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
regular author-reader

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
case a

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
vigilance.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
One of those wasn't a letter.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
I

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
think

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
has found a lump

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
and will be needing

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
lots and lots of extra subscribers

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
for us to continue

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
our scary work.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
It's, it's, and I, I know

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
that people are like, like, like, I think

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
you have a adamantine. I think, well,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
my, you have, you have

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
self-esteem. You have, you have

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
some. Not after tonight, I'll tell you.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
But

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
like, uh, you,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
obviously I would never, I would never

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
even go into that area if I

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
thought, not if I

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
thought it would hurt. I'm not, I won't credit

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
myself as being a pain reader and

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
responder. I mean, like, if I

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
thought I was, what I was doing was hurtful,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I wouldn't do it.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I, I, so, I guess that's me telling you not

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
to be offended. I would, what, what kind

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
of gaslight shit is that?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Don't be offended.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Well, it's funny because I was talking to

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Dan earlier today, as we mentioned, bragging

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
about Capitol Records. Um, but

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
yeah, Dan was commenting on the show

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
and talking about my Canadian accent.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
you did that, I think, two or three episodes

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
in a row. And a lot of friends, a lot of people

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
listened to that. And so people were contacting me

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
and they're saying, hey, dude,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
are you okay?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Don't let Harmon get to you, man.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I'm sure he didn't mean anything by that.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Really, really, don't let

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
it get to you. It's all cool.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
And I'm thinking, these people are

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
worried that I'm going to be upset because

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I sound like a Canadian.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I am a Canadian!

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
You

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
people think it sounds

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
terrible or you think it's an insult, but

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
no. It's a thrill

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
to sound like a Canadian.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Well, when you're a country that has, that has

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
never made a single mistake,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
uh,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
you look around you and you just want to help people.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Well,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
those guys talk weird.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Let's let them have it.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Let's hold them to a higher standard.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Nobody down here talks weird.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Uh,

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
it's not weird.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
It's super soothing.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I think that, well, I'm from

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
Wisconsin, so the,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
the treatment

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
of vowel sounds is a little

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
related. I find it to be more lullaby-like.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Like, the making

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
of vowel sounds.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I truly love it.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
I know you, nobody wants to hear about

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
the word a-boot and that,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
oot and a-boot and all that stuff because it's

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
like so, it's like making mind jokes

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
now. It's like so played out, but

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
at the same time, it's like such a,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
I get a little dopamine spike when a word comes

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
up that, that, that you

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
just pronounce that way

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
because it feels like an uncle

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
or a father or something is like,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
it's, it feels, it feels

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
very nurturing. It's basically

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
like, it's October, so

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
you know, what I, what I

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
learned from Campbell is that trick or treat

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
is that, like, all of our Halloween tradition

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
is all about this, this, it's the duality.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
It's like, not just

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
like, hey,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
knock, knock, who's there?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Torture! Ah! Like, like, like,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
that's sometimes what horror becomes,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
but like, this idea of like,

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
sit down in front of this

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
fireplace. I'm a nice

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
guy, but I want to tell you about

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
someone that'll eat your fucking

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
guts out of, with a straw.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
And it's kind of like more effective

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
because you're like, I didn't want to have

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
to warn you about this,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
but the truth is there's a

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
crazy corn-toothed

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Eskimo man.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, Eskimo, that's not, that's, that's politically

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
incorrect. Easy, easy with the Eskimos, man.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Sorry, that word flew out of my

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
mouth.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Speaking of which, though, I was also telling

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
you that because you're a sister podcast,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
born at the same time,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I didn't, I don't have this experience

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
because I haven't binge listened to our podcast,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
but listening to yours go through

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
these recently

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
rapidly shifting times was

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
very interesting to me. Do you remember

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
your first episode where

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
you very exuberantly,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
like, very, just enthusiastically,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
like, really, you had heard about the

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
concept and you were really, like, into it,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
and were like, you loved the idea and you were

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
introducing it to the people and like, we are,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
we, the, if you'll go on the

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
webpage, we now have something called

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
a trigger warning.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
And it was like, it was like, you had just

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
heard about it and it was like disco, like,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
it was like, oh, it's like, and like

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
me at that same time, do you remember

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
that, you know, adding that

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
and being happy about it and

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I don't remember

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
being happy about it, that's the weird thing.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Well, that you were behind it, that you weren't, you weren't

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
like, oh, apparently you have to

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
put trigger warnings. It wasn't like that.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
It was like, I felt to me like, you were like, I heard

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
about this concept of letting people

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
know where they are or aren't,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
you know, gonna be comfortable

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
so that people can mind their own fucking beeswax

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
and you were like,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
sounds really logical

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
and practical to me.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
And I guess I must be a really

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
quintessential polite Canadian

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
because inside, I felt

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
like, fuck these people, what are they,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
this is a poor podcast.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
What are you talking about, trigger warnings?

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
And so, and then

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
the following episode, it was like

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
it was like this class, like this is what we were

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
all going through, it was sort of like

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
there was this first round of like, go

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
to the website and you'll see a new thing called

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
a trigger warning. A trigger warning

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
is a warning. It was just sort of like, this is like

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
it was like, not a big deal, like nothing's happening,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
no bowing, no scraping, nothing, but then the following

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
episode was like, look,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
here's the thing.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
The reason I did a trigger warning is

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
and the unspoken story

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
was that actually what had happened

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
was this avalanche of

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
maybe understandable, but ultimately

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
like bad

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
target, like because you're just trying to

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
do the right thing, like that you had been

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
there was this backlash

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
that obviously people listening to horror podcasts,

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
their nightmare was hearing you use

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
that phrase because it meant something different to them.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
They had a different relationship with it, etc.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
And so you remember that time is my question.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I remember the time and yeah, it was

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I got a whole bunch of emails

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
that almost seemed like a concerted effort

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
by people to say

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
you've got to be more sensitive to your listeners

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
and you've got to warn people and a lot of it was based around

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
very understandable topics, like

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
we're not a show that's going to highlight stories

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
about rape or child molestation

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and stuff like that, but we might

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
imply that in a story

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
so I can get how some people would want that.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Well, yeah, I know, I think I mean

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I'll

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
acting as the opposite of your publicist or agent

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
I would say, yeah, no, this is a genre

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
that is festooned with

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
better feeling and rape because

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
it's like it's a horror that is

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
being written by people who are

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
they're off the chain

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
there the roots come through reddit forums

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
and things and people are exploring

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
really what scares me

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
what will therefore scare a stranger

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
and there's an often campfire

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
stories begin as that it would have been

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
outrageous to

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
ask a parent via an affidavit

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
or something if you're like

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
hey, your kid's going to be at summer camp

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
is it alright with you if I tell him this

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
I'm going to tell him a couple stories, I've written the synopses here

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
you're like what the fuck, what

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
two teenagers

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
lovers lane, my child is 10 years old

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
what are you talking about, it's not planned

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
it's like very tribal and like

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
like horror has always

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
it has its roots in

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I mean, what draws you to

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
horror, you talk more than me about it

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
like I just like listening to it and I don't know why

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
well

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
in terms of horror it's always been a genre

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
that I like but when I grew up

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
when I was young I would lie in bed on Sunday night

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
and there was a radio show in my

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
hometown of Toronto and they played

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
old

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
old time radio shows like

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Lights Out and Suspense and that type of thing

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
so I was introduced

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
to horror in the audio format

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
so it was the magic of

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
if you watch a horror movie

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
and there's a creepy basement

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
you're seeing the director's

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
impression of their creepiest basement

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
but if you're listening to a story

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and they say, I walked into a creepy

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
basement, the listener is going to imagine

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
what their creepiest

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
basement looks like and so their

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
imagination draws them into the story

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
did those shows use sound effects?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
oh yeah, they did

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
also if I

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
watch an Eli Roth movie

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I'll be like, well

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I don't know if I want to

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I need more of a story than this

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
which means unfortunately for the horror director

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
that I basically want it to be more like

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Jaws or E.T.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
and maybe that director is like

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
saying, well I just want to make a movie

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
that will freak you out, gross you out

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
take you to a crazy dark, demonic place

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
that your return

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
threshold is running out of the theatre

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
and telling your friends I survived watching this movie

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
and artists should have a right

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
to, they shouldn't be bound to my definition

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
of what a story is, however

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
when I watch a movie I go to a movie with those

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
expectations and I do not go to books

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
which I don't read

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
with that expectation therefore I definitely

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
do not go to a strangers

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
half of the time anonymous

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
like crazy

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I just wrote this to

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
kind of fuck with you

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
to fuck with myself and so a lot of the themes

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
will have to do with

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
heavy themes that emerge that

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
you in an uncomfortable place are

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
abortion

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
there's such a huge

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
it's almost because where else would you

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
go except the idea of children

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
children being threatened

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
the stakes can only

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
get so high before

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
some theme of that

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
your stories like you said

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
they don't go there

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
you would never be mistaken for being into

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
the things that you're supposed to be scared of

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
but they have to be able to go there

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
in order to enjoy it

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I think that I don't know

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I know that I could never

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
our friend John Grills

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
who does the creepy podcast

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
which is more of just

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
how I found your podcast

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
he told me

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
because I was like I don't think I could ever write horror

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I wouldn't know how to do it

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
and he said just scare yourself

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
like do the same advice with comedy

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
as you would for horror

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
and then I think oh yeah

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
like then I couldn't do it

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
because when I think about

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
being scared I get scared

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
so my stories

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
would be about like someone made me

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
go to a scary thing

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
and I would

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
and I said

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
no I'm not gonna go

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I'm not gonna go to that scary thing

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I don't like being startled

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
and then they felt bad

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
and that made me feel bad

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
well yeah

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
it's true

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
so I like listening to other people

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
who go there and like I'm a

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
proctologist that likes to do

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
extracurricular work

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and I'm like whoa

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
that's not a real example

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
well yeah

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
and the other thing too when it comes to writing horror

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
not that I do a lot of it

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
but you think that one of the big things

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
about horror is if there's a twist

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
or if there's something you don't see coming

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
that would be the real scary point

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
but if you're writing it

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
well you know what the twist is

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
so you can never put yourself behind

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
the scenes enough to know

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
to experience that twist

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
what scares you

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
what scares me

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
the thing

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
well it's not so much of a broad theme

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
but the thing that creeps me out the most

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
and you see it a lot in horror films

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
is that someone's standing outside

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
and there's a face in the window

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and if there's something about

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
it's either you're inside the house and you look out the window

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
and you see somebody standing in your yard

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
or you see a face in the window

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
or like the house you just got out of

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
there's stories where

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
there's weird shit going on in the house

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
and then finally the person does

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
what you would do which is they just get the fuck out of there

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
they're like I'm gonna stay in a motel

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
and then they drop their keys

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and they look up and there's a fucking person in the window

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
it's like

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
it's almost scarier

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
remember that classic urban legend

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
about the trucker with the headlights

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
the punchline of that

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
is that you lived but it's scarier

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
thinking about

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
there was a dude in your backseat

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
because

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
part of that is like

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
the red eyeball behind the keyhole

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
or whatever the red room

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
that's another classic where it's like I looked through the keyhole

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
and it was just red all I saw was red

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I heard that hotel room was like haunted

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
or the red but I already blew it

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
there's a red eye whatever

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
who cares

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I can't write horror I don't know what I'd do

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
it would be all about cutting

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
I don't even know where I'd go

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
it scares you

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
surgery

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
just basic like bees

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
yeah

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
people

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
conversations

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
the alt-right

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
home invasion

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
losing Cody

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
disappointing my dogs

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
what would make you run

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
what would make you run

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
no questions asked

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
everything I've never asked questions

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
if I can't I'm not allowed to talk I start running

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
hey you know why I'm not running

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
shut up

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
have you ever lived through the horror

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
of when you go to a fast food restaurant

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
and they give you a soft drink

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
and there's like this prophylactic over the whole

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
you're just

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
terrifying

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
run

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
are you implying

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
in all of your Canadian grace

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
that that piece of Scotch tape is doing me the service

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
of keeping germs out of my

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
my Thai iced tea

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
is that like

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
you're saying by the way you're welcome

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
for keeping those germs out of the hole

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
it's just to protect them

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
they don't want to have to spill it

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I don't know

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I've never experienced that

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and you're like peeling at this thing

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and the tape just breaks

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
it's something it breaks into little strings

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
like it turns into

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
you're like pulling threads of Scotch tape

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I'm telling you look

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
why don't you kids get a job

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
um

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
well they gotta make like

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Capri Sun straws where you could just like

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
they have a point to it and you just go bam

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
you know yeah I mean you can't

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
tell me thank you yes everybody

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
applause and stand while you're doing it

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
look at you

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I guess that was a good idea

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
look at you easy shark tank mother fuckers

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
people people come up with stuff

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
there just isn't enough pushback from the community

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
we need to focus

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
on how hard it is for

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
yeah yeah I know you can't complain

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
about this stuff anymore because it's like

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
it's like it's to the world

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
is too connected and the real life

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
became the internet so you really can't

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
anymore it's not fun

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
even it used to already be whiny

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
and taboo but you know you can't be like

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I was on my way over here and the

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
wait person did

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
one of these things and everyone

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
now is just like yeah they make minimum

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
wage fuck you you fucking cock sucker

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and then

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
a bunch of people attack them for what's wrong with sucking

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
cock nothing I just say

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
if he was doing it

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
never mind I just

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
the point at straw would be good a point

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
at straw everyone wins or like

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
you know they have those they have some of them

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
but they're the lids that are like legitimately

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
sealed until you really

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
poke the plug there when there's a circular thing

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
and you like poke you poke right down in there

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
and it's like ready made and it goes

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
it's like really satisfying gotta be

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
what it exists gotta be a half a penny

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
more per lid and we're all

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
gonna get rich what half penny

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
at a time just

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
write a screenplay

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
it's

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
not that difficult

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
to figure out everyone just

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
write a screenplay and sell it

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
and take that money put

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
it into your restaurant supplies

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
and what we have left over

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
we build a radio for our island

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
why do I have to

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
spell it out for everybody

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I understand how money works

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
there's an island

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
so we had a

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
you got a

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
there was a thing that

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
did Rebecca write the thing that

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
and did she want

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
credit

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
she just got it if she did write it

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
the thing that

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
there was a thing that's

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
written that we can do a

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
performance we can write it

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Dan some people call it a script

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
you're in Hollywood

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
your team the no sleep team

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
by the way do you call them no sleeps

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
the individual segments

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
are they called those do you go like

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I have to do three more no sleeps

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
or this episode will be

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
hmmm

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
frighteningly under

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
run time

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
no Dan we don't

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
you don't call them no sleeps what do you

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
refer to them as

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
basically are you talking about the

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
individual segments

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
we should call them uh

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
naps

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
like what do you

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
what do you what do you

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I said naps

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
everybody applaud

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
like what do you think do you think Rod

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Sterling called them called them zones

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
or like we just call them

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
stories because it's not like you're

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
gonna confuse them with another thing

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
alright I answered my own question

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
creep shows the individual creep

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
shows within a creep show

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
it's confusing I'm glad that we're sharing

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
this with our Canadian friend yeah what

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
thing there's a thing that's been written

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
sleeps

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
sorry about that thanks

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
so as I mentioned Dan was

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
talking about no sleep on the show

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
and talking about

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Canada and me being a Canadian and all that

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
so we talked to one of our

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
famous writers one of our best

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
C.K. Walker

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
beloved

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
and if you if you don't

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
know how many people here are fans of

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
horror and Netflix enough to know about

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
the upcoming series called the house

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
the haunting of Hill House

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
the great

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
the great C.K. Walker

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
is a staff writer on

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
that series so

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
we're thrilled not only that she is

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
working with great people like Mike Flanagan

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
doing all these big TV series but

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
she still writes stories for us and so

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
what we decided to do or C.K.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
did was to write a short

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
script about Canada

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
specifically about Canadian

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Thanksgiving

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
because our Thanksgiving

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
is next weekend we have it

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
earlier than you that's spooky as hell

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
anytime I would

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
ask questions about it but I think

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
we're gonna learn about yes that's

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
right because C.K.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
wrote this script

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
with some fun but also with some true facts

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
about one of the

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
people who founded Canada

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
or at least got it off the ground many many years

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
ago and how it relates to Thanksgiving

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
can we

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
is the music

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
let's see what we got oh you got you got

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
good that's right

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
yeah

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
all our music has

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
fat beats Dan so

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I guess I should get my script too

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
first nations

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
oh by the way Brandon will be playing

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
the part of Jeff Davis

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
already here

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
see how I can do this

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
all right hosers

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
so in Canada

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
we've got this thing called Thanksgiving

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
there don't you know

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
hey it's offensive when you do it

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
it works the opposite

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
because

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
well you know it's tradition

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
in the motherland to tell stories of

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Thanksgiving past

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
from around the world

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
we do it around the holidays of course

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
but today I'm in America

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Los Angeles to be specific

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
and since Canada's day of thanks

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
is quickly approaching I thought I would tell

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
you about a Thanksgiving

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
of the future

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
instead

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
a Thanksgiving when I extend

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
an invitation down south

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
to some American friends

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
music

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
he brought sound effects

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
and his doorbell was on Canada sorry okay

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
let us in

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
come on David I haven't seen my balls

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
in hours

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
yeah I don't think that has anything to do

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
with the weather seriously it's fucking cold

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
hey oh boys welcome to Canada

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
you're just in time

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
didn't think we'd ever find the place

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
well I'm glad to see you did

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
sun's getting low gotta get you inside

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
before dark

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
packed quite a bit for a long weekend

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
didn't ya? ridiculous

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
you travel like a woman

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
it's my laptop and some DVDs

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
what? it was a long flight

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
smart if you ask me

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
not much to do and too cold to go

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
anywhere what's the temperature

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
outside David? it's about

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
6 degrees celsius

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
oh a bit of a scorcher

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
can we get that in freedom units

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
it's like 40 degrees

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
thank you patriot

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
can I get you a boys a beer?

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I'll take one damn nice place

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
David? smells fucking good too

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
turkey?

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
of course there's turkey

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
it's Canadian Thanksgiving

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
it's just called Thanksgiving

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
here

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
you got candied yams

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
I'm afraid not

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
only in the U.S. do they put sugar

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
and marshmallows in their vegetables

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I would love to get my hands on some

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
poutine

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
no poutine

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
a pecan pie

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
nope

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Thanksgiving in Canada is a bit different

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
than in the U.S.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
how so?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
other than being on a Monday

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
well here it's not just

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
a Christmas dress rehearsal

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
damn

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
there are traditions and rites

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
that must be satisfied

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
like what? oh you'll see

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
sit down

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
eat eat it's custom that

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
the host tells the story of the first Thanksgiving

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
over the feast

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
though I'm sure you're already well versed in it

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I wouldn't count on that

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
this is great

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
you're a decent cook

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Cummings

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
definitely but what's the green

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
stuff at the end of the table?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
that's mushed peas

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
they were served at the first Thanksgiving

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
in Canada

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
so are you ready for the telling?

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
yeah whatever you want just pass more of that

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Canadian gravy

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
well

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
the story of the first Thanksgiving

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
starts in 1574

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
with a pirate named

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Martin Frobisher

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
wait there's pirates in this story

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
oh there sure is

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
he was a pirate

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
lost his eye

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
privateering for the English crown

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
so was he a privateer

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
or a pirate?

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
well he was both

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Frobisher was an Englishman who had contracts

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
with the crown to go explore

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
the Northwest Passage

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
but he also participated in piracy

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Frobisher's letter of mark

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
basically government license

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
to attack England's enemies at sea

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
was falsified

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
yeah basically

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
but in 1574

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Martin received the crown's approval

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
to explore new routes to the Pacific Ocean

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
through

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
well though he didn't get the funding

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Frobisher was forced to pursue financing

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
through his friend and director

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
of the cafe company Michael Locke

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
America's first Thanksgiving stories

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
have way more murder

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Jeff left and Brandy

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
showed up

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
oh shit hey Brandy

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
so

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
so Frobisher weighed anchor

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
and took his fleet of three ships west

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
because of some bad weather

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
he was pushed into Baffin Island

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
and landed in an inlet that Martin named

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Frobisher Bay

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
and had the first Canadian Thanksgiving

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
it's really picking up out there

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
yes it sure is

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
and interestingly enough that was

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
not the first Thanksgiving

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
because while Frobisher was on Baffin Island

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
he discovered gold

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
and that was the first Canadian Thanksgiving

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
no not even close

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
you see happy with his find

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Martin loaded up 200 tons

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
of mined gold

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
from Frobisher Bay

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
and hauled it back to England to present to the queen

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
he was celebrated

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
by high society

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
welcomed into new circles

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
people no longer mocked his one eye

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Martin wanted more

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
so he requested another expedition

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
to retrieve even more gold from Canada

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
he also petitioned

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Queen Elizabeth to be named

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
High Admiral of the Northwestern Seas

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
she agreed

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
to one request but not the other

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
and Martin was forced to again

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
beg for financing from his friend

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Michael Locke and the Cafe Company

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
did he get it

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
did he go back to Canada

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
for more gold

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
he did yes yes

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
and this time he took a fleet of 15 vessels

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
and fine gold chain

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
around his neck

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
a gift from Queen Elizabeth herself

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
this time

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
the storm that hit the expedition

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
was truly awesome

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
and they limped into Frobisher Bay

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
with a fleet of only 12

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
and this was the first Canadian

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Thanksgiving

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
yes yes yes

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Martin was so happy to make land

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
that the 400 men on the expedition

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
sat down to a lovely supper

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
of salted ham

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
biscuits and mushed peas

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
moose meat would have been more Canadian

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
oh Spencer

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
no no no

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Martin saw the moose

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
as a majestic animal

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
larger and more powerful than a horse

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
he would never have thought to slaughter one for food

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
and that's the story

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
of the first Canadian Thanksgiving

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
well yes but there's more

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
much much more

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Frobisher mined the gold

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
and brought 1350

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
tons

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
of it back to England

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
is that an animal

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
it's a moose

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I'm gonna get another beer

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
so Frobisher was Kardashian rich

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
when he got back to England

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
well not exactly

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Frobisher returned to England

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
with his 1300 tons of gold

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
but when he anchored in London

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
he received unsettling news

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
the gold he brought back

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
from Canada had been smelted

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
it turns out it wasn't

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
gold at all

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
what was it?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
iron pyrite

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
ha ha ha ha

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
fools gold

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
yes

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
and he had literal tons of it

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Frobisher was stripped

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
of his title shunned by the crown

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
the cafe company went bankrupt

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
and Martin's friend Michael Locke

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
was thrown into debtor's prison

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
wow

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
share your wow

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Martin Frobisher was humiliated

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
publicly and otherwise

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
people laughed in his face

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
we get another laugh Dan

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
ha

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
accused his one remaining eye of bad eyesight

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
and Martin blamed Canada

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
for the bamboozle

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
drunkenly ranting that the only

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
dignified part of that frozen hell

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
was the enormous antlered

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
creature we now call

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
a moose

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I like the Canadian Thanksgiving

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
oh

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
what happened next

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
well

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Frobisher died during the Anglo-Spanish

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
war in France

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
in a town called Brest

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
ha ha ha

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
well admit that story is more interesting

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
than pilgrims eating corn in the greater

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Boston area

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
oh but it's not finished

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
god damn it

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
it's not

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
what else could

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
whatever part of the story

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
could there be

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
what about Frobisher's body

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
his corpse is a part

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
of the story

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
yes indeed upon hearing

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
of Frobisher's death at Brest

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
ha ha ha

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Queen Elizabeth ordered

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
his body to be decapitated

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
and taken back to Baffin Island

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
and buried there

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
so that his shame may follow him into death

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
why be

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
headed? well because she did not believe

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Frobisher should ever be able to hold

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
his head high even in the afterlife

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
savage

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
indeed

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
and it's said that every Thanksgiving

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Frobisher awakens from hell

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
to climb upon

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
his antlered steed

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
a moose? yes a moose

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and passed through Canada from coast to coast

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
visiting our homes

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
to demand a piece of gold

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
from every household

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
wait wait wait he's a headless horseman

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I mean mooseman? yes

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
exactly

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
I really love Canadian Thanksgiving

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
why does he do that

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
well he wishes to collect the fortune

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
of gold that Canada robbed him of

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
to clear his name

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
exactly

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
what was that

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
that's hilarious

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
so what do you guys do? eat Yukon gold potatoes

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
at Thanksgiving or some shit

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
of course

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
now don't be ridiculous Dan

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
we offer him gold

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
for his harvest

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
gold? right so like Canadian

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
kids leave out gold slogger on Thanksgiving

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
night or mommy's earrings

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
oh no no children are put to bed long

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
before Frobisher arrives

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
and you simply hand him

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
the gold

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
okay guys seriously what is that

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
what do you mean hand him the gold

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
there's a moose on the porch

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
on the fucking porch

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
alright you have to hand it to him

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
very carefully remember that Frobisher

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
only has one eye and he will

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
be very angry if he accidentally

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
drops his gold what gold

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
the gold you brought

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
for Thanksgiving of course

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
but we didn't know we were supposed

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
to bring gold to Canadian Thanksgiving

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Jesus Christ

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
it's a

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
it's a muffled door crash

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
now

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
everybody slowly get out your

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
gold Frobisher prefers

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
solid metal but sometimes will accept

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
flakes or even gold wiring

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I heard he even once accepted

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
a book called Churchill's gold

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
a book called Churchill gold

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
yes yes and actually

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
growing up in my family

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
we were very poor and some years

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
we offered him simple craft

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
dinner cooked to golden perfection

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
we don't have any gold

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
you fucking lunatic

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
his head

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
it's sitting behind him

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
it's off

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
his fucking head's off

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
well of course it is you listen

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
to the story now quickly

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
stop playing around and offer

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
him our gold or he will kill us

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
we don't have any gold

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
what?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
guests always bring the gold for Thanksgiving

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
everyone knows that

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
oh god

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
what if we don't have any gold

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
what do I do

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
if we

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
don't offer gold to Frobisher on Thanksgiving

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
then we will be massacred

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
trampled to death under the hooves

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
of his steed

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
it's not a steed

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
it's a fucking moose

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
man Jesus

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
does anybody have a Rolex

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
a gold chain a wedding ring

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
literally anything made out of gold

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
on what you pay me why don't you offer me

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
your fucking Emmy Dan

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
why the fuck would I have that with me

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I didn't bring a 40 pound suitcase

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
like Jeff

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
my suitcase

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I might have something

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
let me see

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
let me just look

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
gold

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I'm looking

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
gold

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
it's your line too

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
oh it is my line

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
but if you want

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Frobisher to say his last line again

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I'd be fine

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
hurry Jeff

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
wherever you are hurry Brandon

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
he has many homes to get to

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
his patience is thin

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
no no no no not that one

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
gold

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
good good bow your head

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
and grip it tightly do not

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
let him drop it his vision is bad

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
what is it

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
what are you giving him

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Jesus Jeff that's not gold

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
he may accept it

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
what's he doing

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
he's showing

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
the DVD

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
to Frobisher's head

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
he's putting it into his bag

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
he's he's accepted it

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
holy shit

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
that was

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
that was just

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
man fuck Canadian Thanksgiving

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
what DVD did you even give him Jeff

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
the 20th anniversary

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
of the re-release

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
of GoldenEye

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
that fucking worked

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
it was very good thinking

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Frobisher is very sensitive

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
about his missing eye

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'm sure he would like to have a golden one

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
that doesn't

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
that doesn't even make sense

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I think it does in Canada

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I'm not surprised at all

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
that Frobisher accepted our

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
endowment it was very clever

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Brandon

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Brandon

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Christ what is it

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
uh oh

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
ah I'm just

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
just going through my bag and I

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I think I fucked up with the DVD

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
oh yeah wrong region

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
no

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I didn't get to put the right one

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
back in the case

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
what are you saying

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I'm saying the 20th

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
anniversary of the re-release

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
of GoldenEye is not in the

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
disc in the case

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
that I gave him

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
well what is in the case

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I gave him

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
fuck he's coming back

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
he's coming back

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
how much time do we have

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
what do we do Cummings

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
nothing

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
if he doesn't have the 20th anniversary

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
of the re-release of GoldenEye

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
then it's already too late

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I thought I gave it to him

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I tried shit

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
oh fuck

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
he's coming back to Canada

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
shit

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
run

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
our door is so quiet

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
there's nowhere to run

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I thought it was the 20th anniversary

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
of the re-release of GoldenEye

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I swear

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I swear

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
wow

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
you bring my body home

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
to the US you hear me Cummings

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
don't let them bury me

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
in Canada

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
ah

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
ah

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
ah

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
ah

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
ah

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
ah

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I withhold from my death screen

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
the letter you

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
because your

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
country is so fond of it

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
they use it

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
too much in words like a boot

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I'm riffing

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
ah

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I know what you're thinking

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
but don't worry I do live through

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
that particular Thanksgiving Day

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
massacre

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
every Canadian knows to keep a gold filling

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
in their molar for Old Frobisher

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
just for this very reason

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
oh and I do bring

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Dan's body back to the States

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
so you can rest easy about that

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
but I guess what you really want to know

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
is what disc is in the case

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
if it isn't

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
GoldenEye

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
and sure

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I'll tell you

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
it's a Razzie nominated 2008

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Matthew McConaughey masterpiece

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.000
called Fool's Gold

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
alright

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
16 pages

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
pretty powerful stuff

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I looked at the number of pages

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
when we were at page 8

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and I was like

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
oh shit

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I was led to believe that you gave strict

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
requirements for what you wanted the story

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
to be

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
we keep a tight ship around here

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
let's do some

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
a big part of the podcast that I like

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
is at least once per season

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
you do these

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
suddenly shocking episodes

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
is there a term for

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
is it like flash horror

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
or is there a term for the objective

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
the mini no-sleeps

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
yeah

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
flash fiction is a common one

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
usually stories that run 3-5 minutes long

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
flash fiction

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
micro stories

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
micro horrors

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
alright let's do a couple

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
no script for tonight

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
and I'll play the David Cummings part

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
and then

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I don't know how we're gonna do it

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
because usually they're more narrated

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
but

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I'll

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I'll introduce one

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and then

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
we'll go from there

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
and then we'll make some adjustments

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
alright hit the music

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
oh I guess I'm talking to you

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
yeah hit your music

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
sorry I would have been more polite

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
if I knew I was talking to you

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
hit the music

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I'm Canadian I wait for please and thank you

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
the hourglass is almost

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
full

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
and time is just

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
about up

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
for tonight

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
there will be

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
no sleep

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
this is a podcast

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
about disturbing you

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
for fun

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and profit

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
with an under emphasis

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
on the profit

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
which will be equitably distributed

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
to all of the talent involved

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
for the health care

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
for all those involved in this show

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
will be

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
universal

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
anyone listening to tonight's show

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
will have any

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
injuries immediately healed

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
at the nearest hospital

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
as part of a new promotion

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
for tonight there will be

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
no oligarchy

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm your host David Cummings

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
and tonight

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I will be

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
coming a few stories

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
it took that long for you to make fun of my last name

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
it's not making fun of your last name

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
it's making fun of the idea of you were like

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
hey hey I got

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
it's like we used to say in the early

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
they're not racist jokes

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
they're jokes about racism

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
it worked until

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
2006

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
and then everything started falling apart

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
for tonight there will be millennial

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
accountability

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
a few words about the trigger warning

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
on our website

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000

you gave yourself like amazing

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
due to budget constraints

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
well it's season 11

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000

before we get started

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
starting in October

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000

I appreciate these donations

and will spread them out

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
accordingly across the tundra

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I speak for the audience when I say

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
shut the fuck up Cummings

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
but let's get on with the show

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
we've got a series of

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
micro fast spine tinglers

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
tonight called

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
suddenly shockers

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
these micro sized

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
postcards from the oblivion

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
will take you on a trip to fear

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
but come with

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
postage prepaid

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
through stamps dot com

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
which is being

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
subsidized by the Canadian government

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I know you don't want to hear

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
commercials during your podcasts

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
and we are sensitive to that

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
so the Royal Canadian Mounties

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
have given us a special

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
check

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
it's all

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
we're running like a

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Swiss clock up here

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
our first tale

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
cuckoo clocks

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
are often

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
a trope

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
in chronological

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
imagery

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
these avian time tellers

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
often

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
say loud sounds

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
at various hours

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
to ring the time of day in

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
but sometimes the time

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
of day is the only

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
time you wish

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
you had left

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
author J.K. Simmons

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
takes us through an example

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
of what I mean

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
in a tale read by

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Rupert

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
that will make you understand

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
why I love

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
my grandfather's

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
cuckoo clock

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
I

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
will never do another episode

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
of the podcast again

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
bitty

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
it was

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
a very difficult time

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
for me

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
because I had no time

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
my beloved grandfather

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
had passed away and at the time

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
of his death

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
his favorite cherished

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
cuckoo clock stopped

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
ticking

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:55.000
cuckoo clock

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I didn't know I could

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I had that power

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Bradley

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
why don't you do something nice

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
for your grandfather's funeral

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
but I didn't know what to do

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
for his funeral

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
with his clock broken

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
cuckooing no more

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I knew I had to have it repaired

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Bradley

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
you should hurry up

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
and get that cuckoo clock repaired

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I'm horny

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and my needs

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
come first

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
and so I took care of her cuckoo

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
lovingly

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
sensuously

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
with lots of little birds

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
popping in and out

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
oh thank you

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Bradley

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
that takes care of that

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
my true Canadian girlfriend

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
thanking me for sex

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
and that's when I called

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
the cuckoo clock repairman

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
hey

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
he can't leave his cuckoo clock here no more

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
hey shut up

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
you fucking immigrant

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I don't need any of this

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
immigrant shit

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
going on in my cuckoo clock

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
repair shop

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
what do you want

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
my beloved grandfather

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
has passed and his cuckoo

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
clock broke

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
ceased to function at the very moment

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
of his death have you experienced

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
supernatural

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
cuckoo clock repair before

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
don't you

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
are you fucking with me

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I am not good sir

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
shut the fuck up

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
immigrants

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I'm trying to help you out

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
you can't even fucking with you

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
now I'm a Canadian fascist

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
get the fuck out of here

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
you need me tomorrow

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
yeah

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
sorry

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I got a little situation

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
going on in the

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
uh

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
back room

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
anyways

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
sit down

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
you came over right you called

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
and then you came over

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
yes

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I phoned you

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
and asked if I could come over to your shop

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
alright

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
sit down you're gonna wanna be

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
sitting for this story

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
within a story

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I must know

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
tell me of Timothy

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
well

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
all I could tell you is

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
what I've seen

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I never see it again

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
back in the old days

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
when this was a mining town

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
nobody cared what time it was

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
eventually

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
they found out they could mine more coal

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
if they took a bird down

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
put it in a cage

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
real cage like

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
and let it breed

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
the fucking coal fumes

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
coal fumes go up

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
the bird takes a dirt nap

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
only it ain't no dirt in the cage

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
imagine being a

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
fucking bird taking a dirt

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
nap in a cage with no dirt

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
rather

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
a fucking immigrant suffer that

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
fate personally

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
but that's just me

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I ain't gonna suffer

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
hey fuck you

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I'm a Canadian

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
fascist

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
love Canada I don't want anybody

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
coming in here fucking it up

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
that's pretty rare

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
sorry I ever fucking married you

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I'm sorry

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
you stay in your special

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
door

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
it ain't so special

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
you could have built a better door

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
yeah yeah yeah

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
you'll meet the little lady later

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
she's uh

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
uh

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
quite a reveal

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
anyways

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
get back to your B story

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
you god not a beast

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
don't dismiss it ain't no fucking sitcom

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
not a B story

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
not a fucking

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
what do you think George Costanza's gonna

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
have a runner

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
while the hitchhiker's getting killed

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
they get cut over to him and it's like

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
B story don't fucking insult me

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
that's immigrant shit

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
anyways

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
so this mining town right

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
here's the thing

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
whole town

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
runs on coal dig

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
yes coal coal is dug yes yes

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
but you can't dig the coal

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
if all the birds die see

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
so they get this idea right

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
the mining industry

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
they think

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
let's put kids down there

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
cheaper than fucking birds right

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
and a kid's gonna react

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
to coal fumes

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
just as readily as a bird

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
in point of fact

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
their lungs are notoriously weak

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
they're probably a more accurate and beneficial

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
metric of coal fumes than a different species

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
if it's too much for a kid

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
I should stop digging coal

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
look I'm not defending the practice

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
okay

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
these were Canadian kids

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
they didn't deserve that fate

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
and they're worth about

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
75% of American children

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
so they did it for years right

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
and the coal town

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
booms look you've seen it in the paper

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
this town buried one story though

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Timothy

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
is that what I said

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
yes

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
we're on pins and needles

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
for Timothy

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I can't

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
I judged your 16 pages

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
look at me go

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Timothy

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I don't know

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
the scientists didn't know

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
where they found him

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
and the test results

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
didn't provide no clarity

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
but this kid was

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
different

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
first time he went down

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
he come up from the fume chamber

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
saying give me more

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
the kid wouldn't die

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
see

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
he just kept loving going down

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
deeper and deeper

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
one after one

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
dozens after dozens

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
the Canadian coal miners started to die

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
because Timothy wasn't dying

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
he wasn't dying

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
by the time they caught on

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
they grabbed their pickaxes

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
but it wasn't coal they were going to mine

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
it was going to be Timothy's soul

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
at that point he was living down

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
in the bottom of the mines

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
where we called no man's land

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
because we hadn't yet

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
had an inclusive

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
mining operation

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
it's now called no body's land

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
it's also closed

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Canada has a very good green energy policy

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
and this is not about that

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
but they went down

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
pickaxes and torches

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
in hand

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
and the other hand free

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
the pickaxes

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
getting hot from the torch

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
adjacent to it

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
the custom made handles

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
of the torch and pickaxe

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
doing their job of fitting

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
snugly into one hand

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
so that later they could be described

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
in the telling of the story

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
as having plural things

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
in hand

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
without a second thought

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
when they got down

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
to nobody's land

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
they saw something scarier

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
than a thousand dead birds

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
something scarier

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
than the sea of child bones

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
that had been created

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
by the Canadian coal industry

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
they saw

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Timothy's empty cage

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
so anyways

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
that's on his anniversary

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
people say they

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
what did you say that made me alarmed

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
your grandpa died

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
your grandpa died

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
yeah grandpa

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
on Timothy's anniversary

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
oh my god you're right

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
they say he comes and he kills me

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
and Timothy's last name

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
if I'm not mistaken

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
was Horton

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
yeah

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
how did you left off the part about the Horton

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I'm trying to catch up to a reference

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
in here

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
you fucking immigrant

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
alright look

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
you've put up with enough

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
I can repair your cuckoo clock

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I'll bump you ahead

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
it's called the

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
true Canadian benefits package

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
couple of

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
brown people that want their clocks

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
fixed might find

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
they're unfixable this season

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
ha ha ha ha

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I'm racist

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
as Canadians

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
just the characters that have

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
come up it's coming

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I'm not a quintessential

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Canadian

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
listen to my voice I'm a villain

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Jesus alright

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
sorry I don't mean to give notes from inside the story

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I just

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
suddenly thought maybe you thought I was

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
doing something that I wasn't doing

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
no I hear you but

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I'm going to time to reveal my wife

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
oh my god where is she

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
now remember

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
you're the narrator of the story

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I just been

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
what do you call it some kind of dialogue

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
digression

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
within your prose

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
the

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
story pays off as I open this door

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
and you see my wife

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
oh

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
oh

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
oh my god

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
a smile too

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
wide for her face

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
now

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
you see why he keeps me away

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
horrifying

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
horrifying but strangely arousing

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
that's hey doc

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
why you're a doc

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
that's why they call it

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:05.000
a cuckoo clock

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
oh yeah

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
it's hard to improvise these

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
they have to be written in order to have a

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
punchy ending right

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
we try to have a punchy ending yes

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
so that's why they're called a cuckoo clock

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
I see

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I think my grandfather didn't know

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
that story and that's

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
why he died

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
that was a good one all things considered

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
that's fine

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
how have we been doing this for seven years

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
if that's what our stories are like

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I mean if you try to make one up

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
they're like

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I didn't want to mention

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
one thing I don't want to be cloying about it

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
but it actually was impressive to me

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
like I said

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I was following you

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
when trigger warnings were invented

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
and then following you for the backlash

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
and following you the whole time and you've never

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
whereas we've been podcasting the same amount of time

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
and I've just been like hitting garbage cans

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
and swerving around and like I don't want to hurt anybody

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
but I hurt everybody

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
but you have a scripted podcast

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
that's like you can watch the earth

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
move beneath your podcast's feet

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
but what emerges I just

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I'm listening to your most recent season

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
and you did Pride Week

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
and you did this like LGBT

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
like episode

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
and it's like

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I honestly like

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
there's a fear in the back of my head

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
when I think about this stuff I'm like

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
yeah but just don't

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
let's not have that

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
be adding water to something

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
like because the Nazis call it virtue signaling

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
and it just makes the

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
it truly I'm listening to

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
like scripted horror podcasts

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
and it's like I'm not

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
virtue signaling

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
or white nighting or whatever they call it when I say

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
it really struck me that

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
we like gay voices

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
gay perspectives and things

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
like make shit like horror

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
better because

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
either A you have a classic

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
story that's like a husband and wife

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
but it's like a husband and husband

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and it's like all the more like

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
because it's a horror story the focus is on this

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
fucked up shit that's going on

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
you're like run grab your husband

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
and run and you come through a visceral

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
experience like having been trained

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
neurologically to think of

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
people that are different

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
as the same which is like a healing

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
that's one kind of good thing

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
but then the other thing is like

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
when the shit goes deep and dark

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and earns those trigger warnings

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
there are like

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
there was an author who was

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
talking about his

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
it was like a weird like

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
there's a tradition in this format where it's like

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
the person is the unreliable narrator

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
who kind of like turns out to be

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
your kidnapper or whatever

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
and kind of like I don't know I'm babbling

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
but like would you take over

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
and say anything about that

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
like did you have you what has been

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
your experience I don't know if you're straight or gay

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
I've never bothered to ask because

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
I've been involved by your podcast

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
but like

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
whatever

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
category you might fit or not fit into

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
what has been your experience with representation

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
your obligations

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
your desires and things

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
well one of the neat things about our show

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
is that we have a cast of voice actors

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
writers producers and they're from

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
all around the world and we

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
they all record separately and send their parts in

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
and we have a really

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
strong representation

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
from the LGBTQ community

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
just in the team that creates the show

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
for you as a kind of incidental

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
like were you like a straight guy in front of

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
a microphone going like I like horror let's do this

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
horror thing and then one by one people are like

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
by the way I'm such and such

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
and you're like yes and

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
it's like the Muppet movie that works

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
yeah it was never an issue

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
it was never at all

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
and then as Dan mentioned it seemed for some

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
reason recently we did some

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
stories that just happened to have

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
same sex couples

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
it wasn't a heavy

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
gay theme there was no gay sex or anything

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
like that it's just two people driving

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
down the road and they're too

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
being gay on the road

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
can be a bit of a

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
problem

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I saw a gay ghost staring at me

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
yeah it's not

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
it's not like you just add the word yeah

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
and yeah so

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
that we did these stories and believe it or not

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I got emails from people saying

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
what's with all the queer stuff

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
why do you have you know

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
it adds nothing to the story why do you have all these

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
same sex things

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
and it was right around that time that we had

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
as a team we were already thinking about

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
putting together for Pride Month

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
an episode that had

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
every story would be written by someone from the

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
LGBTQ community and it was just

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
we're gonna celebrate Pride Month not because

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
just like

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
that I like that you pissed off somebody who

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
complained

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
well that's the thing and so I put a little disclaimer

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
on the next episode the episode before the Pride

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
episode basically said

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
look we will do these stories and

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
if you don't like them you're free to not listen

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
and we

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
and I think I tried to inform our audience

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
that yeah we've got voice actors

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
and people on the show who

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
terrifyingly enough are gay

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
and

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
and yeah we got some blowback from that

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
there were people who canceled their subscriptions

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
and all that kind of stuff

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
and they would never say by the way this isn't

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
like I this is because I

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
love freedom

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
and I perceive these

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
these sort of like

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
these

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
when I get these signals

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
they get ironically triggered by them

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and go like oh political correctness is coming

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
like because there's like

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and but I gotta say

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
as a potbellied 45 year old

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
straight white dude who has nothing

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
to gain or lose like I honestly

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
and this may be the most insulting compliment

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
of all time but I really struck

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
me as listening to that episode just yesterday

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
and was like I would

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I would recommend to a fan

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
of like where I was going like you should listen to this as like really well produced

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
well written

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
horror stories that have

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
a modern context to them but they

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
have a but they also have like

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
a classy like foundation

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
to them a respect for the audio

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
format and stuff like that and I would go actually

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
if you're gonna start with anything listen to the

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
it happens to be the LGBT I would say like

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
you'll find it that way but it wouldn't be because

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
it would be it just happens

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
to be my point being that

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
in addition to being inclusive it's

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
not like a handicap parking space it's

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
not it's not this like thing of like let's

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
be proactive and break the cycle which is also

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
fine but you've managed

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
to gracefully do this thing because

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
you've had this commune of artists

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
your people who love reading stories and writing stories

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
they're all individuals

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
snowflakes if you will

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
and and each of them

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
comes to the table I assume and going like you know

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
could I could I go here could I go there

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
could you represent this and that and you

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I'm I'm psychically

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
osmotically interpreting are that are like me and

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
that you would go yeah because

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
why would I put up a wall against

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
that and and the result

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
is truly not obnoxious it's not

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
saccharine it's not watered

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
down it's anything it's like it has

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
it has all this extra flavor

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
to it because it's

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
it's something I mean look

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
fear xenophobia

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
sex fear they all go kind of hand in hand

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
right it's different from comedy

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
and

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
I guess that's like my remaining

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
like discussion point is like what the hell

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
is it with what are we

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
in the in the in these times where we're

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
actually trying to be sensitive to each

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
other and when the reality

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
is that when we go to bed together

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
and when we speak around campfires

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
to each other when we

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
we want to get visceral reactions from

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
each other we want to we want to be able to

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
cross thresholds that's literally the definition

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
of a story crossing boundaries

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
and yet in a very

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I'm not doing the old man thing where I'm like

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
we can't have fun anymore because

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
you're having fun but you're not

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
hurting anybody it's very clear

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
that you're not doing it in defiance

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
it's like it's very it's two

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
things are very clear when I listen to that

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
podcast you guys don't give a shit

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
about like whether or not

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
somebody might boycott or anything

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
like that there's no pandering

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
happening and the next thing

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
that's clear is that you definitely don't want to hurt

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
anybody I like I don't know how

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
how you could impart to somebody

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
that we're listening is that like is there some

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
key to the philosophy like the algorithm

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
that you run or is it simply

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
you don't think about it and

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
over thought well I fully

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
agree Dan that I am pretty fucking awesome

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
no no no come on come on

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
no it's yeah it's

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
definitely the latter it's just

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
I don't care and I know it's

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I've heard that lately some people say that

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
as a straight person if I say look I don't

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
care if you're gay or straight or trans

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
and they say well that's not right you gotta

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
be a little more sensitive but no to me

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
like you said sex

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
and horror are very intermingled

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
they're very much

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
talking about it

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
maybe they weren't interesting

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
like what's the kind of stuff

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
that you get like submissions

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
like so what are

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
and you can say I don't want to talk about this

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
because I don't want you to know how the sausage is made

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
and you know but

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
do you have lines that you draw

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
where like rules

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
in your head that you run things through

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
so you go like you know what this is

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
because this

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
go ahead I'll stop asking the question

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
so you can answer it

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
there aren't a lot of hard and fast rules

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
as I mentioned

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
earlier we'll do a story if it implies

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
let's say a sexual assault

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
or rape something that isn't gratuitous

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
we're not going to have a 12 minute segment

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
where you hear a person describe

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
the graphic moments of them being

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
raped and stuff like that

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
so we guard that line

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
but I remember

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
way back in season 3 we did a story

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
called Autopilot

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
and it basically told the story

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
of something that you hear in the news

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
every summer

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
and it's horrifyingly tragic

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
and it has to do with children being left

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
in cars in the summertime

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
and so that's

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
a story that I probably wouldn't do today

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
because fearing all the blowback and people saying

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
we heard back from

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
after that we did that show

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
somebody emailed me and said

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
are you going to keep doing stories where children are murdered

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
and we thought

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
the child wasn't murdered it was a horrifying accident

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
but that's how his mind

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
as a father

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
he thought that

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
we like pushing people

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and we say right at the top of every show

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
as Dan has so gracefully pointed out tonight

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
with his imitation of me

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I say

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
we do tales to frighten

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and disturb

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
and that key word disturb

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
is I think lost on a lot of people

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
not just to be

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
chills up the spine that's spooky

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
but we want people to be genuinely

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
uncomfortable and unsettled

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I think you phrased it in a way that it's the most

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
elegant trigger warning

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
which is something like

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
to paraphrase it you're coming here

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
to be frightened and disturbed on purpose

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
or something like that

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
you're coming here to do that

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
you're choosing to be frightened and

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
disturbed for your own entertainment

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
that's a big part of it

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
what do you use then?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I mean

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
oh boy

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
is it audio

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
or horror that's more

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
like if you had an opportunity to do more than

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
the audio

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
version of it

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
you're like well I like the scary stuff

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
or are you more like

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
I like

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
audio storytelling and it doesn't necessarily

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
have to be horror but that's the

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
hot dog of audio

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
yeah I think

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
audio and horror go together

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
better than probably any other format

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
again just what I mentioned earlier

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
about using your imagination and getting cues

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
from the story to involve yourself

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
in the story but

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
you know doing it for seven years

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I'd love to branch out I had the thrill

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
of being on a podcast

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
produced by the aforementioned Alex

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Aldea about called Deadly Manors

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
and it was a ten part series

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
thank you very much

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
and it's basically like

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
the movie Clue it's a comedy

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
who done it Murder Mystery

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
and being able to do comedy

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
and play a bit of an over the top

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
has been washed out

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
actor in a role that was written

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
especially for me

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
was a real thrill and that was a lot of fun

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
so yeah I think horror will always be my first love

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
but yeah it'd be fun to branch out

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
and do voices on animation

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Rick and Morty and all the stuff so

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
yeah

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
well it's funny you should mention that David

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
because I actually have

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
now I know I did some goofing

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I improvised some stuff

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
but I did write and polish

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
a

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
story in which the character

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
is you David Cummings

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
telling a story

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
called

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
and I'm telling you because you'll have to introduce it

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
author Dan Harmon

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
will tell the story

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
the title is

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
why I won't ever go back

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
to Rick and Morty

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
so

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
then you do the introduction and I'll be you

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
telling the story

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I'm me introducing you as me

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
yeah

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
in our final tale

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
author music what's the music

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
music

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
hey wait sorry just before we do this

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
can I give a shout out real quick

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
yeah I know I forgot about the shout out

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
we had a we had a fan that was gonna come

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
they they're not from here and they're gonna come

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
and see the show but they had a health

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
incident that involved I believe a brain

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
tumor which made them had to cancel

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
their plans they wanted to be here

in our

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
final tale

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
we meet a man

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
involved in producing

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
a pretty funny show

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
author Dan Harmon shares with us

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
a tale

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
horrifyingly enough about

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
said show and it's a story

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
entitled

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
why I'll never go back to

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
making more tea

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
my name

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
is David Cummings

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I'm an actor

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
primarily working in the Canadian area

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I don't

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
toot my own horn

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I like to have lots of sex

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
with my big Canadian

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:51.000
dick

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I enjoy the company

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
of the ladies

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and a nice six pack of

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
moose head

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Mickey's big mouth

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
what do we drink

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Molson

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Molson ice

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
but

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
but what I've always wanted

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
to do

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
was be a voice actor

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
on an adult swim cartoon

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
called Rick and Morty

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I never thought

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I could be a candidate

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
for such a job

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
little old me sitting in my

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
shack on the North Pole

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
but

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
it's healthy to fantasize

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
and so I would pet my

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
husky

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
and look at my sled

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
while

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
whittling

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
my kitchen furniture

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
out of my grandmother's

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
snowshoes

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
which she donated to me

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
after retiring from Vaudeville

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Canadian

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Vaudeville

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
which

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
no I'm not going to tell you about that

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
that's a different story

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
so it was quite a surprise

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
to me when my

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
message on the local moose board

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
got responded to

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
with a strange

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
handwritten scroll

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I asked the bartender

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
had anyone been

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
or ruined

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I don't know why

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
it's so why am I allowed

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I don't know why am I abusive

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
it doesn't

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
it's because you're nice and so I'm abusing you

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
it makes no sense

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I gave you a big dick remember

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I don't think of you as a

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
I'm thinking of me as the bad person

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
alright sorry

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
the bartender's answer was

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
even more

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
weird

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
than my question

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
no wait no weirder

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
it's funny you should

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
ask because

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
no

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
when I got home to my answering

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
machine I had the strangest

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
message

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
it said it was from

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
an Emmy winning television producer

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
but I couldn't tell if it was fake

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
my friends like to play Canadian

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
pranks

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
but it went like this

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
how's it going there

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
here's

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
what you're going to be on the old Rick and Morty there

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
oh jeez

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
so yeah I'll come over

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
with some oil so we'll talk about it there

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I backed up

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
from the machine with horror

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
if that message

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
was from a producer of Rick and Morty

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
why would he be coming over

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
and why would he be

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
speaking like me

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
ran to the front door

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
and rubbed it with

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
my hand on the cold window

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
unsticking

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
my flesh from the

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
frozen pain of glass

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
poked my eyes outside and

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
saw anyways later I was

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
look

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
it's getting late

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
found a plane ticket in a box

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
with a thumb

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
would have described it longer and more scary

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
but that's I got to get the bullet

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
points because we got to we got to hit this

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I found a plane ticket

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
in a box with a thumb there was a thumb

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
there was a human thumb

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
and a plane ticket

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
flying in to the production

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
office

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I wondered to myself what

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
should I do

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I didn't know what

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I was about to see

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
when I got

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
off the elevator

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
four children

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
in clown makeup

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
with smiles

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
wider than their faces that's like

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
big thing and

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
everyone has got smiles

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
greeted me

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
with Machiatos

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
you're here to work

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
on the show

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I couldn't stand

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
the feelings in my boots

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I wanted to run away

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
but I

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
also needed to be polite

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
that sounds good I said

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
and they took me back

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
to the VO booth

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
where what I saw

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
will stay with

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
me for the rest

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
of my life

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
300 pounds

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
of human intestine

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
in a writhing

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
mass of aborted

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
foot bone

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
surgically altered

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
all of it smiling

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
with smiles and children

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
bigger than the children's smiles

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
lips curled in a surgical

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
foot

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
intestine with aborted

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
things and

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
a little implication of the

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
threat of rape but not taking

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
pleasure in it

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
a writhing

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
sea

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I dove in

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
because I felt pressured

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
and the microphone was turned

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
on and I said

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I'm David Cummings

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
hello

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I just said it

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
silence

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
into the room

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
and all I heard over the speaker

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
was

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
that's good

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
can we do

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
another take

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
okay no that's not a good ending

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
well no

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I like that

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
a sea of intestines

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
and bones

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
but the one thing that will

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
always be the reason

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I will never forget

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
what I was looking at

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
the one thing that I

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
can never explain

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
no matter how hard I try

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
the reason I am posting

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
this to Reddit from an asylum

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
is

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
because

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
the engineer

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
had a

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
hat on with a maple leaf

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
I see you can't riff it

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
there's always like the one thing

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
that will keep me up at night

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
is that he knew my name

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
and then there's like a punchline

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
and that is why

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
he'll never go back

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
to Rick and Morty

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
and why we bid you tonight

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
on Harmontown

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
ladies and gentlemen

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
we bid you good night

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
thank you so much

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Hey it's been the same since the beginning

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Yeah we're all players

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
in this game

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I'm winning

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I keep my nerves

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
in my mind

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I can't find it

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
but I don't really mind

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I'm just a loser

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
but I gotta like it

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
I'm gonna give it a try

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Did you get any of that?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It's a good show!
