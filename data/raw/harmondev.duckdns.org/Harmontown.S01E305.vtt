officially October.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.000\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh.\n\n01:07.000 --> 01:09.000\nYeah, the idea was that maybe I would have wrapped.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:10.000\nI forgot.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.000\nI didn't even think about it at this point.\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:13.000\nYo, how you doing?\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:14.000\nI'm a doom doom.\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:15.000\nI'm a doom doom.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:16.000\nI'm a doom doom.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:17.000\nI'm a doom doom.\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:18.000\nI'm a doom doom.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.000\nWrapping, wrapping all the time\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\nis the name of the game.\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:24.000\nLike a bucket mama, so harder.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:25.000\nHere's like a mane.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:26.000\nOK.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:29.000\nAnd leopards come round and round.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:30.000\nI have to do it.\n\n01:30.000 --> 01:31.000\nWait to do it.\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:35.000\nAnd your booty got found in the treasure chest\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nat the bottom of the sea.\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nAnd I said, who's that pussy?\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:42.000\nIt belongs to me.\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nBreak down like a robot dancer.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:50.000\nBreak down, I'm never taking chances, sir.\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:54.000\nI'm going to your papa's pussy in a bus.\n\n01:54.000 --> 01:57.000\nAnd, OK.\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.000\nI agree.\n\n01:58.000 --> 01:59.000\nI agree.\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:04.000\nSo out of breath and so fat.\n\n02:04.000 --> 02:07.000\nAnd for any of the ladies that happen to be joining us\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:10.000\nfor the first time tonight, that's not,\n\n02:10.000 --> 02:14.000\nthe pussies aren't for driving into.\n\n02:14.000 --> 02:16.000\nAt least of all with a bus.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:17.000\nThere's nothing.\n\n02:17.000 --> 02:18.000\nHow did this begin?\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nI don't know.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:22.000\nWe've been doing the podcast for about seven years.\n\n02:22.000 --> 02:24.000\nOur guest tonight has been doing,\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:26.000\nit's basically like a sister podcast.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nI look at it as, because we like to feminize our enemies.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:31.000\nNo.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:34.000\nI don't know why that is why.\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\nI think that's our worshipfulness of the feminine\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\ngenerally with sister cities and sister productions.\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:45.000\nWhen we call things, I think it's like a battleship as a she.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\nI think that's us trying to be flattering to women.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:50.000\nI hope so.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:53.000\nI do hope so.\n\n02:53.000 --> 02:54.000\nIt's a good thing.\n\n02:54.000 --> 02:56.000\nSo it must be a girl.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:58.000\nBecause it's soft.\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:01.000\nLike one thing that makes us better than we can be.\n\n03:01.000 --> 03:03.000\nLike a battleship with big guns.\n\n03:03.000 --> 03:05.000\nLook at her big guns.\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.000\nLook at those big guns that girls got.\n\n03:07.000 --> 03:11.000\nShe's going to blow the fuck out of our enemy city.\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:14.000\nOur brother city that we hate.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:16.000\nWe're going to ally with our sister country\n\n03:16.000 --> 03:20.000\nand fucking shoot our tits all over that fucking enemy country.\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:22.000\nBecause we're better.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:23.000\nSo we're women.\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:24.000\nI don't know what we're doing.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:25.000\nI wish, man.\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:28.000\nI really do wish that was true.\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\nAnd then some people come along and go,\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\nhey, maybe I want to do some weird shit with pronouns.\n\n03:33.000 --> 03:35.000\nAnd we're like, fuck you.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:37.000\nThat's crazy.\n\n03:37.000 --> 03:38.000\nWe're crazy with pronouns.\n\n03:38.000 --> 03:39.000\nWe are crazy with pronouns.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:40.000\nWe do weird shit with pronouns.\n\n03:40.000 --> 03:41.000\nIt's weird.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:44.000\nWe're still trying to figure out what we should do to not offend each other\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.000\nwhen we speak to each other.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:47.000\nThat's going to take a little while.\n\n03:47.000 --> 03:49.000\nHuman race is like a little,\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:51.000\nthinks it's smarter than it is.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:53.000\nSo we're like, fuck, we've got language and shit.\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nThis is how you talk.\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.000\nAnd so far it hasn't really worked out.\n\n03:57.000 --> 04:00.000\nSo we're still working our way through pronouns, I think.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nAnd is that how English works?\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nEnglish is a garbage dump.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nThat's why it's successful.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.000\nEnglish is the language that said,\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:07.000\npolystyrene is welcome.\n\n04:07.000 --> 04:09.000\nWe've been over this.\n\n04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\nI've listened to four podcasts about the history of English.\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:13.000\nSo I'm an expert.\n\n04:13.000 --> 04:15.000\nI don't know.\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:18.000\nIt dominated the planet because it's content with the lowest of places.\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.000\nIt'll take a fucking inlet from any river.\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:23.000\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:27.000\nIt's just like a diarrhea canal that connects the earth.\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.000\nAnd that's why it dominates.\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nAlso, it's spoken by first world empires.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.000\nI can blow you up if you don't speak right.\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:35.000\nAnyways, I'm fat.\n\n04:35.000 --> 04:37.000\nI got fat.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:39.000\nI'm becoming now this person.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.000\nI'm like, I'm fat because I'm working out.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:44.000\nAnd now I'm in the thing.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:50.000\nI'm in the atonement with the father chapter of Amy Schumer's,\n\n04:50.000 --> 04:54.000\nI Feel Pretty, where I felt good for a while.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.000\nSo I met with the goddess.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:57.000\nI was like, yeah, I did it.\n\n04:57.000 --> 04:59.000\nI'm exercising every other day.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:00.000\nAnd I feel good.\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:05.000\nI feel the feeling that you feel.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:09.000\nIt's an interesting movie.\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:15.000\nActually, I can understand why it wasn't like a swish,\n\n05:15.000 --> 05:17.000\nnothing but net kind of perfect.\n\n05:17.000 --> 05:19.000\nThe times we're going through right now,\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:24.000\nhow could you fucking hoop is on the move?\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:29.000\nBut it's definitely worth watching because there's some actually profound\n\n05:29.000 --> 05:33.000\ngrounded shit that happens in that movie because the concede is just that she hits her head\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:40.000\nand she doesn't, they show her looking at her body when she wakes up.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:45.000\nBut they don't do the fan, her point of view is that her arms,\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:47.000\ninstead of looking like this, look like that.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.000\nThey don't use a model instead of her.\n\n05:49.000 --> 05:50.000\nThey use her.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:52.000\nAnd she doesn't say, look at my boobs.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:54.000\nThey're so blank shaped.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:57.000\nShe doesn't say, look how much blanker my legs are.\n\n05:57.000 --> 05:59.000\nShe just says, my legs are amazing.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:05.000\nShe doesn't, and so it's like a nuanced thing because it's like,\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nwhat if the way you looked, which is fine,\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:10.000\nwhat if you could believe that?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:14.000\nWhat if you just believed that the way we think we would believe that if we looked\n\n06:14.000 --> 06:16.000\nlike so and so on the cover of whatever magazine?\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nAnd the answer is a lot of confusing jokes because to me,\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:22.000\nthat movie's one flaw is that the world doesn't,\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:24.000\nI don't know what the world feels like.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.000\nSometimes the world is trying to talk people into thinking they're ugly in that movie.\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:30.000\nAnd then, but then there's like these beauty,\n\n06:30.000 --> 06:34.000\nlike I think the scene where she meets the guy,\n\n06:34.000 --> 06:38.000\nlike the meet cute of that scene is actually really interesting\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:42.000\nbecause it's very realistic, like the what if of like what if,\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:46.000\nwhat if Amy Schumer thought she was like gorgeous and then she's like,\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.000\noh, is this how it happens?\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:52.000\nLike a guy starts talking to her and then he's just confused by how aggressive she is.\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:56.000\nBut in a way that I was watching as a guy, I was like, that is attractive behavior.\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:59.000\nLike no matter, and that does make all the difference,\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:01.000\nlike which is what people are always telling us.\n\n07:01.000 --> 07:05.000\nLike you just have to think that you blah blah blah and act like you look how you,\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:09.000\nall this stuff like it's very complicated stuff to me.\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:12.000\nPeople are really big on like confidence in other people\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:16.000\nbecause we're kind of fascinated by how you can see.\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:17.000\nWe love confident people.\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:21.000\nWe definitely, but we also love to like hit them in the face with bats.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:25.000\nLike we don't like, we like to warm our hands over them,\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:30.000\nbut then we will also like put our cigarettes out in them, pour our beer into them, kick them.\n\n07:30.000 --> 07:35.000\nLike, and that's another interesting thing about I Feel Pretty is they do go,\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:40.000\nit does track, there's like unlike a lot of movies that have a simpler concept,\n\n07:40.000 --> 07:45.000\nlike it does take you around the wheel where you're like, oh yeah, okay.\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:52.000\nSo one of the fantasy about feeling pretty is like we all have this thing in our head\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:58.000\nthat's like if I looked like so-and-so and you pick whoever, like you might not pick Tom Cruise.\n\n07:58.000 --> 08:01.000\nYou might pick somebody for a totally different reason,\n\n08:01.000 --> 08:04.000\nbut whatever that person is in your head, if I looked like this person,\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:10.000\nthen the reason that would be great is because then I would be able to blank\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:16.000\nand I think blank is pretty much universally stop worrying so much about everybody else,\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:22.000\nwhich we think is a service to other people because we tend to be toxically insecure.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:25.000\nLike me coming out telling you I feel fat, like what are you supposed to do with that?\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:27.000\nThat's me wiping my ass on you.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\nYou're like, I just have your fat shit on my face.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.000\nLike what am I, you know, you look great.\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:33.000\nWhat am I doing?\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:35.000\nWhy am I doing this for you?\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.000\nI have shit to do at home.\n\n08:36.000 --> 08:38.000\nLike I have dogs that need me.\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:41.000\nLike why are you the famous rich guy?\n\n08:41.000 --> 08:42.000\nI'm fat.\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:43.000\nLike no, you're not.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nFuck you.\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:47.000\nAnyways, but also your friend can do that too.\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:48.000\nYou do that to other people.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:53.000\nWe are most familiar with insecurity as a thing that if it was gone,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nwe would be like super people.\n\n08:55.000 --> 09:01.000\nBut the anxiety is why we are good people.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:04.000\nAnd so it seems like a no-brainer to talk about this,\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:07.000\nbut it's a pretty good job in that movie of like she starts like,\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nshe becomes a prick like in all the right ways,\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nlike where she's sort of like, yeah, she's like,\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:15.000\nokay, she's like trying to help her friends,\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:19.000\nwhom she now thinks are her less attractive friends.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:21.000\nAnd she's like trying to help them,\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.000\nlike hot people help ugly people in movies,\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nwhere it's like, come on, just let it out.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:26.000\nYou're gonna fucking do it.\n\n09:26.000 --> 09:27.000\nAnd they're like to them, they're like,\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:29.000\nwhy are you being such an asshole?\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.000\nIt's kind of fun to think about it anyways.\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.000\nTwo Harmons Up.\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:36.000\nWatch that and Mandy and maybe, I don't know,\n\n09:36.000 --> 09:37.000\nsomething about ants.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nKeep it educational.\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.000\nTwo Harmons Up.\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.000\nThey don't make stuff about insects anymore.\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:46.000\nLike when I was a kid, I just want to

10:35.000\nthat MIT departments were unable to decode it all the way.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:37.000\nThis intricate alphabet, if it were in English,\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:42.000\nwould have 550 letters and be 700,000 words long\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:43.000\nor something.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.000\nYou're like, what?\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:45.000\nThe wiggle butt language.\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd then they explain everything.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:48.000\nOh, new queen is on the way.\n\n10:48.000 --> 10:51.000\nAnd so it's time to sting her competitors to death.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:53.000\nAnd

12:23.000\nHere are my notes.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:24.000\nAnd then we're going to bring out our guest.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:25.000\nOkay.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:26.000\nHere's the thing.\n\n12:26.000 --> 12:27.000\nAll right.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:28.000\nSo, well, this belongs in a segment.\n\n12:28.000 --> 12:30.000\nIt's called things that I'm not allowed to complain about\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nbecause I'm...\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nActually, honestly,\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nfour people are allowed to complain about what I'm going to complain about.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:37.000\nBut play a little music cue like it's a segment.\n\n12:37.000 --> 12:38.000\nLike...\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:43.000\nThings I can't complain about.\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:45.000\nOh,

have angst\n\n12:57.000 --> 13:01.000\nbecause it's 1981.\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:06.000\nEveryone is doing fine.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:15.000\nWe're going to learn 30 years from now how poor you can be.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:21.000\nRight now, poor means living in the goondocks.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:22.000\nOkay.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:23.000\nCome on.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.000\nKnock it off.\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:29.000\nRead my mind.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:33.000\nLiving in the goondocks was the cue.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.000\nWho would fuck that up?\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:36.000\nWhat do you think?\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:39.000\nWhat do you think I'm going to sing about the goonies for 40 minutes?\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:42.000\nWhat kind of podcast do you think this is?\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:43.000\nThe goondocks.\n\n13:43.000 --> 13:50.000\nSome shit your old grandfather says before he has a stroke.\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:54.000\nThey called it the goondocks and the goonies.\n\n13:54.000 --> 14:02.000\nLook, when we order the food now, you get it brought to your house.\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:04.000\nAre you familiar with this?\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:06.000\nThey get the styrofoam cups.\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:09.000\nWe're all taking a hit for Mother Gaia.\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.000\nPut it in some styrofoam.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:11.000\nPut a plastic lid on it.\n\n14:11.000 --> 14:13.000\nAll of us are humans.\n\n14:13.000 --> 14:15.000\nSorry, Earth.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:17.000\nPayback's a bitch.\n\n14:17.000 --> 14:21.000\nYou fucking tried as hard as you could to kill us forever.\n\n14:21.000 --> 14:23.000\nEver since we were amoeba,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:25.000\nyou were like, better be a better amoeba\n\n14:25.000 --> 14:27.000\nor you're going to get eaten by a bigger amoeba.\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nAnd we're like, we would rather just hang out.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:34.000\nAnd God's like, Earth, I'm sorry, Earth.\n\n14:34.000 --> 14:38.000\nEarth was like, fine, be a regular amoeba.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:42.000\nHave fun being studied by the people that evolve out of you\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.000\na billion years from now.\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\nAnd we were like, all right, I think your math's wrong.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.000\nAll right.\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:52.000\nSo we make these things.\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.000\nI'm sorry, our guests are waiting.\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:57.000\nOne guest.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nWhy are you not allowed to complain about these things?\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:03.000\nBecause, listen, you'll know when I complain about it.\n\n15:03.000 --> 15:07.000\nWhen they deliver the liquids, the soft drinks,\n\n15:07.000 --> 15:11.000\nand they have taken the time at the restaurant.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nBecause, hey, we're all on the same team, right?\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:16.000\nNobody wants your drinks spilled.\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:17.000\nAnd it's moving on the go.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.000\nIt's being delivered to you.\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\nBut they're not thinking about us.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.000\nThey don't give a fuck what happens after they leave,\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nwhich is why they put a big piece of scotch tape over the hole,\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:28.000\nthe straw hole.\n\n15:28.000 --> 15:30.000\nThese lids are designed for transport.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:34.000\nI knew I wouldn't have your sympathy.\n\n15:34.000 --> 15:36.000\nI called your silence in advance.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nYou silver-leg fucks.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:40.000\nYou judgemental.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:42.000\nI said I'm not allowed to complain about it.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:45.000\nNow let me complain.\n\n15:45.000 --> 15:49.000\nThese lids should either have holes in them or not.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.000\nWhy are you going that they're putting scotch tape?\n\n15:52.000 --> 15:54.000\nDid you get the drink and you're like,\n\n15:54.000 --> 15:55.000\nah, the food's here.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:56.000\nThank God.\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:57.000\nAnd they're like, yeah, thank God.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:58.000\nI got a million orders to do.\n\n15:58.000 --> 16:00.000\nEverybody's got priorities.\n\n16:00.000 --> 16:01.000\nEveryone's got better things to do\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nthan to make sure your drink doesn't spill.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nAnd their technique, the shit rolls downhill.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:08.000\nThey're like, you get the thing and you're like,\n\n16:08.000 --> 16:10.000\nah, time to put the straw in.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:11.000\nWhat the fuck?\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:12.000\nThere's a fucking scotch tape.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nDo they have a dispenser on the shelf above the thing?\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nOr do they make a shift if people take a box\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:20.000\nand they go like, this will be for deliveries.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:23.000\nJust buy, just buy the whole list lids\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:27.000\nand say to people, or make a collector's item thing\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nand be like, we don't want anything to ever spill\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:32.000\nand you should benefit from that too.\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:34.000\nHere's a football-shaped cup that you can throw\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:36.000\nand it won't spill, but it like,\n\n16:36.000 --> 16:37.000\nit fucking converts into a thing\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nand you can believe it on your portrait.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:40.000\nWe'll give you a refund.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nI'll, I'll, I'll, let me wet my beak\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:45.000\nin this like, efficiency thing.\n\n16:45.000 --> 16:47.000\nIt just feels a little bit like a fuck you.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:50.000\nYou're like, well, all I know is if I spill something,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:53.000\nif your liquid gets anywhere, then that's on me.\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:55.000\nAnd so, here, I solved my problem.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nGood luck.\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.000\nLike, because you can't take a bag\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:02.000\nand I saw you roll your eyes at me, sir.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:04.000\nI know you think I'm petty.\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:07.000\nI know you think I'm petty, but I said I was petty.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:10.000\nSo this is not pettiness.\n\n17:10.000 --> 17:13.000\nHe was like, I can't believe this motherfucker's bitching\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.000\nabout a sippy cup.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:18.000\nIt would serve them right if when you got your food,\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.000\nyou like said, hold on a second,\n\n17:20.000 --> 17:22.000\nand you looked in as if to count your tacos,\n\n17:22.000 --> 17:25.000\nbut you don't even care about the accurate taco count.\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.000\nYou actually go, oh, hey, could you,\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:31.000\ncould you untape the straw holes?\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:32.000\nGod damn it.\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:36.000\nBecause it usually takes me about 20 minutes.\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.000\nBecause I don't know if you've ever put scotch tape\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:41.000\non a fucking lid.\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:43.000\nYou guys, look, nobody gets me.\n\n17:43.000 --> 17:46.000\nI'm telling you, if I was running this world,\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.000\noh boy.\n\n17:51.000 --> 17:53.000\nYeah, before childhood hunger,\n\n17:53.000 --> 17:55.000\nwe got to fix that tape shit.\n\n17:55.000 --> 17:59.000\nI bet half of childhood hunger is somehow related to this.\n\n18:02.000 --> 18:05.000\nOkay, one more thing, and then I'll bring out our guests.\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nHere's, okay, a genius idea.\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:11.000\nThis is like, you can have it, I got enough to do.\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:13.000\nSomebody go write this up\n\n18:13.000 --> 18:15.000\nand get the people attached and do it.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nSo, Tom Hanks,\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nbeloved actor,\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:23.000\nbeen with us for a long time.\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.000\nWe've been with him when he was a young whippersnapper,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\na bosom buddy, a maze monster,\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:33.000\nall the way up through Philadelphia,\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nall the way to Captain Robert Phillips,\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:38.000\nand beyond.\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:42.000\nHis road to perdition led him to, he's lived a full life.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:46.000\nOne of his many roles was a child\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nwho wished he was a little older.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:51.000\nI'm saying now, it's time, you can use him,\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:55.000\nwe can do this, big two colon, small.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.000\nLet's go. Let's fucking go.\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:03.000\nI actually got the idea from the Amy Schumer movie.\n\n19:03.000 --> 19:05.000\nWhat is this? Let's go.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:06.000\nThis sounds amazing.\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:08.000\nIn the Amy Schumer movie, they reference the big movie\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nbecause they're like, well, cite your references\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:12.000\nbecause she's wishing she was pretty,\n\n19:12.000 --> 19:15.000\nand then I was explaining to Cody,\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\noh, they're doing the

Do you remember\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:13.000\nyour first episode where\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nyou very exuberantly,\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:17.000\nlike, very, just enthusiastically,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:19.000\nlike, really, you had heard about the\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nconcept and you were really, like, into it,\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nand were like, you loved the idea and you were\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:25.000\nintroducing it to the people and like, we are,\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.000\nwe, the, if you'll go on the\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:29.000\nwebpage, we now have something called\n\n30:29.000 --> 30:31.000\na trigger warning.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:33.000\nAnd it was like, it was like, you had just\n\n30:33.000 --> 30:35.000\nheard about it and it was like disco, like,\n\n30:35.000 --> 30:37.000\nit was like, oh, it's like, and like\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nme at that same time, do you remember\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.000\nthat, you know, adding that\n\n30:41.000 --> 30:43.000\nand being happy about it and\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nI don't remember\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:47.000\nbeing happy about it, that's the weird thing.\n\n30:47.000 --> 30:49.000\nWell, that you were behind it, that you weren't, you weren't\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nlike, oh, apparently you have to\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:53.000\nput trigger warnings. It wasn't like that.\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:55.000\nIt was like, I felt to me like, you were like, I heard\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:57.000\nabout this concept of letting people\n\n30:57.000 --> 30:59.000\nknow where they are or aren't,\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:01.000\nyou know, gonna be comfortable\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:03.000\nso that people can mind their own fucking beeswax\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:05.000\nand you were like,\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:07.000\nsounds really logical\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:09.000\nand practical to me.\n\n31:09.000 --> 31:11.000\nAnd I guess I must be a really\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:13.000\nquintessential polite Canadian\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.000\nbecause inside, I felt\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:17.000\nlike, fuck these people, what are they,\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:19.000\nthis is a poor podcast.\n\n31:19.000 --> 31:21.000\nWhat are you talking about, trigger warnings?\n\n31:23.000 --> 31:25.000\nAnd so, and then\n\n31:25.000 --> 31:27.000\nthe following episode, it was like\n\n31:27.000 --> 31:29.000\nit was like this class, like this is what we were\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nall going through, it was sort of like\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:33.000\nthere was this first round of like, go\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.000\nto the website and you'll see a new thing called\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:37.000\na trigger warning. A trigger warning\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nis a warning. It was just sort of like, this is like\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nit was like, not a big deal, like nothing's happening,\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nno bowing, no scraping, nothing, but then the following\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nepisode was like, look,\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:47.000\nhere's the thing.\n\n31:47.000 --> 31:49.000\nThe reason I did a trigger warning is\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:51.000\nand the unspoken story\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:53.000\nwas that actually what had happened\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:55.000\nwas this avalanche of\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nmaybe understandable, but ultimately\n\n31:57.000 --> 31:59.000\nlike bad\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:01.000\ntarget, like because you're just trying to\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.000\ndo the right thing, like that you had been\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:05.000\nthere was this backlash\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:07.000\nthat obviously people listening to horror podcasts,\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\ntheir nightmare was hearing you use\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nthat phrase because it meant something different to them.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:13.000\nThey had a different relationship with it, etc.\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:15.000\nAnd so you remember that time is my question.\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.000\nOh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:19.000\nI remember the time and yeah, it was\n\n32:19.000 --> 32:21.000\nI got a whole bunch of emails\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.000\nthat almost seemed like a concerted effort\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nby people to say\n\n32:25.000 --> 32:27.000\nyou've got to be more sensitive to your listeners\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nand you've got to warn people and a lot of it was based around\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:31.000\nvery understandable topics, like\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:33.000\nwe're not a show that's going to highlight stories\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.000\nabout rape or child molestation\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.000\nand stuff like that, but we might\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:39.000\nimply that in a story\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:41.000\nso I can get how some people would want that.\n\n32:41.000 --> 32:43.000\nWell, yeah, I know, I think I mean\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nI'll\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:47.000\nacting as the opposite of your publicist or agent\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:49.000\nI would say, yeah, no, this is a genre\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nthat is festooned with\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nbetter feeling and rape because\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nit's like it's a horror that is\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nbeing written by people who are\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:59.000\nthey're off the chain\n\n32:59.000 --> 33:01.000\nthere the roots come through reddit forums\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nand things and people are exploring\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nreally what scares me\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:07.000\nwhat will therefore scare a stranger\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nand there's an often campfire\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:11.000\nstories begin as that it would have been\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:13.000\noutrageous to\n\n33:13.000 --> 33:15.000\nask a parent via an affidavit\n\n33:15.000 --> 33:17.000\nor something if you're like\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.000\nhey, your kid's going to be at summer camp\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nis it alright with you if I tell him this\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:23.000\nI'm going to tell him a couple stories, I've written the synopses here\n\n33:23.000 --> 33:25.000\nyou're like what the fuck, what\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:27.000\ntwo teenagers\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:29.000\nlovers lane, my child is 10 years old\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.000\nwhat are you talking about, it's not planned\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nit's like very tribal and like\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.000\nlike horror has always\n\n33:35.000 --> 33:37.000\nit has its roots in\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nI mean, what draws you to\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.000\nhorror, you talk more than me about it\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:43.000\nlike I just like listening to it and I don't know why\n\n33:43.000 --> 33:45.000\nwell\n\n33:45.000 --> 33:47.000\nin terms of horror it's always been a genre\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nthat I like but when I grew up\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nwhen I was young I would lie in bed on Sunday night\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nand there was a radio show in my\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nhometown of Toronto and they played\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nold\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.000\nold time radio shows like\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:01.000\nLights Out and Suspense and that type of thing\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.000\nso I was introduced\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nto horror in the audio format\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:07.000\nso it was the magic of\n\n34:07.000 --> 34:09.000\nif you watch a horror movie\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.000\nand there's a creepy basement\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:13.000\nyou're seeing the director's\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:15.000\nimpression of their creepiest basement\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:17.000\nbut if you're listening to a story\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:19.000\nand they say, I walked into a creepy\n\n34:19.000 --> 34:21.000\nbasement, the listener is going to imagine\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nwhat their creepiest\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nbasement looks like and so their\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nimagination draws them into the story\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:29.000\ndid those shows use sound effects?\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:31.000\noh yeah, they did\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.000\nalso if I\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nwatch an Eli Roth movie\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.000\nI'll be like, well\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.000\nI don't know if I want to\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\nI need more of a story than this\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nwhich means unfortunately for the horror director\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:45.000\nthat I basically want it to be more like\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:47.000\nJaws or E.T.\n\n34:47.000 --> 34:49.000\nand maybe that director is like\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:51.000\nsaying, well I just want to make a movie\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.000\nthat will freak you out, gross you out\n\n34:53.000 --> 34:55.000\ntake you to a crazy dark, demonic place\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:57.000\nthat your return\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:59.000\nthreshold is running out of the theatre\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nand telling your friends I survived watching this movie\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:03.000\nand artists should have a right\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.000\nto, they shouldn't be bound to my definition\n\n35:05.000 --> 35:07.000\nof what a story is, however\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.000\nwhen I watch a movie I go to a movie with those\n\n35:09.000 --> 35:11.000\nexpectations and I do not go to books\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:13.000\nwhich I don't read\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:15.000\nwith that expectation therefore I definitely\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:17.000\ndo not go to a strangers\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:19.000\nhalf of the time anonymous\n\n35:19.000 --> 35:21.000\nlike

35:29.000\nwill have to do with\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:31.000\nheavy themes that emerge that\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:33.000\nyou in an uncomfortable place are\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nabortion\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:37.000\nthere's such a huge\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nit's almost because where else would you\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\ngo except the idea of children\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:43.000\nchildren being threatened\n\n35:43.000 --> 35:45.000\nthe stakes can only\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.000\nget so high before\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:49.000\nsome theme of

36:03.000\nI think that I don't know\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:05.000\nI know that I could never\n\n36:05.000 --> 36:07.000\nour friend John Grills\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:09.000\nwho does the creepy podcast\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:11.000\nwhich is more of just\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nhow I found your podcast\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:15.000\nhe told me\n\n36:15.000 --> 36:17.000\nbecause I was like I don't think I could ever write horror\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:19.000\nI wouldn't know how to do it\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nand he said just scare yourself\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:23.000\nlike do the same advice with comedy\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:25.000\nas you would for horror\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:27.000\nand then I think oh yeah\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:29.000\nlike then I couldn't do it\n\n36:29.000 --> 36:31.000\nbecause when I think about\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:33.000\nbeing scared I get scared\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:35.000\nso my stories\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:37.000\nwould be about like someone made me\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:39.000\ngo to a scary thing\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:41.000\nand I would\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nand I said\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nno I'm not gonna go\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:47.000\nI'm not gonna go to that scary thing\n\n36:47.000 --> 36:49.000\nI don't like being startled\n\n36:49.000 --> 36:51.000\nand then they felt bad\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nand that made me feel bad\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:55.000\nwell yeah\n\n36:55.000 --> 36:57.000\nit's true\n\n36:57.000 --> 36:59.000\nso I like listening to other people\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:01.000\nwho go there and like I'm a\n\n37:01.000 --> 37:03.000\nproctologist that likes to do\n\n37:03.000 --> 37:05.000\nextracurricular work\n\n37:05.000 --> 37:07.000\nand I'm like whoa\n\n37:07.000 --> 37:09.000\nthat's not a real example\n\n37:09.000 --> 37:11.000\nwell yeah\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:13.000\nand the other thing too when it comes to writing horror\n\n37:13.000 --> 37:15.000\nnot that I do a lot of it\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:17.000\nbut you think that one of the big things\n\n37:17.000 --> 37:19.000\nabout horror is if there's a twist\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:21.000\nor if there's something you don't see coming\n\n37:21.000 --> 37:23.000\nthat would be the real scary point\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.000\nbut if you're writing it\n\n37:25.000 --> 37:27.000\nwell you know what the twist is\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:29.000\nso you can never put yourself behind\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:31.000\nthe scenes enough to know\n\n37:31.000 --> 37:33.000\nto experience that twist\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:35.000\nwhat scares you\n\n37:35.000 --> 37:37.000\nwhat scares me\n\n37:39.000 --> 37:41.000\nthe thing\n\n37:41.000 --> 37:43.000\nwell it's not so much of a broad theme\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:45.000\nbut the thing that creeps me out the most\n\n37:45.000 --> 37:47.000\nand you see it a lot in horror films\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.000\nis that someone's standing outside\n\n37:49.000 --> 37:51.000\nand there's a face in the window\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.000\nand if there's something about\n\n37:53.000 --> 37:55.000\nit's either you're inside the house and you look out the window\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:57.000\nand you see somebody standing in your yard\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:59.000\nor you see a face in the window\n\n37:59.000 --> 38:01.000\nor like the house you just got out of\n\n38:01.000 --> 38:03.000\nthere's stories where\n\n38:03.000 --> 38:05.000\nthere's weird shit going on in the house\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:07.000\nand then finally the person does\n\n38:07.000 --> 38:09.000\nwhat you would do which is they just get the fuck out of there\n\n38:09.000 --> 38:11.000\nthey're like I'm gonna stay in a motel\n\n38:11.000 --> 38:13.000\nand then they drop their keys\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:15.000\nand they look up and there's a fucking person in the window\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.000\nit's like\n\n38:17.000 --> 38:19.000\nit's almost scarier\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:21.000\nremember that classic urban legend\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:23.000\nabout the trucker with the headlights\n\n38:23.000 --> 38:25.000\nthe punchline of that\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:27.000\nis that you lived but it's scarier\n\n38:27.000

keyhole\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:43.000\nand it was just red all I saw was red\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.000\nI heard that hotel room was like haunted\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nor the red but I already blew

that\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000\nwe like gay voices\n\n01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000\ngay perspectives and things\n\n01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000\nlike make shit like horror\n\n01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000\nbetter because\n\n01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000\neither A you have a classic\n\n01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000\nstory that's like a husband and wife\n\n01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000\nbut it's like a husband and husband\n\n01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nand it's like all the more like\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000\nbecause it's a horror story the focus is on this\n\n01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nfucked up shit that's going on\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000\nyou're like run grab your husband\n\n01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000\nand run and you come through a visceral\n\n01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000\nexperience like having been trained\n\n01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000\nneurologically to think of\n\n01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000\npeople that are different\n\n01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000\nas the same which is like a healing\n\n01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nthat's one kind of good thing\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000\nbut then the other thing is like\n\n01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000\nwhen the shit goes deep and dark\n\n01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000\nand earns those trigger warnings\n\n01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000\nthere are like\n\n01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000\nthere was an author who was\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\ntalking about his\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nit was like a weird like\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000\nthere's a tradition in this format where it's like\n\n01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000\nthe person is the unreliable narrator\n\n01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000\nwho kind of like turns out to be\n\n01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000\nyour kidnapper or whatever\n\n01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000\nand kind of like I don't know I'm babbling\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nbut like would you take over\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000\nand say anything about that\n\n01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nlike did you have you what has been\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000\nyour experience I don't know if you're straight or gay\n\n01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000\nI've never bothered to ask because\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000\nI've been involved by your podcast\n\n01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000\nbut like\n\n01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nwhatever\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000\ncategory you might fit or not fit into\n\n01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000\nwhat has been your experience with representation\n\n01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nyour obligations\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000\nyour desires and things\n\n01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000\nwell one of the neat things about our show\n\n01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000\nis that we have a cast of voice actors\n\n01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000\nwriters producers and they're from\n\n01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000\nall around the world and we\n\n01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000\nthey all record separately and send their parts in\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000\nand we have a really\n\n01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000\nstrong representation\n\n01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000\nfrom the LGBTQ community\n\n01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000\njust in the team that creates the show\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000\nfor you as a kind of incidental\n\n01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000\nlike were you like a straight guy in front of\n\n01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000\na microphone going like I like horror let's do this\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000\nhorror thing and then one by one people are like\n\n01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nby the way I'm such and such\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000\nand you're like yes and\n\n01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000\nit's like the Muppet movie that works\n\n01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000\nyeah it was never an issue\n\n01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nit was never at all\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nand then as Dan mentioned it seemed for some\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000\nreason recently we did some\n\n01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nstories that just happened to have\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000\nsame sex couples\n\n01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000\nit wasn't a heavy\n\n01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000\ngay theme there was no gay sex or anything\n\n01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000\nlike that it's just two people driving\n\n01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000\ndown the road and they're too\n\n01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000\nbeing gay on the road\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000\ncan be a bit of a\n\n01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000\nproblem\n\n01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000\nI saw a gay ghost staring at me\n\n01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000\nyeah it's not\n\n01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000\nit's not like you just add the word yeah\n\n01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000\nand yeah so\n\n01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000\nthat we did these stories and believe it or not\n\n01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000\nI got emails from people saying\n\n01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nwhat's with all the queer stuff\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000\nwhy do you have you know\n\n01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000\nit adds nothing to the story why do you have all these\n\n01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000\nsame sex things\n\n01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000\nand it was right around that time that we had\n\n01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000\nas a team we were already thinking about\n\n01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000\nputting together for Pride Month\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000\nan episode that had\n\n01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000\nevery story would be written by someone from the\n\n01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nLGBTQ community and it was just\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000\nwe're gonna celebrate Pride Month not because\n\n01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000\nI\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000\nI\n\n01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000\njust like\n\n01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000\nthat I like that you pissed off somebody who\n\n01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000\ncomplained\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000\nwell that's the thing and so I put a little disclaimer\n\n01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000\non the next episode the episode before the Pride\n\n01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000\nepisode basically said\n\n01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nlook we will do these stories and\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000\nif you don't like them you're free to not listen\n\n01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000\nand we\n\n01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000\nand I think I tried to inform our audience\n\n01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nthat yeah we've got voice actors\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nand people on the show who\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nterrifyingly enough are gay\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nand\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000\nand yeah we got some blowback from that\n\n01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nthere were people who canceled their subscriptions\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000\nand all that kind of stuff\n\n01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nand they would never say by the way this isn't\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000\nlike I this is because I\n\n01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nlove freedom\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000\nand I perceive these\n\n01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000\nthese sort of like\n\n01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nthese\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000\nwhen I get these signals\n\n01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nthey get ironically triggered by them\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nand go like oh political correctness is coming\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000\nlike because there's like\n\n01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000\nand but I gotta say\n\n01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000\nas a potbellied 45 year old\n\n01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000\nstraight white dude who has nothing\n\n01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000\nto gain or lose like I honestly\n\n01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000\nand this may be the most insulting compliment\n\n01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nof all time but I really struck\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nme as listening to that episode just yesterday\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000\nand was like I would\n\n01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000\nI would recommend to a fan\n\n01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000\nof like where I was going like you should listen to this as like really well produced\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nwell written\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000\nhorror stories that have\n\n01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000\na modern context to them but they\n\n01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nhave a but they also have like\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000\na classy like foundation\n\n01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000\nto them a respect for the audio\n\n01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000\nformat and stuff like that and I would go actually\n\n01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000\nif you're gonna start with anything listen to the\n\n01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000\nit happens to be the LGBT I would say like\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000\nyou'll find it that way but it wouldn't be because\n\n01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000\nit would be it just happens\n\n01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000\nto be my point being that\n\n01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000\nin addition to being inclusive it's\n\n01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nnot like a handicap parking space it's\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nnot it's not this like thing of like let's\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000\nbe proactive and break the cycle which is also\n\n01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nfine but you've managed\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nto gracefully do this thing because\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000\nyou've had this commune of artists\n\n01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000\nyour people who love reading stories and writing stories\n\n01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nthey're all individuals\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nsnowflakes if you will\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000\nand and each of them\n\n01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000\ncomes to the table I assume and going like you know\n\n01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000\ncould I could I go here could I go there\n\n01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000\ncould you represent this and that and you\n\n01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000\nI'm I'm psychically\n\n01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000\nosmotically interpreting are that are like me and\n\n01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000\nthat you would go yeah because\n\n01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000\nwhy would I put up a wall against\n\n01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000\nthat and and the result\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000\nis truly not obnoxious it's not\n\n01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nsaccharine it's not watered\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000\ndown it's anything it's like it has\n\n01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000\nit has all this extra flavor\n\n01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nto it because it's\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000\nit's something I mean look\n\n01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nfear xenophobia\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000\nsex fear they all go kind of hand in hand\n\n01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000\nright it's different from comedy\n\n01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000\nand\n\n01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000\nI guess that's like my remaining\n\n01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000\nlike discussion point is like what the hell\n\n01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000\nis it with what are we\n\n01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nin the in the in these times where we're\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000\nactually trying to be sensitive to each\n\n01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nother and when the reality\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000\nis that when we go to bed together\n\n01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000\nand when we speak around campfires\n\n01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000\nto each other when we\n\n01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000\nwe want to get visceral reactions from\n\n01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000\neach other we want to we want to be able to\n\n01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000\ncross thresholds that's literally the definition\n\n01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000\nof a story crossing boundaries\n\n01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000\nand yet in a very\n\n01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nI'm not doing the old man thing where I'm like\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000\nwe can't have fun anymore because\n\n01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000\nyou're having fun but you're not\n\n01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000\nhurting anybody it's very clear\n\n01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000\nthat you're not doing it in defiance\n\n01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000\nit's like it's very it's two\n\n01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000\nthings are very clear when I listen to that\n\n01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000\npodcast you guys don't give a shit\n\n01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000\nabout like whether or not\n\n01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nsomebody might boycott or anything\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000\nlike that there's no pandering\n\n01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000\nhappening and the next thing\n\n01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000\nthat's clear is that you definitely don't want to

01:35:21.000\ntalking about it\n\n01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000\nmaybe they weren't interesting\n\n01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000\nlike what's the kind of stuff\n\n01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nthat you get like submissions\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000\nlike so what are\n\n01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000\nand you can say I don't want to talk about this\n\n01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nbecause I don't want you to know how the sausage is made\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nand you know but\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000\ndo you have lines that you draw\n\n01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nwhere like rules\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000\nin your head that you run things through\n\n01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nso you go like you know what this is\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nbecause this\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000\ngo ahead I'll stop asking the question\n\n01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000\nso you can answer it\n\n01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000\nthere aren't a lot of hard and fast rules\n\n01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nas I mentioned\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000\nearlier we'll do a story if it implies\n\n01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000\nlet's say a sexual assault\n\n01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000\nor rape something that isn't gratuitous\n\n01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000\nwe're not going to have a 12 minute segment\n\n01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000\nwhere you hear a person describe\n\n01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nthe graphic moments of them being\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nraped and stuff like that\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nso we guard that line\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nbut I remember\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000\nway back in season 3 we did a story\n\n01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000\ncalled Autopilot\n\n01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000\nand it basically told the story\n\n01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000\nof something that you hear in the news\n\n01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nevery summer\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nand it's horrifyingly tragic\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nand it has to do with children being left\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nin cars in the summertime\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000\nand so that's\n\n01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000\na story that I probably wouldn't do today\n\n01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000\nbecause fearing all the blowback and people saying\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000\nwe heard back from\n\n01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000\nafter that we did that show\n\n01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000\nsomebody emailed me and said\n\n01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000\nare you going to keep doing stories where children are murdered\n\n01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000\nand we thought\n\n01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000\nthe child wasn't murdered it was a horrifying accident\n\n01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nbut that's how his mind\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000\nas a father\n\n01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000\nhe thought that\n\n01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000\nwe like pushing people\n\n01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000\nand we say right at the top of every show\n\n01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000\nas Dan has so gracefully pointed out tonight\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000\nwith his imitation of me\n\n01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000\nI say\n\n01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000\nwe do tales to frighten\n\n01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000\nand disturb\n\n01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000\nand that key word disturb\n\n01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000\nis I think lost on a lot of people\n\n01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000\nnot just to be\n\n01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000\nchills up the spine that's spooky\n\n01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000\nbut we want people to be genuinely\n\n01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nuncomfortable and unsettled\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000\nI think you phrased it in a way that it's the most\n\n01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nelegant trigger warning\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nwhich is something like\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nto paraphrase it you're coming here\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000\nto be frightened and disturbed on purpose\n\n01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nor

more than\n\n01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000\nthe audio\n\n01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000\nversion of it\n\n01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000\nyou're like well I like the scary stuff\n\n01:37:57.000 -->

horror but that's the\n\n01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000\nhot dog of audio\n\n01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000\nyeah I think\n\n01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000\naudio and horror go together\n\n01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000\nbetter than probably any other format\n\n01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000\nagain just what I mentioned earlier\n\n01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000\nabout using your imagination and getting cues\n\n01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000\nfrom the story to involve yourself\n\n01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000\nin the story but\n\n01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000\nyou know doing it for seven
