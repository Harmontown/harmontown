00:00.000 --> 00:23.360
Hello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown. Harmontown is now in session. I'm your little old

00:23.360 --> 00:30.360
comptroller, Jeff Davis. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Den Harmon.

00:30.360 --> 00:49.680
What a lively crowd. It's not just like eight people that are going to bump everybody else

00:49.680 --> 00:54.440
out. It's actually a lively crowd. You can never tell from listening. Is there a bachelorette

00:54.440 --> 01:01.000
party out there? Everyone else is not actually that excited. It's just Caroline and her friends.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.840
We made them wait. It's eight. It's eight. Oh, it's a little late. It's eight fifteen.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.960
We made them wait seven minutes longer than normal. Yeah, they're five hours. They're

01:07.960 --> 01:14.620
kicking in. Okay. Well, look, I'm glad your energy is up. Mine's a little down. My body's

01:14.620 --> 01:33.480
sore. Football practice started. Somebody just registers as a joke that I'm playing softball

01:33.480 --> 01:41.200
at all. My animation studio, Star Burns Industries, has a softball team in some kind of league,

01:41.200 --> 01:49.560
and we got together to practice, and it's looking pretty grim. But it was kind of nice. I was

01:49.560 --> 01:54.360
dreading the actual experience myself, but I actually kind of enjoyed being out there.

01:54.360 --> 01:59.320
I didn't die. But two days later, it's like, you know, you don't exercise at all, and you

01:59.320 --> 02:03.360
go to the gym, and you feel great. And then two days later, all those torn muscles that

02:03.360 --> 02:08.480
are now repairing themselves or whatever, however muscles work. All of a sudden, you're

02:08.480 --> 02:18.080
all sore. That's where I'm at. So whatever. Who cares? Go fuck yourself. We were thinking

02:18.080 --> 02:21.480
about, because of the scheduling conflict, because we're going to be playing softball

02:21.480 --> 02:27.440
on Monday nights, we came this close to taking a little hiatus from our Harmontown meetings.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.560
And then we told them, melt down that, and they were all bumped out, and they said, what

02:30.560 --> 02:37.320
about Sundays? So starting May 6th, for those of you who come to the shows here in LA, we're

02:37.320 --> 02:41.680
going to be moving to Sundays at eight for at least a couple of months. I think that's

02:41.680 --> 02:50.360
a better night. I can hear a couple people crying. But who's got the biggest conflict

02:50.360 --> 02:59.080
with somebody going to be unable to come from now on? Is your waving your hand back there?

02:59.080 --> 03:12.800
What's wrong? Why can't you come? How much are they paying you? Because we'll double

03:12.800 --> 03:26.480
them. What do you do for a living? We're at Cheesecake Factory. I don't know what to say

03:26.480 --> 03:36.600
to them. It's not that easy for everybody. You can't swap out with somebody on a Sunday

03:36.600 --> 03:48.320
night? Monday night, rather? You're a big wheel in Cheesecake Town? He said he's a very important

03:48.320 --> 03:53.960
member of the Cheesecake Team. I don't know what the... Yeah, I didn't want to suggest

03:53.960 --> 03:59.400
that he quit. I mean, it could be an important step in the right direction for him. We don't

03:59.400 --> 04:07.240
know. Erin McGathy, my girlfriend, has recently become a cake maniac. She's making a million

04:07.240 --> 04:13.520
cakes a day. She made several cakes for tonight. She made one for Emily. I think it must be

04:13.520 --> 04:19.720
Emily's birthday or anniversary of her cat or something. She made one cake and then she

04:19.720 --> 04:25.360
made another cake in honor of a movie we watched when we couldn't find the movie that I said

04:25.360 --> 04:34.320
we were going to watch, which is The Abominable Dr. Fibes. So I didn't see that. Nor did I.

04:34.320 --> 04:38.640
I couldn't find it. It wasn't on Netflix or Hulu or any of the thing in the Apple TV's.

04:38.640 --> 04:45.840
My video store didn't have it. We bought it on Amazon. You bought it? We'll label it

04:45.840 --> 04:58.880
for next time. What's your name, ma'am? Marcy. Marcy? Okay, bring out the cake. The squeaky

04:58.880 --> 05:08.600
wheel always gets the grease at Harmontown. I figured... It's a beautiful Jaws 4 cake.

05:08.600 --> 05:14.200
There's a little chocolate Mario Van Peebles getting eaten to death. Even though in the

05:14.200 --> 05:19.640
movie he doesn't really die, spoilers, Mario Van Peebles gets placed in the shark's mouth

05:19.640 --> 05:26.440
gently and lowered into the ocean by this helicopter-like shark. And then he pops up

05:26.440 --> 05:31.680
at the end and says, yeah, man, you thought I was dead, but I wasn't, man. And he talks

05:31.680 --> 05:37.240
just like that in the movie for real. Is that the movie where they use the flash in the

05:37.240 --> 05:41.200
camera to make the shark go crazy? Yeah, yeah. And then you find out the sharks have vocal

05:41.200 --> 05:49.440
core and the shark goes, no! And then Mrs. Brody rams the shark with the... What do you

05:49.440 --> 05:59.000
call it? The bousprix or the shark impaler on the front of the boat. And the shark explodes.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.760
It explodes on contact with the thing. And so to make sense, they intercut it with Roy

06:04.760 --> 06:08.760
Scheider saying, smile you son of a bitch from the first movie so that you think, well, maybe

06:08.760 --> 06:13.880
it kind of exploded reminiscently. And then it goes down and there's a piece of wood kind

06:13.880 --> 06:18.360
of halfway through the shark, right? Yeah. I'll tell you, that shark was as abominable

06:18.360 --> 06:24.360
as Dr. Fibes himself. Thank you for all the trouble you went through to watch that movie

06:24.360 --> 06:41.800
that I didn't watch. Here's Marcy, this is your shark cake. She has to leave. You have

06:41.800 --> 06:46.600
to leave. I'm sorry, you can't have that cake in here. You can't have your cake in Harmon

06:46.600 --> 06:58.040
Town too. No, that's just the shark damage. You're looking at dismembered Van Peebles

06:58.040 --> 07:01.840
and saying it's been partially eaten, but that's all part of the verisimilitude of the

07:01.840 --> 07:08.440
cake. There was a while there in movies where they were making animals yell that they don't

07:08.440 --> 07:13.160
have vocal cords or voice boxes. I'm pretty sure an arachnophobia, it was a spider, and

07:13.160 --> 07:18.240
I was like, ahhhh. There was a spider that popped a wheelie and came at you and yelled

07:18.240 --> 07:22.240
at you. You'll make a lot of crazy choices when you're looking down the barrel of a

07:22.240 --> 07:27.600
stinker in the final audio mix. You got that big board in front of you and a whole computer

07:27.600 --> 07:33.400
and you're just like, juice the spiders. I'm looking at a Jeff Daniels vehicle here.

07:33.400 --> 07:43.040
I thought it seemed like a good idea on paper, but it's not. Give the spiders some juice.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.680
That's what they did on the Exorcist when they made the devil sound like some bees in

07:46.680 --> 07:51.800
a box or something. I probably don't have to tell you this, but I'm feeling a little

07:51.800 --> 07:57.880
off tonight. For that reason, I've surrounded myself with a blanket of friends who to give

07:57.880 --> 08:04.560
me energy and offset my softball soreness. Let's keep this bullet train on the tracks

08:04.560 --> 08:18.480
and bring up my friend Duncan Tressel. Duncan Tressel! Grab any mic you like. Wherever

08:18.480 --> 08:22.520
you're comfortable, buddy. Thank you. It's good to have you back. Thanks, Dan. Thank

08:22.520 --> 08:27.720
you. Good to be here. I thought we could bring you out here and keep the spirits up because

08:27.720 --> 08:39.880
I know your mom just died. Yeah, I'm grieving. Is it true? Yeah. I don't know why I'm so

08:39.880 --> 08:44.280
happy about it. You're handling it awfully well. I told you a couple episodes ago about

08:44.280 --> 08:50.600
Duncan actually podcast his mom's death bed. I don't know how else to put it. Yeah, I

08:50.600 --> 08:54.960
always heard that. I mean, it wasn't technically, she died on a different bed, so I was like,

08:54.960 --> 09:05.000
the bed before death bed? Whatever you call that. It was the anti-death bed. Yeah, exactly.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.160
I mean, he sat with her. I mean, I know that doesn't sound like a sale. If I heard that

09:13.160 --> 09:16.720
on paper, I wouldn't be like, I'm going to listen to that on the way to work and slam

09:16.720 --> 09:25.280
dunk that pitch. But it's a transcendental experience. It's incredibly, it's neither saccharine nor

09:25.280 --> 09:30.480
is it depressing. It's just transcendental and uplifting. I mean, it's a guy talking

09:30.480 --> 09:38.960
to you. Thank you. And I mean, it was so important for you to do that because there would have

09:38.960 --> 09:44.280
been so easy not to. There's so many reasons not to do that. Yeah. Well, she wanted to

09:44.280 --> 09:48.480
do it. See, I was sort of, I was putting it off because she had said, you know, we should

09:48.480 --> 09:54.400
probably do one of your podcasts. And I just, the whole experience, are your parents still

09:54.400 --> 10:07.680
alive? Yeah. See, well, the whole experience is not what you expect when one of your parents,

10:07.680 --> 10:14.080
the problem with it is it's just not what you expect. And all these crazy defense mechanisms

10:14.080 --> 10:19.480
start floating up from inside of you that you did, they like, like denial of the experience

10:19.480 --> 10:26.520
or well, basically, like I've, well, many, many years ago, for some reason, I did some

10:26.520 --> 10:31.960
volunteer work at a hospice and they sort of walk you through the death process. And

10:31.960 --> 10:38.280
one of the things that they said was people die like they live. So when you're dying,

10:38.280 --> 10:44.120
you sort of, it's like your life repeats over the course of two or three weeks. It just,

10:44.120 --> 10:48.320
you go through every single pattern. You like all those patterns that you keep repeating

10:48.320 --> 10:53.840
and repeating and repeating. So I'm just going to play Minecraft. Yes, you will. No, you'll

10:53.840 --> 10:58.320
play video games and then also any kind of relationship stuff that you have, you'll probably

10:58.320 --> 11:02.840
relive in any kind of like, you know, that, that, that track that you're always that people

11:02.840 --> 11:06.920
are inevitably on the repeating track that happens again and again in your life, like

11:06.920 --> 11:13.360
some weird echo, that echo happens super sped up when you're dying and it doesn't just happen

11:13.360 --> 11:17.360
to you. It happens to the people around you. They start reliving all the old patterns.

11:17.360 --> 11:24.400
So what I was doing while my mom was dying is I went into the basement and just started

11:24.400 --> 11:30.280
playing Starcraft, just playing Starcraft to try to like, you know, escape. Cause when

11:30.280 --> 11:31.280
I was like,

11:31.280 --> 11:34.000
Okay. So I'm sorry. So the cycles that are happening, are they happening to the, to

11:34.000 --> 11:38.200
the person that's dying or? Yeah. And you said it's also happening to everyone.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.360
All your defense mechanisms kick in because you're, you're sort of standing at the brink

11:42.360 --> 11:49.440
of infinity. You're in the presence of absolute truth that there's, you can't escape from.

11:49.440 --> 11:53.480
There's no way to bargain with it. You can't. So what happens is all your defense, you try

11:53.480 --> 11:59.720
to stick your head in any kind of sand that you can find to escape from the, you know,

11:59.720 --> 12:05.520
avoid basically. So, but your mom, your relationship with your mom, I was surprised to hear this

12:05.520 --> 12:11.480
cause I would have guessed just through natural parental math that your parents were either

12:11.480 --> 12:15.280
truck drivers or football coaches. Right. Yeah.

12:15.280 --> 12:21.000
Because you are this Zen guy was like into the, like from the bag of Ed Geeta to the

12:21.000 --> 12:24.280
Dowdy Jig and everything in between. There's actually only a couple of things in between

12:24.280 --> 12:32.040
those two. It's a, but, but, but you are your, your, your brain is this, this spiritual,

12:32.040 --> 12:36.760
you know, a tree branching out into everything, the roots drinking deeply from everything

12:36.760 --> 12:46.720
beneath you and the leaves. I love you. I love you too. God, I wish I was like that.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.160
But then, but then the podcast started rolling. I was like, okay, what is this going to be?

12:50.160 --> 12:55.880
First of all, I expected to hear like the, the, the Darth Vader sound of an air device,

12:55.880 --> 13:02.000
you know, like, yeah, I ex, and I definitely expected her to be in firm vocally, you know,

13:02.000 --> 13:06.200
that she, like, like that would be this horrible experience of listening to a person that wasn't

13:06.200 --> 13:11.360
able to live anymore. And, but beneath all of those very surfacey expectations, I also

13:11.360 --> 13:16.520
expected her to not have a personality as much like yours. And it's not an exact match,

13:16.520 --> 13:19.960
but, but she's, she's seen, almost seems like she was some kind of mentor to you.

13:19.960 --> 13:25.600
She was. Yeah. She was, she definitely wasn't a lot of ways. She's, she's the, I mean, yeah,

13:25.600 --> 13:30.240
that, I would go, it's going through her books that I first found the Bhagavad Gita or found

13:30.240 --> 13:34.280
any kind of Eastern religion or anything like that.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.680
So that means that your dad must have been.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.680
No.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.680
Okay.

13:39.680 --> 13:44.520
Well, no, my dad is just this crazy. Yes. My dad is the, where I rebelled from because

13:44.520 --> 13:48.640
my dad is this like he, when I was a kid, I grew up in the South and he used to take

13:48.640 --> 13:53.420
me hunting and I hated hunting. I didn't want to go hunting. And so I'd end up sitting

13:53.420 --> 13:57.640
in the back of this truck with, cause when you go dove hunting, you just, you don't

13:57.640 --> 14:00.440
kill a few doves. You kill piles, like,

14:00.440 --> 14:03.120
You're killing doves? Is it even a thing? I didn't even know.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.240
Yeah. Oh yeah. They kill doves. They go out and they just shoot doves.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.640
That's like killing Christmas trees.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.640
Yeah.

14:09.640 --> 14:14.880
I guess they do that too. I guess that's how they become Christmas trees.

14:14.880 --> 14:20.000
I didn't think the doves on the trees were also had to be, no, yeah, we would hang doves

14:20.000 --> 14:27.360
on the trees. Dove corpses on the tree. The, the, um, so I would like one story that my

14:27.360 --> 14:32.560
dad likes to bring up when he's, when he's, uh, around his Southern friends or drinking

14:32.560 --> 14:37.200
is like, I took you on and you're sitting in the back of the truck and you started trying

14:37.200 --> 14:41.360
to breathe life back into the doves bodies.

14:41.360 --> 14:48.480
And you're star man. Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably where they're, they're,

14:48.480 --> 14:52.360
You think you're star man? You ain't no star man.

14:52.360 --> 14:57.160
Yeah. Yeah. That's probably the, um, where the rebellion thing happened.

14:57.160 --> 15:02.080
Right. Your dad was corporeal. Your dad was visceral. He was, he was of, of the mortal

15:02.080 --> 15:03.080
coil.

15:03.080 --> 15:07.880
That's right. Exactly. Yeah. That's exactly right. But still a really cool, interesting

15:07.880 --> 15:15.120
Southern guy. Um, but yeah, you know, I read, uh, one of your blogs to my mom on her pre

15:15.120 --> 15:16.120
death.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
Oh, that's right. Justin said something.

15:17.120 --> 15:23.400
She thought it was so fucking funny, man. You made somebody with late stage cancer

15:23.400 --> 15:28.560
authentically laugh and she compared you to, uh, she said that you remind her of Dylan

15:28.560 --> 15:39.520
Thomas. I know, I know. I got a text message about it and I wrote it down. Uh, I mean that,

15:39.520 --> 15:44.000
that was incredibly flattering, but it put me at this weird, strutting the spotlight

15:44.000 --> 15:49.800
on, cause I was being a voyeur, watching you in this relationship with your mom and her

15:49.800 --> 15:55.040
death and all this stuff. And I am a rampant narcissist. I will insert myself into anything

15:55.040 --> 16:01.560
wrap, bend everything toward me. Like my, my ego has just, it's, it's like some singularity.

16:01.560 --> 16:05.800
It just has, it's like, it's the size of a penny, but has the gravity of Jupiter. It

16:05.800 --> 16:10.760
just, I, I, I play that unassuming, like, oh, a little old me game. And he just sucked

16:10.760 --> 16:16.800
into me. Everything's about me. 10 seconds before the word I or me comes into it. It

16:16.800 --> 16:20.800
doesn't matter what we're talking about. And, and so I was listening to that and I, I was

16:20.800 --> 16:25.520
thinking in my head, I was like, I wonder what she'd think of, uh, my, my writing. There

16:25.520 --> 16:31.400
you go. No, she thought it was, she thought it was hilarious, man. But you know, she was,

16:31.400 --> 16:34.520
she, she was, by that time the cancer had gone into her brain.

16:34.520 --> 16:52.040
Only the, only the taste center, uh, all her other faculties about her. The grain of salt.

16:52.040 --> 16:58.760
The last thing she said is, man, those Ernest movies. I wish, I wish he had gone to one

16:58.760 --> 17:09.280
more place and Dan Harmon's like Dylan Thomas. But anyways, I thank you so much for having

17:09.280 --> 17:13.920
done that because I don't, I mean, I won't like, I'll, I'll have an experience. Well,

17:13.920 --> 17:18.760
if I'm, if I'm, if I'm, if I'm quote unquote lucky, either, either I will die before my

17:18.760 --> 17:23.600
mom or, or, or my mom will die before me, but it, uh, assuming my mom will die before

17:23.600 --> 17:27.360
me, I don't know why I'm qualifying all of us because I'm superstitious and weird and

17:27.360 --> 17:33.680
death is fucking weird and even, even viewed from, from the deer blind of, of, of, of it

17:33.680 --> 17:37.520
not being reality. Like it already starts to get awkward and weird and you, you want

17:37.520 --> 17:42.840
to knock on wood after everything you say and you want the dying to be invisible, which

17:42.840 --> 17:49.320
is why it's, it makes it already hard process, even harder. And, and, and that tunnel is

17:49.320 --> 17:54.640
what you go through when you listen to that podcast episode, you come out the other side,

17:54.640 --> 17:59.040
it's only for a moment because already I feel weird about death again, but, but for that,

17:59.040 --> 18:04.400
that, that, that period of time and all day at work that day, it was like, fuck man, so

18:04.400 --> 18:11.000
much shit that I was afraid of, uh, you know, is not, it's, it's not a thing to be afraid

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
of.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.600
It isn't, you know why it's not a thing to be afraid of? Because you can't understand

18:14.600 --> 18:20.160
it. It's impossible to understand it. It's not anything that you expect. You can't, being

18:20.160 --> 18:27.120
afraid is every see, it's kind of like any reaction you have to death is like kicking

18:27.120 --> 18:33.080
sand at Godzilla. It's a, there's no reaction you can have to it because it is, it's, it's

18:33.080 --> 18:39.760
a singularity and it's in, so there almost seems to, it seems pointless to contemplate

18:39.760 --> 18:45.120
it too much, even though all the, a lot of Eastern traditions say that, uh, meditation

18:45.120 --> 18:51.080
is the preparation for death, you know, because when you, I guess it's kind of like you don't,

18:51.080 --> 18:55.280
if you can avoid it, you don't want to relive your life in the last two weeks of your life.

18:55.280 --> 19:00.560
If you can avoid it, you want to have this stable, steady thing and not go into all the

19:00.560 --> 19:06.680
old neurotic aspects of your life because it's, because it's a terrifying, I mean, now

19:06.680 --> 19:10.920
I was just saying, don't be afraid of it. Now I'm saying it's fucking scary, but you

19:10.920 --> 19:16.880
can't breathe, you're in pain. They put you, they, it's, it's really, I haven't, I haven't

19:16.880 --> 19:21.560
really, um, I'm, my brain is still stuttering from it and, and my therapist says it's like

19:21.560 --> 19:22.560
at least six months.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.920
Well that's the other thing I wanted to ask you about is now you, and you went on tour

19:25.920 --> 19:31.480
right after, right as it was happening and, and, and now you're back and, and I know you

19:31.480 --> 19:39.840
were via Dustin, who's, you know, he's a little, he's a little gossip, he said that you were,

19:39.840 --> 19:43.040
you know, having trouble, uh, getting out of the house and feeling a little, like,

19:43.040 --> 19:44.040
Yeah, I'm depressed.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.040
Yeah.

19:45.040 --> 19:50.200
I'm, uh, but, and that's not grief is depression, but I've retired. What I do is I buy robots

19:50.200 --> 19:56.880
and feed birds and just sit, like, my brain is reacting in this weird way where I bought

19:56.880 --> 20:04.320
a Roomba, I, I bought lights that I controlled my phone and a, and a bird feed bird feeders.

20:04.320 --> 20:09.320
So I just sit with the Roomba and you're still breathing life back into birds.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
Oh, yeah.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.840
No, I'm not. I'm killing them. I've, I, so I'm sitting on my porch. I've got,

20:14.840 --> 20:17.840
You didn't mix up the robot food with the bird food.

20:17.840 --> 20:22.640
You sent Roomba a soul.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.720
No, I, you know, I've set up my porch for this to, like, it's a place to read. I've got wind

20:27.720 --> 20:31.840
chimes, a fountain, a bird feeders, and I've,

20:31.840 --> 20:33.400
Have you bought all that stuff recently?

20:33.400 --> 20:34.680
Yeah. It's all part of this.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.680
Really all of that?

20:35.680 --> 20:36.680
All part of this.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.680
I was just over at your place for your birthday.

20:37.680 --> 20:42.800
Well, there's a whole package at hospitals. You can buy as a wind chime bird feeder porch

20:42.800 --> 20:43.800
swing package.

20:43.800 --> 20:48.960
You, well, yeah, I got all of that. I don't know what it is. Like everyone's telling me

20:48.960 --> 20:54.640
you're grieving. So you're going to go crazy. So let yourself go crazy. And the more you

20:54.640 --> 20:59.960
let yourself go crazy and be impulsive, the faster you'll get through it. So for me, that

20:59.960 --> 21:06.440
going crazy was, Oh, I'll buy a robot vacuum cleaner and hummingbird feeders. And the,

21:06.440 --> 21:09.880
so I'm sitting on the porch proud of myself because all the birds finally came to the

21:09.880 --> 21:15.560
feeder and it's covered in birds. And I'm watching the birds and I feel like the God of birds.

21:15.560 --> 21:20.440
Like when you have bird feeders, you get this weird sense of like, this is because of me.

21:20.440 --> 21:29.560
I am your Lord. And I bring the food. It is, we're starving before that.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.880
Maybe if somebody, yeah, they're starving. Maybe if somebody wronged you.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.200
You just changed migration routes and now they're all going to die eventually cause they came

21:38.200 --> 21:39.200
out of their way.

21:39.200 --> 21:45.280
Well, no, it already happened. Like I'm sitting there when chimes are chiming the fountain.

21:45.280 --> 21:51.440
It's so peaceful and a bird just like rockets right into my fucking window right in front

21:51.440 --> 21:52.440
of me.

21:52.440 --> 21:58.120
It's right in front of me. And I go over to it. It's little and I had seen it. I went

21:58.120 --> 22:04.000
to its body and a little trickle of red was coming out of it's feet cause it broke its

22:04.000 --> 22:08.320
neck. I'd seen that bird on the feeder earlier in the day.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.320
Was it a hummingbird?

22:09.320 --> 22:10.320
No, it was a Finch.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.200
Yeah. Cause they, okay.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.080
The hummingbirds don't hit the window there. They seem like they would be incapable of

22:16.080 --> 22:17.080
that.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.480
You know, the secret is you have to dress like a hawk.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.440
I sit on my porch dressed as a hawk.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.280
You have to get a, a, a hawk cut.

22:24.280 --> 22:28.920
This is your origin story of your new super villain character.

22:28.920 --> 22:35.080
You have to strike fear into those you love. It's very complicated, but the Batman version

22:35.080 --> 22:36.080
has been taken.

22:36.080 --> 22:40.080
You know, you want to be a superhero these days. You got to get, you got to get labyrinthine.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.080
Oh yeah. That's a great, I would do, I would do that.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.560
I mean, you would dress like a hawk.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.120
Fuck yeah. I dress like a hawk.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.440
You're on record. We're recording this.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.400
I'll dress like a hawk and sit on my porch.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.080
All right. You heard it here.

22:51.080 --> 22:57.160
It's a weird, I got to tell you though, it's a very strange dimension that we're existing

22:57.160 --> 23:01.880
in when you, and that's why bird feeders are cool, because you just consider what's happening.

23:01.880 --> 23:07.800
It's such a bizarre thing from the perspective of the bird, which is this giant tower of

23:07.800 --> 23:14.680
meat, like this HP Lovecraft couture thing, the opposite of the bird is like, put these

23:14.680 --> 23:18.760
things out and they don't understand what I have and I stink to them.

23:18.760 --> 23:24.040
I like, yeah, there's some weird smells that birds hate is coming off of me and they sit

23:24.040 --> 23:29.240
and, but they want to eat the food. So they sit and eat and like peer around and look

23:29.240 --> 23:33.240
and then eat and constantly, yeah, they must live in constant, whatever their version of

23:33.240 --> 23:37.880
fear is because they're surrounded by mammals that, and 90% of them will hurt them if they

23:37.880 --> 23:41.040
grab them, but then some 10% of them don't, but they probably can't tell the difference

23:41.040 --> 23:42.600
between a cat and a dude.

23:42.600 --> 23:47.200
They're just all, yeah, they're always, yeah, they exist in a hell world where one raw

23:47.200 --> 23:51.080
man moves, like, like, like, you know, like, yeah, that's why they're always ball players

23:51.080 --> 23:58.640
in an old movie, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, and yeah, they, they, and I, I was watching them

23:58.640 --> 24:05.160
before the bird died and I was thinking, I bet there's an older bird somewhere being

24:05.160 --> 24:12.160
like, don't go to those feeders. It's cursed near the feeders. You go near the feeders

24:12.160 --> 24:17.440
and you're cursed by the Lord of Birds. And then one of them smacked right into the window.

24:17.440 --> 24:24.000
He's like, see the price is death from the, he just, he just fell right out of the air.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.400
It is nothing. It's like he hit a force field.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.400
That's what it is.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.640
You know what a force field is, but you don't know what a window is.

24:31.640 --> 24:39.760
Season. We, we're trying to season, but we don't have hands. The bird equivalent of

24:39.760 --> 24:47.520
seizure. Yeah. I don't know what's natural for a bird though. They're probably, I mean,

24:47.520 --> 24:50.800
they don't know, like, like, like, like, like, what are they, I guess digging up a worm like

24:50.800 --> 24:55.000
in some cartoon, like, they got to be thinking someone put that there too. What am I talking

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
about?

24:56.000 --> 25:03.760
I should just shoot myself right now. Thanks guys. Thanks. I'll keep saying that once or

25:03.760 --> 25:11.040
a week until I stop getting that reaction. And then boom, I know you're conflicted about

25:11.040 --> 25:12.040
that.

25:12.040 --> 25:17.360
A guy, a guy did that. Remember the guy who did that a while ago? In an open mic, a guy

25:17.360 --> 25:18.360
stabbed himself to death.

25:18.360 --> 25:19.360
What?

25:19.360 --> 25:20.360
You guys didn't hear about that?

25:20.360 --> 25:21.360
What?

25:21.360 --> 25:22.360
Yeah.

25:22.360 --> 25:23.360
This is in Colorado.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.360
Anthony Jeselnick.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.360
It was like, it was like a couple of days ago.

25:28.360 --> 25:33.360
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
it's, it's fucking.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.360
Yeah.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.360
What, no, what happened?

25:36.360 --> 25:41.680
Well, the story is like he came on stage and he just played some song. I can't, I think

25:41.680 --> 25:46.160
the song was like, it had something to do with like, sorry for the mess was the name

25:46.160 --> 25:49.160
of the song. And then he just started jamming a knife.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.160
Where was this?

25:50.160 --> 25:56.440
This is in Colorado. So he just, I don't, I don't know. Just some shitty open mic,

25:56.440 --> 25:57.440
you know, like,

25:57.440 --> 25:58.440
Did he die?

25:58.440 --> 25:59.440
Oh, he died.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
Yeah.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.600
He went up, he went up and murdered himself in front of an audience.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.120
Yeah. He stabbed himself to death in front of a crap.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
Who's a shit?

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
I, I,

26:08.120 --> 26:09.120
It's a terrible thing to do.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.120
To other people.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
To other people.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.120
It is true.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.120
It is true.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
You've talked about that.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.640
Suicide is actually like a very selfish, you know, it's like the, the amount of gravity

26:18.640 --> 26:23.000
that you exert on other people's lives when you, when you, when you, when you take yourself

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
out of the picture.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Oh yeah.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.360
It's a, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's definitely a, those, those, I mean that in particular,

26:29.360 --> 26:33.920
I think suicide, suicide when you have some kind of chronic illness or something is, is

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
totally cool.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.920
No, no, no, no.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
Let him.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
I think it should be illegal.

26:37.920 --> 26:38.920
No, no, no.

26:38.920 --> 26:39.920
All right.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.960
Let's, let's, let's, let's keep the bullet train moving.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.960
You stay here.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
Let's bring up another friend.

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
Mr. Greg.

26:44.960 --> 27:04.960
Mr. Greg Prups.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.320
Your microphones in your, in your tickets.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.320
Oh man.

27:08.320 --> 27:11.920
I just realized that, is that, is that, is that why the extra energy when I, when I took

27:11.920 --> 27:17.880
the stage, are there proof-of-files that, that are, that are, all right, good?

27:17.880 --> 27:22.120
I don't, I don't mean to say that harmonians are, are a bunch of sluggish oafs.

27:22.120 --> 27:27.160
No, but proof-of-files and harmonians can learn to live together, like the Czechs and

27:27.160 --> 27:29.400
the Slovaks did for all those years.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.040
What makes a proof-of-file a proof-of-file?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.040
What, what, what says them apart?

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
I think a certain.

27:33.040 --> 27:37.040
If I could walk like a proof-of-file.

27:37.040 --> 27:43.080
I mean, a Joie de Vieve, a certain Jeanne-Séquin, a certain, a sense of denial, goes into every

27:43.080 --> 27:44.080
day of living.

27:44.080 --> 27:49.800
I mean, yeah, a total, like, actually, moronic, I mean, you're a proof-of-file, it's like,

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
God.

27:50.800 --> 27:56.680
Think about how fruitless that is, as a pursuit, and then you get a good idea of why proof-of-files

27:56.680 --> 27:57.680
follow it.

27:57.680 --> 28:02.160
I think it's not a Sisyphusian pushing the rock up the hill, and then the rock rolls

28:02.160 --> 28:04.080
back down the hill kind of thing.

28:04.080 --> 28:08.960
Either that, or some hilarious sitcom reference from the 70s.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.200
Yes.

28:10.200 --> 28:13.600
More of a Starsky and Hutchian than a Sisyphusian.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
Right.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
Hey, don't count it.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.280
I know from your perspective, you think that that's like, no, they just stare at me blankly

28:19.280 --> 28:20.280
all the time, too.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.280
Oh, I know.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.280
I know.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.280
There's Starsky and Hutch.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.280
They're like, what?

28:24.280 --> 28:29.320
Who is the Starsky and Hutch you speak of when television was powered by water?

28:29.320 --> 28:31.920
Greg, have you met Duncan before?

28:31.920 --> 28:32.920
You guys pals?

28:32.920 --> 28:37.000
I haven't, and I've been very moved by what Duncan was saying.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
You're an extraordinary person.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.120
You're very brave, and you're very funny, and I adore your podcasting right on, buddy.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.120
Thank you very much.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.120
Thank you, Greg.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
Thanks.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.120
That's amazing.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
Thank you.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.720
I think he's been marvelously genuine tonight, something that I'm terrible at.

28:51.720 --> 28:57.200
I wanted you guys to, I wanted to see what would happen if, because I don't know, I have

28:57.200 --> 29:01.040
like three friends.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.040
Certainly not.

29:02.040 --> 29:09.520
But I mean, I was like, a lot of people have like 20 or 30 people that they call friends,

29:09.520 --> 29:13.400
and then they have like, let's say 150 people that they call something else, like acquaintances

29:13.400 --> 29:14.400
or something.

29:14.400 --> 29:21.320
And I have like three people that are my friends, only because they're the only people that

29:21.320 --> 29:26.280
can tolerate texting me and then not me not responding, because I was like, it's Jeff

29:26.280 --> 29:27.280
and Dina.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.280
Are you that person?

29:28.280 --> 29:29.280
You don't respond?

29:29.280 --> 29:30.280
Yeah, I guess.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.280
Really?

29:31.280 --> 29:32.280
No.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.280
No?

29:33.280 --> 29:34.280
I don't.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.280
I'm terrible at answering emails.

29:35.280 --> 29:40.560
And I do the exact same thing, Dan, and it's a problem because people take it the wrong

29:40.560 --> 29:41.560
way.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.520
They think it means you don't love them, but it's just.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.000
So then we can be friends.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh yeah.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.580
We already are friends.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.200
You already haven't responded to several of my emails.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.200
Yeah.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.200
This is great.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.200
It's like the honeymoon.

29:54.200 --> 29:57.480
You'll be friends, but you'll never, ever have lunch together.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.120
No, because you'll never be able to finish that series of texts.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.640
Exactly.

30:02.640 --> 30:07.240
You really have to love drinking a block from my house in order to become really tight with

30:07.240 --> 30:08.240
me.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
Right.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.840
I feel like I'm raising up in this friend state here.

30:11.840 --> 30:15.640
Now that you've got the house, Dan, and I think we could have all predicted this, that

30:15.640 --> 30:22.720
I see you Monday nights here at Harmontown, and if I go to your house, I don't work at

30:22.720 --> 30:27.440
Starbucks Industries, and other than that, that's where you're going to be.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.440
Yeah.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.440
I'm getting bad.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.440
And I'm sinking into it.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.120
I was like, I'm a proud Minecraft addict.

30:33.120 --> 30:37.960
Like I'm just like, I'm so, I just, like, it's obscene.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.440
What are you working on?

30:39.440 --> 30:41.880
What's the new task in Minecraft that you're doing?

30:41.880 --> 30:46.360
I've loaded up Minecraft with all these mods that let you make all these different things.

30:46.360 --> 30:52.720
So I'm working on making a nuclear reactor, and I have a, I created my sixth solar panel.

30:52.720 --> 30:58.240
So I'm just proudly going to the point where solar energy, what's that going, yeah, like

30:58.240 --> 30:59.240
Korea.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.840
Well, it doesn't matter.

31:00.840 --> 31:10.160
I mean, like, if, if, if, if, if, if what was going on with me was interesting, I wouldn't,

31:10.160 --> 31:13.360
you know, I wouldn't be surrounding myself with entertaining people.

31:13.360 --> 31:17.280
When you leave the house to come to Harmontown, say tonight, I go, I go, oh fuck, what am

31:17.280 --> 31:20.160
I going to talk to them about, Minecraft?

31:20.160 --> 31:21.160
Why not?

31:21.160 --> 31:22.720
I hope Greg Proups and Duncan Trussell show up.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.360
Greg, do you play video games?

31:24.360 --> 31:25.360
What?

31:25.360 --> 31:26.360
You don't play video games.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.360
No.

31:27.360 --> 31:35.360
I, but you know what, I don't, I don't, I don't shame people who do.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.360
Uh, I don't.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.360
You just did.

31:37.360 --> 31:38.360
Yeah.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.360
The, the inflection.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.360
It wasn't intentional.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.360
The inflection was there.

31:43.360 --> 31:48.360
The inflection was, the inflection is you're counting lashes when you're whipping Jesus.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.360
Wow.

31:49.360 --> 31:53.360
Because you know, Jesus had his bad side.

31:53.360 --> 31:56.360
Let me, let's not, let's not get, you know, you're being just.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.360
He was asking for it.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.360
Exactly.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.360
You're being, you're making a value judgment, Duncan.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.360
I'm sorry.

32:02.360 --> 32:08.120
Uh, maybe my, my, my tomb or my tone indicated that I, that I, that I was diminishing people

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
who play games.

32:09.120 --> 32:14.120
But I think it's marvelous when people let their creativity run rampant, uh, in that

32:14.120 --> 32:15.120
area.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.120
It's simply not for me.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.680
I think it's a generational thing.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.360
I was born in the middle of a war.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.360
I was born in a crossfire hurricane.

32:22.360 --> 32:27.360
And I had a hound in my mouth and they're driving right.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.360
Yeah.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.360
Yeah.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.360
Yeah.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Yeah.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.360
I was down.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.360
So the thing is.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.360
Well, there's a healthy use of your time.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.360
Yeah.

32:36.360 --> 32:43.360
I don't, uh, I like to read and watch old movies and lately because Jackie Robinson's

32:43.360 --> 32:49.360
movie came out this week, 42, I went and saw it the other day and I have, and my wife,

32:49.360 --> 32:54.360
you know, imagine her disappointment when I bring four different books about Jackie

32:54.360 --> 32:56.360
Robinson out, including two that he's written.

32:56.360 --> 33:01.360
I saw the poster at the grove and I was like, I bet Greg's happy about that, uh, the baseball

33:01.360 --> 33:02.360
movie coming out.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.360
Is it any good?

33:03.360 --> 33:09.360
It was, it was a hagiographic, as we say, uh, it, it, it, it, it portrayed him in a way.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.360
Uh, that,

33:10.360 --> 33:11.360
What does that mean?

33:11.360 --> 33:12.360
Hagiographic?

33:12.360 --> 33:14.360
Hagiographic is like when you take someone's history.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.360
Like for instance, if I were to write the history of Dan Harmon,

33:17.360 --> 33:18.360
Go on.

33:18.360 --> 33:23.360
Like all of a sudden you'd be, you'd be pounding over a typewriter and piece of paper coming

33:23.360 --> 33:24.360
out and then there'd be stacks of them.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.360
Right.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.360
And then Steven J. Canada logo would happen.

33:27.360 --> 33:28.360
The shot of the paper.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.360
Yeah.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.360
Yeah.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.360
Yeah.

33:31.360 --> 33:37.360
And then you, you, you take a sip from a bottle, but then we'd see in the garbage can

33:37.360 --> 33:38.360
80 bottles.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.360
Right.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.360
And then all over the floor.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.360
And a letter from my mom.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.360
Right.

33:42.360 --> 33:46.360
And a can of tin out that's been upturned and a cat that hasn't been fed into agents

33:46.360 --> 33:47.360
and whatnot.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.360
And I'd have an answering machine and there'd be six messages in a row all expository.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.360
Right.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
Hey, it's your editor.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.360
Got another thing.

33:53.360 --> 33:57.360
Every single one of them would explain your character.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
Right.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
Right.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.360
This is your mom.

34:00.360 --> 34:01.360
Why won't you call?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.360
Right.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.360
You know, one after the next.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.360
Yeah.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.360
That family, that 80s mom on the other end of the phone.

34:05.360 --> 34:09.360
But then when you finally, when you like write the script that wins and, and you become

34:09.360 --> 34:11.360
Dan Harmon and shit.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.360
That's the moment we'd be like, I'm so grateful.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.360
There's one thing I want to thank is God and shit.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.360
They didn't do that.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.360
So, okay.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.360
So, well, they didn't wait.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.360
They didn't know they didn't.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.360
They had to be a human, but like, I know way too much about this.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
And I don't want to stop your show.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.360
Well, but I'm caught up on this word.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.360
Hagiographic.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.360
I just want to make sure.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.360
Hagiography is taking the history of someone.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.360
And can you spell that word?

34:35.360 --> 34:36.360
Yeah.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.360
H-A-G-I-O.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.360
Can you mine it in Minecraft?

34:39.360 --> 34:41.360
Yeah, I can.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.360
No, not mine.

34:43.360 --> 34:44.360
What's an O?

34:44.360 --> 34:46.360
Oh, my man.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.360
Wait, were you going to mine it?

34:48.360 --> 34:51.360
No, I was going to mine it.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.360
He was miming pulling a card.

34:53.360 --> 34:57.360
If you remember the Seven Dorms, they worked in a mine all day.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.360
So it's spelled like Hagi.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.360
Yeah, it's a Greek word.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.360
And I'm not certain what the prefix means.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.360
But in essence, what it brought.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.360
Easy, tiger.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.360
I'll take it from here.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.360
Thanks.

35:08.360 --> 35:12.360
I know you've got some Asperger people here tonight.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.360
Just some Goldberg people.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.360
I know.

35:15.360 --> 35:20.360
You have many thesaurus here and other tiny dinosaurs all around the audience.

35:20.360 --> 35:27.360
It just means that it takes what was once a human experience and turns it into a movie experience.

35:27.360 --> 35:33.360
For instance, you've seen, Jeff and I often talk about the movie Patton or Lawrence of Arabia,

35:33.360 --> 35:37.360
which are great biopics, but they have nothing to do with the actual process.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.360
There's not a single moment in the movie that probably happens.

35:40.360 --> 35:45.360
Patton didn't jump out on a balcony and start shooting his pistols on a plane going by.

35:45.360 --> 35:46.360
Maybe he did.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.360
If he didn't, he ought to have, and that's what movies are about.

35:48.360 --> 35:53.360
I hope he actually said in the hallway somewhere with sunlight coming in a bunch of windows,

35:53.360 --> 35:56.360
I hope he said, is this some kind of sick joke?

35:56.360 --> 35:57.360
An entire world at war?

35:57.360 --> 35:58.360
Yeah.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.360
God will not allow it.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.360
That's my favorite part of the movie now.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.360
Greg and I have done, we travel a lot together.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.360
Greg and I will do the entirety of Patton together.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.360
Oh, no, two and a half hours.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.360
Yeah, it's horrible.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.360
And that's the best part down.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.360
An entire world at war, and I'm not allowed to be in it.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.360
God will not allow this to happen.

36:17.360 --> 36:20.360
I will be allowed to fulfill my destiny.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.360
His will be done.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.360
Patton's four black bellies standing there like,

36:27.360 --> 36:31.360
You know, but that's why movies are good.

36:31.360 --> 36:35.360
Because I once said to my wife, if movies aren't better than real life, I don't want to live.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.360
Yeah, yeah.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.360
Movies are an extrapolation on life.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.360
They're a reflection.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.360
Yeah.

36:41.360 --> 36:46.360
Yeah, I mean, a movie for better or for worse, the definition of it has become,

36:46.360 --> 36:48.360
well, now it's been extended to three hours.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.360
I don't know why that movement happened.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
Why?

36:51.360 --> 36:56.360
It has something to do with the same reason why in the 90s graphic design of posters went out the window.

36:56.360 --> 37:01.360
It just became Denzel Washington's half of his face and half of whoever else's face was in the movie.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.360
And then like a knife.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.360
I thought that would never end.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.360
But I think like I've seen some cool posters lately.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.360
Like it seems like graphic designers have started to get paid again.

37:12.360 --> 37:13.360
Yeah.

37:13.360 --> 37:18.360
But I think that maybe editing entered that thing where they're like, wait a minute,

37:18.360 --> 37:20.360
we don't have to do three passes on this movie.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.360
Let's just make it three and a half hours long.

37:22.360 --> 37:26.360
But you would think that the bottom line mentality would say, no, make it 90 minutes.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.360
No, they don't.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.360
So that we can show it in multiplyses.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.360
Those bloody go-to-the-rings movies are like eight hours long each.

37:30.360 --> 37:34.360
I guess, but they must make so much money that everyone's confusing that and going like,

37:34.360 --> 37:38.360
sure, let your Brad Pitt movie about the invention of ping-pong be three hours long.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.360
It'll be just like a Peter Jackson film.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.360
I love that movie, by the way.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.360
Hot balls.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.360
The tiny net.

37:45.360 --> 37:50.360
Have you heard of these new theaters that they have in Japan that are coming here?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.360
They're in China.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
Have you heard about these?

37:52.360 --> 37:58.360
There's these new theaters, hardcore theaters that drop bubbles onto the audience

37:58.360 --> 38:01.360
and have scent that they're sweet.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.360
Yeah.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.360
I can't wait.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
Like South 50s.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.360
The seat's vibrant.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.360
Yeah.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.360
That's coming back.

38:07.360 --> 38:11.360
That the aspect of scent, like apparently it's coming to the United States soon.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.360
But yeah, it's basically somehow their emulating smell,

38:14.360 --> 38:17.360
which I've always wanted to see what that would be like.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.360
Does anyone remember the book Brave New World by Aldous Huxley,

38:20.360 --> 38:26.360
where you held onto two electrodes during the movie and they were called the filets?

38:26.360 --> 38:30.360
So when people in the movie are raped and people in the movie are shot,

38:30.360 --> 38:32.360
and while you're watching, you're like, oh.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.360
Yes.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.360
And I always thought that really nailed it.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
Yeah.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
Well, we're getting there.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.360
Yeah.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.360
I just put on one of those Oculus Rift things.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.360
I don't know if you know.

38:40.360 --> 38:44.360
This is like they're starting to ship the development kits for these things

38:44.360 --> 38:49.360
that when I was in my 20s, there was this concept called virtual reality in the 90s.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.360
Yes.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.360
And everybody always looked at their hands.

38:52.360 --> 38:56.360
Yeah, everyone was like, they inserted it into everything, Lucky Charms commercials

38:56.360 --> 38:58.360
and virtual reality in it.

38:58.360 --> 39:05.360
Like, oh, they'll never get my Lucky Charms if I won't go into virtual reality.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.360
I'm not kidding.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.360
That's really not an exaggeration.

39:07.360 --> 39:11.360
There would be a shitty movie of the month would come out with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore,

39:11.360 --> 39:16.360
and then they'd have just a scene in between blowjobs where she was in virtual reality.

39:16.360 --> 39:22.360
Like the scene where they go into the office and look through a filing cabinet was replaced

39:22.360 --> 39:26.360
with a scene of her putting on goggles and going into a virtual filing cabinet.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.360
Yeah.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.360
Anyways, lawnmower man, yada, yada.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.360
Then we dropped it because it got so embarrassing.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.360
It was like disco.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
It was like we've got so...

39:33.360 --> 39:38.360
As soon as New Year's of 2000 happened, we're like, enough with the goggles and the people

39:38.360 --> 39:39.360
going like this.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.360
No more strange days.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.360
Because it never really happened.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.360
Yeah.

39:42.360 --> 39:47.360
And as this kid started a Kickstarter, a kid, I call him a kid.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.360
He's probably under 50.

39:49.360 --> 39:53.360
He started a Kickstarter and said, look, I don't know why we gave up on this.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.360
We can do this.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.360
This is a real thing.

39:55.360 --> 40:00.360
And it just got flooded with money and flooded with agreements from software developers like,

40:00.360 --> 40:02.360
yes, yes, let's fucking do this.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.360
So anyways, my friend Justin Roiland, who's an insane...

40:05.360 --> 40:10.360
He's the co-creator of Rick and Morty, and he's like this insane like collector of everything.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.360
He got one of these development kits, brought it to the office.

40:13.360 --> 40:21.360
I put on these goggles and I was like, I'm standing in Tuscany in a house and I moved

40:21.360 --> 40:23.360
my head a little cautiously this way.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.360
And there's shit over here.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.360
And I'm everywhere.

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
I'm looking everywhere.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.360
And there's Tuscany everywhere.

40:31.360 --> 40:38.360
360 degrees of Tuscany, which I'm recommending is the title of my biopic.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.360
Please, please let it be hagiographic.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
It will be.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.360
Yeah, because I've never been to Tuscany.

40:44.360 --> 40:48.360
Because you know what, in the first scene, you're burning your canvas.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.360
And just fuming over it.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.360
You've spent hours painting it and you're just burning it.

40:53.360 --> 40:56.360
And a wife that I've never had, but that's an amalgam of all of my girlfriends comes in

40:56.360 --> 40:59.360
and goes, you need, you need.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.360
And then someone rides up on a donkey and goes, this is from the Pope.

41:02.360 --> 41:07.360
And you're like, shit.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.360
Because you're in Tuscany.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.360
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.360 --> 41:12.360
Yeah, anyways, I don't know.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.360
It's happening.

41:13.360 --> 41:14.360
It's definitely happening.

41:14.360 --> 41:19.360
Like one look through these things and just the realization that it's happening within

41:19.360 --> 41:22.360
five years, because these things are super low resolution.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.360
They don't have proximity sensors on them.

41:24.360 --> 41:28.360
So when you move your head, you get motion sickness very quickly.

41:28.360 --> 41:34.360
You get like a weird nausea because of little tweaks that they need to make to this thing.

41:34.360 --> 41:39.360
Once they make those tweaks and increase the resolution of these things, it's like unbelievable.

41:39.360 --> 41:45.360
I was talking to Rochester, they have a three month old baby.

41:45.360 --> 41:52.360
And in two years, we're talking about the Oculus Rift.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.360
That's going to be that baby's baseline.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.360
They're going to start out there.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.360
That's going to be so cool.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.360
Yeah, but it's going to be a pair of Ray-Bans.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.360
It's not going to be a fucking ridiculous set of goggles.

42:02.360 --> 42:06.360
And then five years after that, it's going to be a patch you put on your temple.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.360
Well, it'll be already inserted in the way.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.360
I know this for a fact.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.360
I predicted jet packs in the 80s.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.360
Look, they happened eventually in the title sequence for the fall guy.

42:15.360 --> 42:24.360
Because of this technology, this has created this philosophy that we're in a simulation.

42:24.360 --> 42:27.360
This is something we always talk about, but they're testing right now.

42:27.360 --> 42:32.360
Something that's actually accessible now, which is interesting because in Plato's cave,

42:32.360 --> 42:36.360
he's using state-of-the-art technology to make his point.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.360
Candles, shadows.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.360
And I was like, think about it.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.360
And if he was saying that to a caveman pre-fire,

42:42.360 --> 42:45.360
they'd go, hey, man, listen, I know you're trying to tell me that life is a dream,

42:45.360 --> 42:50.360
but I don't know fire yet, let alone controlling the shadows and stuff.

42:50.360 --> 42:56.360
And this concept of actual video games have gotten so addictive and so immersive

42:56.360 --> 42:59.360
that you and I kind of like talking about this have been on your podcast twice

42:59.360 --> 43:01.360
and we keep talking about it.

43:01.360 --> 43:04.360
I think there's two reasons we talk about it.

43:04.360 --> 43:09.360
One, because there is a technological tsunami that's about to destroy society

43:09.360 --> 43:16.360
because the moment the technology advances to the point where that reality becomes more amazing,

43:16.360 --> 43:21.360
then this reality becomes indistinguishable from this reality.

43:21.360 --> 43:25.360
When it becomes hagiographic, is that what you call it?

43:25.360 --> 43:27.360
Life becomes vestigial.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.360
When the myth is better than the reality.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.360
Exactly, when that happens.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.360
Like movies are to me.

43:32.360 --> 43:38.360
Yeah, already people are hooked on World of Warcraft or even movies are on these very low res.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.360
People won't want to travel, people already don't want to travel,

43:40.360 --> 43:43.360
but people that feel like they should travel but don't have the...

43:43.360 --> 43:49.360
I know Tuscany's probably beautiful, but I really liked looking at fake low res Tuscany

43:49.360 --> 43:51.360
with motion sickness through a pair of goggles,

43:51.360 --> 43:55.360
because it was more exciting because we have been as a species,

43:55.360 --> 44:02.360
we are instinctively compelled to, I think, destroy ourselves.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.360
We think create ourselves.

44:04.360 --> 44:09.360
Campbell would say we have like a blueprint on our spinal cord.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.360
That's why we create the gods that we worship.

44:12.360 --> 44:17.360
We have this fantasy that our purpose is to be gods.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.360
Our purpose is to create life.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.360
Our purpose is to change the weather.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.360
Our purpose is to defeat death.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.360
Our purpose is to teleport.

44:24.360 --> 44:30.360
Our purpose is to reach across the earth and grab the Loch Ness Monster by the neck

44:30.360 --> 44:32.360
and use it for salting our pizza.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.360
That's it.

44:33.360 --> 44:35.360
That's the point of everything.

44:35.360 --> 44:39.360
By the way, that's exactly what I would do with the Loch Ness Monster.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.360
You know why?

44:40.360 --> 44:43.360
Because he's spicy.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.360
A lot of people don't think so because he's Scottish.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.360
They think it's going to be bland.

44:47.360 --> 44:50.360
It'll be salty because Scotland only has two spices.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.360
Salt and booze.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.360
Have you found that your pizza is salty?

44:54.360 --> 44:56.360
Your salt and freedom!

44:56.360 --> 44:57.360
Yeah.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.360
You can take it away, man.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.360
I thought you were going to take it away, man.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.360
I'd like a Scottish pizza.

45:05.360 --> 45:09.360
Can I get half Loch Ness salt, half freedom?

45:09.360 --> 45:10.360
Aye.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.360
That's all we got, man.

45:12.360 --> 45:15.360
It'll be there in two and a half hours.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.360
We're a little bit short tonight.

45:16.360 --> 45:20.360
It's a great, great day for multi-car racing!

45:20.360 --> 45:21.360
All right.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.360
What were you going to say, Jeff?

45:22.360 --> 45:23.360
Sorry.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.360
Do you find that...

45:26.360 --> 45:28.360
I took an accident workshop in Congress.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.360
No, you didn't.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.360
We should talk about that.

45:31.360 --> 45:32.360
We should talk about that rather than...

45:32.360 --> 45:33.360
Did you hear me?

45:33.360 --> 45:34.360
Did you really?

45:34.360 --> 45:35.360
Yeah.

45:35.360 --> 45:36.360
Well, I didn't take it.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.360
They gave it to me.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.360
They thought that I would be better at improv if I knew how to say,

45:41.360 --> 45:44.360
It's a great, great day for multi-car racing!

45:44.360 --> 45:46.360
Every time someone said, Scottish!

45:46.360 --> 45:47.360
So you're Jackie Stewart.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.360
Yeah.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.360
I'm a wart on Rich Little's taint.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.360
His taint was pretty smooth.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.360
Yeah.

45:57.360 --> 45:58.360
That's the irony.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.360
I think we already tried to...

46:03.360 --> 46:07.360
The actual irony is, Rich Little's taint, incredibly distinctive,

46:07.360 --> 46:10.360
resembled no one else's taint to the world.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.360
A unique and singular taint.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.360
A master impressionist.

46:14.360 --> 46:16.360
His taint was just...

46:16.360 --> 46:17.360
It was only his.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.360
God broke the mold.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.360
But no one could ever know, and that's why.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.360
When virtual reality gets advanced enough,

46:24.360 --> 46:28.360
you will be able to stand in his taint and look around.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.360
This is Rich Little's taint.

46:30.360 --> 46:33.360
That's not a day I look forward to talking about.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.360
What you were speaking of before, I could thrill to,

46:36.360 --> 46:40.360
but you guys travel, ever?

46:40.360 --> 46:41.360
You travel, right?

46:41.360 --> 46:42.360
Yeah, a little bit.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.360
A little bit.

46:43.360 --> 46:45.360
But you don't like traveling much, Dan, do you?

46:45.360 --> 46:47.360
Me and Jeff, I think, are kind of addicted to traveling.

46:47.360 --> 46:55.360
I think with my mouth, and so I've only been out of the English hegemony zone once.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.360
I was in Paris, where they still speak a ton of English.

46:57.360 --> 46:58.360
Of course.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.360
Or at least three pounds of it.

47:00.360 --> 47:05.360
And I was immediately, as I would have predicted, very uncomfortable.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.360
I roll with it.

47:07.360 --> 47:12.360
But the truth is, I'm walking around Paris, and I was like,

47:12.360 --> 47:15.360
I just feel absolutely useless and crippled.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.360
It's my fault, because I never...

47:18.360 --> 47:21.360
I took two years of French, but didn't take...

47:21.360 --> 47:23.360
Oh, no, we all took two years of French.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.360
And never took...

47:24.360 --> 47:27.360
Every other country in the world speaks two languages.

47:27.360 --> 47:32.360
Eiffel Tower looks like a big thing.

47:32.360 --> 47:33.360
Great.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.360
Well, Greg has a great thing.

47:34.360 --> 47:36.360
But I loved Dublin, because they spoke...

47:36.360 --> 47:38.360
Something that I could decipher.

47:38.360 --> 47:39.360
I've learned something from Greg.

47:39.360 --> 47:43.360
Greg and I have traveled around the world a few countries that don't speak English.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.360
And Greg has this great thing.

47:44.360 --> 47:50.360
Greg actually keeps a book with paper in it, and he writes notes down.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.360
And he's a little pages of...

47:52.360 --> 47:53.360
What a cock.

47:53.360 --> 47:54.360
All the...

47:54.360 --> 47:55.360
All the...

47:55.360 --> 47:56.360
He writes down notes.

47:56.360 --> 47:58.360
Paper.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.360
Cast your mind out.

48:02.360 --> 48:08.360
It's a surface that, with the pinch zoom function, disabled.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.360
Speaking of which, Greg and I, you and I,

48:10.360 --> 48:13.360
we were stuck in San Luis Obispo Airport for eight hours.

48:13.360 --> 48:16.360
And this little tiny airport with one plane that didn't show up.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.360
And there was a big...

48:17.360 --> 48:18.360
And there was a fucking...

48:18.360 --> 48:20.360
I think I might have talked about this on the show before,

48:20.360 --> 48:23.360
but there was a toddler walking around and haranguing everybody.

48:23.360 --> 48:25.360
And everybody wanted to murder this child.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.360
But you can't, because you're in an airport in 9-11,

48:27.360 --> 48:28.360
and you're fucking...

48:28.360 --> 48:29.360
You can't...

48:29.360 --> 48:31.360
It's the reason you can't.

48:31.360 --> 48:33.360
The reason you can't is 9-11.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.360
Goddamn that 9-11.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.360
In the old days, you could fucking Patriot Act.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.360
You could smoke on the plane, and you could throttle the child.

48:41.360 --> 48:42.360
Thank you.

48:42.360 --> 48:43.360
Thank you.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.360
They're good old days.

48:44.360 --> 48:46.360
And you got off a fucking Hawaii on the Hawaiian Airlines,

48:46.360 --> 48:48.360
and they gave you a lay, and it was sexy, and it was good.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.360
But now you can't kill a three-year-old.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.360
But the little baby had like a news week,

48:53.360 --> 48:56.360
and there was nothing to do in this plane that wouldn't fucking show.

48:56.360 --> 49:00.360
And there was a baby, and we heard this laughter behind us,

49:00.360 --> 49:03.360
and this toddler was looking at a magazine,

49:03.360 --> 49:05.360
and it was trying to iPad it.

49:05.360 --> 49:06.360
It was trying to swipe.

49:06.360 --> 49:07.360
Wow.

49:07.360 --> 49:11.360
And the baby hadn't mastered page-turning technology.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.360
He couldn't understand why he was moving his hand across a thing,

49:14.360 --> 49:16.360
and the surface wasn't changing the image,

49:16.360 --> 49:21.360
and everybody laughed, and I wanted to just vomit tears.

49:21.360 --> 49:25.360
I mean, to be fair, to be fucking fair, though,

49:25.360 --> 49:26.360
not a single person...

49:26.360 --> 49:27.360
Don't be fair to...

49:27.360 --> 49:28.360
Don't coddle this child, Harmon.

49:28.360 --> 49:33.360
No, just to bring back perspective so that we don't feel like the world is falling apart

49:33.360 --> 49:36.360
because of that, because that makes me feel queasy, too.

49:36.360 --> 49:40.360
But then you have to remember that not a single person in this room...

49:40.360 --> 49:43.360
I say that now, I'm going to make one guy stand up and say,

49:43.360 --> 49:45.360
I know how to do it, but not a single person...

49:45.360 --> 49:46.360
I know how to do it.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.360
Sorry.

49:47.360 --> 49:52.360
Not a single person in this room can make a piece of paper out of a log.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.360
That is technology.

49:54.360 --> 50:00.360
We are as beholden to the guy that invented paper as we are to Steve Jobs' jobs.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.360
Or Job.

50:02.360 --> 50:06.360
The technology...

50:06.360 --> 50:08.360
We build on it, build on it, build on it.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.360
40% of this audience is wearing eyeglasses.

50:10.360 --> 50:14.360
100% of this audience speaks an alphabet that was invented after...

50:14.360 --> 50:17.360
So it's a mimetic society.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.360
It's a genetic one.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.360
Otherwise, we'd be fucking lions or ants.

50:20.360 --> 50:21.360
And so that kid...

50:21.360 --> 50:23.360
Or bees.

50:23.360 --> 50:26.360
That kid that doesn't know how to turn a page and may never turn a page,

50:26.360 --> 50:30.360
he could end up being, you know, president of Earth.

50:30.360 --> 50:34.360
And he did in a futuristic episode I wrote,

50:34.360 --> 50:38.360
and then I had to kill his mother because so he wouldn't be born

50:38.360 --> 50:44.360
in case he made peace that didn't defeat Kim Jong-un.

50:44.360 --> 50:48.360
It's a lot like that Harlan Ellis in the Star Trek episode.

50:48.360 --> 50:54.360
I learned from Greg, we were in Sarajevo.

50:54.360 --> 50:58.360
We were in Yugoslavia or the former Republic of Yugoslavia, whatever the fuck we were.

50:58.360 --> 50:59.360
Fyrom.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.360
That was Macedonia, right?

51:01.360 --> 51:03.360
You guys went to Fyrom?

51:03.360 --> 51:04.360
Fyrom, yeah.

51:04.360 --> 51:07.360
And we went to... God, what was that?

51:07.360 --> 51:09.360
Macedonia was really bad.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.360
Kosovo?

51:10.360 --> 51:11.360
Kosovo, yeah.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.360
Are there citizens of Fyrom called Thyroids?

51:14.360 --> 51:15.360
Yes.

51:15.360 --> 51:19.360
It's Fyrom, the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.360
But Greg has a little piece of paper and he writes it down,

51:21.360 --> 51:22.360
all the pleases and thank yous.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.360
Hello, how do you do?

51:23.360 --> 51:25.360
Sorry, good day.

51:25.360 --> 51:27.360
You write those things down, and you don't have to know everything

51:27.360 --> 51:29.360
when you travel to a foreign place.

51:29.360 --> 51:32.360
If you walk in, you go dobrodon, and they go like...

51:32.360 --> 51:33.360
Dobroverche.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.360
Yeah, and they freak out.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.360
And Greg's like, I use that all the time.

51:38.360 --> 51:41.360
Whenever I go anywhere, I make sure I know how to say all the polite things

51:41.360 --> 51:42.360
that you can walk in.

51:42.360 --> 51:45.360
You learn how to stay, what is it?

51:45.360 --> 51:46.360
Steimer.

51:46.360 --> 51:47.360
Yeah.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.360
Steimer.

51:48.360 --> 51:51.360
I did a show, which means like, what's up, what kind of...

51:51.360 --> 51:52.360
Like, what's happening?

51:52.360 --> 51:53.360
And like...

51:53.360 --> 51:54.360
Correct.

51:54.360 --> 51:55.360
Cerebral creation.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.360
Cerebral creation.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.360
And so I was in Chicago, I did a gig with Luceva Voom,

51:59.360 --> 52:01.360
and I met some people and they took me to a club

52:01.360 --> 52:05.360
and it was run by these giant Eastern European guys

52:05.360 --> 52:07.360
who hated my guts on site.

52:07.360 --> 52:09.360
I went with this girl who they knew

52:09.360 --> 52:11.360
and they didn't like me at all, but they were...

52:11.360 --> 52:14.360
They were like six, seven, a giant hockey player looking dudes

52:14.360 --> 52:16.360
in suits, and they wanted to murder me.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.360
And they were either Serbian or Croatian,

52:18.360 --> 52:20.360
but you can't guess wrong on that one.

52:20.360 --> 52:23.360
Like, if you think about an option.

52:23.360 --> 52:26.360
Yeah, if you think like, guessing wrong on Kiwi versus Ozzy,

52:26.360 --> 52:27.360
like, that's not...

52:27.360 --> 52:28.360
No.

52:28.360 --> 52:31.360
You know, Japanese and Chinese, they love that.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
Yeah.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.360
They're like, no, no, you got it wrong.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.360
Same difference.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.360
Yeah.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.360
These guys hated my guts, they were giants,

52:38.360 --> 52:40.360
and they just were like, just glowering at me,

52:40.360 --> 52:43.360
and I went up to one of them,

52:43.360 --> 52:45.360
and they wouldn't let me buy a drink,

52:45.360 --> 52:46.360
they wanted me out of there,

52:46.360 --> 52:47.360
and it was really like,

52:47.360 --> 52:48.360
they were being really hostile and strange,

52:48.360 --> 52:51.360
and I said, are you Croatian?

52:51.360 --> 52:52.360
Just guessed.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
Do you know what?

52:53.360 --> 52:55.360
I had a 50-50 and he goes,

52:55.360 --> 52:57.360
I mean, assuming I was even right about that,

52:57.360 --> 52:59.360
because his name was like Draco.

52:59.360 --> 53:00.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
Yeah, something like that.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.360
Gragula, yeah.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.360
I will bury you.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.360
His name was Milo, or something like that.

53:06.360 --> 53:07.360
I said, are you Croatian?

53:07.360 --> 53:09.360
He goes, big, long pause.

53:09.360 --> 53:10.360
It felt like about a minute.

53:10.360 --> 53:13.360
And he was like, yes.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.360
And I went, because of Greg,

53:15.360 --> 53:17.360
I went, Steimer.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.360
And he goes, what the fuck?

53:20.360 --> 53:22.360
Because of who?

53:22.360 --> 53:23.360
What does it mean?

53:23.360 --> 53:25.360
You know what your answer to Steimer is?

53:25.360 --> 53:26.360
Niste speciale.

53:26.360 --> 53:27.360
Niste speciale.

53:27.360 --> 53:28.360
Nothing special?

53:28.360 --> 53:29.360
Nothing special, man.

53:29.360 --> 53:31.360
Are you saying you learned how to say no worries, bro?

53:31.360 --> 53:33.360
Yes, yes.

53:33.360 --> 53:35.360
He went over to his buddies,

53:35.360 --> 53:37.360
and he goes, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

53:37.360 --> 53:40.360
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

53:40.360 --> 53:43.360
I could not get my wallet out of my pocket.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.360
They would not let me leave the club.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.360
Drinks were on them for the rest of the night.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.360
They took your wallet out of your pocket?

53:49.360 --> 53:51.360
No, no, they wouldn't let me get my wallet out of my pocket.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.360
Oh, okay.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.360
They pulled my pants down.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.360
They put their penises in my asshole.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.360
I had the, I mean,

53:58.360 --> 54:00.360
Long story short, the next morning,

54:00.360 --> 54:01.360
Naked with nothing to worry about.

54:01.360 --> 54:03.360
They were such friendly racists.

54:03.360 --> 54:05.360
Long story short,

54:05.360 --> 54:07.360
they fucked me into the dirt.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.360
That's what we learned in Game of Thrones, yeah.

54:09.360 --> 54:11.360
Oh, fuck you into the dirt.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.360
Oh, fuck you into the dirt.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.360
That episode almost went fucking wow.

54:15.360 --> 54:17.360
You know who we do to runners, don't you?

54:17.360 --> 54:19.360
No, I don't.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.360
Tell me. You bring them back.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.360
I said, fuck you into dirt.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.360
What the hell? What?

54:25.360 --> 54:27.360
No, not fuck you into dirt.

54:27.360 --> 54:29.360
We're going to fuck you into the dirt.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.360
They're not going to make you dirt.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.360
I missed this episode. What is that?

54:33.360 --> 54:35.360
That was two episodes ago.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.360
Did you watch Game of Thrones? No.

54:37.360 --> 54:39.360
Oh, fuck man. Do they fuck people into dirt?

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
No, they didn't.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.360
But they threatened to fuck a guy into the dirt.

54:43.360 --> 54:45.360
Spoilers, this is two episodes ago.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.360
But yeah, then a guy came along

54:47.360 --> 54:49.360
and shot a bunch of dudes with arrows.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.360
But at one point, I'm going to fuck you into the dirt.

54:51.360 --> 54:53.360
What? Jesus.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.360
That's saying a lot.

54:55.360 --> 54:57.360
But don't say too much, because there are some people

54:57.360 --> 54:59.360
that will be a couple episodes behind.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.360
But I swear to God, like,

55:01.360 --> 55:03.360
I fucking went into...

55:03.360 --> 55:05.360
Did we talk about this in the show?

55:05.360 --> 55:07.360
Greg and I were doing a gig at a casino.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.360
And I'm wandering around in the daytime.

55:09.360 --> 55:11.360
The show is not until night.

55:11.360 --> 55:13.360
I walked by and there's Greg sitting at a slot machine.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.360
And he's sitting there like a little old lady.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.360
His legs are crossed.

55:17.360 --> 55:19.360
He's been there for a while.

55:19.360 --> 55:21.360
And it was the sex in the city slot machine.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.360
Oh, yeah.

55:23.360 --> 55:25.360
And I almost disowned you as a friend.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.360
I'm not gay.

55:27.360 --> 55:29.360
I'm not gay.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.360
I'm not gay.

55:31.360 --> 55:33.360
And I make no case for it.

55:33.360 --> 55:35.360
It was the best slot machine.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.360
I won a couple hundred off that fucker, too.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.360
They'd go like...

55:43.360 --> 55:45.360
Samantha has to pick a pair of shoes.

55:45.360 --> 55:47.360
No.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.360
And then, like, which shoes will it be?

55:49.360 --> 55:51.360
And I'm like, oh, God, the pumps

55:51.360 --> 55:53.360
or the fucking sling box.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.360
Oh, shit.

55:55.360 --> 55:57.360
Sling box.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.360
And then Mr. Big would go...

55:59.360 --> 56:01.360
Nice choice.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.360
All right, wait.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.360
Let's get Spencer up here

56:13.360 --> 56:15.360
and play some Dungeons & Dragons.

56:15.360 --> 56:17.360
Spencer Crinton and...

56:19.360 --> 56:21.360
Summon yourself.

56:23.360 --> 56:25.360
Spencer, baby.

56:25.360 --> 56:27.360
Dungeon Master to the stars.

56:29.360 --> 56:31.360
There's no chair.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.360
I'll stand. I'll sit.

56:33.360 --> 56:35.360
He walks to the black table,

56:35.360 --> 56:37.360
his beard wagging,

56:37.360 --> 56:39.360
his community t-shirt making Dan Harmon

56:39.360 --> 56:41.360
feel sad.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.360
That's not a joke.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.360
I can't wear blue shirts to work,

56:47.360 --> 56:49.360
because when I'm leaving, people will be like,

56:49.360 --> 56:51.360
help me, and I'm like, no.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.360
He works at the Apple Store.

56:53.360 --> 56:55.360
But isn't that your fantasy

56:55.360 --> 56:57.360
as a back rumor?

56:57.360 --> 56:59.360
No, because they'd still be mistaken

56:59.360 --> 57:01.360
and then they'd be like, oh, that guy didn't help.

57:01.360 --> 57:03.360
Oh, man.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.360
When I worked in food service,

57:05.360 --> 57:07.360
I worked in the dishroom, and then they promoted me

57:07.360 --> 57:09.360
to work the front line of the rehab center

57:09.360 --> 57:11.360
where I was doing dishes.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.360
And I...

57:13.360 --> 57:15.360
My raise was a quarter an hour.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.360
And after a week,

57:17.360 --> 57:19.360
I went to the manager and I said,

57:19.360 --> 57:21.360
I want to wash dishes again.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.360
I can't...

57:23.360 --> 57:25.360
I can't deal with the people.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.360
That was my whole thing, yeah.

57:27.360 --> 57:29.360
I thought it was going to be a dream,

57:29.360 --> 57:31.360
like, oh, instead of washing the dishes,

57:31.360 --> 57:33.360
I get to make the dishes dirty.

57:33.360 --> 57:35.360
I get to put their mashed potatoes on the plate.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.360
But you have to talk to the people.

57:37.360 --> 57:39.360
Their psychological dishes were not done.

57:41.360 --> 57:43.360
And if you would point that out,

57:43.360 --> 57:45.360
a counselor would say, that's inappropriate.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.360
It's not inappropriate,

57:47.360 --> 57:49.360
and you don't have a psychology degree.

57:49.360 --> 57:51.360
You have a counselor at a private rehab center

57:51.360 --> 57:53.360
that's draining insurance money.

57:53.360 --> 57:55.360
And then you're sending anorexics home.

57:55.360 --> 57:57.360
I've been putting polycos in their apple juice

57:57.360 --> 57:59.360
for six months,

57:59.360 --> 58:01.360
and their insurance ran out.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.360
They're walking home a human skeleton.

58:03.360 --> 58:05.360
It's a fattener

58:05.360 --> 58:07.360
that they use to keep anorexics from dying

58:07.360 --> 58:09.360
while they suck their bank accounts dry.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.360
Wow.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.360
Anyways, I'm going to write a letter

58:13.360 --> 58:15.360
to a 1993 senator.

58:15.360 --> 58:17.360
That's good.

58:17.360 --> 58:19.360
Shut that place down again.

58:19.360 --> 58:21.360
Why don't you write a movie like Upton Sinclair that shit

58:21.360 --> 58:23.360
if I can blow the lid off?

58:23.360 --> 58:25.360
Because I'm sure that everything's changed now.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.360
Did the anorexics know that you're putting this

58:27.360 --> 58:29.360
into their apple juice?

58:29.360 --> 58:31.360
No, they did not, sir. No, they did not.

58:31.360 --> 58:33.360
Instead of polyglots, I eat a lot of racist pieces.

58:37.360 --> 58:39.360
Sometimes Oreo bits.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.360
I was in charge of...

58:41.360 --> 58:43.360
I would have to watch the people

58:43.360 --> 58:45.360
from the anorexic unit

58:45.360 --> 58:47.360
because they had an open cafeteria

58:47.360 --> 58:49.360
that would hide their jello

58:49.360 --> 58:51.360
behind the juice machine.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.360
And I had to go.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.360
It was an 18-year-old pimply-faced guy

58:55.360 --> 58:57.360
with a rat tail.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.360
I was in charge of going,

58:59.360 --> 59:01.360
hey, Veronica, come on, hey.

59:01.360 --> 59:03.360
Saiya, put your jello behind the...

59:03.360 --> 59:05.360
I don't put my jello behind the thing.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.360
Hey, come on.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.360
I'm making $3.75 an hour.

59:09.360 --> 59:11.360
Which was a raise from the $3.50 an hour

59:11.360 --> 59:13.360
that I raced back to

59:13.360 --> 59:15.360
after one week on the line,

59:15.360 --> 59:17.360
as we called it.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.360
But they drink the apple...

59:19.360 --> 59:21.360
Is that a thing where they would drink

59:21.360 --> 59:23.360
the anorexics love apple juice?

59:23.360 --> 59:25.360
They think it's just apple juice.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.360
I'm dumping like fucking like

59:27.360 --> 59:29.360
liquid turkey stuffing in it.

59:29.360 --> 59:31.360
Invisible, odorless, flavorless,

59:31.360 --> 59:33.360
a caloric booster in it.

59:33.360 --> 59:35.360
Which is their nightmare.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.360
It's like curing a

59:37.360 --> 59:39.360
conspiracy theorist by

59:39.360 --> 59:43.360
getting together with the government.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.360
It's not...

59:45.360 --> 59:47.360
It can't be healthy.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.360
It's their fantasy come true.

59:49.360 --> 59:51.360
If they find out...

59:51.360 --> 59:53.360
Because I was like, do they know

59:53.360 --> 59:55.360
we're putting fucking fat

59:55.360 --> 59:57.360
in their apple juice

59:57.360 --> 59:59.360
to keep their bodies from dying

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.360
while you have them draw pictures of themselves

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.360
in finger paint?

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.360
No, they don't, and we'd really appreciate it if you...

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.360
Keep a lid on that, like you keep a lid

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.360
on the mayonnaise.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.360
You minimum wage

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.360
to food service worker.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.360
Thanks for helping us with people's brains

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.360
for our living.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.360
Let's play some D&D.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.360
Yeah!

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.360
How you been, Spencer?

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.360
How am I...

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.360
What's new in crittendome?

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.360
Crittendome.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.360
I don't know, man.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.360
Um...

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.360
Nothing?

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.360
We started playing.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.360
We started an actual D&D campaign

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.360
at Dan's crib.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.360
Yeah.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.360
Non-televised, non-podcasted.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.360
I'm very excited about it.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.360
I wore a little costume last time

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.360
and no one else did.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.360
Turns out you're not supposed to wear a costume to...

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.360
Yeah, you are.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.360
You, yes, please keep doing it.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.360
My costume is on a rack

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.360
and on a hanger for tomorrow night

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360
and it's going to be...

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.360
I went into a thrift store

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.360
because I went to go buy a little...

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.360
I went to a stationery store

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.360
because I wanted like a little notebook

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.360
so I walked in there and it was kind of a nerdy dude

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.360
working at the mailboxes

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.360
whatever the place was.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.360
I go, do you have any blank books or journals?

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.360
Yeah, we got some over here, we got some over there.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.360
I go, I'm looking for one...

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.360
D&D, you just write this way.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.360
And I was like, oh,

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.360
that's the jazz right there.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.360
And then, so we're talking about this

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.360
and I got some Post-it notes

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.360
and I got my little folder to put my character sheet in.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360
I was very excited about it.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.360
It felt like the first day of school.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.360
And next door to the place is a thrift store

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.360
and I went to the ladies section.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.360
It turns out you can get a nice little

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.360
halfling rogue costume in there.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.360
I came out and nobody wanted to help me.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.360
They were so bummed out.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.360
I told all the hipster girls

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.360
and they were like, oh look, I'm playing D&D

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.360
and I'm a halfling rogue

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.360
and I'd like something maybe like a little

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.360
vest or like they didn't give a shit.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.360
But then I came out in my outfit and they were like,

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.360
that's the stuff.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.360
Are you going to dress up?

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.360
Yes, anything to support this gateway

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.360
that you're going through.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.360
I want you to

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.360
end up where you want to end up

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.360
if you need me to...

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.360
I want to dress up too.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.360
I was at your place half way before you came home

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.360
and you were at the table rolling dice

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.360
and looking at your book and doing stuff

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.360
and we'd spoken a few times before you realized

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.360
that I was wearing a costume.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.360
Yeah, I mean you were...

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.360
Let's get Erin out here

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.360
and...

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.360
Erin McGathy to the stage.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.360
Erin McGathy.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:57.360
The return of Mulrainee Sidhanna.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.360
I'm glad you could take your time

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.360
out of your busy cake making schedule.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.360
I was talking about a cake making with Danielle.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.360
I almost couldn't be bothered

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.360
to come out because I was talking about my cake tip.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.360
I made a cake for Duncan

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.360
for his birthday. It was amazing.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.360
I've been eating it by myself

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.360
in my house.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.360
Just scooping big chunks

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.360
of chocolate cake

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.360
and watching...

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.360
birds.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.360
But it was delicious.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.360
How long does it take to make a cake like that?

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.360
Four days.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.360
No, not really.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.360
I love it.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.360
Well, I've learned how to multi-task.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.360
So it takes

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.360
30 minutes

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.360
for the cake to bake in the oven

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.360
and it takes about 4 minutes for me to mix.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.360
I use a mix. I use a box.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.360
Well, I never said it otherwise.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.360
I'm just doing it because

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.360
I like decorating my cake.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.360
We have

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.360
Thrones Night at my place,

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:57.360
our place, every

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.360
week.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.360
We're three weeks in a row

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.360
and you started with a Dinklage that looked like Cobain.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.360
Then it was a

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.360
Jon Snow that looked a lot like Jon Snow.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.360
And last night

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.360
your Game of Thrones cake

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.360
had the...

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Daenerys.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.360
Look, man.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.360
You're getting...

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.360
I bought some fondant.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.360
Who loves fondant?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.360
Where for fondant?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.360
What is fondant?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.360
Fondant is

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.360
sugar clay. It's clay made out of sugar.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.360
It's a hagiographic

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.360
suitcase.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.360
You give it to anorexics.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.360
And they

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.360
don't know they're being fed it.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.360
All right, Dan, will you dispense

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.360
the character sheets?

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.360
I would be glad to. Thank you, sir.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.360
Tonight, Duncan will be portraying

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.360
Kumail's character, Chris de Burgh.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.360
Yeah, you're Chris de Burgh. You wrote the song Lady in Red

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.360
and performed it. Okay.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.360
He's a human rogue, thief? What does he, Spencer?

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.360
He's a human rogue.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.360
Spencer, I love when you're in character.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.360
Yeah.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.360
The thing is...

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.360
The thing nobody realizes is I'm

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360
always a character. You are.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.360
I just switch it up.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.360
It's not funny. It's not meant

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.360
to be funny. That's the honest truth.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.360
Again, not funny.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.360
Thank you.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.360
That time it was funny.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.360
When you start dungeon mastering, you don't

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.360
become a different Spencer. You just become

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.360
a more resident.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.360
You become a little bit more mellifluous.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.360
Yes, I do.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Can I carve

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.360
a message into my skin for Kumail

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.360
the next time?

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.360
Yeah, do it.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.360
Fuck with him for sure.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.360
Great.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.360
I mean, there's a lot of

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.360
whatever.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.360
It's like phone jacking.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.360
This is great.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.360
Whatever Aaron's not here, Jeff fucks

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.360
something that Aaron owns.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.360
It happened one time.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.360
Last time I fucked and murdered a spider.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.360
That was fucking weird.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.360
I mean, as I

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.360
listened to that, it was like that was as weird

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.360
as I remembered it.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.360
A guy

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.360
turned into a spider.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.360
It was my fault, but

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.360
and we

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360
brutalized it out of self-defense

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.360
slash.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.360
It attacked us.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.360
You guys kept trying to bring it back to life

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.360
and make friends with it.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.360
And you

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.360
had, I put a blanket over it's head

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.360
because I thought we were going to have

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.360
kill it and I was like, I'm sorry

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.360
we did this to you.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.360
You had sex with it and whispered in

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.360
its ear

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.360
we're going to let you live.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.360
But he did that while the spider

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360
was asleep.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.360
But there were some

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.360
circuitous conditional statement.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360
We're going to let you live, but I'm going to fuck you every night.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360
I'm going to fuck you every night.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.360
And then you killed it.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.360
Look, you're like Ted Bundy.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.360
I was putting

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.360
it was a commentary

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.360
on the chaos

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.360
that preceded that.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.360
It was a commentary on the

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360
we kept hurting it and then trying to save it

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.360
and trying to save it. So I

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.360
fucked it, told it I was going to fuck it forever.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.360
Are we actually playing now?

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.360
I mean, you can call it a commentary.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.360
You became the BTK

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.360
killer.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.360
I'm a barbarian.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.360
I'm a barbarian, Dan.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.360
I'm a barbarian, Dan.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.360
I'm whimsical.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.360
All right.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360
Spencer, if you would, get us up to speed.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360
When we last met

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.360
our heroes were following

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.360
the mysterious wanderer Breffi

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.360
into a web slung stand of black

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360
pillars on the mysterious

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.360
and dark shadow plane.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.360
Immediately after fleeing a forest fire

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.360
set off by Sharpie's Fireball

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.360
the wizard

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.360
blasted the new webby obstacle

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.360
the shreds with the second fireball.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.360
Upon doing this

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.360
Breffi fell to his knees and began

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.360
shape-shifting into a monstrosity.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.360
After a brief discussion

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.360
the gang left into action.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.360
Mulraine fired arrows and quarked

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360
detached three limbs with a single critical strike.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.360
Then a monkey was summoned

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360
or a fiendish ape or something.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.360
Christopher sued the savage Breffi

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.360
who surrendered rather anticlimactically.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360
Feeling the intense bloodlust from the

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360
unsatisfying and peaceful end of combat

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360
the barbarian expressed himself in the only way he could.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.360
Violence and sexual devious.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.360
After promising the clearly unconscious

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.360
shape-shifter his life would be spared

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.360
quark drove his sword directly through the spider skull

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.360
mid-coitus

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.360
bringing an end to his miserable, tormented life.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.360
But with their guide

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.360
and the only ally they had on the

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.360
shadow plane murdered

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360
how would they recover their shadows and return home?

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.360
Spencer!

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.360
Yes!

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.360
Shit.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360
I stand by my actions.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.360
I stand by my actions.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.360
You were only cleaning up a mess I made.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.360
I experienced the, you know,

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.360
I was feeling like we had been moving too slowly

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.360
like I started casting

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360
fireball everywhere.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:21.360
Yeah, you were willy-nilly.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.360
It made sense given the circumstances.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.360
You wouldn't have known.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.360
You know, you were trying to make momentum.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.360
I don't know.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.360
Whatever.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.360
Okay, so well, what's the state of affairs

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.360
around us right now?

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Well, right now I should at first mention

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.360
Sharpie, you're out of level three spells.

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:41.360
So you have level one and two spells left

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.360
but you have to like sleep a whole night

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.360
before you regain your level three spells.

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360
But I'm level five. That's true.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.360
Level five spells?

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360
No, it's weird. It's like, you're weird.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360
I would never deny that.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:57.360
The answer to your question, Greg, is never.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360
What?

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360
I said the answer to your question is never.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.360
Thank you.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.360
There's only two answers.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360
If you're in the Navy and two, never.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360
That was one of those moments where no one else

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360
was thinking the same thing you were.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.360
Well, because you asked when we were starting

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.360
and you were unhappy.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.360
No, I'm not unhappy at all. I'm ecstatic.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.360
Oh, did you have a heart out? Did you need to go?

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.360
No.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.360
I had a door to smoke some pot, but we'll wait.

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.360
Me too.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360
Thank you.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.360
If we had a vaporizer, we could do it right indoors.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360
Great.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.360
Thanks to the young woman who played

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360
Mollering last week. It was great.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.360
She fired two arrows.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.360
Hi, how are you?

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.360
Good, all right.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360
Thank you for having me.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.360
Thank you for having me.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.360
She fired two arrows and...

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.360
Correct.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.360
All right, Spencer, I examine the surroundings.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360
Standing in the burned ruins of the ebb and thicket,

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.360
you survey your surroundings.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360
The burned webs are slick and shiny on the remains

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.360
of the crumbled pillars burnt by spent fireballs.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.360
You've created a pretty large clearing

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360
from all the fire,

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360
and where before was a large

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.360
vision obscuring barrier of weapons.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.360
Webbing, you can now see clearly.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.360
And through the graph,

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360
through the gap, you can see

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.360
a ripply waving mass

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.360
far off in the distance.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360
But to the south, you hear the approaching of hooves.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.360
Oh, shit.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.360
Boom, boom, boom.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.360
Ah!

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360
Ah!

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.360
Ah!

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.360
What? Tylenol with codeine?

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.360
What are you doing here?

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:41.360
Ah!

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.360
Ah!

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:47.360
Why the flaming balls

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.360
of Kathy Lee Gifford?

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.360
Once again, I find

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.360
myself in your company

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.360
for my entire forest has been

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.360
decimated,

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.360
burneted to the ground, says I.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.360
What villains are

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.360
these who would come to my homeland?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.360
The place where I was folid,

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.360
the place where my horn did

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.360
grow.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.360
I am, of course, a unicorn

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.360
and therefore immortal, but the place

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360
where I did once stride upon

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.360
my four legs

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.360
unbelievably

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.360
has now been

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360
rendered useless, and I find myself

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.360
in another dimension.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.360
This one with you,

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360
greetings, hail,

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:35.360
and salutations, says I.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360
Word up!

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.360
Yo, pretty ladies,

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.360
around the world,

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.360
I see that thou art gathered,

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.360
and thou art still as ugly

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.360
and hunched as I remember,

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.360
whilst I remain beautiful,

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.360
pristine white

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.360
with a golden horn

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360
that's spiraled toward the heaven.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.360
Tellin' em,

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360
how come ye to the shadow plain?

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.360
The shadow place I must cometh to,

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.360
in order that the place

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.360
where I am frometh

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.360
is burned fucketh down.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.360
I feel like,

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.360
I feel like I might have done that.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.360
To be serious?

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.360
It was an ascident.

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.360
Thou art my brother, did we not swear?

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360
I swore, I didn't.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360
We're on a shadow plain.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360
I think I cast fireball,

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.360
and I think things we do here

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.360
may affect other places.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.360
I made a poo-poo.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.360
Surely, twas not, malfeasance on thine part?

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.360
I...

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.360
I...

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.360
You will find

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.360
that within a unicorn

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.360
with two things, one,

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.360
a member extravagant and wild,

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.360
and two, a heart that

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.360
encompasseth all.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.360
Forgiveness I bestow upon

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.360
all of thee, for destroying the land

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.360
I am from.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.360
Thank you.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.360
Tellin' em, we've lost our shadows.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.360
Our shadows were ripped apart from us,

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.360
and they ran off into the middle darkness.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:21.360
The fuck thou say?

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.360
The fuck, the fuck I don't say.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360
Shadows not have thee?

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360
No, we're in the shadow plain.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.360
They up and ran.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.360
Inconvenient most I find this.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.360
Even in the brightness of thine noon day,

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.360
find thou no shadow

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.360
to follow thee upon the ground.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.360
No.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:43.360
Guys, I don't feel good.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.360
I don't feel...

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.360
I don't feel like myself right now.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.360
Christopher, what is it?

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.360
I don't know, I just... I don't really...

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.360
I think I have some form of amnesia,

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.360
perhaps in this battle,

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.360
something happened to me, because I have this

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360
compulsion at this moment

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360
to start slicing off

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.360
my own fingers.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.360
Oh my god.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.360
Don't do it.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.360
Oh, Jolie of Angelina from the 90s.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.360
Thou art but a cutter.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360
Yes, it's cutting, you know?

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.360
I just... I want to carve...

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.360
I mean, I'm just going to show you guys,

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.360
I can't get this thought out of my mind.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360
I'm just going to carve it into my arm,

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.360
and then we'll get back to finding our shadows.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360
So I pull out my dagger,

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.360
wipe the poison off,

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.360
and I carve into my arm.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360
Wipe that poison, dagger.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.360
I go,

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360
I go,

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.360
I carve into my arm.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360
Something very strange

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.360
that doesn't make sense, probably,

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.360
to any of us.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.360
I carve into my arm.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.360
How can you have a video game podcast

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.360
and not play

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.360
Starcraft 2?

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.360
Wow.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.360
Wow.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.360
That's some strange cryptic...

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.360
I don't know what it means.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.360
I just wanted to do it.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.360
Perochild, I vent.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360
I have horn plus 11,

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.360
and 1d8 plus 10 damage.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360
Can I help in that respect?

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360
You could stab him with your horn.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.360
It wouldn't help, it would hurt.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.360
Stab me with your horn, unicorn!

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.360
Since Thou demanded that,

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.360
shall I yes?

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.360
Snorf...

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.360
Snorf is the noise that make it

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.360
when my horn doth stab it then to thine.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.360
No!

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.360
Sharp!

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.360
It's somehow satisfying.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.360
Honing for many days, have I been?

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Me too.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.360
Chris, may I offer up

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360
my bedroll and some flint and steel,

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.360
so you may write a note?

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.360
No, I already carved it into my arm.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.360
It's there, I could use a bandage.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.360
I'm bleeding a little bit,

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.360
but it's there. I think it's going to scar permanently.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.360
That's on me permanently.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.360
You guys, stop!

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.360
This shadow plane is driving us insane.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.360
Spencer, how far off is that shimmering, wavy

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.360
thing up ahead?

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360
It's about 50 feet away.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360
There's a couple pillars in front of it

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.360
obscuring it, but it's mostly

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.360
in plain view.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.360
I hop a stride Tylenol with codeine,

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.360
and I say, on Tylenol to the shimmery mouth.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.360
Oh, barbarian, Thou hast mounted me once again.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.360
And fulfill, do I feel,

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.360
prance, prance, toward the light,

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360
do I thigh?

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.360
Follow closely, shall ye,

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.360
even you with moderate wounds,

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360
that I shall heal, because I have the power.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.360
Don't heal, don't heal, doesn't need healing.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.360
Okay, fuck it.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360
Needs no healing, go kind,

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.360
unicorn, will you?

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.360
Oh, thou masochist lie, we'll let

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360
thy wallow in thy pain.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.360
Skip, skip, and prance,

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.360
and here we are.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.360
You head towards the

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.360
undulating black barrier.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.360
It wavers and ripples slowly,

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.360
like a massive black ooze.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.360
I'll say.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.360
But appears to be the sh-

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.360
Steady boy, steady.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360
Steady.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.360
But appears to be in the shape of a

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.360
massive iron, or a wrought iron fence

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360
made out of thick, shifting shadows.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.360
I shove my arm in it.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.360
You shove your arm in it.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.360
Sweet Maria!

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.360
Oh!

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.360
Your arm, like, into the shadow part,

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.360
or the space between the shadow part?

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.360
Well, now I feel bad, I don't do it.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.360
No, do it, just follow your arm.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.360
I shove my arm into the shadow part.

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.360
You shove your arm into the shadow part,

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.360
and it strikes with a clang,

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.360
like metal.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.360
It's metal.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360
It appears that, or it sounds that way,

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.360
it doesn't appear that way, it appears like shadows.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.360
I shove my arm in three times,

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.360
and it goes clang, clang, clang.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.360
With a trolley

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.360
ding, ding, ding,

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.360
with a bell.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.360
Zing, zing, zing.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.360
Easy tellin' all, easy boy.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.360
Not gay am I, but

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.360
case not, I make for it.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.360
Silently, you see

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.360
what appears to be

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360
several black tendrils shooting out of the ground

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.360
beneath the wall.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.360
They connect

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.360
with your feet and wrap up your arms

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360
and legs, and you feel yourself

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360
bound, you and Chris de Burgh.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.360
Who and Chris de Burgh?

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.360
Quark and Chris de Burgh, the ones who

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.360
shoved their hands through the fence there.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.360
Ah, I'm trapped! Just kill me, unicorn!

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.360
Can't I use my dodge ability

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.360
to get away from that? Not in this case,

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.360
because you were like reaching into it.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.360
Don't I have any power in this instance?

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.360
You could

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.360
stab someone with your horn.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.360
Um, although shadows

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360
that doff

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360
beleaguered my friends,

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.360
shall I

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.360
point my fuckin' horn out?

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.360
Scrunch, scrunch.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.360
Take that, oh,

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.360
shadow.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:11.360
And fuck it off into the night, thee.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.360
You strike the shadow,

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.360
but it does not waver. What the fuck?

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360
Fuck!

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.360
Bad unicorn luck dot.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.360
So, Mulraine and Sharpie are seeing this

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.360
happen, you know, about 30 feet away.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.360
Sharpie? Yeah, right.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360
Appli Pauley Lodge is?

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.360
Is Coco a shadow still?

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360
Is she in a nearby? Yeah, Coco's still shadow Coco.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360
You're with her.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.360
Coco's her horse, Greg. Does Coco feel

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.360
jealous

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.360
of Tylenol Coding?

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.360
Just paying Coding a lot of attention.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.360
Oh, well, I mean,

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.360
yeah.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.360
But, but you wouldn't be able to know

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.360
by looking at it. Coco's my horse.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.360
And I, yeah, and I, I, I fucked her

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360
horse once or twice. He, he raped my horse.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.360
Yeah, she's, to be sure.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.360
All right, so it's a,

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.360
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.360
fence shaped thing that's like shadowy.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.360
It's like a shadowy fence, and I was

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.360
at the bottom of it. Well, I mean, you

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.360
haven't. Is it, how high is it?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.360
It's 30 feet tall. There's a large

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.360
gate set in it.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.360
Yeah. But if I touch it, there's going to be

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.360
tendrils on me. I mean, you don't know

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.360
that for sure. You didn't say that.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.360
Is, is this a time for the rope tracker?

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.360
What's up? Is this a good time for my

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360
rope tracker? Well, they are, it is a

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360
visible fence. Oh, I see.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.360
I'll tell you what it's time for.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.360
Um,

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.360
will soon be a new favorite among my spell

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.360
things.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.360
Well, wait, you said I have

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.360
no level three spells. No level three

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.360
spells? Yeah, man, you run out of spells

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360
sometimes.

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.360
I, I, I motion, I motion to sleep for

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.360
eight hours. Sorry, what?

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.360
I'm sorry. I, I motion to Sharpie

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.360
to ride over to the fence

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.360
on Coco. What do I have left?

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.360
You have all your level one and two spells,

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.360
just not the level threes.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.360
You get three of those per

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360
day. Perhaps the

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360
shadow rope is susceptible

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360
to blood. I bite

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.360
my own tongue and

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.360
and spit

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.360
the blood at the shadow

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.360
rope. Does, does it affect it at all?

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.360
Awesome thinking.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.360
For those of you keeping track at home,

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.360
Christopher is now inflicted 18

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.360
points of damage on himself.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.360
How many does he have left?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.360
Wait, I don't want to die.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.360
I would like to formally thank again

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:27.360
the young woman who played me last week.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.360
I, I however can cure moderate

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.360
wounds. Don't bother.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360
There are other things to worry about.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.360
Don't kill Kamal's character. I'm not

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.360
going to kill him. I'm just going to

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.360
drain him a bit.

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.360
I've got

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.360
50 hit points. There's plenty

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.360
left to spare. Alright, fuck it.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.360
I, I seem to

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360
Sorry.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.360
Yeah.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.360
I love it. That's a romantic comedy.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.360
I

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.360
I

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.360
I seem to have found a spell

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.360
under level one called

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.360
Ha, jump, jump,

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.360
jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.360
Hey, casting jump, your legs are

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.360
wrapping around my neck. Over 30 feet

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.360
of fence.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.360
Go ahead and jump.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.360
Right. Over 30 feet of fence.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.360
Over 30 feet of fence.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.360
I see you 30 feet of fences.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360
That ain't really, that ain't right on me.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360
Oh,

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.360
And it doesn't matter that you

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:35.000
You bribe me with spells from level three!

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.680
Howl, cause I'm gonna cast jump!

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.680
Jump!

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.840
Might as well jump!

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.840
Jump!

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.320
Over the fence!

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.320
Sing, sing, sing with my heartstrings!

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:54.480
From the moment I met him, I fell, he said, alone.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.960
Oh, yeah, that happens.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.280
You jump over the fence.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.680
You're now on the other side of the fence.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.680
Yow!

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.800
Sharpie, can you hear me?

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.800
Yow!

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:14.440
Can you disentangle me and Chris de Burgh from these shadow tendrils?

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.440
You don't have to disentangle me, I'll just stay here, you guys go ahead.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.200
Lady in red!

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:29.120
Well I don't, I'm hoping that from the other side I can get the gate open.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.120
Oh I see, okay.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.520
I didn't want to touch it from the other side, yeah, good idea.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520
Get to work, Jack.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.520
What were you gonna do there, Mulrainee?

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.960
I was going to take my sack.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.520
I detest when anyone even nibbles at my sack.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520
Steady.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:57.280
I was gonna take my sack and loop through some of my rope and create a shadow gate

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.280
retriever.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280
Okay.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.560
Which does?

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.000
It gets anyone out of any kind of gate.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.800
And I throw it at Chris.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.160
I also say, Chris, can I have some of your stuff?

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.840
Yeah, what do you want?

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.240
Yeah, sure, I got, let's see, hold on.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.880
You know what, just take it all, you just take it all.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.000
It seems like I've got a, hold on a second, these, I'm sick of you.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.080
You said you were gonna weaken him, not give away all your shit.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:32.920
This week, that's, I'm gonna give you, pick one thing, pick, the unicorn is sensitive,

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.920
pick one thing.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.760
Of course I'm sensitive, I'm a unicorn.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.440
You don't want any of my stuff?

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.840
You don't want any of my stuff, Cody?

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:48.200
I need, nothing need I, I am completed every moment.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:54.160
I throw my sack over, over Chris.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.920
It lands over Chris.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:03.200
And I yank him out, I try, I attempt to yank him out.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200
Fuck howdy.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:09.760
Let's see here, that's a weird thing to have happen.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.920
His neck doesn't snap.

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.360
The bag slides off his head and you know, it doesn't, nothing happens.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.520
I'm sharpie, so are you at the gate, right?

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.200
Yeah, I go to that gate.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.520
So now, and I was thinking of casting knock, but I can't tell, because I think I lost one

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.520
of my spell sheets.

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.800
Yeah, I must have lost it.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.760
I can't tell if knock is a level two spell.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.600
Knock's a level two, two spell.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.200
Okay, I was gonna try to cast knock on it without touching it.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.680
I don't want to touch this stuff.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.080
Was it knock open?

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.520
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:50.400
With a loud knocking sound, knocking, with a loud sound, the gate is blasted open.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.600
Immediately, your binds are dissolved and you can free your limbs again.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.320
Thank God.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.640
But you hear a sound behind you, Sharpie, coming out of the, you know, the sound behind

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640
you.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.120
Words, words are a thing.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.760
I turn around and examine my surrounded bit behind me.

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.960
You see six shadowy humanoids approaching.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.960
Uh oh.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.080
Oh, I hold my hand up in friendly greeting.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.400
One of them holds their hand up.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.920
It appears to be the shape of a blade.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.920
Wait what?

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.280
One of them holds their hand up.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.840
It appears to be the shape of her blade.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.120
One of them holds their hand up.

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.800
Yeah, what's your armor class?

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800
Their hand.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.360
I'll answer that in one second.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.600
You said their hand is the shape of a blade?

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.040
Like, like Ryan Reynolds character from the Wolverine movie?

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.240
Like, yeah.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240
Alright.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.400
Or they're just holding a sword.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.160
No, it's the shape of a blade.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.000
It's like muted into a blade.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.240
Definitely muted into a blade.

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.520
And it strikes you dealing 12 damage.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.560
My armor class, by the way, is a million.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.840
I can cure medium wounds.

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.840
That's true.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840
Definitely you can.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.040
Can I, uh, is, is, am I able to hide in the shadows?

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.440
Um, you can try, definitely.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.920
No, only Stevie Nicks is.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:20.920
You attempt to conceal yourselves in the shadows.

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920
Hopefully the shadowy figures will see you.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:30.440
I will cure you with my medium healing wound healing powers.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:41.360
Let me squat upon thine face and dispense the mucus that does make one whole again.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.600
Okay, 19 hit points of damage.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.600
Wow.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600
To me?

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600
Yeah, that brings you back to full health.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.280
Oh, oh, you can, oh, okay.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.280
Thank you.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.280
Welcome back.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280
Your dreams were your ticket out.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.960
Does anyone have a, have a, have a sheet in their stuff that's, that has level two

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960
spells on it?

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960
Are you fucking joking?

01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.040
I have a piece of fucking graphite paper here with me.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040
Not me.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.520
How many of these shadow warriors are there?

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.520
Uh, there's six of them.

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.520
I fire two arrows.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.120
You know, now you can fire three arrows.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.120
Oh really?

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120
Yeah.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120
What did that happen?

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120
Uh, you got a magic bow.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120
Whoa.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120
I fire three arrows.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:30.720
So I'm going to spin two arrows for so long.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:38.960
Wait, while she fires the arrows, I quickly use my knife to pry off three of my fingernails.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.040
And then I, I do a, I try to do a backstab on one of the shadow beings.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.520
Do you hate Camel, not Gianna?

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.320
I don't, I love Camel, I don't like his character.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.440
Oh, it'd be so funny if you hated Camel.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:57.280
Two of the arrows plant themselves in the figure dealing, uh, nine damage, um, at the

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:03.040
same time you attempt your backstab maneuver, but, uh, it doesn't seem to go as planned.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.360
They smile in your face all the time they want to.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.120
All right, so, so, uh, what, what is the arrangement of these, uh, these figures?

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.880
Where are they standing in relationship tests?

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.920
There's about three that are up on Sharpie and he's inside this gate and you guys are

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.760
outside this gate and then there's three farther back.

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.280
Didn't he bust the gate open?

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.360
He did from the inside, but they're farther inside.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.040
So can I come through the gate?

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.040
Definitely.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.040
Okay.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.160
I, I, I jump through the gate and take a, and I do a flaming sword attack on the, on

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.960
the nearest, uh, uh, figure.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960
That happens.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.720
With your flaming sword, you charge directly towards the, the most menacing of the shadow

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:49.440
shapes and slice, an incredible slice across the dark foe dealing some damage.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440
Oh shit.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:56.120
Oh, that was almost off the table.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.600
Dealing 16 damage.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.600
Yeah.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.760
I can't wait to find out what the non-conflict resolution of this encounter would have been.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.880
I know, we brought you a shadow cake.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.760
The guy, the guy had a sword for a hand, right?

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.760
The lead shadow falls.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:16.680
All I did was jump over his tendril having shadow fence and open the door.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.400
The rest of the shadows pour out.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.720
They actually flow past Sharpie and directly towards Mulraine and Chris.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.200
May I summon a magical beast?

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.640
After this you can.

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.960
Can I apologize?

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.560
Can I kick some mighty fucking dick?

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.520
All of those things can happen in due time, ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:45.200
Let me get some attack rolls out of the way, it'll be a blast.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.200
Are you okay?

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.200
No.

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:55.320
Yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm fine, I'm having the best time, objectively.

01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:02.560
Anyway, two of the shadow creatures approach Mulraine and Chris and strike deadly blows

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.640
on their arms and legs with their bladed limbs, dealing some damage.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640
Oh shit.

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:15.120
Mulraine takes 15 damage and Christopher takes 9.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.880
The other two shadows, one of their limbs become hazy and smoky like hazy and smoke.

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.920
And their limbs, and the smoke that they, you know, they have for their now limbs flows

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.920
directly into the throat of a quark as if attempting to strangle them.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.560
You feel a dark presence invade your body.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.440
It won't be the last time.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.440
Oh shit.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.000
Now with that costume on.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.040
You feel yourself choking and like it's getting harder to move, but otherwise you're not affected.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.360
And I mean you're choking, but yeah.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.360
All right.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.560
Can I respond to that or do I, who moved first?

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.840
I think it was, I think this is Mulraine's turn now.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.320
Uh, I summon magical beast.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.320
Okay.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.560
So you can summon some sort of magical beast with that.

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.560
Shadow Eater.

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.560
Nope.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560
Close.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.560
Close.

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.080
Let's edit this out, this whole thing.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.240
She can't summon a squid.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.240
That's the thing.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.240
Dire rat, eagle, monkey, octopus, owl, porpoise, snake, wolf.

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.240
Porpoise.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.240
Porpoise.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.240
Summon the porpoise.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.240
Summon the porpoise.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:28.520
I think I just always want aquatic creatures to be summoned to terrestrial space.

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.560
You really have 4chan message board.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.720
Like you just want to see suffering.

01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.080
You just want to watch a creature die in front of you.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.960
You can imagine that without us doing anything.

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.280
It's not visually happening.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:49.080
Uh, because this creature reads to me as the most magical beast.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.920
The most fearless.

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.560
And uh, maniacal, I summon the monkey.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.060
Nice.

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:04.840
With a snap of your fingers and a wave of your arms, a monkey leaps into existence.

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:10.840
Cover me when I sleep.

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.840
Cover me.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840
Nobody?

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840
Peter Gabriel?

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.360
Don't you know you got us?

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.600
He appears as if he was like jumping through the air.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.680
Yeah, he jumps like, he dissolves into existence, jumping directly onto one of the shadow creatures

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.680
and is now on his head trying to like beat him or like pummel him or rip his hair out.

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.080
But it's not, it's not going so well.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.080
It's not doing any damage.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.080
It tickles me.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:44.440
I remember my first time summoning a monkey.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:51.440
I was 13 the first time I summoned the monkey.

01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.440
Oh boy.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.440
I was in the bathroom and my mom was like, get out of there.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440
What are you doing?

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.440
I yell out encouragingly, uh, go marbles, go!

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440
Marbles!

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.440
That happens.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440
Yeah, that happens.

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440
It's Chris's turn.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440
Go marbles, go.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:21.440
Is our goal to delight these foes into a submission?

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:27.440
Does he have a little hat on?

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.440
Yeah, put a birthday hat on him.

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:44.440
I just love the juxtaposition of Spencer in a bad mood so serious and having to say,

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.440
you summon a monkey.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.440
He appears.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.440
I'm not in a bad mood, you guys.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440
No, I know.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.440
I'm sorry, Spencer.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440
I'm sorry.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.440
No, don't be sorry.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440
It's okay.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.440
What did the monkey do to the shadow things?

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.440
He didn't do any damage.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440
Well, you delighted them.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440
He delighted them.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.440
Yeah, it certainly was entertaining for all of us.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.440
They called their wives and told them that they loved their wives, their shadow wives.

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.440
That's what happened.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.440
I'm watching an ape named Marbles try to attack me.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.440
I just wanted to make sure you're okay, darling.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.440
I'll be home after eight.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.440
So it's Chris's turn.

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.440
That's Duncan.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.440
Oh, sorry.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:36.440
Well, I eat a high cost for all breakfasts.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:40.440
Have we hurt any of these things at all?

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.440
I knocked one down, right?

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.440
Yeah, you cut one down.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.440
It's not moving.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.440
It's not moving.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:50.440
So I go to that being and try to give him CPR.

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440
No, I'm just kidding.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440
I don't do that.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.440
Maybe we should run.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440
Does it seem like we can run you guys?

01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.440
Why don't we just run?

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.440
Jump upon my back, all of you, and you on cocoa and whatnot.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.440
And I could throw my blinding bombs at the shadow beast,

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.440
and then we'll just get the fuck out of here.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.440
Most of that plan is good other than the fact that only two people can fit on.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440
I've been running my whole life.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.440
I'll stay behind as a distraction.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440
You guys go.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.440
Leave him. He is too slow, for he is Kamal's character,

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.440
and shall live to die another day.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.440
Well, we have shadow cocoa, too, right?

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440
Oh, yeah.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.440
So that's four people?

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440
Yes.

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.440
Fuckin' let's do it.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.440
Not runnin'!

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.440
Why?

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:52.440
I feel a monologue coming on.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.440
Jump upon my back, be not shy.

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.440
What if Hitler had run from...

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.440
The World War II would have been six months instead of five and a half years.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440
He did. He killed himself.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440
The first example off the top of my head, wrong one to grab.

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.440
Okay, shitty example.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:14.440
What if everyone Hitler fought had run?

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.440
What if George Washington ran from the Delaware?

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.440
What if dirt ran from itself?

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440
What if the sky would be made of dirt?

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.440
He's right!

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.440
What if...

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440
He's right, he's right.

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.440
We should stay and fight these invincible shadow beings.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.440
He's right. Marble's the monkey out.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.440
After Marble's...

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.440
Do I have any fuckin' powers here that I can...

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.440
You can stomp on people.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.440
You can stab people with your guard.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.440
Watch me fuckin' work.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.440
Let's go rodeo on these dicks.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440
Alright.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440
So you wanna stab him?

01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.440
Honey, I wanna do everything I can to get out of this.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440
Great proofs, everybody.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.440
If he's gonna run, then I'm gonna kick ass.

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.440
Spencer.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:09.440
What's up?

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.440
Oh, I'm just resolving an attack real quick.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440
Hold up, you guys.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440
Terrific.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440
You deal.

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.440
No, no, charging towards one of the shadowy foes.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.440
You strike them directly with your horn, dealing 16 damage.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440
Alright.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.440
That is precisely what I'm talking about.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440
What?

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.440
Mic bump.

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.440
Bump.

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440
Was there a question?

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.440
So how many foes are left now?

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.440
Let me know when it's my turn.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:38.440
There's still five.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.440
Jesus Christ.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.440
Wait, I didn't get to throw my blinding bombs.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440
That's true.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.440
I thought you changed your mind up.

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.440
I did.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.440
I could still throw the...

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.440
You could throw all sorts of stuff, man.

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440
Oh, okay.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.440
Throw the blinding bombs and then let's kick ass.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.440
I throw to create a distraction.

01:39:52.440 --> 01:40:01.440
I take just like one small hit from one of my vials of acid and throw three smoke bombs.

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.440
Do I...

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.440
I throw three blinding bombs at the shadow beasts.

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.440
Throwing three blinding bombs at the feet of the shadow beasts.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.440
It just sounds like a euphemism that a drunk uncle would use at Thanksgiving.

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.440
Let me throw one of my blinding bombs on you.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.440
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.440
I feel hurdy.

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:28.440
That's just the blinding bombs.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440
I don't know what's happening.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440
Spencer, if we lose you, we're fucked.

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440
What is happening?

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440
Blinding bombs.

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440
Yeah, no, they work.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440
The people are blind now.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440
Oh.

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.440
Jump upon my back and Coco's back and let's fuck us off.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.440
I'm not running.

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.440
It's not running.

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:54.440
It's called galloping.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.440
Discussion is the better part of valor.

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440
Be not that so proud.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440
Love has no pride when I call out your name.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440
And where will we go?

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.440
To a place where there's no more shadow people with swords for hands?

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.440
Jesus, fuck, you burned my forest to the ground, you cocksucker.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:11.440
Can't you fucking jump on my back and run with me for a while?

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:18.440
Is it possible, though, that these shadows, if we've vanquished these shadow people,

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440
that we'll get our shadows back?

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.440
Or maybe they're the embodiments of our shadows in some way?

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440
Or no, are they just guardians of...

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.440
Makes sense to me.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.440
It makes sense.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.440
It makes sense.

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.440
You're looking at them, they don't seem like they look like your shadows,

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440
but that still might be the case.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.440
Can I give Marbles some of my arrows?

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.440
Would you toss them to her?

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:45.440
Oh, it's a shame.

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.440
You thought Marbles was a guy?

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.440
I did, I did, I did.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.440
I thought he was a plucky little fellow.

01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:00.440
I give Madame Marbles five of my arrows and I say,

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.440
you know what to do with these.

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.440
The idea being that Marbles is going to take those arrows

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.440
and stab the shadows in the head.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.440
Because Marbles is very agile.

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440
She's a monkey.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.440
She's a monkey.

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.440
That's true.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:25.440
But she identifies as male gender-wise, but her sexuality is female.

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.440
What's happening?

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.440
Arrows?

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.440
Marbles is going to try to stab five shadows with five arrows.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.440
Marbles has something to prove.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.440
As it happens, Marbles doesn't have anything to prove.

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440
Anyway, you give her the arrows,

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.440
but she doesn't seem very confused.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.440
What is happening?

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.440
A good time.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.440
So Marbles doesn't have anything to prove.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440
So, side question, with these magical beasts,

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:04.440
do they have no wants or they're just fucking animals?

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.440
Or do they have personalities?

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.440
I don't know.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440
Can you just tell me how Marbles felt?

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:13.440
I said she didn't have anything to prove.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.440
Yeah.

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.440
That's a possession.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.440
Something to prove, right?

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.440
Well, I was thinking like, I don't know,

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:23.440
like Marbles' parents said,

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.440
hey Marbles, you'll never mount to anything.

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.440
You'll never murder a shadow creature.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440
Well, it brings up an interesting question.

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440
What are some of these beasts?

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440
Where do they come from?

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440
They come from an alternate plane, actually, yeah.

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440
Where they're just hanging out?

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440
Do they have lives of their own?

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440
Yeah, they have it, and then they get pulled through,

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.440
and then they're confused,

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.440
and they attack whatever looks the most threatening.

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:46.440
So Marbles might have had something to prove, maybe.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440
But you're saying that Marbles doesn't.

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440
I'm saying, you know, I'll redact that

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.440
and say there's no way of knowing.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440
Should I fuck Marbles?

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440
Yes.

01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.440
Let's make sure that Marbles has something to prove.

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.440
I'm only asking.

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.440
I'm going to.

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440
I'm saying, should I or should I not fuck Marbles?

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440
I can't say what you should or shouldn't do.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440
Can I say something?

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440
Yes.

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.440
If you're gonna fuck the monkey, will you fuck me first?

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:15.440
Yes!

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.440
All right.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440
I will sever my emotional ties with Marbles.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.440
You know what, actually fuck me after you fuck the monkey.

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:32.440
Why waste a chance to get extra-dimensional aids?

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440
Well, yeah.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.440
Right now, Christopher, I like where you're going with this,

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.440
but right now we dazzle these shadow figures.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.440
They're blinded right now.

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.440
Yep.

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.440
That's the time to fuck, my man.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.440
Look, I'm hard as a fucking diamond right now.

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.440
Me too.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.440
I would like to cast Charm Person on one of the shadow creatures

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.440
when it's my turn, because it's a level one spell.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440
Charm Person.

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.440
It has no effect.

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:13.440
I go into a barbarian rage, I go into a berserk rage.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.440
I jump astride Marbles, and I take out my far sword,

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.440
and I go on Marbles, and we run towards him,

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.440
and taking out my far sword, I hold it out like a clothesline

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.440
and try to slice through all of them,

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.440
like I'm cutting down them all, like a bunch of trees.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.440
How big do you think Marbles is?

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.440
I was...

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.440
Five-five?

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.440
Make Ryan-sized?

01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.440
I guess I could have done a better job.

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.440
I was always thinking of Marbles as like a marmoset-sized.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.440
Forget Marbles, I jump astride Tylenol.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440
I go, Tylenol, it's you and me, baby.

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.440
Let's roll.

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:59.440
I jump astride Tylenol's back in a berserker rage,

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.440
and I grab a fistful of maine,

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.440
and I pull Marbles' torment and I go,

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.440
we're gonna go in there.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:15.440
Two separate people, but we're coming out.

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.440
One...

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.440
Fucked monkey.

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:24.440
And I give him a little spur, a little boot,

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440
and do his haunches, and I go,

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:30.440
and I un-weald, un-sheath my far sword

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.440
and try to slice down the shadow figures.

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.440
Okay, so all of this is happening,

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.440
but you're still being strangulated by that shadow.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440
Oh fuck, I forgot about that.

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:43.440
You're choking, but this stuff can still be happening.

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.440
So with your far sword strike,

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.440
you attempt to attack as many of the shadow creatures

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440
as you possibly can.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
At a full gallop, astride Tylenol with codeine.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440
At a full gallop, astride Tylenol with codeine,

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.440
you unleash a far sword blast directly

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.440
towards the shadow creatures,

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.440
hitting merely two of them.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.440
Oh cock.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440
That's still good, that's still good.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.440
I don't know why I framed it that way.

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.440
Two's great, you guys, dealing 11 damage

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.440
and 17 damage.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.440
One of the shadows falls, slain,

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.440
the other is still standing,

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440
you're faced with four.

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.440
You might want to cover time there.

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440
10-0-3.

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.440
You might want to what?

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.440
He's saying we're never going to finish this fight.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.440
Let's get out of here.

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.440
I say we end on a bang.

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.440
Let's pick one of them and not talk about it.

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.440
Well done, Barbarian, look at those that you have slain

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.440
and the others that are still standing.

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:46.440
Wait, does this mean the game's about to end?

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.440
Chris, do you have a sword I can have?

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.440
Do I have hair?

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440
Yeah, you have hair.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.440
Before the game ends with my dagger,

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.440
I cut all my hair off.

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:01.440
All of it is gone.

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.440
I just take swipe chunks with my dagger

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:08.440
and then I give you my, take my hair cutting dagger.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440
Oh, well, thank you.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.440
I freeze time and do a crazy rap.

01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.440
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.440
Super fly, honey to the money, motherfucker.

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.440
Put your mama down and I started to pocket.

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.440
Put her in the field and in the sky.

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.440
Fuck your mama so low, fuck your mama high.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.440
I'm sorry.

01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.440
In the background of this rap, keep going, keep rapping.

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.440
In the background, I take Christopher's hand

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440
and pull them off into the shadows.

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440
Yes.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.440
Yo, take me out.

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:55.440
Yo, yo, I rap over them as they conjugate

01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.440
like Richard Gere and Guinevere in First Night.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.440
And I pull them out of the shadows so everyone can watch.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.440
Okay.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440
Except instead of Sean Connery,

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440
instead of stabbing a sword into the dirt,

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.440
am I getting my Arthurian movies mixed?

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440
I just watch them fuck.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.440
And I rap over them, which is what King Arthur didn't do.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.440
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.440
I like the shape of your ass thrusting in and out.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:29.440
I like the way your dimples like to pout.

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.440
I like to look at your manly calves.

01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.440
I like to look at both male halves coming together

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:39.440
to form and draw your knee.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:42.440
I like to witness sexual heterogeneity.

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.440
I like to see your wiener go into a butt.

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:51.440
I like to look at it, but I like to also participate.

01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.440
So I'm going to drop my pants and masturbate.

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.440
I'm going to spread my seed onto the dirt.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:01.440
And where I come from, that's called starting to flick.

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.440
Thank you for coming to Hymen Town, everybody.

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:07.440
We did it.

01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.440
That was a wrap in Closer.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.440
Thanks for...

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.440
That was a bit of an epic.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:19.440
How about a round of applause for Greg Pruips, everyone?

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:23.440
Duncan Trussell.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.440
Erin McGathy.

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:30.440
Spencer Crittenden.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.440
And of course, everybody here at Meltdown Commons

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:35.440
are making this the best place to do a podcast in the world.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.440
I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.440
Thank you very much.

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:47.440
One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.440
We will try and watch the Abominable Dr. Fibes this week

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.440
and get back to you, Marcy.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.440
And we're still Monday nights until further notice

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.440
until we move to Sunday.

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.440
Someone put their character sheet in the ice bucket?

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.440
What the fuck?

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.440
Thank you for coming, everybody.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:18.440
We love you all dearly.
