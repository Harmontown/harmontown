{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:23.360\nHello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown. Harmontown is now in session. I'm your little old\n\n00:23.360 --> 00:30.360\ncomptroller, Jeff Davis. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmontown, Den Harmon.\n\n00:30.360 --> 00:49.680\nWhat a lively crowd. It's not just like eight people that are going to bump everybody else\n\n00:49.680 --> 00:54.440\nout. It's actually a lively crowd. You can never tell from listening. Is there a bachelorette\n\n00:54.440 --> 01:01.000\nparty out there? Everyone else is not actually that excited. It's just Caroline and her friends.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:04.840\nWe made them wait. It's eight. It's eight. Oh, it's a little late. It's eight fifteen.\n\n01:04.840 --> 01:07.960\nWe made them wait seven minutes longer than normal. Yeah, they're five hours. They're\n\n01:07.960 --> 01:14.620\nkicking in. Okay. Well, look, I'm glad your energy is up. Mine's a little down. My body's\n\n01:14.620 --> 01:33.480\nsore. Football practice started. Somebody just registers as a joke that I'm playing softball\n\n01:33.480 --> 01:41.200\nat all. My animation studio, Star Burns Industries, has a softball team in some kind of league,\n\n01:41.200 --> 01:49.560\nand we got together to practice, and it's looking pretty grim. But it was kind of nice. I was\n\n01:49.560 --> 01:54.360\ndreading the actual experience myself, but I actually kind of enjoyed being out there.\n\n01:54.360 --> 01:59.320\nI didn't die. But two days later, it's like, you know, you don't exercise at all, and you\n\n01:59.320 --> 02:03.360\ngo to the gym, and you feel great. And then two days later, all those torn muscles that\n\n02:03.360 --> 02:08.480\nare now repairing themselves or whatever, however muscles work. All of a sudden, you're\n\n02:08.480 --> 02:18.080\nall sore. That's where I'm at. So whatever. Who cares? Go fuck yourself. We were thinking\n\n02:18.080 --> 02:21.480\nabout, because of the scheduling conflict, because we're going to be playing softball\n\n02:21.480 --> 02:27.440\non Monday nights, we came this close to taking a little hiatus from our Harmontown meetings.\n\n02:27.440 --> 02:30.560\nAnd then we told them, melt down that, and they were all bumped out, and they said, what\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:37.320\nabout Sundays? So starting May 6th, for those of you who come to the shows here in LA, we're\n\n02:37.320 --> 02:41.680\ngoing to be moving to Sundays at eight for at least a couple of months. I think that's\n\n02:41.680 --> 02:50.360\na better night. I can hear a couple people crying. But who's got the biggest conflict\n\n02:50.360 --> 02:59.080\nwith somebody going to be unable to come from now on? Is your waving your hand back there?\n\n02:59.080 --> 03:12.800\nWhat's wrong? Why can't you come? How much are they paying you? Because we'll double\n\n03:12.800 --> 03:26.480\nthem. What do you do for a living? We're at Cheesecake Factory. I don't know what to say\n\n03:26.480 --> 03:36.600\nto them. It's not that easy for everybody. You can't swap out with somebody on a Sunday\n\n03:36.600 --> 03:48.320\nnight? Monday night, rather? You're a big wheel in Cheesecake Town? He said he's a very important\n\n03:48.320 --> 03:53.960\nmember of the Cheesecake Team. I don't know what the... Yeah, I didn't want to suggest\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:59.400\nthat he quit. I mean, it could be an important step in the right direction for him. We don't\n\n03:59.400 --> 04:07.240\nknow. Erin McGathy, my girlfriend, has recently become a cake maniac. She's making a million\n\n04:07.240 --> 04:13.520\ncakes a day. She made several cakes for tonight. She made one for Emily. I think it must be\n\n04:13.520 --> 04:19.720\nEmily's birthday or anniversary of her cat or something. She made one cake and then she\n\n04:19.720 --> 04:25.360\nmade another cake in honor of a movie we watched when we couldn't find the movie that I said\n\n04:25.360 --> 04:34.320\nwe were going to watch, which is The Abominable Dr. Fibes. So I didn't see that. Nor did I.\n\n04:34.320 --> 04:38.640\nI couldn't find it. It wasn't on Netflix or Hulu or any of the thing in the Apple TV's.\n\n04:38.640 --> 04:45.840\nMy video store didn't have it. We bought it on Amazon. You bought it? We'll label it\n\n04:45.840 --> 04:58.880\nfor next time. What's your name, ma'am? Marcy. Marcy? Okay, bring out the cake. The squeaky\n\n04:58.880 --> 05:08.600\nwheel always gets the grease at Harmontown. I figured... It's a beautiful Jaws 4 cake.\n\n05:08.600 --> 05:14.200\nThere's a little chocolate Mario Van Peebles getting eaten to death. Even though in the\n\n05:14.200 --> 05:19.640\nmovie he doesn't really die, spoilers, Mario Van Peebles gets placed in the shark's mouth\n\n05:19.640 --> 05:26.440\ngently and lowered into the ocean by this helicopter-like shark. And then he pops up\n\n05:26.440 --> 05:31.680\nat the end and says, yeah, man, you thought I was dead, but I wasn't, man. And he talks\n\n05:31.680 --> 05:37.240\njust like that in the movie for real. Is that the movie where they use the flash in the\n\n05:37.240 --> 05:41.200\ncamera to make the shark go crazy? Yeah, yeah. And then you find out the sharks have vocal\n\n05:41.200 --> 05:49.440\ncore and the shark goes, no! And then Mrs. Brody rams the shark with the... What do you\n\n05:49.440 --> 05:59.000\ncall it? The bousprix or the shark impaler on the front of the boat. And the shark explodes.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.760\nIt explodes on contact with the thing. And so to make sense, they intercut it with Roy\n\n06:04.760 --> 06:08.760\nScheider saying, smile you son of a bitch from the first movie so that you think, well, maybe\n\n06:08.760 --> 06:13.880\nit kind of exploded reminiscently. And then it goes down and there's a piece of wood kind\n\n06:13.880 --> 06:18.360\nof halfway through the shark, right? Yeah. I'll tell you, that shark was as abominable\n\n06:18.360 --> 06:24.360\nas Dr. Fibes himself. Thank you for all the trouble you went through to watch that movie\n\n06:24.360 --> 06:41.800\nthat I didn't watch. Here's Marcy, this is your shark cake. She has to leave. You have\n\n06:41.800 --> 06:46.600\nto leave. I'm sorry, you can't have that cake in here. You can't have your cake in Harmon\n\n06:46.600 --> 06:58.040\nTown too. No, that's just the shark damage. You're looking at dismembered Van Peebles\n\n06:58.040 --> 07:01.840\nand saying it's been partially eaten, but that's all part of the verisimilitude of the\n\n07:01.840 --> 07:08.440\ncake. There was a while there in movies where they were making animals yell that they don't\n\n07:08.440 --> 07:13.160\nhave vocal cords or voice boxes. I'm pretty sure an arachnophobia, it was a spider, and\n\n07:13.160 --> 07:18.240\nI was like, ahhhh. There was a spider that popped a wheelie and came at you and yelled\n\n07:18.240 --> 07:22.240\nat you. You'll make a lot of crazy choices when you're looking down the barrel of a\n\n07:22.240 --> 07:27.600\nstinker in the final audio mix. You got that big board in front of you and a whole computer\n\n07:27.600 --> 07:33.400\nand you're just like, juice the spiders. I'm looking at a Jeff Daniels vehicle here.\n\n07:33.400 --> 07:43.040\nI thought it seemed like a good idea on paper, but it's not. Give the spiders some juice.\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:46.680\nThat's what they did on the Exorcist when they made the devil sound like some bees in\n\n07:46.680 --> 07:51.800\na box or something. I probably don't have to tell you this, but I'm feeling a little\n\n07:51.800 --> 07:57.880\noff tonight. For that reason, I've surrounded myself with a blanket of friends who to give\n\n07:57.880 --> 08:04.560\nme energy and offset my softball soreness. Let's keep this bullet train on the tracks\n\n08:04.560 --> 08:18.480\nand bring up my friend Duncan Tressel. Duncan Tressel! Grab any mic you like. Wherever\n\n08:18.480 --> 08:22.520\nyou're comfortable, buddy. Thank you. It's good to have you back. Thanks, Dan. Thank\n\n08:22.520 --> 08:27.720\nyou. Good to be here. I thought we could bring you out here and keep the spirits up because\n\n08:27.720 --> 08:39.880\nI know your mom just died. Yeah, I'm grieving. Is it true? Yeah. I don't know why I'm so\n\n08:39.880 --> 08:44.280\nhappy about it. You're handling it awfully well. I told you a couple episodes ago about\n\n08:44.280 --> 08:50.600\nDuncan actually podcast his mom's death bed. I don't know how else to put it. Yeah, I\n\n08:50.600 --> 08:54.960\nalways heard that. I mean, it wasn't technically, she died on a different bed, so I was like,\n\n08:54.960 --> 09:05.000\nthe bed before death bed? Whatever you call that. It was the anti-death bed. Yeah, exactly.\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:13.160\nI mean, he sat with her. I mean, I know that doesn't sound like a sale. If I heard that\n\n09:13.160 --> 09:16.720\non paper, I wouldn't be like, I'm going to listen to that on the way to work and slam\n\n09:16.720 --> 09:25.280\ndunk that pitch. But it's a transcendental experience. It's incredibly, it's neither saccharine nor\n\n09:25.280 --> 09:30.480\nis it depressing. It's just transcendental and uplifting. I mean, it's a guy talking\n\n09:30.480 --> 09:38.960\nto you. Thank you. And I mean, it was so important for you to do that because there would have\n\n09:38.960 --> 09:44.280\nbeen so easy not to. There's so many reasons not to do that. Yeah. Well, she wanted to\n\n09:44.280 --> 09:48.480\ndo it. See, I was sort of, I was putting it off because she had said, you know, we should\n\n09:48.480 --> 09:54.400\nprobably do one of your podcasts. And I just, the whole experience, are your parents still\n\n09:54.400 --> 10:07.680\nalive? Yeah. See, well, the whole experience is not what you expect when one of your parents,\n\n10:07.680 --> 10:14.080\nthe problem with it is it's just not what you expect. And all these crazy defense mechanisms\n\n10:14.080 --> 10:19.480\nstart floating up from inside of you that you did, they like, like denial of the experience\n\n10:19.480 --> 10:26.520\nor well, basically, like I've, well, many, many years ago, for some reason, I did some\n\n10:26.520 --> 10:31.960\nvolunteer work at a hospice and they sort of walk you through the death process. And\n\n10:31.960 --> 10:38.280\none of the things that they said was people die like they live. So when you're dying,\n\n10:38.280 --> 10:44.120\nyou sort of, it's like your life repeats over the course of two or three weeks. It just,\n\n10:44.120 --> 10:48.320\nyou go through every single pattern. You like all those patterns that you keep repeating\n\n10:48.320 --> 10:53.840\nand repeating and repeating. So I'm just going to play Minecraft. Yes, you will. No, you'll\n\n10:53.840 --> 10:58.320\nplay video games and then also any kind of relationship stuff that you have, you'll probably\n\n10:58.320 --> 11:02.840\nrelive in any kind of like, you know, that, that, that track that you're always that people\n\n11:02.840 --> 11:06.920\nare inevitably on the repeating track that happens again and again in your life, like\n\n11:06.920 --> 11:13.360\nsome weird echo, that echo happens super sped up when you're dying and it doesn't just happen\n\n11:13.360 --> 11:17.360\nto you. It happens to the people around you. They start reliving all the old patterns.\n\n11:17.360 --> 11:24.400\nSo what I was doing while my mom was dying is I went into the basement and just started\n\n11:24.400 --> 11:30.280\nplaying Starcraft, just playing Starcraft to try to like, you know, escape. Cause when\n\n11:30.280 --> 11:31.280\nI was like,\n\n11:31.280 --> 11:34.000\nOkay. So I'm sorry. So the cycles that are happening, are they happening to the, to\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:38.200\nthe person that's dying or? Yeah. And you said it's also happening to everyone.\n\n11:38.200 --> 11:42.360\nAll your defense mechanisms kick in because you're, you're sort of standing at the brink\n\n11:42.360 --> 11:49.440\nof infinity. You're in the presence of absolute truth that there's, you can't escape from.\n\n11:49.440 --> 11:53.480\nThere's no way to bargain with it. You can't. So what happens is all your defense, you try\n\n11:53.480 --> 11:59.720\nto stick your head in any kind of sand that you can find to escape from the, you know,\n\n11:59.720 --> 12:05.520\navoid basically. So, but your mom, your relationship with your mom, I was surprised to hear this\n\n12:05.520 --> 12:11.480\ncause I would have guessed just through natural parental math that your parents were either\n\n12:11.480 --> 12:15.280\ntruck drivers or football coaches. Right. Yeah.\n\n12:15.280 --> 12:21.000\nBecause you are this Zen guy was like into the, like from the bag of Ed Geeta to the\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:24.280\nDowdy Jig and everything in between. There's actually only a couple of things in between\n\n12:24.280 --> 12:32.040\nthose two. It's a, but, but, but you are your, your, your brain is this, this spiritual,\n\n12:32.040 --> 12:36.760\nyou know, a tree branching out into everything, the roots drinking deeply from everything\n\n12:36.760 --> 12:46.720\nbeneath you and the leaves. I love you. I love you too. God, I wish I was like that.\n\n12:46.720 --> 12:50.160\nBut then, but then the podcast started rolling. I was like, okay, what is this going to be?\n\n12:50.160 --> 12:55.880\nFirst of all, I expected to hear like the, the, the Darth Vader sound of an air device,\n\n12:55.880 --> 13:02.000\nyou know, like, yeah, I ex, and I definitely expected her to be in firm vocally, you know,\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:06.200\nthat she, like, like that would be this horrible experience of listening to a person that wasn't\n\n13:06.200 --> 13:11.360\nable to live anymore. And, but beneath all of those very surfacey expectations, I also\n\n13:11.360 --> 13:16.520\nexpected her to not have a personality as much like yours. And it's not an exact match,\n\n13:16.520 --> 13:19.960\nbut, but she's, she's seen, almost seems like she was some kind of mentor to you.\n\n13:19.960 --> 13:25.600\nShe was. Yeah. She was, she definitely wasn't a lot of ways. She's, she's the, I mean, yeah,\n\n13:25.600 --> 13:30.240\nthat, I would go, it's going through her books that I first found the Bhagavad Gita or found\n\n13:30.240 --> 13:34.280\nany kind of Eastern religion or anything like that.\n\n13:34.280 --> 13:37.680\nSo that means that your dad must have been.\n\n13:37.680 --> 13:38.680\nNo.\n\n13:38.680 --> 13:39.680\nOkay.\n\n13:39.680 --> 13:44.520\nWell, no, my dad is just this crazy. Yes. My dad is the, where I rebelled from because\n\n13:44.520 --> 13:48.640\nmy dad is this like he, when I was a kid, I grew up in the South and he used to take\n\n13:48.640 --> 13:53.420\nme hunting and I hated hunting. I didn't want to go hunting. And so I'd end up sitting\n\n13:53.420 --> 13:57.640\nin the back of this truck with, cause when you go dove hunting, you just, you don't\n\n13:57.640 --> 14:00.440\nkill a few doves. You kill piles, like,\n\n14:00.440 --> 14:03.120\nYou're killing doves? Is it even a thing? I didn't even know.\n\n14:03.120 --> 14:07.240\nYeah. Oh yeah. They kill doves. They go out and they just shoot doves.\n\n14:07.240 --> 14:08.640\nThat's like killing Christmas trees.\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:09.640\nYeah.\n\n14:09.640 --> 14:14.880\nI guess they do that too. I guess that's how they become Christmas trees.\n\n14:14.880 --> 14:20.000\nI didn't think the doves on the trees were also had to be, no, yeah, we would hang doves\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:27.360\non the trees. Dove corpses on the tree. The, the, um, so I would like one story that my\n\n14:27.360 --> 14:32.560\ndad likes to bring up when he's, when he's, uh, around his Southern friends or drinking\n\n14:32.560 --> 14:37.200\nis like, I took you on and you're sitting in the back of the truck and you started trying\n\n14:37.200 --> 14:41.360\nto breathe life back into the doves bodies.\n\n14:41.360 --> 14:48.480\nAnd you're star man. Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably where they're, they're,\n\n14:48.480 --> 14:52.360\nYou think you're star man? You ain't no star man.\n\n14:52.360 --> 14:57.160\nYeah. Yeah. That's probably the, um, where the rebellion thing happened.\n\n14:57.160 --> 15:02.080\nRight. Your dad was corporeal. Your dad was visceral. He was, he was of, of the mortal\n\n15:02.080 --> 15:03.080\ncoil.\n\n15:03.080 --> 15:07.880\nThat's right. Exactly. Yeah. That's exactly right. But still a really cool, interesting\n\n15:07.880 --> 15:15.120\nSouthern guy. Um, but yeah, you know, I read, uh, one of your blogs to my mom on her pre\n\n15:15.120 --> 15:16.120\ndeath.\n\n15:16.120 --> 15:17.120\nOh, that's right. Justin said something.\n\n15:17.120 --> 15:23.400\nShe thought it was so fucking funny, man. You made somebody with late stage cancer\n\n15:23.400 --> 15:28.560\nauthentically laugh and she compared you to, uh, she said that you remind her of Dylan\n\n15:28.560 --> 15:39.520\nThomas. I know, I know. I got a text message about it and I wrote it down. Uh, I mean that,\n\n15:39.520 --> 15:44.000\nthat was incredibly flattering, but it put me at this weird, strutting the spotlight\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:49.800\non, cause I was being a voyeur, watching you in this relationship with your mom and her\n\n15:49.800 --> 15:55.040\ndeath and all this stuff. And I am a rampant narcissist. I will insert myself into anything\n\n15:55.040 --> 16:01.560\nwrap, bend everything toward me. Like my, my ego has just, it's, it's like some singularity.\n\n16:01.560 --> 16:05.800\nIt just has, it's like, it's the size of a penny, but has the gravity of Jupiter. It\n\n16:05.800 --> 16:10.760\njust, I, I, I play that unassuming, like, oh, a little old me game. And he just sucked\n\n16:10.760 --> 16:16.800\ninto me. Everything's about me. 10 seconds before the word I or me comes into it. It\n\n16:16.800 --> 16:20.800\ndoesn't matter what we're talking about. And, and so I was listening to that and I, I was\n\n16:20.800 --> 16:25.520\nthinking in my head, I was like, I wonder what she'd think of, uh, my, my writing. There\n\n16:25.520 --> 16:31.400\nyou go. No, she thought it was, she thought it was hilarious, man. But you know, she was,\n\n16:31.400 --> 16:34.520\nshe, she was, by that time the cancer had gone into her brain.\n\n16:34.520 --> 16:52.040\nOnly the, only the taste center, uh, all her other faculties about her. The grain of salt.\n\n16:52.040 --> 16:58.760\nThe last thing she said is, man, those Ernest movies. I wish, I wish he had gone to one\n\n16:58.760 --> 17:09.280\nmore place and Dan Harmon's like Dylan Thomas. But anyways, I thank you so much for having\n\n17:09.280 --> 17:13.920\ndone that because I don't, I mean, I won't like, I'll, I'll have an experience. Well,\n\n17:13.920 --> 17:18.760\nif I'm, if I'm, if I'm, if I'm quote unquote lucky, either, either I will die before my\n\n17:18.760 --> 17:23.600\nmom or, or, or my mom will die before me, but it, uh, assuming my mom will die before\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:27.360\nme, I don't know why I'm qualifying all of us because I'm superstitious and weird and\n\n17:27.360 --> 17:33.680\ndeath is fucking weird and even, even viewed from, from the deer blind of, of, of, of it\n\n17:33.680 --> 17:37.520\nnot being reality. Like it already starts to get awkward and weird and you, you want\n\n17:37.520 --> 17:42.840\nto knock on wood after everything you say and you want the dying to be invisible, which\n\n17:42.840 --> 17:49.320\nis why it's, it makes it already hard process, even harder. And, and, and that tunnel is\n\n17:49.320 --> 17:54.640\nwhat you go through when you listen to that podcast episode, you come out the other side,\n\n17:54.640 --> 17:59.040\nit's only for a moment because already I feel weird about death again, but, but for that,\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:04.400\nthat, that, that period of time and all day at work that day, it was like, fuck man, so\n\n18:04.400 --> 18:11.000\nmuch shit that I was afraid of, uh, you know, is not, it's, it's not a thing to be afraid\n\n18:11.000 --> 18:12.000\nof.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.600\nIt isn't, you know why it's not a thing to be afraid of? Because you can't understand\n\n18:14.600 --> 18:20.160\nit. It's impossible to understand it. It's not anything that you expect. You can't, being\n\n18:20.160 --> 18:27.120\nafraid is every see, it's kind of like any reaction you have to death is like kicking\n\n18:27.120 --> 18:33.080\nsand at Godzilla. It's a, there's no reaction you can have to it because it is, it's, it's\n\n18:33.080 --> 18:39.760\na singularity and it's in, so there almost seems to, it seems pointless to contemplate\n\n18:39.760 --> 18:45.120\nit too much, even though all the, a lot of Eastern traditions say that, uh, meditation\n\n18:45.120 --> 18:51.080\nis the preparation for death, you know, because when you, I guess it's kind of like you don't,\n\n18:51.080 --> 18:55.280\nif you can avoid it, you don't want to relive your life in the last two weeks of your life.\n\n18:55.280 --> 19:00.560\nIf you can avoid it, you want to have this stable, steady thing and not go into all the\n\n19:00.560 --> 19:06.680\nold neurotic aspects of your life because it's, because it's a terrifying, I mean, now\n\n19:06.680 --> 19:10.920\nI was just saying, don't be afraid of it. Now I'm saying it's fucking scary, but you\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:16.880\ncan't breathe, you're in pain. They put you, they, it's, it's really, I haven't, I haven't\n\n19:16.880 --> 19:21.560\nreally, um, I'm, my brain is still stuttering from it and, and my therapist says it's like\n\n19:21.560 --> 19:22.560\nat least six months.\n\n19:22.560 --> 19:25.920\nWell that's the other thing I wanted to ask you about is now you, and you went on tour\n\n19:25.920 --> 19:31.480\nright after, right as it was happening and, and, and now you're back and, and I know you\n\n19:31.480 --> 19:39.840\nwere via Dustin, who's, you know, he's a little, he's a little gossip, he said that you were,\n\n19:39.840 --> 19:43.040\nyou know, having trouble, uh, getting out of the house and feeling a little, like,\n\n19:43.040 --> 19:44.040\nYeah, I'm depressed.\n\n19:44.040 --> 19:45.040\nYeah.\n\n19:45.040 --> 19:50.200\nI'm, uh, but, and that's not grief is depression, but I've retired. What I do is I buy robots\n\n19:50.200 --> 19:56.880\nand feed birds and just sit, like, my brain is reacting in this weird way where I bought\n\n19:56.880 --> 20:04.320\na Roomba, I, I bought lights that I controlled my phone and a, and a bird feed bird feeders.\n\n20:04.320 --> 20:09.320\nSo I just sit with the Roomba and you're still breathing life back into birds.\n\n20:09.320 --> 20:10.320\nOh, yeah.\n\n20:10.320 --> 20:14.840\nNo, I'm not. I'm killing them. I've, I, so I'm sitting on my porch. I've got,\n\n20:14.840 --> 20:17.840\nYou didn't mix up the robot food with the bird food.\n\n20:17.840 --> 20:22.640\nYou sent Roomba a soul.\n\n20:22.640 --> 20:27.720\nNo, I, you know, I've set up my porch for this to, like, it's a place to read. I've got wind\n\n20:27.720 --> 20:31.840\nchimes, a fountain, a bird feeders, and I've,\n\n20:31.840 --> 20:33.400\nHave you bought all that stuff recently?\n\n20:33.400 --> 20:34.680\nYeah. It's all part of this.\n\n20:34.680 --> 20:35.680\nReally all of that?\n\n20:35.680 --> 20:36.680\nAll part of this.\n\n20:36.680 --> 20:37.680\nI was just over at your place for your birthday.\n\n20:37.680 --> 20:42.800\nWell, there's a whole package at hospitals. You can buy as a wind chime bird feeder porch\n\n20:42.800 --> 20:43.800\nswing package.\n\n20:43.800 --> 20:48.960\nYou, well, yeah, I got all of that. I don't know what it is. Like everyone's telling me\n\n20:48.960 --> 20:54.640\nyou're grieving. So you're going to go crazy. So let yourself go crazy. And the more you\n\n20:54.640 --> 20:59.960\nlet yourself go crazy and be impulsive, the faster you'll get through it. So for me, that\n\n20:59.960 --> 21:06.440\ngoing crazy was, Oh, I'll buy a robot vacuum cleaner and hummingbird feeders. And the,\n\n21:06.440 --> 21:09.880\nso I'm sitting on the porch proud of myself because all the birds finally came to the\n\n21:09.880 --> 21:15.560\nfeeder and it's covered in birds. And I'm watching the birds and I feel like the God of birds.\n\n21:15.560 --> 21:20.440\nLike when you have bird feeders, you get this weird sense of like, this is because of me.\n\n21:20.440 --> 21:29.560\nI am your Lord. And I bring the food. It is, we're starving before that.\n\n21:29.560 --> 21:33.880\nMaybe if somebody, yeah, they're starving. Maybe if somebody wronged you.\n\n21:33.880 --> 21:38.200\nYou just changed migration routes and now they're all going to die eventually cause they came\n\n21:38.200 --> 21:39.200\nout of their way.\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:45.280\nWell, no, it already happened. Like I'm sitting there when chimes are chiming the fountain.\n\n21:45.280 --> 21:51.440\nIt's so peaceful and a bird just like rockets right into my fucking window right in front\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:52.440\nof me.\n\n21:52.440 --> 21:58.120\nIt's right in front of me. And I go over to it. It's little and I had seen it. I went\n\n21:58.120 --> 22:04.000\nto its body and a little trickle of red was coming out of it's feet cause it broke its\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:08.320\nneck. I'd seen that bird on the feeder earlier in the day.\n\n22:08.320 --> 22:09.320\nWas it a hummingbird?\n\n22:09.320 --> 22:10.320\nNo, it was a Finch.\n\n22:10.320 --> 22:12.200\nYeah. Cause they, okay.\n\n22:12.200 --> 22:16.080\nThe hummingbirds don't hit the window there. They seem like they would be incapable of\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:17.080\nthat.\n\n22:17.080 --> 22:19.480\nYou know, the secret is you have to dress like a hawk.\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:22.440\nI sit on my porch dressed as a hawk.\n\n22:22.440 --> 22:24.280\nYou have to get a, a, a hawk cut.\n\n22:24.280 --> 22:28.920\nThis is your origin story of your new super villain character.\n\n22:28.920 --> 22:35.080\nYou have to strike fear into those you love. It's very complicated, but the Batman version\n\n22:35.080 --> 22:36.080\nhas been taken.\n\n22:36.080 --> 22:40.080\nYou know, you want to be a superhero these days. You got to get, you got to get labyrinthine.\n\n22:40.080 --> 22:43.080\nOh yeah. That's a great, I would do, I would do that.\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:44.560\nI mean, you would dress like a hawk.\n\n22:44.560 --> 22:46.120\nFuck yeah. I dress like a hawk.\n\n22:46.120 --> 22:47.440\nYou're on record. We're recording this.\n\n22:47.440 --> 22:49.400\nI'll dress like a hawk and sit on my porch.\n\n22:49.400 --> 22:51.080\nAll right. You heard it here.\n\n22:51.080 --> 22:57.160\nIt's a weird, I got to tell you though, it's a very strange dimension that we're existing\n\n22:57.160 --> 23:01.880\nin when you, and that's why bird feeders are cool, because you just consider what's happening.\n\n23:01.880 --> 23:07.800\nIt's such a bizarre thing from the perspective of the bird, which is this giant tower of\n\n23:07.800 --> 23:14.680\nmeat, like this HP Lovecraft couture thing, the opposite of the bird is like, put these\n\n23:14.680 --> 23:18.760\nthings out and they don't understand what I have and I stink to them.\n\n23:18.760 --> 23:24.040\nI like, yeah, there's some weird smells that birds hate is coming off of me and they sit\n\n23:24.040 --> 23:29.240\nand, but they want to eat the food. So they sit and eat and like peer around and look\n\n23:29.240 --> 23:33.240\nand then eat and constantly, yeah, they must live in constant, whatever their version of\n\n23:33.240 --> 23:37.880\nfear is because they're surrounded by mammals that, and 90% of them will hurt them if they\n\n23:37.880 --> 23:41.040\ngrab them, but then some 10% of them don't, but they probably can't tell the difference\n\n23:41.040 --> 23:42.600\nbetween a cat and a dude.\n\n23:42.600 --> 23:47.200\nThey're just all, yeah, they're always, yeah, they exist in a hell world where one raw\n\n23:47.200 --> 23:51.080\nman moves, like, like, like, you know, like, yeah, that's why they're always ball players\n\n23:51.080 --> 23:58.640\nin an old movie, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, and yeah, they, they, and I, I was watching them\n\n23:58.640 --> 24:05.160\nbefore the bird died and I was thinking, I bet there's an older bird somewhere being\n\n24:05.160 --> 24:12.160\nlike, don't go to those feeders. It's cursed near the feeders. You go near the feeders\n\n24:12.160 --> 24:17.440\nand you're cursed by the Lord of Birds. And then one of them smacked right into the window.\n\n24:17.440 --> 24:24.000\nHe's like, see the price is death from the, he just, he just fell right out of the air.\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:25.000\nYeah.\n\n24:25.000 --> 24:27.400\nIt is nothing. It's like he hit a force field.\n\n24:27.400 --> 24:28.400\nThat's what it is.\n\n24:28.400 --> 24:31.640\nYou know what a force field is, but you don't know what a window is.\n\n24:31.640 --> 24:39.760\nSeason. We, we're trying to season, but we don't have hands. The bird equivalent of\n\n24:39.760 --> 24:47.520\nseizure. Yeah. I don't know what's natural for a bird though. They're probably, I mean,\n\n24:47.520 --> 24:50.800\nthey don't know, like, like, like, like, like, what are they, I guess digging up a worm like\n\n24:50.800 --> 24:55.000\nin some cartoon, like, they got to be thinking someone put that there too. What am I talking\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:56.000\nabout?\n\n24:56.000 --> 25:03.760\nI should just shoot myself right now. Thanks guys. Thanks. I'll keep saying that once or\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:11.040\na week until I stop getting that reaction. And then boom, I know you're conflicted about\n\n25:11.040 --> 25:12.040\nthat.\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:17.360\nA guy, a guy did that. Remember the guy who did that a while ago? In an open mic, a guy\n\n25:17.360 --> 25:18.360\nstabbed himself to death.\n\n25:18.360 --> 25:19.360\nWhat?\n\n25:19.360 --> 25:20.360\nYou guys didn't hear about that?\n\n25:20.360 --> 25:21.360\nWhat?\n\n25:21.360 --> 25:22.360\nYeah.\n\n25:22.360 --> 25:23.360\nThis is in Colorado.\n\n25:23.360 --> 25:24.360\nAnthony Jeselnick.\n\n25:24.360 --> 25:28.360\nIt was like, it was like a couple of days ago.\n\n25:28.360 --> 25:33.360\nIt's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,\n\n25:33.360 --> 25:34.360\nit's, it's fucking.\n\n25:34.360 --> 25:35.360\nYeah.\n\n25:35.360 --> 25:36.360\nWhat, no, what happened?\n\n25:36.360 --> 25:41.680\nWell, the story is like he came on stage and he just played some song. I can't, I think\n\n25:41.680 --> 25:46.160\nthe song was like, it had something to do with like, sorry for the mess was the name\n\n25:46.160 --> 25:49.160\nof the song. And then he just started jamming a knife.\n\n25:49.160 --> 25:50.160\nWhere was this?\n\n25:50.160 --> 25:56.440\nThis is in Colorado. So he just, I don't, I don't know. Just some shitty open mic,\n\n25:56.440 --> 25:57.440\nyou know, like,\n\n25:57.440 --> 25:58.440\nDid he die?\n\n25:58.440 --> 25:59.440\nOh, he died.\n\n25:59.440 --> 26:00.440\nYeah.\n\n26:00.440 --> 26:03.600\nHe went up, he went up and murdered himself in front of an audience.\n\n26:03.600 --> 26:06.120\nYeah. He stabbed himself to death in front of a crap.\n\n26:06.120 --> 26:07.120\nWho's a shit?\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:08.120\nI, I,\n\n26:08.120 --> 26:09.120\nIt's a terrible thing to do.\n\n26:09.120 --> 26:10.120\nTo other people.\n\n26:10.120 --> 26:11.120\nTo other people.\n\n26:11.120 --> 26:12.120\nIt is true.\n\n26:12.120 --> 26:13.120\nIt is true.\n\n26:13.120 --> 26:14.120\nYou've talked about that.\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:18.640\nSuicide is actually like a very selfish, you know, it's like the, the amount of gravity\n\n26:18.640 --> 26:23.000\nthat you exert on other people's lives when you, when you, when you, when you take yourself\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nout of the picture.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:25.000\nOh yeah.\n\n26:25.000 --> 26:29.360\nIt's a, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's definitely a, those, those, I mean that in particular,\n\n26:29.360 --> 26:33.920\nI think suicide, suicide when you have some kind of chronic illness or something is, is\n\n26:33.920 --> 26:34.920\ntotally cool.\n\n26:34.920 --> 26:35.920\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n26:35.920 --> 26:36.920\nLet him.\n\n26:36.920 --> 26:37.920\nI think it should be illegal.\n\n26:37.920 --> 26:38.920\nNo, no, no.\n\n26:38.920 --> 26:39.920\nAll right.\n\n26:39.920 --> 26:41.960\nLet's, let's, let's, let's keep the bullet train moving.\n\n26:41.960 --> 26:42.960\nYou stay here.\n\n26:42.960 --> 26:43.960\nLet's bring up another friend.\n\n26:43.960 --> 26:44.960\nMr. Greg.\n\n26:44.960 --> 27:04.960\nMr. Greg Prups.\n\n27:04.960 --> 27:07.320\nYour microphones in your, in your tickets.\n\n27:07.320 --> 27:08.320\nOh man.\n\n27:08.320 --> 27:11.920\nI just realized that, is that, is that, is that why the extra energy when I, when I took\n\n27:11.920 --> 27:17.880\nthe stage, are there proof-of-files that, that are, that are, all right, good?\n\n27:17.880 --> 27:22.120\nI don't, I don't mean to say that harmonians are, are a bunch of sluggish oafs.\n\n27:22.120 --> 27:27.160\nNo, but proof-of-files and harmonians can learn to live together, like the Czechs and\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:29.400\nthe Slovaks did for all those years.\n\n27:29.400 --> 27:31.040\nWhat makes a proof-of-file a proof-of-file?\n\n27:31.040 --> 27:32.040\nWhat, what, what says them apart?\n\n27:32.040 --> 27:33.040\nI think a certain.\n\n27:33.040 --> 27:37.040\nIf I could walk like a proof-of-file.\n\n27:37.040 --> 27:43.080\nI mean, a Joie de Vieve, a certain Jeanne-Séquin, a certain, a sense of denial, goes into every\n\n27:43.080 --> 27:44.080\nday of living.\n\n27:44.080 --> 27:49.800\nI mean, yeah, a total, like, actually, moronic, I mean, you're a proof-of-file, it's like,\n\n27:49.800 --> 27:50.800\nGod.\n\n27:50.800 --> 27:56.680\nThink about how fruitless that is, as a pursuit, and then you get a good idea of why proof-of-files\n\n27:56.680 --> 27:57.680\nfollow it.\n\n27:57.680 --> 28:02.160\nI think it's not a Sisyphusian pushing the rock up the hill, and then the rock rolls\n\n28:02.160 --> 28:04.080\nback down the hill kind of thing.\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:08.960\nEither that, or some hilarious sitcom reference from the 70s.\n\n28:08.960 --> 28:10.200\nYes.\n\n28:10.200 --> 28:13.600\nMore of a Starsky and Hutchian than a Sisyphusian.\n\n28:13.600 --> 28:14.600\nRight.\n\n28:14.600 --> 28:15.600\nHey, don't count it.\n\n28:15.600 --> 28:19.280\nI know from your perspective, you think that that's like, no, they just stare at me blankly\n\n28:19.280 --> 28:20.280\nall the time, too.\n\n28:20.280 --> 28:21.280\nOh, I know.\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:22.280\nI know.\n\n28:22.280 --> 28:23.280\nThere's Starsky and Hutch.\n\n28:23.280 --> 28:24.280\nThey're like, what?\n\n28:24.280 --> 28:29.320\nWho is the Starsky and Hutch you speak of when television was powered by water?\n\n28:29.320 --> 28:31.920\nGreg, have you met Duncan before?\n\n28:31.920 --> 28:32.920\nYou guys pals?\n\n28:32.920 --> 28:37.000\nI haven't, and I've been very moved by what Duncan was saying.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:38.000\nYou're an extraordinary person.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:42.120\nYou're very brave, and you're very funny, and I adore your podcasting right on, buddy.\n\n28:42.120 --> 28:43.120\nThank you very much.\n\n28:43.120 --> 28:44.120\nThank you, Greg.\n\n28:44.120 --> 28:45.120\nThanks.\n\n28:45.120 --> 28:46.120\nThat's amazing.\n\n28:46.120 --> 28:47.120\nThank you.\n\n28:47.120 --> 28:51.720\nI think he's been marvelously genuine tonight, something that I'm terrible at.\n\n28:51.720 --> 28:57.200\nI wanted you guys to, I wanted to see what would happen if, because I don't know, I have\n\n28:57.200 --> 29:01.040\nlike three friends.\n\n29:01.040 --> 29:02.040\nCertainly not.\n\n29:02.040 --> 29:09.520\nBut I mean, I was like, a lot of people have like 20 or 30 people that they call friends,\n\n29:09.520 --> 29:13.400\nand then they have like, let's say 150 people that they call something else, like acquaintances\n\n29:13.400 --> 29:14.400\nor something.\n\n29:14.400 --> 29:21.320\nAnd I have like three people that are my friends, only because they're the only people that\n\n29:21.320 --> 29:26.280\ncan tolerate texting me and then not me not responding, because I was like, it's Jeff\n\n29:26.280 --> 29:27.280\nand Dina.\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:28.280\nAre you that person?\n\n29:28.280 --> 29:29.280\nYou don't respond?\n\n29:29.280 --> 29:30.280\nYeah, I guess.\n\n29:30.280 --> 29:31.280\nReally?\n\n29:31.280 --> 29:32.280\nNo.\n\n29:32.280 --> 29:33.280\nNo?\n\n29:33.280 --> 29:34.280\nI don't.\n\n29:34.280 --> 29:35.280\nI'm terrible at answering emails.\n\n29:35.280 --> 29:40.560\nAnd I do the exact same thing, Dan, and it's a problem because people take it the wrong\n\n29:40.560 --> 29:41.560\nway.\n\n29:41.560 --> 29:44.520\nThey think it means you don't love them, but it's just.\n\n29:44.520 --> 29:46.000\nSo then we can be friends.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nOh yeah.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:48.580\nWe already are friends.\n\n29:48.580 --> 29:51.200\nYou already haven't responded to several of my emails.\n\n29:51.200 --> 29:52.200\nYeah.\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:53.200\nThis is great.\n\n29:53.200 --> 29:54.200\nIt's like the honeymoon.\n\n29:54.200 --> 29:57.480\nYou'll be friends, but you'll never, ever have lunch together.\n\n29:57.480 --> 30:01.120\nNo, because you'll never be able to finish that series of texts.\n\n30:01.120 --> 30:02.640\nExactly.\n\n30:02.640 --> 30:07.240\nYou really have to love drinking a block from my house in order to become really tight with\n\n30:07.240 --> 30:08.240\nme.\n\n30:08.240 --> 30:09.240\nRight.\n\n30:09.240 --> 30:11.840\nI feel like I'm raising up in this friend state here.\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:15.640\nNow that you've got the house, Dan, and I think we could have all predicted this, that\n\n30:15.640 --> 30:22.720\nI see you Monday nights here at Harmontown, and if I go to your house, I don't work at\n\n30:22.720 --> 30:27.440\nStarbucks Industries, and other than that, that's where you're going to be.\n\n30:27.440 --> 30:28.440\nYeah.\n\n30:28.440 --> 30:29.440\nI'm getting bad.\n\n30:29.440 --> 30:30.440\nAnd I'm sinking into it.\n\n30:30.440 --> 30:33.120\nI was like, I'm a proud Minecraft addict.\n\n30:33.120 --> 30:37.960\nLike I'm just like, I'm so, I just, like, it's obscene.\n\n30:37.960 --> 30:39.440\nWhat are you working on?\n\n30:39.440 --> 30:41.880\nWhat's the new task in Minecraft that you're doing?\n\n30:41.880 --> 30:46.360\nI've loaded up Minecraft with all these mods that let you make all these different things.\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:52.720\nSo I'm working on making a nuclear reactor, and I have a, I created my sixth solar panel.\n\n30:52.720 --> 30:58.240\nSo I'm just proudly going to the point where solar energy, what's that going, yeah, like\n\n30:58.240 --> 30:59.240\nKorea.\n\n30:59.240 --> 31:00.840\nWell, it doesn't matter.\n\n31:00.840 --> 31:10.160\nI mean, like, if, if, if, if, if, if what was going on with me was interesting, I wouldn't,\n\n31:10.160 --> 31:13.360\nyou know, I wouldn't be surrounding myself with entertaining people.\n\n31:13.360 --> 31:17.280\nWhen you leave the house to come to Harmontown, say tonight, I go, I go, oh fuck, what am\n\n31:17.280 --> 31:20.160\nI going to talk to them about, Minecraft?\n\n31:20.160 --> 31:21.160\nWhy not?\n\n31:21.160 --> 31:22.720\nI hope Greg Proups and Duncan Trussell show up.\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:24.360\nGreg, do you play video games?\n\n31:24.360 --> 31:25.360\nWhat?\n\n31:25.360 --> 31:26.360\nYou don't play video games.\n\n31:26.360 --> 31:27.360\nNo.\n\n31:27.360 --> 31:35.360\nI, but you know what, I don't, I don't, I don't shame people who do.\n\n31:35.360 --> 31:36.360\nUh, I don't.\n\n31:36.360 --> 31:37.360\nYou just did.\n\n31:37.360 --> 31:38.360\nYeah.\n\n31:38.360 --> 31:41.360\nThe, the inflection.\n\n31:41.360 --> 31:42.360\nIt wasn't intentional.\n\n31:42.360 --> 31:43.360\nThe inflection was there.\n\n31:43.360 --> 31:48.360\nThe inflection was, the inflection is you're counting lashes when you're whipping Jesus.\n\n31:48.360 --> 31:49.360\nWow.\n\n31:49.360 --> 31:53.360\nBecause you know, Jesus had his bad side.\n\n31:53.360 --> 31:56.360\nLet me, let's not, let's not get, you know, you're being just.\n\n31:56.360 --> 31:58.360\nHe was asking for it.\n\n31:58.360 --> 31:59.360\nExactly.\n\n31:59.360 --> 32:01.360\nYou're being, you're making a value judgment, Duncan.\n\n32:01.360 --> 32:02.360\nI'm sorry.\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:08.120\nUh, maybe my, my, my tomb or my tone indicated that I, that I, that I was diminishing people\n\n32:08.120 --> 32:09.120\nwho play games.\n\n32:09.120 --> 32:14.120\nBut I think it's marvelous when people let their creativity run rampant, uh, in that\n\n32:14.120 --> 32:15.120\narea.\n\n32:15.120 --> 32:17.120\nIt's simply not for me.\n\n32:17.120 --> 32:18.680\nI think it's a generational thing.\n\n32:18.680 --> 32:20.360\nI was born in the middle of a war.\n\n32:20.360 --> 32:22.360\nI was born in a crossfire hurricane.\n\n32:22.360 --> 32:27.360\nAnd I had a hound in my mouth and they're driving right.\n\n32:27.360 --> 32:28.360\nYeah.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:29.360\nYeah.\n\n32:29.360 --> 32:30.360\nYeah.\n\n32:30.360 --> 32:31.360\nYeah.\n\n32:31.360 --> 32:32.360\nI was down.\n\n32:32.360 --> 32:33.360\nSo the thing is.\n\n32:33.360 --> 32:35.360\nWell, there's a healthy use of your time.\n\n32:35.360 --> 32:36.360\nYeah.\n\n32:36.360 --> 32:43.360\nI don't, uh, I like to read and watch old movies and lately because Jackie Robinson's\n\n32:43.360 --> 32:49.360\nmovie came out this week, 42, I went and saw it the other day and I have, and my wife,\n\n32:49.360 --> 32:54.360\nyou know, imagine her disappointment when I bring four different books about Jackie\n\n32:54.360 --> 32:56.360\nRobinson out, including two that he's written.\n\n32:56.360 --> 33:01.360\nI saw the poster at the grove and I was like, I bet Greg's happy about that, uh, the baseball\n\n33:01.360 --> 33:02.360\nmovie coming out.\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:03.360\nIs it any good?\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:09.360\nIt was, it was a hagiographic, as we say, uh, it, it, it, it, it portrayed him in a way.\n\n33:09.360 --> 33:10.360\nUh, that,\n\n33:10.360 --> 33:11.360\nWhat does that mean?\n\n33:11.360 --> 33:12.360\nHagiographic?\n\n33:12.360 --> 33:14.360\nHagiographic is like when you take someone's history.\n\n33:14.360 --> 33:17.360\nLike for instance, if I were to write the history of Dan Harmon,\n\n33:17.360 --> 33:18.360\nGo on.\n\n33:18.360 --> 33:23.360\nLike all of a sudden you'd be, you'd be pounding over a typewriter and piece of paper coming\n\n33:23.360 --> 33:24.360\nout and then there'd be stacks of them.\n\n33:24.360 --> 33:25.360\nRight.\n\n33:25.360 --> 33:27.360\nAnd then Steven J. Canada logo would happen.\n\n33:27.360 --> 33:28.360\nThe shot of the paper.\n\n33:28.360 --> 33:29.360\nYeah.\n\n33:29.360 --> 33:30.360\nYeah.\n\n33:30.360 --> 33:31.360\nYeah.\n\n33:31.360 --> 33:37.360\nAnd then you, you, you take a sip from a bottle, but then we'd see in the garbage can\n\n33:37.360 --> 33:38.360\n80 bottles.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:39.360\nRight.\n\n33:39.360 --> 33:40.360\nAnd then all over the floor.\n\n33:40.360 --> 33:41.360\nAnd a letter from my mom.\n\n33:41.360 --> 33:42.360\nRight.\n\n33:42.360 --> 33:46.360\nAnd a can of tin out that's been upturned and a cat that hasn't been fed into agents\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:47.360\nand whatnot.\n\n33:47.360 --> 33:50.360\nAnd I'd have an answering machine and there'd be six messages in a row all expository.\n\n33:50.360 --> 33:51.360\nRight.\n\n33:51.360 --> 33:52.360\nHey, it's your editor.\n\n33:52.360 --> 33:53.360\nGot another thing.\n\n33:53.360 --> 33:57.360\nEvery single one of them would explain your character.\n\n33:57.360 --> 33:58.360\nRight.\n\n33:58.360 --> 33:59.360\nRight.\n\n33:59.360 --> 34:00.360\nThis is your mom.\n\n34:00.360 --> 34:01.360\nWhy won't you call?\n\n34:01.360 --> 34:02.360\nRight.\n\n34:02.360 --> 34:03.360\nYou know, one after the next.\n\n34:03.360 --> 34:04.360\nYeah.\n\n34:04.360 --> 34:05.360\nThat family, that 80s mom on the other end of the phone.\n\n34:05.360 --> 34:09.360\nBut then when you finally, when you like write the script that wins and, and you become\n\n34:09.360 --> 34:11.360\nDan Harmon and shit.\n\n34:11.360 --> 34:14.360\nThat's the moment we'd be like, I'm so grateful.\n\n34:14.360 --> 34:17.360\nThere's one thing I want to thank is God and shit.\n\n34:17.360 --> 34:18.360\nThey didn't do that.\n\n34:18.360 --> 34:19.360\nSo, okay.\n\n34:19.360 --> 34:20.360\nSo, well, they didn't wait.\n\n34:20.360 --> 34:21.360\nThey didn't know they didn't.\n\n34:21.360 --> 34:25.360\nThey had to be a human, but like, I know way too much about this.\n\n34:25.360 --> 34:26.360\nAnd I don't want to stop your show.\n\n34:26.360 --> 34:28.360\nWell, but I'm caught up on this word.\n\n34:28.360 --> 34:29.360\nHagiographic.\n\n34:29.360 --> 34:30.360\nI just want to make sure.\n\n34:30.360 --> 34:32.360\nHagiography is taking the history of someone.\n\n34:32.360 --> 34:35.360\nAnd can you spell that word?\n\n34:35.360 --> 34:36.360\nYeah.\n\n34:36.360 --> 34:37.360\nH-A-G-I-O.\n\n34:37.360 --> 34:39.360\nCan you mine it in Minecraft?\n\n34:39.360 --> 34:41.360\nYeah, I can.\n\n34:41.360 --> 34:43.360\nNo, not mine.\n\n34:43.360 --> 34:44.360\nWhat's an O?\n\n34:44.360 --> 34:46.360\nOh, my man.\n\n34:46.360 --> 34:48.360\nWait, were you going to mine it?\n\n34:48.360 --> 34:51.360\nNo, I was going to mine it.\n\n34:51.360 --> 34:53.360\nHe was miming pulling a card.\n\n34:53.360 --> 34:57.360\nIf you remember the Seven Dorms, they worked in a mine all day.\n\n34:57.360 --> 34:59.360\nSo it's spelled like Hagi.\n\n34:59.360 --> 35:00.360\nYeah, it's a Greek word.\n\n35:00.360 --> 35:02.360\nAnd I'm not certain what the prefix means.\n\n35:02.360 --> 35:05.360\nBut in essence, what it brought.\n\n35:05.360 --> 35:06.360\nEasy, tiger.\n\n35:06.360 --> 35:07.360\nI'll take it from here.\n\n35:07.360 --> 35:08.360\nThanks.\n\n35:08.360 --> 35:12.360\nI know you've got some Asperger people here tonight.\n\n35:12.360 --> 35:14.360\nJust some Goldberg people.\n\n35:14.360 --> 35:15.360\nI know.\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:20.360\nYou have many thesaurus here and other tiny dinosaurs all around the audience.\n\n35:20.360 --> 35:27.360\nIt just means that it takes what was once a human experience and turns it into a movie experience.\n\n35:27.360 --> 35:33.360\nFor instance, you've seen, Jeff and I often talk about the movie Patton or Lawrence of Arabia,\n\n35:33.360 --> 35:37.360\nwhich are great biopics, but they have nothing to do with the actual process.\n\n35:37.360 --> 35:40.360\nThere's not a single moment in the movie that probably happens.\n\n35:40.360 --> 35:45.360\nPatton didn't jump out on a balcony and start shooting his pistols on a plane going by.\n\n35:45.360 --> 35:46.360\nMaybe he did.\n\n35:46.360 --> 35:48.360\nIf he didn't, he ought to have, and that's what movies are about.\n\n35:48.360 --> 35:53.360\nI hope he actually said in the hallway somewhere with sunlight coming in a bunch of windows,\n\n35:53.360 --> 35:56.360\nI hope he said, is this some kind of sick joke?\n\n35:56.360 --> 35:57.360\nAn entire world at war?\n\n35:57.360 --> 35:58.360\nYeah.\n\n35:58.360 --> 36:00.360\nGod will not allow it.\n\n36:00.360 --> 36:02.360\nThat's my favorite part of the movie now.\n\n36:02.360 --> 36:05.360\nGreg and I have done, we travel a lot together.\n\n36:05.360 --> 36:08.360\nGreg and I will do the entirety of Patton together.\n\n36:08.360 --> 36:10.360\nOh, no, two and a half hours.\n\n36:10.360 --> 36:11.360\nYeah, it's horrible.\n\n36:11.360 --> 36:13.360\nAnd that's the best part down.\n\n36:13.360 --> 36:15.360\nAn entire world at war, and I'm not allowed to be in it.\n\n36:15.360 --> 36:17.360\nGod will not allow this to happen.\n\n36:17.360 --> 36:20.360\nI will be allowed to fulfill my destiny.\n\n36:20.360 --> 36:22.360\nHis will be done.\n\n36:25.360 --> 36:27.360\nPatton's four black bellies standing there like,\n\n36:27.360 --> 36:31.360\nYou know, but that's why movies are good.\n\n36:31.360 --> 36:35.360\nBecause I once said to my wife, if movies aren't better than real life, I don't want to live.\n\n36:35.360 --> 36:36.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n36:36.360 --> 36:38.360\nMovies are an extrapolation on life.\n\n36:38.360 --> 36:40.360\nThey're a reflection.\n\n36:40.360 --> 36:41.360\nYeah.\n\n36:41.360 --> 36:46.360\nYeah, I mean, a movie for better or for worse, the definition of it has become,\n\n36:46.360 --> 36:48.360\nwell, now it's been extended to three hours.\n\n36:48.360 --> 36:50.360\nI don't know why that movement happened.\n\n36:50.360 --> 36:51.360\nWhy?\n\n36:51.360 --> 36:56.360\nIt has something to do with the same reason why in the 90s graphic design of posters went out the window.\n\n36:56.360 --> 37:01.360\nIt just became Denzel Washington's half of his face and half of whoever else's face was in the movie.\n\n37:01.360 --> 37:04.360\nAnd then like a knife.\n\n37:04.360 --> 37:06.360\nI thought that would never end.\n\n37:06.360 --> 37:09.360\nBut I think like I've seen some cool posters lately.\n\n37:09.360 --> 37:12.360\nLike it seems like graphic designers have started to get paid again.\n\n37:12.360 --> 37:13.360\nYeah.\n\n37:13.360 --> 37:18.360\nBut I think that maybe editing entered that thing where they're like, wait a minute,\n\n37:18.360 --> 37:20.360\nwe don't have to do three passes on this movie.\n\n37:20.360 --> 37:22.360\nLet's just make it three and a half hours long.\n\n37:22.360 --> 37:26.360\nBut you would think that the bottom line mentality would say, no, make it 90 minutes.\n\n37:26.360 --> 37:27.360\nNo, they don't.\n\n37:27.360 --> 37:28.360\nSo that we can show it in multiplyses.\n\n37:28.360 --> 37:30.360\nThose bloody go-to-the-rings movies are like eight hours long each.\n\n37:30.360 --> 37:34.360\nI guess, but they must make so much money that everyone's confusing that and going like,\n\n37:34.360 --> 37:38.360\nsure, let your Brad Pitt movie about the invention of ping-pong be three hours long.\n\n37:38.360 --> 37:40.360\nIt'll be just like a Peter Jackson film.\n\n37:40.360 --> 37:42.360\nI love that movie, by the way.\n\n37:42.360 --> 37:43.360\nHot balls.\n\n37:43.360 --> 37:45.360\nThe tiny net.\n\n37:45.360 --> 37:50.360\nHave you heard of these new theaters that they have in Japan that are coming here?\n\n37:50.360 --> 37:51.360\nThey're in China.\n\n37:51.360 --> 37:52.360\nHave you heard about these?\n\n37:52.360 --> 37:58.360\nThere's these new theaters, hardcore theaters that drop bubbles onto the audience\n\n37:58.360 --> 38:01.360\nand have scent that they're sweet.\n\n38:01.360 --> 38:02.360\nYeah.\n\n38:02.360 --> 38:03.360\nI can't wait.\n\n38:03.360 --> 38:04.360\nLike South 50s.\n\n38:04.360 --> 38:05.360\nThe seat's vibrant.\n\n38:05.360 --> 38:06.360\nYeah.\n\n38:06.360 --> 38:07.360\nThat's coming back.\n\n38:07.360 --> 38:11.360\nThat the aspect of scent, like apparently it's coming to the United States soon.\n\n38:11.360 --> 38:14.360\nBut yeah, it's basically somehow their emulating smell,\n\n38:14.360 --> 38:17.360\nwhich I've always wanted to see what that would be like.\n\n38:17.360 --> 38:20.360\nDoes anyone remember the book Brave New World by Aldous Huxley,\n\n38:20.360 --> 38:26.360\nwhere you held onto two electrodes during the movie and they were called the filets?\n\n38:26.360 --> 38:30.360\nSo when people in the movie are raped and people in the movie are shot,\n\n38:30.360 --> 38:32.360\nand while you're watching, you're like, oh.\n\n38:32.360 --> 38:33.360\nYes.\n\n38:33.360 --> 38:35.360\nAnd I always thought that really nailed it.\n\n38:35.360 --> 38:36.360\nYeah.\n\n38:36.360 --> 38:37.360\nWell, we're getting there.\n\n38:37.360 --> 38:38.360\nYeah.\n\n38:38.360 --> 38:39.360\nI just put on one of those Oculus Rift things.\n\n38:39.360 --> 38:40.360\nI don't know if you know.\n\n38:40.360 --> 38:44.360\nThis is like they're starting to ship the development kits for these things\n\n38:44.360 --> 38:49.360\nthat when I was in my 20s, there was this concept called virtual reality in the 90s.\n\n38:49.360 --> 38:50.360\nYes.\n\n38:50.360 --> 38:52.360\nAnd everybody always looked at their hands.\n\n38:52.360 --> 38:56.360\nYeah, everyone was like, they inserted it into everything, Lucky Charms commercials\n\n38:56.360 --> 38:58.360\nand virtual reality in it.\n\n38:58.360 --> 39:05.360\nLike, oh, they'll never get my Lucky Charms if I won't go into virtual reality.\n\n39:05.360 --> 39:06.360\nI'm not kidding.\n\n39:06.360 --> 39:07.360\nThat's really not an exaggeration.\n\n39:07.360 --> 39:11.360\nThere would be a shitty movie of the month would come out with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore,\n\n39:11.360 --> 39:16.360\nand then they'd have just a scene in between blowjobs where she was in virtual reality.\n\n39:16.360 --> 39:22.360\nLike the scene where they go into the office and look through a filing cabinet was replaced\n\n39:22.360 --> 39:26.360\nwith a scene of her putting on goggles and going into a virtual filing cabinet.\n\n39:26.360 --> 39:27.360\nYeah.\n\n39:27.360 --> 39:29.360\nAnyways, lawnmower man, yada, yada.\n\n39:29.360 --> 39:31.360\nThen we dropped it because it got so embarrassing.\n\n39:31.360 --> 39:32.360\nIt was like disco.\n\n39:32.360 --> 39:33.360\nIt was like we've got so...\n\n39:33.360 --> 39:38.360\nAs soon as New Year's of 2000 happened, we're like, enough with the goggles and the people\n\n39:38.360 --> 39:39.360\ngoing like this.\n\n39:39.360 --> 39:40.360\nNo more strange days.\n\n39:40.360 --> 39:41.360\nBecause it never really happened.\n\n39:41.360 --> 39:42.360\nYeah.\n\n39:42.360 --> 39:47.360\nAnd as this kid started a Kickstarter, a kid, I call him a kid.\n\n39:47.360 --> 39:49.360\nHe's probably under 50.\n\n39:49.360 --> 39:53.360\nHe started a Kickstarter and said, look, I don't know why we gave up on this.\n\n39:53.360 --> 39:54.360\nWe can do this.\n\n39:54.360 --> 39:55.360\nThis is a real thing.\n\n39:55.360 --> 40:00.360\nAnd it just got flooded with money and flooded with agreements from software developers like,\n\n40:00.360 --> 40:02.360\nyes, yes, let's fucking do this.\n\n40:02.360 --> 40:05.360\nSo anyways, my friend Justin Roiland, who's an insane...\n\n40:05.360 --> 40:10.360\nHe's the co-creator of Rick and Morty, and he's like this insane like collector of everything.\n\n40:10.360 --> 40:13.360\nHe got one of these development kits, brought it to the office.\n\n40:13.360 --> 40:21.360\nI put on these goggles and I was like, I'm standing in Tuscany in a house and I moved\n\n40:21.360 --> 40:23.360\nmy head a little cautiously this way.\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:25.360\nAnd there's shit over here.\n\n40:25.360 --> 40:27.360\nAnd I'm everywhere.\n\n40:27.360 --> 40:28.360\nI'm looking everywhere.\n\n40:28.360 --> 40:31.360\nAnd there's Tuscany everywhere.\n\n40:31.360 --> 40:38.360\n360 degrees of Tuscany, which I'm recommending is the title of my biopic.\n\n40:38.360 --> 40:41.360\nPlease, please let it be hagiographic.\n\n40:41.360 --> 40:42.360\nIt will be.\n\n40:42.360 --> 40:44.360\nYeah, because I've never been to Tuscany.\n\n40:44.360 --> 40:48.360\nBecause you know what, in the first scene, you're burning your canvas.\n\n40:48.360 --> 40:50.360\nAnd just fuming over it.\n\n40:50.360 --> 40:53.360\nYou've spent hours painting it and you're just burning it.\n\n40:53.360 --> 40:56.360\nAnd a wife that I've never had, but that's an amalgam of all of my girlfriends comes in\n\n40:56.360 --> 40:59.360\nand goes, you need, you need.\n\n40:59.360 --> 41:02.360\nAnd then someone rides up on a donkey and goes, this is from the Pope.\n\n41:02.360 --> 41:07.360\nAnd you're like, shit.\n\n41:07.360 --> 41:09.360\nBecause you're in Tuscany.\n\n41:09.360 --> 41:10.360\nYeah, yeah.\n\n41:10.360 --> 41:12.360\nYeah, anyways, I don't know.\n\n41:12.360 --> 41:13.360\nIt's happening.\n\n41:13.360 --> 41:14.360\nIt's definitely happening.\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:19.360\nLike one look through these things and just the realization that it's happening within\n\n41:19.360 --> 41:22.360\nfive years, because these things are super low resolution.\n\n41:22.360 --> 41:24.360\nThey don't have proximity sensors on them.\n\n41:24.360 --> 41:28.360\nSo when you move your head, you get motion sickness very quickly.\n\n41:28.360 --> 41:34.360\nYou get like a weird nausea because of little tweaks that they need to make to this thing.\n\n41:34.360 --> 41:39.360\nOnce they make those tweaks and increase the resolution of these things, it's like unbelievable.\n\n41:39.360 --> 41:45.360\nI was talking to Rochester, they have a three month old baby.\n\n41:45.360 --> 41:52.360\nAnd in two years, we're talking about the Oculus Rift.\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:54.360\nThat's going to be that baby's baseline.\n\n41:54.360 --> 41:56.360\nThey're going to start out there.\n\n41:56.360 --> 41:58.360\nThat's going to be so cool.\n\n41:58.360 --> 42:00.360\nYeah, but it's going to be a pair of Ray-Bans.\n\n42:00.360 --> 42:02.360\nIt's not going to be a fucking ridiculous set of goggles.\n\n42:02.360 --> 42:06.360\nAnd then five years after that, it's going to be a patch you put on your temple.\n\n42:06.360 --> 42:08.360\nWell, it'll be already inserted in the way.\n\n42:08.360 --> 42:09.360\nI know this for a fact.\n\n42:09.360 --> 42:12.360\nI predicted jet packs in the 80s.\n\n42:12.360 --> 42:15.360\nLook, they happened eventually in the title sequence for the fall guy.\n\n42:15.360 --> 42:24.360\nBecause of this technology, this has created this philosophy that we're in a simulation.\n\n42:24.360 --> 42:27.360\nThis is something we always talk about, but they're testing right now.\n\n42:27.360 --> 42:32.360\nSomething that's actually accessible now, which is interesting because in Plato's cave,\n\n42:32.360 --> 42:36.360\nhe's using state-of-the-art technology to make his point.\n\n42:36.360 --> 42:38.360\nCandles, shadows.\n\n42:38.360 --> 42:40.360\nAnd I was like, think about it.\n\n42:40.360 --> 42:42.360\nAnd if he was saying that to a caveman pre-fire,\n\n42:42.360 --> 42:45.360\nthey'd go, hey, man, listen, I know you're trying to tell me that life is a dream,\n\n42:45.360 --> 42:50.360\nbut I don't know fire yet, let alone controlling the shadows and stuff.\n\n42:50.360 --> 42:56.360\nAnd this concept of actual video games have gotten so addictive and so immersive\n\n42:56.360 --> 42:59.360\nthat you and I kind of like talking about this have been on your podcast twice\n\n42:59.360 --> 43:01.360\nand we keep talking about it.\n\n43:01.360 --> 43:04.360\nI think there's two reasons we talk about it.\n\n43:04.360 --> 43:09.360\nOne, because there is a technological tsunami that's about to destroy society\n\n43:09.360 --> 43:16.360\nbecause the moment the technology advances to the point where that reality becomes more amazing,\n\n43:16.360 --> 43:21.360\nthen this reality becomes indistinguishable from this reality.\n\n43:21.360 --> 43:25.360\nWhen it becomes hagiographic, is that what you call it?\n\n43:25.360 --> 43:27.360\nLife becomes vestigial.\n\n43:27.360 --> 43:29.360\nWhen the myth is better than the reality.\n\n43:29.360 --> 43:31.360\nExactly, when that happens.\n\n43:31.360 --> 43:32.360\nLike movies are to me.\n\n43:32.360 --> 43:38.360\nYeah, already people are hooked on World of Warcraft or even movies are on these very low res.\n\n43:38.360 --> 43:40.360\nPeople won't want to travel, people already don't want to travel,\n\n43:40.360 --> 43:43.360\nbut people that feel like they should travel but don't have the...\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:49.360\nI know Tuscany's probably beautiful, but I really liked looking at fake low res Tuscany\n\n43:49.360 --> 43:51.360\nwith motion sickness through a pair of goggles,\n\n43:51.360 --> 43:55.360\nbecause it was more exciting because we have been as a species,\n\n43:55.360 --> 44:02.360\nwe are instinctively compelled to, I think, destroy ourselves.\n\n44:02.360 --> 44:04.360\nWe think create ourselves.\n\n44:04.360 --> 44:09.360\nCampbell would say we have like a blueprint on our spinal cord.\n\n44:09.360 --> 44:12.360\nThat's why we create the gods that we worship.\n\n44:12.360 --> 44:17.360\nWe have this fantasy that our purpose is to be gods.\n\n44:17.360 --> 44:19.360\nOur purpose is to create life.\n\n44:19.360 --> 44:21.360\nOur purpose is to change the weather.\n\n44:21.360 --> 44:22.360\nOur purpose is to defeat death.\n\n44:22.360 --> 44:24.360\nOur purpose is to teleport.\n\n44:24.360 --> 44:30.360\nOur purpose is to reach across the earth and grab the Loch Ness Monster by the neck\n\n44:30.360 --> 44:32.360\nand use it for salting our pizza.\n\n44:32.360 --> 44:33.360\nThat's it.\n\n44:33.360 --> 44:35.360\nThat's the point of everything.\n\n44:35.360 --> 44:39.360\nBy the way, that's exactly what I would do with the Loch Ness Monster.\n\n44:39.360 --> 44:40.360\nYou know why?\n\n44:40.360 --> 44:43.360\nBecause he's spicy.\n\n44:43.360 --> 44:45.360\nA lot of people don't think so because he's Scottish.\n\n44:45.360 --> 44:47.360\nThey think it's going to be bland.\n\n44:47.360 --> 44:50.360\nIt'll be salty because Scotland only has two spices.\n\n44:50.360 --> 44:52.360\nSalt and booze.\n\n44:52.360 --> 44:54.360\nHave you found that your pizza is salty?\n\n44:54.360 --> 44:56.360\nYour salt and freedom!\n\n44:56.360 --> 44:57.360\nYeah.\n\n44:57.360 --> 44:59.360\nYou can take it away, man.\n\n44:59.360 --> 45:03.360\nI thought you were going to take it away, man.\n\n45:03.360 --> 45:05.360\nI'd like a Scottish pizza.\n\n45:05.360 --> 45:09.360\nCan I get half Loch Ness salt, half freedom?\n\n45:09.360 --> 45:10.360\nAye.\n\n45:10.360 --> 45:12.360\nThat's all we got, man.\n\n45:12.360 --> 45:15.360\nIt'll be there in two and a half hours.\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:16.360\nWe're a little bit short tonight.\n\n45:16.360 --> 45:20.360\nIt's a great, great day for multi-car racing!\n\n45:20.360 --> 45:21.360\nAll right.\n\n45:21.360 --> 45:22.360\nWhat were you going to say, Jeff?\n\n45:22.360 --> 45:23.360\nSorry.\n\n45:25.360 --> 45:26.360\nDo you find that...\n\n45:26.360 --> 45:28.360\nI took an accident workshop in Congress.\n\n45:28.360 --> 45:29.360\nNo, you didn't.\n\n45:29.360 --> 45:31.360\nWe should talk about that.\n\n45:31.360 --> 45:32.360\nWe should talk about that rather than...\n\n45:32.360 --> 45:33.360\nDid you hear me?\n\n45:33.360 --> 45:34.360\nDid you really?\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:35.360\nYeah.\n\n45:35.360 --> 45:36.360\nWell, I didn't take it.\n\n45:36.360 --> 45:38.360\nThey gave it to me.\n\n45:38.360 --> 45:41.360\nThey thought that I would be better at improv if I knew how to say,\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:44.360\nIt's a great, great day for multi-car racing!\n\n45:44.360 --> 45:46.360\nEvery time someone said, Scottish!\n\n45:46.360 --> 45:47.360\nSo you're Jackie Stewart.\n\n45:47.360 --> 45:48.360\nYeah.\n\n45:48.360 --> 45:51.360\nI'm a wart on Rich Little's taint.\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:56.360\nHis taint was pretty smooth.\n\n45:56.360 --> 45:57.360\nYeah.\n\n45:57.360 --> 45:58.360\nThat's the irony.\n\n45:58.360 --> 46:00.360\nI think we already tried to...\n\n46:03.360 --> 46:07.360\nThe actual irony is, Rich Little's taint, incredibly distinctive,\n\n46:07.360 --> 46:10.360\nresembled no one else's taint to the world.\n\n46:10.360 --> 46:12.360\nA unique and singular taint.\n\n46:12.360 --> 46:14.360\nA master impressionist.\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:16.360\nHis taint was just...\n\n46:16.360 --> 46:17.360\nIt was only his.\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:19.360\nGod broke the mold.\n\n46:19.360 --> 46:21.360\nBut no one could ever know, and that's why.\n\n46:21.360 --> 46:24.360\nWhen virtual reality gets advanced enough,\n\n46:24.360 --> 46:28.360\nyou will be able to stand in his taint and look around.\n\n46:28.360 --> 46:30.360\nThis is Rich Little's taint.\n\n46:30.360 --> 46:33.360\nThat's not a day I look forward to talking about.\n\n46:33.360 --> 46:36.360\nWhat you were speaking of before, I could thrill to,\n\n46:36.360 --> 46:40.360\nbut you guys travel, ever?\n\n46:40.360 --> 46:41.360\nYou travel, right?\n\n46:41.360 --> 46:42.360\nYeah, a little bit.\n\n46:42.360 --> 46:43.360\nA little bit.\n\n46:43.360 --> 46:45.360\nBut you don't like traveling much, Dan, do you?\n\n46:45.360 --> 46:47.360\nMe and Jeff, I think, are kind of addicted to traveling.\n\n46:47.360 --> 46:55.360\nI think with my mouth, and so I've only been out of the English hegemony zone once.\n\n46:55.360 --> 46:57.360\nI was in Paris, where they still speak a ton of English.\n\n46:57.360 --> 46:58.360\nOf course.\n\n46:58.360 --> 47:00.360\nOr at least three pounds of it.\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:05.360\nAnd I was immediately, as I would have predicted, very uncomfortable.\n\n47:05.360 --> 47:07.360\nI roll with it.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:12.360\nBut the truth is, I'm walking around Paris, and I was like,\n\n47:12.360 --> 47:15.360\nI just feel absolutely useless and crippled.\n\n47:15.360 --> 47:18.360\nIt's my fault, because I never...\n\n47:18.360 --> 47:21.360\nI took two years of French, but didn't take...\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:23.360\nOh, no, we all took two years of French.\n\n47:23.360 --> 47:24.360\nAnd never took...\n\n47:24.360 --> 47:27.360\nEvery other country in the world speaks two languages.\n\n47:27.360 --> 47:32.360\nEiffel Tower looks like a big thing.\n\n47:32.360 --> 47:33.360\nGreat.\n\n47:33.360 --> 47:34.360\nWell, Greg has a great thing.\n\n47:34.360 --> 47:36.360\nBut I loved Dublin, because they spoke...\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:38.360\nSomething that I could decipher.\n\n47:38.360 --> 47:39.360\nI've learned something from Greg.\n\n47:39.360 --> 47:43.360\nGreg and I have traveled around the world a few countries that don't speak English.\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:44.360\nAnd Greg has this great thing.\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:50.360\nGreg actually keeps a book with paper in it, and he writes notes down.\n\n47:50.360 --> 47:52.360\nAnd he's a little pages of...\n\n47:52.360 --> 47:53.360\nWhat a cock.\n\n47:53.360 --> 47:54.360\nAll the...\n\n47:54.360 --> 47:55.360\nAll the...\n\n47:55.360 --> 47:56.360\nHe writes down notes.\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:58.360\nPaper.\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:02.360\nCast your mind out.\n\n48:02.360 --> 48:08.360\nIt's a surface that, with the pinch zoom function, disabled.\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:10.360\nSpeaking of which, Greg and I, you and I,\n\n48:10.360 --> 48:13.360\nwe were stuck in San Luis Obispo Airport for eight hours.\n\n48:13.360 --> 48:16.360\nAnd this little tiny airport with one plane that didn't show up.\n\n48:16.360 --> 48:17.360\nAnd there was a big...\n\n48:17.360 --> 48:18.360\nAnd there was a fucking...\n\n48:18.360 --> 48:20.360\nI think I might have talked about this on the show before,\n\n48:20.360 --> 48:23.360\nbut there was a toddler walking around and haranguing everybody.\n\n48:23.360 --> 48:25.360\nAnd everybody wanted to murder this child.\n\n48:25.360 --> 48:27.360\nBut you can't, because you're in an airport in 9-11,\n\n48:27.360 --> 48:28.360\nand you're fucking...\n\n48:28.360 --> 48:29.360\nYou can't...\n\n48:29.360 --> 48:31.360\nIt's the reason you can't.\n\n48:31.360 --> 48:33.360\nThe reason you can't is 9-11.\n\n48:33.360 --> 48:35.360\nGoddamn that 9-11.\n\n48:35.360 --> 48:38.360\nIn the old days, you could fucking Patriot Act.\n\n48:38.360 --> 48:41.360\nYou could smoke on the plane, and you could throttle the child.\n\n48:41.360 --> 48:42.360\nThank you.\n\n48:42.360 --> 48:43.360\nThank you.\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:44.360\nThey're good old days.\n\n48:44.360 --> 48:46.360\nAnd you got off a fucking Hawaii on the Hawaiian Airlines,\n\n48:46.360 --> 48:48.360\nand they gave you a lay, and it was sexy, and it was good.\n\n48:48.360 --> 48:51.360\nBut now you can't kill a three-year-old.\n\n48:51.360 --> 48:53.360\nBut the little baby had like a news week,\n\n48:53.360 --> 48:56.360\nand there was nothing to do in this plane that wouldn't fucking show.\n\n48:56.360 --> 49:00.360\nAnd there was a baby, and we heard this laughter behind us,\n\n49:00.360 --> 49:03.360\nand this toddler was looking at a magazine,\n\n49:03.360 --> 49:05.360\nand it was trying to iPad it.\n\n49:05.360 --> 49:06.360\nIt was trying to swipe.\n\n49:06.360 --> 49:07.360\nWow.\n\n49:07.360 --> 49:11.360\nAnd the baby hadn't mastered page-turning technology.\n\n49:11.360 --> 49:14.360\nHe couldn't understand why he was moving his hand across a thing,\n\n49:14.360 --> 49:16.360\nand the surface wasn't changing the image,\n\n49:16.360 --> 49:21.360\nand everybody laughed, and I wanted to just vomit tears.\n\n49:21.360 --> 49:25.360\nI mean, to be fair, to be fucking fair, though,\n\n49:25.360 --> 49:26.360\nnot a single person...\n\n49:26.360 --> 49:27.360\nDon't be fair to...\n\n49:27.360 --> 49:28.360\nDon't coddle this child, Harmon.\n\n49:28.360 --> 49:33.360\nNo, just to bring back perspective so that we don't feel like the world is falling apart\n\n49:33.360 --> 49:36.360\nbecause of that, because that makes me feel queasy, too.\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:40.360\nBut then you have to remember that not a single person in this room...\n\n49:40.360 --> 49:43.360\nI say that now, I'm going to make one guy stand up and say,\n\n49:43.360 --> 49:45.360\nI know how to do it, but not a single person...\n\n49:45.360 --> 49:46.360\nI know how to do it.\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:47.360\nSorry.\n\n49:47.360 --> 49:52.360\nNot a single person in this room can make a piece of paper out of a log.\n\n49:52.360 --> 49:54.360\nThat is technology.\n\n49:54.360 --> 50:00.360\nWe are as beholden to the guy that invented paper as we are to Steve Jobs' jobs.\n\n50:00.360 --> 50:02.360\nOr Job.\n\n50:02.360 --> 50:06.360\nThe technology...\n\n50:06.360 --> 50:08.360\nWe build on it, build on it, build on it.\n\n50:08.360 --> 50:10.360\n40% of this audience is wearing eyeglasses.\n\n50:10.360 --> 50:14.360\n100% of this audience speaks an alphabet that was invented after...\n\n50:14.360 --> 50:17.360\nSo it's a mimetic society.\n\n50:17.360 --> 50:18.360\nIt's a genetic one.\n\n50:18.360 --> 50:20.360\nOtherwise, we'd be fucking lions or ants.\n\n50:20.360 --> 50:21.360\nAnd so that kid...\n\n50:21.360 --> 50:23.360\nOr bees.\n\n50:23.360 --> 50:26.360\nThat kid that doesn't know how to turn a page and may never turn a page,\n\n50:26.360 --> 50:30.360\nhe could end up being, you know, president of Earth.\n\n50:30.360 --> 50:34.360\nAnd he did in a futuristic episode I wrote,\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:38.360\nand then I had to kill his mother because so he wouldn't be born\n\n50:38.360 --> 50:44.360\nin case he made peace that didn't defeat Kim Jong-un.\n\n50:44.360 --> 50:48.360\nIt's a lot like that Harlan Ellis in the Star Trek episode.\n\n50:48.360 --> 50:54.360\nI learned from Greg, we were in Sarajevo.\n\n50:54.360 --> 50:58.360\nWe were in Yugoslavia or the former Republic of Yugoslavia, whatever the fuck we were.\n\n50:58.360 --> 50:59.360\nFyrom.\n\n50:59.360 --> 51:01.360\nThat was Macedonia, right?\n\n51:01.360 --> 51:03.360\nYou guys went to Fyrom?\n\n51:03.360 --> 51:04.360\nFyrom, yeah.\n\n51:04.360 --> 51:07.360\nAnd we went to... God, what was that?\n\n51:07.360 --> 51:09.360\nMacedonia was really bad.\n\n51:09.360 --> 51:10.360\nKosovo?\n\n51:10.360 --> 51:11.360\nKosovo, yeah.\n\n51:11.360 --> 51:14.360\nAre there citizens of Fyrom called Thyroids?\n\n51:14.360 --> 51:15.360\nYes.\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:19.360\nIt's Fyrom, the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia.\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:21.360\nBut Greg has a little piece of paper and he writes it down,\n\n51:21.360 --> 51:22.360\nall the pleases and thank yous.\n\n51:22.360 --> 51:23.360\nHello, how do you do?\n\n51:23.360 --> 51:25.360\nSorry, good day.\n\n51:25.360 --> 51:27.360\nYou write those things down, and you don't have to know everything\n\n51:27.360 --> 51:29.360\nwhen you travel to a foreign place.\n\n51:29.360 --> 51:32.360\nIf you walk in, you go dobrodon, and they go like...\n\n51:32.360 --> 51:33.360\nDobroverche.\n\n51:33.360 --> 51:35.360\nYeah, and they freak out.\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:38.360\nAnd Greg's like, I use that all the time.\n\n51:38.360 --> 51:41.360\nWhenever I go anywhere, I make sure I know how to say all the polite things\n\n51:41.360 --> 51:42.360\nthat you can walk in.\n\n51:42.360 --> 51:45.360\nYou learn how to stay, what is it?\n\n51:45.360 --> 51:46.360\nSteimer.\n\n51:46.360 --> 51:47.360\nYeah.\n\n51:47.360 --> 51:48.360\nSteimer.\n\n51:48.360 --> 51:51.360\nI did a show, which means like, what's up, what kind of...\n\n51:51.360 --> 51:52.360\nLike, what's happening?\n\n51:52.360 --> 51:53.360\nAnd like...\n\n51:53.360 --> 51:54.360\nCorrect.\n\n51:54.360 --> 51:55.360\nCerebral creation.\n\n51:55.360 --> 51:56.360\nCerebral creation.\n\n51:56.360 --> 51:59.360\nAnd so I was in Chicago, I did a gig with Luceva Voom,\n\n51:59.360 --> 52:01.360\nand I met some people and they took me to a club\n\n52:01.360 --> 52:05.360\nand it was run by these giant Eastern European guys\n\n52:05.360 --> 52:07.360\nwho hated my guts on site.\n\n52:07.360 --> 52:09.360\nI went with this girl who they knew\n\n52:09.360 --> 52:11.360\nand they didn't like me at all, but they were...\n\n52:11.360 --> 52:14.360\nThey were like six, seven, a giant hockey player looking dudes\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:16.360\nin suits, and they wanted to murder me.\n\n52:16.360 --> 52:18.360\nAnd they were either Serbian or Croatian,\n\n52:18.360 --> 52:20.360\nbut you can't guess wrong on that one.\n\n52:20.360 --> 52:23.360\nLike, if you think about an option.\n\n52:23.360 --> 52:26.360\nYeah, if you think like, guessing wrong on Kiwi versus Ozzy,\n\n52:26.360 --> 52:27.360\nlike, that's not...\n\n52:27.360 --> 52:28.360\nNo.\n\n52:28.360 --> 52:31.360\nYou know, Japanese and Chinese, they love that.\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:32.360\nYeah.\n\n52:32.360 --> 52:34.360\nThey're like, no, no, you got it wrong.\n\n52:34.360 --> 52:35.360\nSame difference.\n\n52:35.360 --> 52:36.360\nYeah.\n\n52:36.360 --> 52:38.360\nThese guys hated my guts, they were giants,\n\n52:38.360 --> 52:40.360\nand they just were like, just glowering at me,\n\n52:40.360 --> 52:43.360\nand I went up to one of them,\n\n52:43.360 --> 52:45.360\nand they wouldn't let me buy a drink,\n\n52:45.360 --> 52:46.360\nthey wanted me out of there,\n\n52:46.360 --> 52:47.360\nand it was really like,\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:48.360\nthey were being really hostile and strange,\n\n52:48.360 --> 52:51.360\nand I said, are you Croatian?\n\n52:51.360 --> 52:52.360\nJust guessed.\n\n52:52.360 --> 52:53.360\nDo you know what?\n\n52:53.360 --> 52:55.360\nI had a 50-50 and he goes,\n\n52:55.360 --> 52:57.360\nI mean, assuming I was even right about that,\n\n52:57.360 --> 52:59.360\nbecause his name was like Draco.\n\n52:59.360 --> 53:00.360\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n53:00.360 --> 53:01.360\nYeah, something like that.\n\n53:01.360 --> 53:02.360\nGragula, yeah.\n\n53:02.360 --> 53:04.360\nI will bury you.\n\n53:04.360 --> 53:06.360\nHis name was Milo, or something like that.\n\n53:06.360 --> 53:07.360\nI said, are you Croatian?\n\n53:07.360 --> 53:09.360\nHe goes, big, long pause.\n\n53:09.360 --> 53:10.360\nIt felt like about a minute.\n\n53:10.360 --> 53:13.360\nAnd he was like, yes.\n\n53:13.360 --> 53:15.360\nAnd I went, because of Greg,\n\n53:15.360 --> 53:17.360\nI went, Steimer.\n\n53:17.360 --> 53:20.360\nAnd he goes, what the fuck?\n\n53:20.360 --> 53:22.360\nBecause of who?\n\n53:22.360 --> 53:23.360\nWhat does it mean?\n\n53:23.360 --> 53:25.360\nYou know what your answer to Steimer is?\n\n53:25.360 --> 53:26.360\nNiste speciale.\n\n53:26.360 --> 53:27.360\nNiste speciale.\n\n53:27.360 --> 53:28.360\nNothing special?\n\n53:28.360 --> 53:29.360\nNothing special, man.\n\n53:29.360 --> 53:31.360\nAre you saying you learned how to say no worries, bro?\n\n53:31.360 --> 53:33.360\nYes, yes.\n\n53:33.360 --> 53:35.360\nHe went over to his buddies,\n\n53:35.360 --> 53:37.360\nand he goes, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,\n\n53:37.360 --> 53:40.360\ngo, go, go, go, go,

them for the rest of the night.\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:49.360\nThey took your wallet out of your pocket?\n\n53:49.360 --> 53:51.360\nNo, no, they wouldn't let me get my wallet out of my pocket.\n\n53:51.360 --> 53:52.360\nOh, okay.\n\n53:52.360 --> 53:54.360\nThey pulled my pants down.\n\n53:54.360 --> 53:56.360\nThey put their penises in my asshole.\n\n53:56.360 --> 53:58.360\nI had

racists.\n\n54:03.360 --> 54:05.360\nLong story short,\n\n54:05.360 --> 54:07.360\nthey fucked me into the dirt.\n\n54:07.360 --> 54:09.360\nThat's what we learned in Game of Thrones, yeah.\n\n54:09.360 --> 54:11.360\nOh, fuck you into the dirt.\n\n54:11.360 --> 54:13.360\nOh, fuck you into the dirt.\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:15.360\nThat episode almost went fucking wow.\n\n54:15.360 --> 54:17.360\nYou know who we do to runners, don't you?\n\n54:17.360 --> 54:19.360\nNo, I don't.\n\n54:19.360 --> 54:21.360\nTell me. You bring them back.\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:23.360\nI said, fuck you into dirt.\n\n54:23.360 --> 54:25.360\nWhat the hell? What?\n\n54:25.360 --> 54:27.360\nNo, not fuck you into dirt.\n\n54:27.360 --> 54:29.360\nWe're going to fuck you into the dirt.\n\n54:29.360 --> 54:31.360\nThey're not going to make you dirt.\n\n54:31.360 --> 54:33.360\nI missed this episode.

doesn't snap.\n\n01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.360\nThe bag slides off his head and you know, it doesn't, nothing happens.\n\n01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.520\nI'm sharpie, so are you at the gate,

one\n\n01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.520\nof my spell sheets.\n\n01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.800\nYeah, I must have lost it.\n\n01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.760\nI can't tell if knock is a level two spell.\n\n01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.600\nKnock's a level two, two spell.\n\n01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.200\nOkay, I was gonna try to cast knock on it without touching it.\n\n01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.680\nI don't want to touch this stuff.\n\n01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.080\nWas it knock open?\n\n01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.520\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:50.400\nWith a loud knocking sound, knocking, with a loud sound, the gate is blasted open.\n\n01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.600\nImmediately, your binds are dissolved and you can free your limbs again.\n\n01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.320\nThank God.\n\n01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.640\nBut you hear a sound behind you, Sharpie, coming out of the, you know, the sound behind\n\n01:27:00.640 -->

01:27:11.960\nYou see six shadowy humanoids approaching.\n\n01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.960\nUh oh.\n\n01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.080\nOh, I hold my hand up in friendly greeting.\n\n01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.400\nOne of them holds their hand up.\n\n01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.920\nIt appears to be the shape of a blade.\n\n01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:21.920\nWait what?\n\n01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.280\nOne of them holds their hand up.\n\n01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.840\nIt appears to be the shape of her blade.\n\n01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.120\nOne of them holds their hand up.\n\n01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.800\nYeah, what's your armor class?\n\n01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800\nTheir hand.\n\n01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.360\nI'll answer that in one second.\n\n01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.600\nYou said their hand is the shape of a blade?\n\n01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.040\nLike, like Ryan Reynolds character from the Wolverine movie?\n\n01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.240\nLike, yeah.\n\n01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240\nAlright.\n\n01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.400\nOr they're just holding a sword.\n\n01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.160\nNo, it's the shape of a blade.\n\n01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.000\nIt's like muted into a blade.\n\n01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.240\nDefinitely muted into a blade.\n\n01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.520\nAnd it strikes you dealing 12 damage.\n\n01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.560\nMy armor class, by the way, is a million.\n\n01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.840\nI can cure medium wounds.\n\n01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.840\nThat's true.\n\n01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840\nDefinitely you can.\n\n01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.040\nCan I, uh, is, is, am I able to hide in the shadows?\n\n01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.440\nUm, you can try, definitely.\n\n01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.920\nNo, only Stevie Nicks is.\n\n01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:20.920\nYou attempt to conceal yourselves in the shadows.\n\n01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:21.920\nHopefully the shadowy figures will see you.\n\n01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:30.440\nI will cure you with my medium healing wound healing powers.\n\n01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:41.360\nLet me squat upon thine face and dispense the mucus that does make one whole again.\n\n01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.600\nOkay, 19 hit points of damage.\n\n01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.600\nWow.\n\n01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600\nTo me?\n\n01:28:45.600 -->

01:28:50.280\nWelcome back.\n\n01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280\nYour dreams were your ticket out.\n\n01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.960\nDoes anyone have a, have a, have a sheet in their stuff that's, that has level two\n\n01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960\nspells on it?\n\n01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.960\nAre you fucking joking?\n\n01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.040\nI have a piece of fucking graphite paper here with me.\n\n01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040\nNot me.\n\n01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.520\nHow many of these shadow warriors are there?\n\n01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.520\nUh, there's six of them.\n\n01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:09.520\nI fire two arrows.\n\n01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.120\nYou know, now you can fire three arrows.\n\n01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.120\nOh really?\n\n01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120\nYeah.\n\n01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120\nWhat did that happen?\n\n01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120\nUh, you got a magic bow.\n\n01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120\nWhoa.\n\n01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120\nI fire three arrows.\n\n01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:30.720\nSo I'm going to spin two arrows for so long.\n\n01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:38.960\nWait, while she fires the arrows, I quickly use my knife to pry off three of my fingernails.\n\n01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.040\nAnd then I, I do a, I try to do a backstab on one of the shadow beings.\n\n01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.520\nDo you hate Camel, not Gianna?\n\n01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.320\nI don't, I love Camel, I don't like his character.\n\n01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.440\nOh, it'd be so funny if you hated Camel.\n\n01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:57.280\nTwo of the arrows plant themselves in the figure dealing, uh, nine damage, um, at the\n\n01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:03.040\nsame time you attempt your backstab maneuver, but, uh, it doesn't seem to go as planned.\n\n01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.360\nThey smile in your face all the time they want to.\n\n01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.120\nAll right, so, so, uh, what, what is the arrangement of these, uh, these figures?\n\n01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.880\nWhere are they standing in relationship tests?\n\n01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:16.920\nThere's about three that are up on Sharpie and he's inside this gate and you guys are\n\n01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.760\noutside this gate and then there's three farther back.\n\n01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.280\nDidn't he bust the gate open?\n\n01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.360\nHe did from the inside, but they're farther inside.\n\n01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.040\nSo can I come through the gate?\n\n01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.040\nDefinitely.\n\n01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.040\nOkay.\n\n01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.160\nI, I, I jump through the gate and take a, and I do a flaming sword attack on the, on\n\n01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.960\nthe nearest, uh, uh, figure.\n\n01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960\nThat happens.\n\n01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.720\nWith your flaming sword, you charge directly towards the, the most menacing of the shadow\n\n01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:49.440\nshapes and slice, an incredible slice across the dark foe dealing some damage.\n\n01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.440\nOh shit.\n\n01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:56.120\nOh, that was almost off the table.\n\n01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.600\nDealing 16 damage.\n\n01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.600\nYeah.\n\n01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:02.760\nI can't wait to find out what the non-conflict resolution of this encounter would have been.\n\n01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.880\nI know, we brought you a shadow cake.\n\n01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:09.760\nThe guy, the guy had a sword for a hand, right?\n\n01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.760\nThe lead shadow falls.\n\n01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:16.680\nAll I did was jump over his tendril having shadow fence and open the door.\n\n01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.400\nThe rest of the shadows pour out.\n\n01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.720\nThey actually flow past Sharpie and directly towards Mulraine and Chris.\n\n01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:25.200\nMay I summon a magical beast?\n\n01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.640\nAfter this you can.\n\n01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.960\nCan I apologize?\n\n01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.560\nCan I kick some mighty fucking dick?\n\n01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.520\nAll of those things can happen in due time, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:45.200\nLet me get some attack rolls out of the way, it'll be a blast.\n\n01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.200\nAre you okay?\n\n01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.200\nNo.\n\n01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:55.320\nYeah, yeah, I'm, I'm fine, I'm having the best time, objectively.\n\n01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:02.560\nAnyway, two of the shadow creatures approach Mulraine and Chris and strike deadly blows\n\n01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:08.640\non their arms and legs with their bladed limbs, dealing some damage.\n\n01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640\nOh shit.\n\n01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:15.120\nMulraine takes 15 damage and Christopher takes 9.\n\n01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:21.880\nThe other two shadows, one of their limbs become hazy and smoky like hazy and smoke.\n\n01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:26.920\nAnd their limbs, and the smoke that they, you know, they have for their now limbs flows\n\n01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.920\ndirectly into the throat of a quark as if attempting to strangle them.\n\n01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.560\nYou feel a dark presence invade your body.\n\n01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:36.440\nIt won't be the last time.\n\n01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.440\nOh shit.\n\n01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.000\nNow with that costume on.\n\n01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.040\nYou feel yourself choking and like it's getting harder to move, but otherwise you're not affected.\n\n01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.360\nAnd I mean you're choking, but yeah.\n\n01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.360\nAll right.\n\n01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.560\nCan I respond to that or do I, who moved first?\n\n01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.840\nI think it was, I think this is Mulraine's turn now.\n\n01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:57.320\nUh, I summon magical beast.\n\n01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.320\nOkay.\n\n01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.560\nSo you can summon some sort of magical beast with that.\n\n01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.560\nShadow Eater.\n\n01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.560\nNope.\n\n01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.560\nClose.\n\n01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.560\nClose.\n\n01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.080\nLet's edit this out, this whole thing.\n\n01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.240\nShe can't summon a squid.\n\n01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.240\nThat's the thing.\n\n01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.240\nDire rat, eagle, monkey, octopus, owl, porpoise, snake, wolf.\n\n01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:16.240\nPorpoise.\n\n01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.240\nPorpoise.\n\n01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.240\nSummon the porpoise.\n\n01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.240\nSummon the porpoise.\n\n01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:28.520\nI think I just always want aquatic creatures to be summoned to terrestrial space.\n\n01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.560\nYou really have 4chan message board.\n\n01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:33.720\nLike you just want to see suffering.\n\n01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.080\nYou just want to watch a creature die in front of you.\n\n01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.960\nYou can imagine that without us doing anything.\n\n01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.280\nIt's not visually happening.\n\n01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:49.080\nUh, because this creature reads to me as the most magical beast.\n\n01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.920\nThe most fearless.\n\n01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.560\nAnd uh, maniacal, I summon the monkey.\n\n01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.060\nNice.\n\n01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:04.840\nWith a snap of your fingers and a wave of your arms, a monkey leaps into existence.\n\n01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:10.840\nCover me when I sleep.\n\n01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.840\nCover me.\n\n01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840\nNobody?\n\n01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.840\nPeter Gabriel?\n\n01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.360\nDon't you know you got us?\n\n01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.600\nHe appears as if he was like jumping through the air.\n\n01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.680\nYeah, he jumps like, he dissolves into existence, jumping directly onto one of the shadow creatures\n\n01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.680\nand is now on his head trying to like beat him or like pummel him or rip his hair out.\n\n01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:32.080\nBut it's not, it's not going so well.\n\n01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.080\nIt's not doing any damage.\n\n01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.080\nIt tickles me.\n\n01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:44.440\nI remember my first time summoning a monkey.\n\n01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:51.440\nI was 13 the first time I summoned the monkey.\n\n01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:52.440\nOh boy.\n\n01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.440\nI was in the bathroom and my mom was like, get out of there.\n\n01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440\nWhat are you doing?\n\n01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.440\nI yell out encouragingly, uh, go marbles, go!\n\n01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.440\nMarbles!\n\n01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.440\nThat happens.\n\n01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440\nYeah, that happens.\n\n01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440\nIt's Chris's turn.\n\n01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440\nGo marbles, go.\n\n01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:21.440\nIs our goal to delight these foes into a submission?\n\n01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:27.440\nDoes he have a little hat on?\n\n01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.440\nYeah, put a birthday hat on him.\n\n01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:44.440\nI just love the juxtaposition of Spencer in a bad mood so serious and having to say,\n\n01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:45.440\nyou summon a monkey.\n\n01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:46.440\nHe appears.\n\n01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.440\nI'm not in a bad mood, you guys.\n\n01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440\nNo, I know.\n\n01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.440\nI'm sorry, Spencer.\n\n01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:54.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.440\nNo, don't be sorry.\n\n01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.440\nIt's okay.\n\n01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.440\nWhat did the monkey do to the shadow things?\n\n01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.440\nHe didn't do any damage.\n\n01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440\nWell, you delighted them.\n\n01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440\nHe delighted them.\n\n01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.440\nYeah, it certainly was entertaining for all of us.\n\n01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.440\nThey called their wives and told them that they loved their wives, their shadow wives.\n\n01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.440\nThat's what happened.\n\n01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.440\nI'm watching an ape named Marbles try to attack me.\n\n01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.440\nI just wanted to make sure you're okay, darling.\n\n01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:22.440\nI'll be home after eight.\n\n01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.440\nSo it's Chris's turn.\n\n01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.440\nThat's Duncan.\n\n01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.440\nOh, sorry.\n\n01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:36.440\nWell, I eat a high cost for all breakfasts.\n\n01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:40.440\nHave we hurt any of these things at all?\n\n01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.440\nI knocked one down, right?\n\n01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.440\nYeah, you cut one down.\n\n01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.440\nIt's not moving.\n\n01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:46.440\nIt's not moving.\n\n01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:50.440\nSo I go to that being and try to give him CPR.\n\n01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n\n01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.440\nI don't do that.\n\n01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.440\nMaybe we should run.\n\n01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440\nDoes it seem like we can run you guys?\n\n01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.440\nWhy don't we just run?\n\n01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:04.440\nJump upon my back, all of you, and you on cocoa and whatnot.\n\n01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.440\nAnd I could throw my blinding bombs at the shadow beast,\n\n01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.440\nand then we'll just get the fuck out of here.\n\n01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:17.440\nMost of that plan is good other than the fact that only two people can fit on.\n\n01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440\nI've been running my whole life.\n\n01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.440\nI'll stay behind as a distraction.\n\n01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440\nYou guys go.\n\n01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:31.440\nLeave him. He is too slow, for he is Kamal's character,\n\n01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.440\nand shall live to die another day.\n\n01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.440\nWell, we have shadow cocoa, too, right?\n\n01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.440\nSo that's four people?\n\n01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440\nYes.\n\n01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.440\nFuckin' let's do it.\n\n01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.440\nNot runnin'!\n\n01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.440\nWhy?\n\n01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:52.440\nI feel a monologue coming on.\n\n01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.440\nJump upon my back, be not shy.\n\n01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.440\nWhat if Hitler had run from...\n\n01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.440\nThe World War II would have been six months instead of five and a half years.\n\n01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.440\nHe did. He killed himself.\n\n01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440\nThe first example off the top of my head, wrong one to grab.\n\n01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.440\nOkay, shitty example.\n\n01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:14.440\nWhat if everyone Hitler fought had run?\n\n01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.440\nWhat if George Washington ran from the Delaware?\n\n01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.440\nWhat if dirt ran from itself?\n\n01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440\nWhat if the sky would be made of dirt?\n\n01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.440\nHe's right!\n\n01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.440\nWhat if...\n\n01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440\nHe's right, he's right.\n\n01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.440\nWe should stay and fight these invincible shadow beings.\n\n01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.440\nHe's right. Marble's the monkey out.\n\n01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:39.440\nAfter Marble's...\n\n01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.440\nDo I have any fuckin' powers here that I can...\n\n01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.440\nYou can stomp on people.\n\n01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.440\nYou can stab people with your guard.\n\n01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:49.440\nWatch me fuckin' work.\n\n01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.440\nLet's go rodeo on these dicks.\n\n01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440\nAlright.\n\n01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440\nSo you wanna stab him?\n\n01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:01.440\nHoney, I wanna do everything I can to get out of this.\n\n01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.440\nGreat proofs, everybody.\n\n01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.440\nIf he's gonna run, then I'm gonna kick ass.\n\n01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.440\nSpencer.\n\n01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:09.440\nWhat's up?\n\n01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.440\nOh, I'm just resolving an attack real quick.\n\n01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440\nHold up, you guys.\n\n01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440\nTerrific.\n\n01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440\nYou deal.\n\n01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:18.440\nNo, no, charging towards one of the shadowy foes.\n\n01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.440\nYou strike them directly with your horn, dealing 16 damage.\n\n01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440\nAlright.\n\n01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.440\nThat is precisely what I'm talking about.\n\n01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440\nWhat?\n\n01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.440\nMic bump.\n\n01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.440\nBump.\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440\nWas there a question?\n\n01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.440\nSo how many foes are left now?\n\n01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.440\nLet me know when it's my turn.\n\n01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:38.440\nThere's still five.\n\n01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.440\nJesus Christ.\n\n01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.440\nWait, I didn't get to throw my blinding bombs.\n\n01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.440\nThat's true.\n\n01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.440\nI thought you changed your mind up.\n\n01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.440\nI did.\n\n01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.440\nI could still throw the...\n\n01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.440\nYou could throw all sorts of stuff, man.\n\n01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440\nOh, okay.\n\n01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.440\nThrow the blinding bombs and then let's kick ass.\n\n01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.440\nI throw to create a distraction.\n\n01:39:52.440 --> 01:40:01.440\nI take just like one small hit from one of my vials of acid and throw three smoke bombs.\n\n01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.440\nDo I...\n\n01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.440\nI throw three blinding bombs at the shadow beasts.\n\n01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.440\nThrowing three blinding bombs at the feet of the shadow beasts.\n\n01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:13.440\nIt just sounds like a euphemism that a drunk uncle would use at Thanksgiving.\n\n01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.440\nLet me throw one of my blinding bombs on you.\n\n01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.440\nThis is the worst Thanksgiving ever.\n\n01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.440\nI feel hurdy.\n\n01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:28.440\nThat's just the blinding bombs.\n\n01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440\nI don't know what's happening.\n\n01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440\nSpencer, if we lose you, we're fucked.\n\n01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.440\nBlinding bombs.\n\n01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440\nYeah, no, they work.\n\n01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440\nThe people are blind now.\n\n01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440\nOh.\n\n01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.440\nJump upon my back and Coco's back and let's fuck us off.\n\n01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.440\nI'm not running.\n\n01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.440\nIt's not running.\n\n01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:54.440\nIt's called galloping.\n\n01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.440\nDiscussion is the better part of valor.\n\n01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440\nBe not that so proud.\n\n01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440\nLove has no pride when I call out your name.\n\n01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440\nAnd where will we go?\n\n01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:05.440\nTo a place where there's no more shadow people with swords for hands?\n\n01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.440\nJesus, fuck, you burned my forest to the ground, you cocksucker.\n\n01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:11.440\nCan't you fucking jump on my back and run with me for a while?\n\n01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:18.440\nIs it possible, though, that these shadows, if we've vanquished these shadow people,\n\n01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440\nthat we'll get our shadows back?\n\n01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.440\nOr maybe they're the embodiments of our shadows in some way?\n\n01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.440\nOr no, are they just guardians of...\n\n01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.440\nMakes sense to me.\n\n01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.440\nIt makes sense.\n\n01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.440\nIt makes sense.\n\n01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.440\nYou're looking at them, they don't seem like they look like your shadows,\n\n01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440\nbut that still might be the case.\n\n01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:37.440\nCan I give Marbles some of my arrows?\n\n01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.440\nWould you toss them to her?\n\n01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:45.440\nOh, it's a shame.\n\n01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.440\nYou thought Marbles was a guy?\n\n01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.440\nI did, I did, I did.\n\n01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:53.440\nI thought he was a plucky little fellow.\n\n01:41:53.440 --> 01:42:00.440\nI give Madame Marbles five of my arrows and I say,\n\n01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.440\nyou know what to do with these.\n\n01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.440\nThe idea being that Marbles is going to take those arrows\n\n01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.440\nand stab the shadows in the head.\n\n01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.440\nBecause Marbles is very agile.\n\n01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440\nShe's a monkey.\n\n01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.440\nShe's a monkey.\n\n01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.440\nThat's true.\n\n01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:25.440\nBut she identifies as male gender-wise, but her sexuality is female.\n\n01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.440\nWhat's happening?\n\n01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.440\nArrows?\n\n01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.440\nMarbles is going to try to stab five shadows with five arrows.\n\n01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.440\nMarbles has something to prove.\n\n01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.440\nAs it happens, Marbles doesn't have anything to prove.\n\n01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440\nAnyway, you give her the arrows,\n\n01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.440\nbut she doesn't seem very confused.\n\n01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.440\nWhat is happening?\n\n01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:53.440\nA good time.\n\n01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.440\nSo Marbles doesn't have anything to prove.\n\n01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440\nSo, side question, with these magical beasts,\n\n01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:04.440\ndo they have no wants or they're just fucking animals?\n\n01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.440\nOr do they have personalities?\n\n01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440\nCan you just tell me how Marbles felt?\n\n01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:13.440\nI said she didn't have anything to prove.\n\n01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.440\nYeah.\n\n01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.440\nThat's a possession.\n\n01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.440\nSomething to prove, right?\n\n01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.440\nWell, I was thinking like, I don't know,\n\n01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:23.440\nlike Marbles' parents said,\n\n01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.440\nhey Marbles, you'll never mount to anything.\n\n01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.440\nYou'll never murder a shadow creature.\n\n01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440\nWell, it brings up an interesting question.\n\n01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440\nWhat are some of these beasts?\n\n01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440\nWhere do they come from?\n\n01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440\nThey come from an alternate plane, actually, yeah.\n\n01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440\nWhere they're just hanging out?\n\n01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440\nDo they have lives of their own?\n\n01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440\nYeah, they have it, and then they get pulled through,\n\n01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.440\nand then they're confused,\n\n01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.440\nand they attack whatever looks the most threatening.\n\n01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:46.440\nSo Marbles might have had something to prove, maybe.\n\n01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440\nBut you're saying that Marbles doesn't.\n\n01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440\nI'm saying, you know, I'll redact that\n\n01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.440\nand say there's no way of knowing.\n\n01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440\nShould I fuck Marbles?\n\n01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440\nYes.\n\n01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:00.440\nLet's make sure that Marbles has something to prove.\n\n01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.440\nI'm only asking.\n\n01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.440\nI'm going to.\n\n01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440\nI'm saying, should I or should I not fuck Marbles?\n\n01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440\nI can't say what you should or shouldn't do.\n\n01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440\nCan I say something?\n\n01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440\nYes.\n\n01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.440\nIf you're gonna fuck the monkey, will you fuck me first?\n\n01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:15.440\nYes!\n\n01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.440\nAll right.\n\n01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440\nI will sever my emotional ties with Marbles.\n\n01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:26.440\nYou know what, actually fuck me after you fuck the monkey.\n\n01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:32.440\nWhy waste a chance to get extra-dimensional aids?\n\n01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.440\nWell, yeah.\n\n01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.440\nRight now, Christopher, I like where you're going with this,\n\n01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.440\nbut right now we dazzle these shadow figures.\n\n01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:45.440\nThey're blinded right now.\n\n01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.440\nYep.\n\n01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.440\nThat's the time to fuck, my man.\n\n01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.440\nLook, I'm hard as a fucking diamond right now.\n\n01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.440\nMe too.\n\n01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.440\nI would like to cast Charm Person on one of the shadow creatures\n\n01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.440\nwhen it's my turn, because it's a level one spell.\n\n01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440\nCharm Person.\n\n01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.440\nIt has no effect.\n\n01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:13.440\nI go into a barbarian rage, I go into a berserk rage.\n\n01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.440\nI jump astride Marbles, and I take out my far sword,\n\n01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.440\nand I go on Marbles, and we run towards him,\n\n01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:25.440\nand taking out my far sword, I hold it out like a clothesline\n\n01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.440\nand try to slice through all of them,\n\n01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.440\nlike I'm cutting down them all, like a bunch of trees.\n\n01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.440\nHow big do you think Marbles is?\n\n01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.440\nI was...\n\n01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:39.440\nFive-five?\n\n01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.440\nMake Ryan-sized?\n\n01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.440\nI guess I could have done a better job.\n\n01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.440\nI was always thinking of Marbles as like a marmoset-sized.\n\n01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.440\nForget Marbles, I jump astride Tylenol.\n\n01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440\nI go, Tylenol, it's you and me, baby.\n\n01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.440\nLet's roll.\n\n01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:59.440\nI jump astride Tylenol's back in a berserker rage,\n\n01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.440\nand I grab a fistful of maine,\n\n01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.440\nand I pull Marbles' torment and I go,\n\n01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.440\nwe're gonna go in there.\n\n01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:15.440\nTwo separate people, but we're coming out.\n\n01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.440\nOne...\n\n01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.440\nFucked monkey.\n\n01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:24.440\nAnd I give him a little spur, a little boot,\n\n01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440\nand do his haunches, and I go,\n\n01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:30.440\nand I un-weald, un-sheath my far sword\n\n01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.440\nand try to slice down the shadow figures.\n\n01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.440\nOkay, so all of this is happening,\n\n01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.440\nbut you're still being strangulated by that shadow.\n\n01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440\nOh fuck, I forgot about that.\n\n01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:43.440\nYou're choking, but this stuff can still be happening.\n\n01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.440\nSo with your far sword strike,\n\n01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.440\nyou attempt to attack as many of the shadow creatures\n\n01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440\nas you possibly can.\n\n01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440\nAt a full gallop, astride Tylenol with codeine.\n\n01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440\nAt a full gallop, astride Tylenol with codeine,\n\n01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.440\nyou unleash a far sword blast directly\n\n01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.440\ntowards the shadow creatures,\n\n01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.440\nhitting merely two of them.\n\n01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.440\nOh cock.\n\n01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440\nThat's still good, that's still good.\n\n01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.440\nI don't know why I framed it that way.\n\n01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.440\nTwo's great, you guys, dealing 11 damage\n\n01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.440\nand 17 damage.\n\n01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.440\nOne of the shadows falls, slain,\n\n01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.440\nthe other is still standing,\n\n01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440\nyou're faced with four.\n\n01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.440\nYou might want to cover time there.\n\n01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440\n10-0-3.\n\n01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.440\nYou might want to what?\n\n01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.440\nHe's saying we're never going to finish this fight.\n\n01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.440\nLet's get out of here.\n\n01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.440\nI say we end on a bang.\n\n01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.440\nLet's pick one of them and not talk about it.\n\n01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.440\nWell done, Barbarian, look at those that you have slain\n\n01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.440\nand the others that are still standing.\n\n01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:46.440\nWait, does this mean the game's about to end?\n\n01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:49.440\nChris, do you have a sword I can have?\n\n01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.440\nDo I have hair?\n\n01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440\nYeah, you have hair.\n\n01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:55.440\nBefore the game ends with my dagger,\n\n01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.440\nI cut all my hair off.\n\n01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:01.440\nAll of it is gone.\n\n01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.440\nI just take swipe chunks with my dagger\n\n01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:08.440\nand then I give you my, take my hair cutting dagger.\n\n01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440\nOh, well, thank you.\n\n01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.440\nI freeze time and do a crazy rap.\n\n01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:28.440\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,\n\n01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.440\nSuper fly, honey to the money, motherfucker.\n\n01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.440\nPut your mama down and I started to pocket.\n\n01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.440\nPut her in the field and in the sky.\n\n01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.440\nFuck your mama so low, fuck your mama high.\n\n01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.440\nI'm sorry.\n\n01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:43.440\nIn the background of this rap, keep going, keep rapping.\n\n01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.440\nIn the background, I take Christopher's hand\n\n01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440\nand pull them off into the shadows.\n\n01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440\nYes.\n\n01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.440\nYo, take me out.\n\n01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:55.440\nYo, yo, I rap over them as they conjugate\n\n01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:01.440\nlike Richard Gere and Guinevere in First Night.\n\n01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.440\nAnd I pull them out of the shadows so everyone can watch.\n\n01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.440\nOkay.\n\n01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440\nExcept instead of Sean Connery,\n\n01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440\ninstead of stabbing a sword into the dirt,\n\n01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.440\nam I getting my Arthurian movies mixed?\n\n01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440\nI just watch them fuck.\n\n01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.440\nAnd I rap
