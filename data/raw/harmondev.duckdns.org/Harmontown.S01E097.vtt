{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:04.000\nSeryl Audio\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:23.000\nBonjour and bonsoir mademoiselle\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:26.000\nWelcome once again to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:29.000\nHarbin Town is now in session\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:44.000\nWhile we're at it, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harbin Town, Dan Harbin\n\n00:44.000 --> 00:46.000\nThank you\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:57.000\nThank you\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nNothing really to talk about tonight\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:03.000\nVery busy, very sleepy\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:06.000\nWe're working on this G.I. Joe cartoon\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:09.000\nWasn't it supposed to be turned in several months ago?\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.000\nWell, it airs Thursday\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.000\nAre you still making it?\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:17.000\nWe're just got a couple more G.I. Joe's to draw\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nWait, so you have an animated episode of Community\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:28.000\nThat is, when was that supposed to be like a properly functioning studio network driven universe?\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:29.000\nWhen was that supposed to be in?\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:32.000\nI don't know, months ago\n\n01:32.000 --> 01:33.000\nMonths ago?\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:34.000\nWell, you said that\n\n01:34.000 --> 01:35.000\nNow you're shocked by it\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:37.000\nWasn't that supposed to be done months ago?\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:39.000\nI don't know, months ago\n\n01:39.000 --> 01:41.000\nI don't know what that means\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:42.000\nWe're putting on a show here, Dan\n\n01:42.000 --> 01:46.000\nI'm trying to involve these people and the crisis that is your life right now\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:49.000\nWell, I don't know, I just don't, I don't do time\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:52.000\nI'm not good with dates and things\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.000\nAnd certainly it's all my fault\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\nWhat time was your show air?\n\n01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\nEight o'clock\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\nHe does that time\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:06.000\nIt's all my fault because I took too long to write the script and all this stuff\n\n02:06.000 --> 02:12.000\nSo Schrab's kind of doing his Schrab thing and he's being an asshole\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:19.000\nIt's like saying stuff on Twitter implying I should be there instead of being here\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:24.000\nIf I went out to go do wedding plans with Aaron and then Rob was tweeting\n\n02:24.000 --> 02:29.000\nHope you're having fun while I'm over here animating this and stuff\n\n02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\nSo today I\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:32.000\nOh, sweet\n\n02:32.000 --> 02:37.000\nYou don't have this on your iPad, do you?\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:40.000\nI might have it in my mail, do you want me to try to open it in there?\n\n02:40.000 --> 02:45.000\nWill it then play on their speakers better?\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:46.000\nLet's see if I have my mail\n\n02:46.000 --> 02:53.000\nSo today I went over and one of the last things I had to do was record the vocals for the G.I. Joe theme\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:02.000\nWe had Jonathan Kimmel, who's Jimmy's brother, who actually we used him for some vocal stuff on the Sarah Silverman show back in the day\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:11.000\nAnd he's a great singer and he's particularly good at this G.I. Joe register for that well-known theme song\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:18.000\nI have a question about it, but before we play it, is that so close that you guys are in jeopardy of copyright infringement?\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\nNo, it's with their permission, Hasbro's been very cooperative\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:23.000\nBecause it's the melody\n\n03:23.000 --> 03:25.000\nIt's the absolute song\n\n03:25.000 --> 03:29.000\nYeah, we're caught, it's G.I. Joe\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:36.000\nSo I just did some alternate lyrics, I think we're allowed to play this because it's like fair use or parody or something, right?\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nI don't know\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.000\nOur show? I play the Beatles and shit, man\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nYeah, I mean, it's a podcast, let's hope we squeak by\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:48.000\nI mean, we're not going to make any money off of this or steal any money from it\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:51.000\nWhat would the season desist be? Stop doing that next week?\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:56.000\nIt's being leaked, it's like the Chevy voicemails, it's a leak\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nOkay\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:59.000\nI don't know who's doing this\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:03.000\nTMZ, get your camera set, right?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:10.000\nSo I didn't even listen to the regular lyrics of the theme song, because that's what people really want to hear\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:17.000\nBut I ran in with the, I was like, can you do one more take and just do these alternate lyrics so I can bring them back to the office to Schrab\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:24.000\nSo this is punishing Rob Schrab.who's dutifully directing the episode that you turned in too late\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:48.000\nAnd he's working around the clock\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:54.000\nHe'll never be nice, he's always mean, eating his own poop and drinking his pee\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:59.000\nStrawbass hole, strawbass hole is there\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nStrawbass hole is the code name for America's biggest dumbest poop-eating asshole\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:11.000\nHis purpose? To tweet mean things at Dan Harmon, a TV writer determined to entertain nice people\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:13.000\nI also suspect he hits his wife\n\n05:13.000 --> 05:25.000\nHe makes you feel bad when you write a script late, strawbass asshole, strawbass hole, strawbass hole\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nLittle unfair, but it's a good song\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:52.000\nIt's accurate, he gets close to it deadline and then he's like, oh I hate you, I hate you for not turning the script on time or whatever\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:56.000\nMakes him feel better, gets him going\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:05.000\nYou know what's not healthy for me is a satisfied confident Schrab that feels sorry for me or is loyal to me\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:08.000\nThat's dangerous, him running around out there, I don't know\n\n06:08.000 --> 06:09.000\nWhy is that?\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:12.000\nI don't know, he's a devious guy\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:15.000\nYou know, remember when Sarah fired me?\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.000\nYeah\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:20.000\nHe kept working there\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:24.000\nIs that what this is about?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nDon't bury the lead man\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nThere's always a little of that underneath everything\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:35.000\nYou guys used to be inseparable best friends, you're not as close as you obviously were\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:38.000\nWhat do you mean?\n\n06:38.000 --> 06:44.000\nNo, we had a year where we were actually not talking to each other, we were actually mad\n\n06:44.000 --> 06:52.000\nIn the wake of the Sarah thing, I actually spent a year not liking him and stuff for real\n\n06:52.000 --> 06:57.000\nBut then we made up, when Mike Ash died, Channel 101\n\n06:57.000 --> 07:06.000\nWe were at a memorial service for a guy who ended his life doing Channel 101 and it just felt like we're both there\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:12.000\nAnd it just felt knobbish to continue to not like each other, kind of made up there\n\n07:12.000 --> 07:15.000\nPut it in your biopic\n\n07:15.000 --> 07:19.000\nAnd then you wrote that song today\n\n07:19.000 --> 07:25.000\nAlright, I don't have anything, in pop culture news\n\n07:25.000 --> 07:29.000\nI smell Bieber rant\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nThat was a goodie by the way\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:38.000\nThe new thing now, Jeff, is hashtags, you can use hashtags to cancel TV shows for being racist\n\n07:38.000 --> 07:45.000\nYou can pick which show you think is racist and you can hashtag cancel in the name of the show\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:52.000\nAnd then voila, racism will go away\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.000\nComedy will become incredibly sophisticated\n\n07:55.000 --> 08:04.000\nThe whole species will become smarter because obviously people that do that are already for really smart material to go into their heads\n\n08:04.000 --> 08:10.000\nWe're clearly at peak IQ as a nation here\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.000\nYeah, it's just a new thing\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:15.000\nDo you have a for instance hashtag on your mind right now?\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:21.000\nI would like to submit hashtag cancel Teen Wolf, I think Teen Wolf's racist\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:23.000\nMondays at 1030\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:26.000\nYou know I created that show\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:28.000\nAren't you racist?\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:31.000\nIt's racist as the day is long\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:34.000\nSo please watch me\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:38.000\nJeff Bryan Davis, not the creator of Teen Wolf\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:42.000\nPeople still are convinced that I created the goddamn show\n\n08:42.000 --> 08:47.000\nBut I have never seen nor would under any fucking circumstance\n\n08:47.000 --> 08:50.000\nEvery time I tell people that, I get more Teen Wolf followers\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:53.000\nAnd for some reason, in Portuguese\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:59.000\nI did a series of tweets again about how I didn't create it but I started doing TNA\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:03.000\nI'm getting ahead of myself\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:07.000\nTeen Wolf Q&A, or as I call it, TNA\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:10.000\nBecause my time is very valuable\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.000\nI answer questions about Teen Wolf as me\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:17.000\nBut people think that I am Jeff Davis, creator of Criminal Minds and Teen Wolf\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:20.000\nAnd I just keep saying what a racist I am\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:28.000\nSo cancel Teen Wolf and watch Rick and Morty on Mondays at 1030 instead\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.000\nThat's my secret agenda\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:34.000\nTeen Wolf is the only show that gets higher ratings than Rick and Morty in our time slot\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nIs that right?\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nThat's unfair\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nI think I've made it pretty clear\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:43.000\nI'm not too hip to the modern TV shows and music and stuff like that\n\n09:43.000 --> 09:45.000\nI fucking love Rick and Morty\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nI watched it last week and I texted you about it, which I don't really do\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nThat show delights me\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:53.000\nIt makes me very happy\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:54.000\nNice\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:55.000\nIt's a good show\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.000\nIt's really...\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.000\nIt's good\n\n09:59.000 --> 10:02.000\nAnd I think I can say that objectively\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:08.000\nAnd subtract my friendship with you and knowing Justin and knowing everybody involved with it\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:12.000\nI think I would like that show in a vacuum just as much\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:15.000\nLike Futurama, I've watched those, never did it\n\n10:15.000 --> 10:18.000\nThere's other animated shows, this is fucking good\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:21.000\nI never really watched Futurama, I heard it was really good\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:22.000\nI should go back and start watching it\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:25.000\nI'm sure it is, I never got off the ground for it\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:32.000\nOkay, so I wanted to bring out some special friends and have a special show tonight\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:35.000\nBecause we're going to take a little break for April\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:42.000\nI had a little chance, I got a lot of shit going on\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:45.000\nThat's not really why, I can be busy and keep doing Harmontowns\n\n10:45.000 --> 10:47.000\nAnd I'll miss it as soon as we don't do it for a week\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:49.000\nBut we're just going to take April off\n\n10:49.000 --> 10:51.000\nBecause it's a show that never takes a hiatus\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:54.000\nIs it because Game of Thrones is also on Sunday?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:56.000\nNo\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:59.000\nAnd then there's people tweeting, oh shit, I'm coming in from Australia\n\n10:59.000 --> 11:01.000\nAnd I'm like okay, I'll have a drink with you\n\n11:01.000 --> 11:04.000\nAnd then someone else says, I'm coming in from Texas\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nAnd I'm like okay, I'll have a drink with you\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:09.000\nI'm going to have a busier month because I'm taking it off\n\n11:09.000 --> 11:16.000\nBut I also just realized Aaron and I are now scheduling a trip to go to Cancun at some point\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:20.000\nAnd I think that might overlap with the arrival of Levi\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:23.000\nRemember Levi with the bare feet in the business?\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:24.000\nHow could I forget?\n\n11:24.000 --> 11:29.000\nHe's coming up here, and then I saw that and I was like, well that guy's not going to take\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:33.000\nGo to Cancun with Levi, take Levi to Cancun, it's built for bare feet\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:41.000\nI feel like as long as the boat that's hitched to my car has at least one axle\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:44.000\nLevi will figure out a way to come down there\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:46.000\nCape Fear reference\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:47.000\nWow\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:51.000\nOkay, I have, Jesus\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.000\nIs that Robert Mitchum or?\n\n11:53.000 --> 11:56.000\nWell I was referencing the De Niro movie\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:59.000\nSomeone said both I think maybe, I never saw the Mitchum one\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:03.000\nWhat a sizzler this tonight's show is\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:06.000\nNot that it's our job to sizzle, I don't know\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:08.000\nWe're a sizzler\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:12.000\nI think iTunes called us the most notable sizzlers\n\n12:12.000 --> 12:15.000\nAre we on sizzle?\n\n12:15.000 --> 12:17.000\nI don't have a lot of time\n\n12:17.000 --> 12:18.000\nYou don't have a lot of money?\n\n12:18.000 --> 12:21.000\nSizzler\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nSo in what order should we bring people up?\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI say in alphabetical\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:29.000\nI say first, is Duncan here yet?\n\n12:29.000 --> 12:30.000\nOkay\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:31.000\nSpoiler\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.000\nYeah\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:34.000\nWell first let's bring out Kumail then\n\n12:43.000 --> 12:44.000\nHello\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.000\nSorry, thank you for nailing that\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:54.000\nI have to say the iPad's been a little spotted today\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.000\nI've got to say I've had that\n\n12:56.000 --> 12:59.000\nBecause I was at Star Burns earlier today for some other thing\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:01.000\nAnd you played me that song\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:04.000\nIt's been stuck in my head\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:05.000\nIt's really catchy\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:08.000\nIf you see Rob on the street or something really\n\n13:08.000 --> 13:10.000\nHe'd really appreciate you\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:14.000\nThat's why I emailed it to his wife and all his friends\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:17.000\nI've actually been doing fake lyrics to that melody all day\n\n13:17.000 --> 13:19.000\nLike cheddar cheese\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:22.000\nFavorite cheese on the sandwich\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:24.000\nCheddar cheese is there\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:26.000\nIt was so funny because you played it for me\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:28.000\nAnd Schrab was there\n\n13:28.000 --> 13:30.000\nAnd he's so good at that\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:32.000\nWhere he's like, oh come on guys\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\nPlease, no, come on\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:37.000\nIt

I can't do it.\n\n44:35.000 --> 44:37.000\nBut, like, stand up, I do, and I tell jokes.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:39.000\nBut only if it's jokes I've written.\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:41.000\nI can't do other people's songs or anything.\n\n44:41.000 --> 44:43.000\nTell somebody else's joke.\n\n44:43.000 --> 44:44.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:47.000\nOkay, there's a guy who goes to the whorehouse\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:50.000\nand there's only one door in the whorehouse.\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:56.000\nThe matron who's there.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:59.000\nAnd they say matron because English is not their first language.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:05.000\nSo they're learning English as they're performing this transaction.\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:10.000\nI also love when he came back the next day\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:11.000\nand he did the whole thing.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.000\n$7, that's too much.\n\n45:12.000 --> 45:14.000\nOh, wait, no, okay. Forget that.\n\n45:14.000 --> 45:16.000\nHe just takes the duck.\n\n45:16.000 --> 45:17.000\nHe just takes the duck.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.000\nAnd then he comes down.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:22.000\nAnd then it's $7.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:26.000\nI mean, that joke telling had so many gifts to give.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:29.000\nAlthough, even with our interruptions and interjections,\n\n45:29.000 --> 45:34.000\nyou told that joke half as long as you did the last time you told me.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:38.000\nYeah, there was a guy on the Harmontown tour.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:41.000\nHe had a t-shirt that he had made.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:45.000\nIt's filled with text and it's me trying to tell the duck joke.\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:47.000\nThat's pretty good.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:59.000\nAll right, let's do our medical corner.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:00.000\nMedical corner.\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.000\nOkay.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:03.000\nAll right.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.000\nYou know, we haven't seen it in a long, long time\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:06.000\nand haven't checked in on him.\n\n46:06.000 --> 46:08.000\nAnd he has a dramatic update.\n\n46:08.000 --> 46:26.000\nOur good friend, Seek Donnelly.\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:33.000\nSeek, Seek for those who don't know is a multiple aneurysm survivor\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:38.000\nwho we established last time.\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:44.000\nBecause of his strange condition, his proclivity for something\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:48.000\nthat is catastrophic to anyone when it occurs randomly,\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:52.000\nhe has a proclivity for aneurysms.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:57.000\nAnd these doctors were cutting you a deal where they said,\n\n46:57.000 --> 47:02.000\nwell, because that's so weird, we'll give you free treatment.\n\n47:02.000 --> 47:04.000\nBut it's for our purposes.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.000\nIt's for our studying and stuff like that.\n\n47:07.000 --> 47:10.000\nAnd you've got your own neurologist as well.\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nBut you were just telling me in the green room,\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:15.000\ndo you want to take it from there?\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:16.000\nWell, sure, yeah.\n\n47:16.000 --> 47:20.000\nSo one of the things I lost that I think I said in previous shows\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:22.000\nwas my visual memory.\n\n47:22.000 --> 47:25.000\nAnd so what that does is it cuts down on my short-term memory a lot\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.000\nand it also makes it really hard.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:30.000\nI'm an artist, so it makes me really hard to create artwork.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:33.000\nSo like the pieces I did for Harmontown,\n\n47:33.000 --> 47:35.000\nwhere you guys are all Mega Man characters,\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:38.000\nI actually had nosebleeds trying to create that art.\n\n47:38.000 --> 47:39.000\nThose are wonderful.\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:40.000\nOh, thank you.\n\n47:40.000 --> 47:43.000\nI had fun doing an indoor kids one with you and Emily.\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:47.000\nAnd so it takes a lot out of me to create things.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:50.000\nBut I don't like being told I can't do stuff.\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:54.000\nSo these doctors that I've been seeing for a couple of years now,\n\n47:54.000 --> 47:58.000\nI had another coiling procedure done in November.\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:00.000\nAnd since then, they've kind of laid off some of the tests\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.000\nthey normally do on me.\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:06.000\nAnd in that time period where it was a longer period than I usually\n\n48:06.000 --> 48:11.000\nhave between tests, I started, at least I thought,\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:14.000\nhaving some visual sense coming back.\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.000\nSo I had a dream one night.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:19.000\nAnd I haven't had a dream in a long time.\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:23.000\nHaven't had a dream in a long time.\n\n48:23.000 --> 48:24.000\nThat's not how you sound.\n\n48:24.000 --> 48:26.000\nJeff, stop doing that.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:29.000\nI'm just saying he's stealing from Morris here.\n\n48:29.000 --> 48:34.000\nWho?\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:35.000\nVisual memory.\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.000\nWhat is coiling?\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:42.000\nCoiling is a procedure where they put,\n\n48:42.000 --> 48:45.000\nit depends on where they feel the best is,\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:47.000\nbut sometimes they go up in your inner thigh\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:50.000\nand they run a calf that are up your entire body.\n\n48:50.000 --> 48:51.000\nWhat?\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\nThat's the fastest way to get there?\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:56.000\nNo, it's not the fact, but it's one of the options, yeah.\n\n48:56.000 --> 49:00.000\nSo either we could start up here or we could do the thigh.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:02.000\nWe could do the thigh.\n\n49:02.000 --> 49:04.000\nNo, that was my option.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:07.000\nSo I did that.\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:10.000\nSo they're writing up an artery or a vein or something like that?\n\n49:10.000 --> 49:12.000\nYeah, and then they go straight up.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:13.000\nGood heavens.\n\n49:13.000 --> 49:17.000\nAnd then they put these coils into a kind of clip\n\n49:17.000 --> 49:22.000\nand direct the aneurysms.\n\n49:22.000 --> 49:24.000\nAnd to drain them sometimes too.\n\n49:24.000 --> 49:27.000\nSo they'll put them in and hold them in place.\n\n49:27.000 --> 49:29.000\nSo since I have multiple ones that keep growing,\n\n49:29.000 --> 49:33.000\nthey have to do this procedure more often than they do.\n\n49:33.000 --> 49:35.000\nSo if a new one comes up they go in and take care of it?\n\n49:35.000 --> 49:38.000\nYeah, well the last two times I didn't get one at a time.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:41.000\nI got like two or three.\n\n49:41.000 --> 49:45.000\nSo the last time I went in I got 14 coils put in.\n\n49:45.000 --> 49:46.000\nAnd then they stay there?\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:49.000\nYeah, I mean for a while.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:51.000\nOver time some of them dissolve.\n\n49:51.000 --> 49:54.000\nYeah, so they ran these tests.\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:57.000\nSo I had this dream and then I was trying to explain the dream.\n\n49:57.000 --> 50:01.000\nAnd they were like, well because I have trouble saying things visually,\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:04.000\nI was having trouble explaining the dream, but I knew I had one.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:06.000\nSo then they're like, oh, it's probably nothing, you know, whatever.\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:08.000\nSo I said, okay, so then in like a week or two later,\n\n50:08.000 --> 50:10.000\nI could have sworn I had another dream.\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:15.000\nAnd then I said, okay, now I'm starting to connect a really major dot here.\n\n50:15.000 --> 50:19.000\nAfter my aneurysm there was a time when I was like writing and stuff again\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:22.000\nthat I would draw like doodle a little bit.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:24.000\nAnd then since then I've been under this program\n\n50:24.000 --> 50:27.000\nand that whole time it's been really hard for me to draw.\n\n50:27.000 --> 50:31.000\nAnd I felt neutered by the medication and the stuff they've been doing to me.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:34.000\nI felt like it was stopping me from creating.\n\n50:34.000 --> 50:37.000\nSo I basically told them, hey look, before we run any more tests,\n\n50:37.000 --> 50:40.000\nI'd like some time off to see if I have more dreams,\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:42.000\nif I get more visual sense.\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:46.000\nAnd then so what ended up happening in that time off was I sculpted something.\n\n50:46.000 --> 50:50.000\nI started writing a song. I started painting.\n\n50:50.000 --> 50:53.000\nAnd I'm still having trouble with the visual sense.\n\n50:53.000 --> 50:55.000\nIt's still hard for me to do these things.\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:57.000\nBut the neat thing is that, or not the song so much,\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:00.000\nbut the neat thing is that I'm conquering it.\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:04.000\nLike I'm beating, I think, whatever this wall was that I was hitting.\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:07.000\nSo recently I told those doctors like, hey, I appreciate all the help,\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:09.000\nbut I want out of this program.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:12.000\nAnd they're like, well, we advise against that because, you know,\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:14.000\nbecause they paid for a lot of my medical treatment.\n\n51:14.000 --> 51:17.000\nThey're like, you know, you make no money at all.\n\n51:17.000 --> 51:22.000\nAnd even less than a normal artist because none of my stuff sells\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.000\nand it's all for charity.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.000\nYeah, that's a terrible business plan for me.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.000\nI'm not making money. I'm donating.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:33.000\nWell, it's funny that my last two jobs have been marketing jobs\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.000\nand I'm like, I don't know how to pay my own bills.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:37.000\nWhy do you want me to pay your bills?\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:40.000\nSo I just like creating.\n\n51:40.000 --> 51:42.000\nAnd I feel like that's my purpose.\n\n51:42.000 --> 51:45.000\nSo I've made the decision, well, even if this kills me,\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:49.000\nnot having you doctors around, I want to create this project.\n\n51:49.000 --> 51:52.000\nSo I started this project that was inspired by Harmontown\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:55.000\nbecause this is the only, I listen to this podcast religiously.\n\n51:55.000 --> 51:57.000\nI've seen, I've heard every episode like 10 or 20 times.\n\n51:57.000 --> 52:00.000\nAnd I feel like this is my family.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:01.000\nThis is my home.\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:04.000\nThese people who understand me, who don't judge me in a negative way.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:08.000\nAnd so, and who also helped me create art, like create those prints for you guys.\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:11.000\nAnd so I wanted to, you know, do a big love letter to that\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:14.000\nand the type of people we have come up here, like, like Jane, you know,\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:17.000\nwho, our earth shine friend, who, you know, who's,\n\n52:17.000 --> 52:19.000\nhe has some earth shine kit, follow him on Twitter.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:20.000\nHe'll tell you about it.\n\n52:20.000 --> 52:24.000\nAnd then we have like Levi and you have these people who are really great people\n\n52:24.000 --> 52:27.000\nand they are in search for an identity.\n\n52:27.000 --> 52:31.000\nAnd I feel like that's what I'm in search for because my memories of childhood are gone.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:35.000\nYou know, like all my, I remember like up to about six, seven years ago.\n\n52:35.000 --> 52:36.000\nAnd then, yeah.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.000\nYou don't have any memories of when you were a kid?\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:41.000\nI have some knowledge of them, but most of them are gone.\n\n52:41.000 --> 52:45.000\nWhen you say there's no visual memory, you can't picture your elementary school.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:46.000\nYou can't.\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:47.000\nNo, no.\n\n52:47.000 --> 52:48.000\nOr my mom.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:49.000\nOr child, really?\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:50.000\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n52:50.000 --> 52:53.000\nSo that's why me and my mom have such a weird relationship now\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:56.000\nis because she always says, oh, don't you remember when you do this, don't you remember that?\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:59.000\nAnd I, it breaks my heart every time to tell her that I don't\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:01.000\nbecause then I see the look on her face.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:05.000\nDo you feel that now that it's kind of trickling back in like your visual sense\n\n53:05.000 --> 53:07.000\nthat maybe memories might come?\n\n53:07.000 --> 53:08.000\nI'm hoping.\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:09.000\nAnd that's why I want to explore it.\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:15.000\nAnd like I said, it's, if anything's worth dying for, it's to find out who you are.\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:19.000\nYou know, so I said, well, okay, so I don't want to die.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:23.000\nI have my one neurologist, but everyone else, I'm like, you can all go away.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:24.000\nLike, let me explore this.\n\n53:24.000 --> 53:26.000\nLet me see how deep this pool is.\n\n53:26.000 --> 53:27.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:32.000\nAnd were they barking at it because they saw you as an investment for their own research?\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:34.000\nThey put a lot of effort and money into you?\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:36.000\nThere's that, but then there's also like, they do care for my well-being.\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:37.000\nThey're doctors.\n\n53:37.000 --> 53:42.000\nYou know, they're trying to make me a better me, obviously, but I don't want to help now.\n\n53:42.000 --> 53:46.000\nI want to find out who Seek is and I want to find out what kind of artist he is.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:50.000\nSo, you know, I heard you talk to Katie at South by Southwest and she said,\n\n53:50.000 --> 53:52.000\noh, I'm trying to figure out what kind of artist I am.\n\n53:52.000 --> 53:53.000\nI want to paint.\n\n53:53.000 --> 53:54.000\nI want to draw.\n\n53:54.000 --> 53:55.000\nI want to, you know, create music.\n\n53:55.000 --> 53:56.000\nAnd you're like, do them all.\n\n53:56.000 --> 53:57.000\nSo I was like, you know what?\n\n53:57.000 --> 53:58.000\nI'm going to do them all too.\n\n53:58.000 --> 54:04.000\nAnd so I'm releasing a book called Alain Vitale, which is French for vital force.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:07.000\nAnd it's a book about the first robot that gets a soul.\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:12.000\nAnd in order to prove that he has a soul, he creates a bunch of different art styles.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:15.000\nAnd so I'm creating the art styles like as the robot, obviously.\n\n54:15.000 --> 54:17.000\nAnd so every page is different art style.\n\n54:17.000 --> 54:19.000\nSo I do purism, surrealism.\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:20.000\nI do sculpting.\n\n54:20.000 --> 54:22.000\nYou know, I teach.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.000\nI choreograph a dance.\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:31.000\nLike I'm literally doing every art style I can think of and putting it all in one book as a big love letter to art,\n\n54:31.000 --> 54:38.000\nbut also a big love letter to the people that inspired it, which is pretty much everyone that's ever heard or listened to or come to this show.\n\n54:38.000 --> 54:40.000\nAnd you guys, obviously.\n\n54:40.000 --> 54:46.000\nThat's amazing.\n\n54:46.000 --> 55:07.000\nBut there's this sobering, chilling edge to the whole thing where you're gambling like, you know, this thing that we all sometimes take for granted, but also are imprisoned by, which is like your well-being.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:21.000\nYou're already, you already have to deal with that being at risk all the time. And you've now made this decision that you're these guys that put coils up there and build levees and things and stuff.\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:32.000\nYou know, you're associating their tests and treatments and things with a mitigation of your true self.\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:41.000\nAnd so you're just going to, like the guy in Into the Wild, kind of, you're going to go off and do the Alaska of not getting these coils anymore.\n\n55:41.000 --> 55:51.000\nAnd there could be poison berries or there could be amazing buses that you get to live in.\n\n55:51.000 --> 55:53.000\nI haven't seen that movie. Is that what happens?\n\n55:53.000 --> 56:05.000\nYeah, yeah. But it's the story of a guy who's just kind of like, he does it wrong, but he gets to live his life. And then he does die in the end.\n\n56:05.000 --> 56:06.000\nInto the wild?\n\n56:06.000 --> 56:16.000\nYeah. But because you're crediting Harmontown with the inspiration for this decision, which I don't know if I would ever have the courage to make myself.\n\n56:16.000 --> 56:23.000\nI want to make sure that I've had an equal shot at inspiring you to make the other decision too.\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:24.000\nNo.\n\n56:24.000 --> 56:31.000\nYou know, have you, have you, have you, do you have a neurologist in your life and you've got these crazy sci-fi scientists in your life?\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:40.000\nDo you, do you have a, do you have a counselor of some kind in your life, somebody that you can talk to about this gigantic decision that's maybe a little more qualified than me?\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:50.000\nI mean, not currently. I had, right when, after I had my, the first aneurysm rupture, I met with a psychologist and we talked out, you know, stuff.\n\n56:50.000 --> 57:00.000\nAnd I know you guys were talking about that last week. So it was really cool to have someone to talk to, but I also suffered, like I said, some emotional damage from where the rupture happened.\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:11.000\nSo I'm also like the most robotic person to talk to at times. Like I, I feel happy and stuff. And I get that. And then there are times where I feel sad, but in the middle there, it's like, that's where it gets weird.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:20.000\nSo, so that's why I wanted to write a book about a robot, because I'm like, I identify, you have people up here that identify when they're men, they identify as women and women who identify as men and vice versa.\n\n57:20.000 --> 57:34.000\nBut it's, I identify as not human, if that makes any sense. And, but I love humanity. Like I, I want to be a part of humanity so much that I'm willing to cut that tether, because I think that's what's going to make me rejoin humanity.\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:44.000\nThat's what's going to make me feel the most human before I, if I do die. And I don't know, I mean, I've been told twice now that, oh, you got this much time to live and I'm still here four years later.\n\n57:44.000 --> 57:54.000\nAnd I feel like I'm doing okay, like I'm walking, I'm talking pretty good. So, I mean, I'm not saying doctors don't know anything. I have utmost respect for doctors are the reason I'm here.\n\n57:54.000 --> 58:03.000\nBut I, I think I have to just trust myself for once. And no, I have given it a lot of thought and I've talked about with a lot of friends, but ultimately it's my decision.\n\n58:03.000 --> 58:06.000\nAnd, and I'm going to stand by it. I think it's the right one.\n\n58:06.000 --> 58:14.000\nAbsolutely. Of course. And we, I, when we stand by you, you're our friend. Thank you so much for.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:22.000\nSo, when you say you don't have like the memories, is there, is it like you do stuff and then sometimes you don't remember you've done it?\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:24.000\nSometimes lately it's been happening a lot more.\n\n58:24.000 --> 58:29.000\nSo there's a chance you might not remember Dan's retelling of the duck joke.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:31.000\nCan I tell my favorite joke?\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:32.000\nYes, of course.\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:43.000\nYes. All right. It's real quick. I hate traveling. I think it's because my dad used to beat me with a globe.\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:44.000\nYou see, Dan?\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:45.000\nYeah.\n\n58:45.000 --> 58:46.000\nThat's good.\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:47.000\nYeah.\n\n58:47.000 --> 58:48.000\nThank you, Steve.\n\n58:48.000 --> 58:50.000\nThank you.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:53.000\nThanks so much.\n\n58:53.000 --> 58:55.000\nIf I can plug it real quick.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:56.000\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n58:56.000 --> 59:04.000\nI was talking about along the towel, the Kickstarter starts tomorrow and I'm looking to raise $5,000 to make a limited 500 print run of it.\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:05.000\nCool.\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:07.000\nSo if anyone out there would like to donate, I would appreciate it.\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:09.000\nIs it along like A-L-A-I-N?\n\n59:09.000 --> 59:10.000\nE-L-A-N.\n\n59:10.000 --> 59:11.000\nOh, E-Line.\n\n59:11.000 --> 59:12.000\nE-Line. Yeah.\n\n59:12.000 --> 59:13.000\nCool. All right. Thank you.\n\n59:13.000 --> 59:14.000\nAll right.\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:15.000\nAll right.\n\n59:15.000 --> 59:26.000\nHoly smoke.\n\n59:26.000 --> 59:37.000\nThat guy asked to actually deal with one of the most offensive things in the world, which is our relationship with an unforgiving, unpredictable God.\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:41.000\nThat's, you know, hashtag cancel humanity.\n\n59:41.000 --> 59:43.000\nDon't cancel God.\n\n59:43.000 --> 59:46.000\nDon't cancel God.\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:47.000\nYou're racist.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:51.000\nThat's why, yeah, your problem with a joke at Colbert.\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:52.000\nYeah.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:56.000\nLike, I mean, the ice caps are melting you dicks.\n\n59:56.000 --> 01:00:05.000\nDoes anybody else in the room have, I don't know if it's sympathetic or empathetic pain where somebody describes an injury or an illness or whatever that you feel physically the thing.\n\n01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:15.000\nLike, I have this thing where he talks about brain injury and my head starts hurting like crazy or someone says they had a friend that had a hernia like operation and my abdomen start hurting.\n\n01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000\nI don't know if anyone else has that was like, like he's up there and my head just starts, I don't get headaches that my head starts pounding during that.\n\n01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000\nLike, I don't know.\n\n01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000\nI don't know if I'm alone.\n\n01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000\nApplause? How many people have that?\n\n01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000\nOh, good.\n\n01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000\nOkay.\n\n01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000\nYeah.\n\n01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000\nIf someone like, like, like has a knee injury, it's like, Oh, God, damn it.\n\n01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000\nLike, it was knee starts dangling.\n\n01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000\nI can't watch shows where people get hurt, like, like Tosh or whatever.\n\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000\nAnd so there's people getting wrecked.\n\n01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000\nLike, I can't.\n\n01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000\nI like the idea of someone who's like that, but the terrible knowledge of anatomy.\n\n01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000\nSo like, the wrong parts of there.\n\n01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000\nMy appendix hurts.\n\n01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000\nOh, my, my foot.\n\n01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000\nIs that a Patan joke?\n\n01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000\nYou know it, buddy.\n\n01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000\nYou're catching on.\n\n01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000\nPatan?\n\n01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000\nIs Duncan back there? Did he ever, did he ever show up?\n\n01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000\nAlmost.\n\n01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000\nWell, why don't we bring Spencer up?\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:27.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000\nBounding.\n\n01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000\nI'm just sending off.\n\n01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000\nHold on.\n\n01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000\nSpencer, you said a very strange thing in the green room.\n\n01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000\nSuck my dick.\n\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000\nI mean, that's not very strange out of place.\n\n01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000\nSure.\n\n01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000\nYou said you often think about how much you would enjoy fighting a pack of coyote.\n\n01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000\nOh, yeah.\n\n01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000\nYeah.\n\n01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000\nOkay.\n\n01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000\nNo.\n\n01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000\nI have follow-up questions.\n\n01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000\nSo also you live in L.A.\n\n01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000\nYou can make this dream come true.\n\n01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000\nOh, I know.\n\n01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000\nAll you have to do is have a cat or a poodle.\n\n01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000\nI used to live in Moorpark, which was kind of like a farming town.\n\n01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000\nWhat?\n\n01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000\nDid somebody just root for Moorpark?\n\n01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000\nNo.\n\n01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000\nNobody's ever done that.\n\n01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000\nYeah.\n\n01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000\nNo.\n\n01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nSeriously.\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000\nCheck it.\n\n01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000\nLook it up on Urban Dictionary.\n\n01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000\nIt has an entry.\n\n01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.420\nBut there's a lot of farmland and stuff and you can go out and sometimes we go out hiking\n\n01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.500\njust in the fields and stuff at night and you'd be able to hear coyotes or even just\n\n01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.500\nnot hiking.\n\n01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.000\nLike in my bed, I'd be able to hear coyotes like all the time and you'd hear a lot of\n\n01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000\nthem.\n\n01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000\nBut like when we'd go on night hike, sometimes they'd sound really close and you'd be like,\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000\nlook at it.\n\n01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000\nIt sounds like six or seven.\n\n01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000\nI'd love to hike.\n\n01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000\nI'll probably be fine.\n\n01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000\nNow, when you picture yourself fighting a pack of coyotes, is it bare-handed?\n\n01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000\nDo you have a weapon of some sort?\n\n01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000\nBare-handed.\n\n01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000\nI mean, the only thing I could ever imagine is like having a bag with me, like a backpack\n\n01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000\nthat I'm hiking with because it's hiking.\n\n01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000\nSo I'd like, you know, maybe swing, have to bag around.\n\n01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000\nBut yeah, mostly bare-hand.\n\n01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000\nDo you think you could take a pack of coyotes?\n\n01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000\nI mean, how big we talk in Kumae?\n\n01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000\nHow big of a pack?\n\n01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nSix or seven.\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000\nYeah, definitely.\n\n01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000\nI kind of feel like they're very powerfully scavengers.\n\n01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000\nI mean, they're...\n\n01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000\nOh, I'm talking about enraged, like, pissed off, like coyotes.\n\n01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000\nI don't know what's supposed to happen here.\n\n01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000\nTraveling down the roads of Moor Park, you stop when you hear a rustling.\n\n01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000\nThe red gleaming eyes from the bushes are all the information you need to realize what's\n\n01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000\non you, a pack of slightly chiming coyote.\n\n01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nSo you have initiative.\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000\nYou can take six or seven coyotes.\n\n01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nI can say this just by looking at you.\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000\nYou're never flat-flittered against coyote.\n\n01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000\nYeah, no, that's definitely a bonus I earned in my travels.\n\n01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000\nI think he could do it, but not because if the six coyote actually is the plural coyote.\n\n01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000\nI think it's coyotes.\n\n01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000\nCoyotai.\n\n01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000\nWhat are you...\n\n01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000\nYou're somebody's Sam?\n\n01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000\nCoyotes.\n\n01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000\nI think that if all six of them had, like, a rage virus that made them, whatever, that\n\n01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000\nmade them, like, physically endeavor as a unit of six coyote, I think my dog could take\n\n01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000\nme out.\n\n01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000\nWhat?\n\n01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000\nI could take your dog.\n\n01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000\nNo way, man.\n\n01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000\nMy dog...\n\n01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000\nI mean, these...\n\n01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000\nThe thing about dogs is, like, all it takes is one blow to the throat.\n\n01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000\nI mean, sure.\n\n01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000\nSo you've got to throw out your left arm, not your good arm, your left arm as a sacrifice,\n\n01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000\nbut once it's clamped on, it's just a quick knee in the throat and you're done.\n\n01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000\nWait, but Rottweilers and those guys, like, kill people, kill people all the time?\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.160\nI hear a lot about people getting attacked and you literally never hear them going for\n\n01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160\nthe throat, ever.\n\n01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.000\nWell, because the stories aren't going to be like, the guy went for the throat and it\n\n01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000\ndidn't work, because you can't even tell the pail, Spencer.\n\n01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.560\nYou hear about the flailing they do and that they hit it on the top of the head or they\n\n01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.640\ntry and unwedge the jaw.\n\n01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.640\nThat's not what you do.\n\n01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.640\nYou just go for the throat.\n\n01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.360\nIf they can't breathe, they're not going to be biting you.\n\n01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360\nWhere did you read...\n\n01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.640\nWhere did you read this?\n\n01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640\nWhat is this information?\n\n01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640\nThis is holistic knowledge.\n\n01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640\nI've cleaned in my everyday life.\n\n01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640\nWhat journal do you subscribe to?\n\n01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:38.960\nYeah, it's a dog throat attack monthly.\n\n01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.840\nHarvard Medical Coyote Edition.\n\n01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840\nI'm just saying.\n\n01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.640\nI mean, have you guys seen Coyotes?\n\n01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640\nThey're main gene.\n\n01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.360\nThey're like maybe twice the size of a house cat.\n\n01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360\nThey're not huge.\n\n01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.440\nThey're main gene-looking skinny things.\n\n01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440\nI don't think they really...\n\n01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.120\nI've never seen them in really, what do I call, packs.\n\n01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.360\nI've seen them travel around that would look like small nuclear families.\n\n01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.640\nYou see like mom and pop and maybe a kid.\n\n01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.480\nYeah, that's probably more likely.\n\n01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.320\nAnd also, they're terrified of us.\n\n01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320\nYeah.\n\n01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.080\nBut I mean, again, we're talking about that's out of the equation here.\n\n01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.120\nSo you're saying these are special coyotes?\n\n01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.120\nI mean, they're just not going to be super timid.\n\n01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.320\nHe just wants to fight them.\n\n01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.560\nSo if they're timid, they're going to run away.\n\n01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560\nYeah, that's not a fight.\n\n01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.120\nBut you wouldn't want to fight a wolf because a wolf will kick you.\n\n01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.120\nNo, no, sure.\n\n01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.120\nI mean, I might be able to take one wolf, maybe.\n\n01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.120\nNow, I say there's only one way to find out.\n\n01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.120\nI don't think...\n\n01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.120\nLet's bring out our wolf.\n\n01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.120\nSpencer, we have great news.\n\n01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.600\nSpencer, do you think you could take a pit bull or a rottweiler?\n\n01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.120\nI don't because, I mean, honestly, if you're talking like a coyote versus a pit bull, like...\n\n01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.440\nWell, I mean, that's a crazy huge difference.\n\n01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.440\nThat's what I'm saying.\n\n01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.440\nI mean, there's a lot of dogs that I'd feel more confident, you know, fighting against.\n\n01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.440\nRottweilers and pit bulls probably aren't up there.\n\n01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.440\nI mean...\n\n01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.440\nWhat about 80 Sheetsu?\n\n01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.440\nYeah, see, this is the whole thing.\n\n01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.440\nYou can, when they're small enough, and I think you could pull this off with a coyote,\n\n01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440\nall you have to do is spin around kicking.\n\n01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440\nThat's not easy to do.\n\n01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440\nIt's very easy to do.\n\n01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440\nThis is a street fighter.\n\n01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.440\nIt's not down-back kick.\n\n01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.440\nIt is quite literally down-back kick.\n\n01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.440\nYou just spin down and backwards while kicking.\n\n01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440\nHow?\n\n01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440\nHow?\n\n01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.440\nI mean, show us, please.\n\n01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.440\nIf somebody doesn't Instagram this right now, I'm going to kill all of us.\n\n01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.440\nIt is such a bummer that this is an audio podcast.\n\n01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.440\nGoddamn it.\n\n01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.440\nBecause that is one of the best things I've ever seen.\n\n01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.440\nSpencer did something between Jean-Claude Van Damme and Baryshnikov.\n\n01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440\nPippi Longstocking, yeah.\n\n01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.440\nI don't see any of those kicks doing major damage.\n\n01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.440\nNo, but you keep knocking them back.\n\n01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440\nYou just got to keep going.\n\n01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.440\nThey would get you on the ground.\n\n01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.440\nI mean, not shitzus.\n\n01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440\nOh, no, not shitzus.\n\n01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:05.440\nHonestly, you might have been born in the wrong era because there's a great book about the early New York,\n\n01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.440\nthe Five Points, and they made that terrible movie, Gangs of New York, about it.\n\n01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440\nBut Luke Santé wrote a book called Low Life.\n\n01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440\nAnd someone likes that movie?\n\n01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.440\nYou're the person that wooed it at Moore Park?\n\n01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.440\nThat movie stinks because it's a bad history.\n\n01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440\nMaybe it's a fine movie, but it's not good history.\n\n01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.440\nBut there's a bunch of things, like entertainment back in the good old bad days of America.\n\n01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.440\nThere were things like rat baiting and bear baiting.\n\n01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.440\nThere was a thing called rat stomping where they would put a guy in a ring,\n\n01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:42.440\nsurrounded by a wooden pen, and they would put 100 or 200 rats in there.\n\n01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.440\nAnd you had to stomp them because they would come attack you.\n\n01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.440\nNo, no, no, but is it like a sport?\n\n01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.440\nYou would bet rat or man.\n\n01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.440\nSo these weren't prisoners.\n\n01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440\nNo, no, this is a bar.\n\n01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.440\nThis is a bar down, which is now the Bowery, and the Lower East Side of New York.\n\n01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.440\nAnd there'd be bear baiting, and there'd be dogs versus bears,\n\n01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.440\nand you would bet money on dogs for dogs or bear.\n\n01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440\nI wouldn't want to win.\n\n01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.440\nI think that, Spencer, you might have taken to that rat stomping.\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440\nWell, you were talking about rat stomping.\n\n01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440\nYou know those tiny monkeys that you see at the zoo?\n\n01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440\nThe little tiny black ones.\n\n01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.440\nLike really, inches tall.\n\n01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440\nYeah, those are adorable.\n\n01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440\nThe first time I saw those, I was just like, man, don't you just want to squish one?\n\n01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.440\nOh, see now?\n\n01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440\nJust stomp on it.\n\n01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.440\nI feel like Spencer's learning to fly.\n\n01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.440\nWe're getting to the heart of the matter here.\n\n01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:50.440\nSo in your coyote fight fetish dreams, are you annihilating them?\n\n01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.440\nAre you breaking their necks and ripping their hearts out?\n\n01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.440\nNo, no, I mean, well, you break a couple necks, sure.\n\n01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.440\nBut not, I mean, just time-wise.\n\n01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440\nYou've got to fight it back without breaking a couple necks.\n\n01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440\nI imagine if you want to make a coyote, I'm like,\n\n01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440\nwell, I mean, you've got to take it out of the fight, right?\n\n01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440\nYeah.\n\n01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440\nIf fighting a bunch of coyote, I think the first thing you do is you break the biggest one's neck\n\n01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440\nand send a message to the rest of you.\n\n01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.440\nWell, yeah, again, this isn't assuming they're not just going to turn tail and run, obviously.\n\n01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440\nWell, that's the thing, if you're just spinning around circles,\n\n01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.440\nyou kick about half the coyotes, they freak out and leave.\n\n01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440\nOkay, how about you, Spencer?\n\n01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:27.440\nI will say this, that move you did is a lot less threatening than you think it is.\n\n01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440\nIt's not supposed to be threatening.\n\n01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.440\nIt's specifically designed to take on hordes of small dogs.\n\n01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:39.440\nIf I see a little dog and I see a guy doing that, I'm like, I got this.\n\n01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.440\nThere's no way, also, you know, like, dogs, like any dog bigger than a shih tzu or any canine,\n\n01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.440\ntheir objective is to get you down on the ground.\n\n01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.440\nAnd once that happens, you're in trouble.\n\n01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440\nWell, again, with coyotes, they're very light.\n\n01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.440\nSo if you have three or four coyotes on, you just jump right up.\n\n01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.440\nAll right, but you can't jump up when these things got you.\n\n01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.440\nYeah, buddy.\n\n01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.440\nMy dog loves me, and sometimes he gets me at a disadvantage.\n\n01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.440\nWhat does that mean?\n\n01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440\nWhat?\n\n01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.440\nThat just sounds dangerous.\n\n01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:19.440\nWell, I'm just saying, he's a golden doodle, but he's like a five-foot child.\n\n01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440\nHe could grab me.\n\n01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.440\nHe would have the body mass of, like, six, five coyotes.\n\n01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.440\nThey have mouths full of little 32-caliber bullets.\n\n01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440\nCoyotes do?\n\n01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.440\nThat's why you throw out the left arm.\n\n01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440\nYeah.\n\n01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.440\nThey could kill you, man.\n\n01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.440\nSometimes I lay in bed with this guy and I'm rubbing his belly in, and he's just like,\n\n01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.440\noh, and I look at his teeth, and I'm like, yeah, this fucker could kill me.\n\n01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.440\nThat's what koo-toe is.\n\n01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.440\nKoo-toe goes bad.\n\n01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.440\nI had a scar on my ass, so my left butt cheek, like a shark tooth, like a triangle.\n\n01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440\nThat's your butt hole.\n\n01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.440\nIs there poop coming out of it?\n\n01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440\nIs it right in the middle?\n\n01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440\nYeah.\n\n01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.440\nWhen you push the button and pull the chain, is that where the chocolate choo-choo train\n\n01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440\ncomes out?\n\n01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.440\nBecause that's a butt hole.\n\n01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440\nEveryone has that scar.\n\n01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440\nIt's not a scar.\n\n01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440\nDon't think of it that way.\n\n01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.440\nI feel like...\n\n01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440\nIt's fucked up.\n\n01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440\nListen, it's not pretty, but that doesn't mean it's the scar.\n\n01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440\nIt's not a wound.\n\n01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440\nIt's actually, if anything, it's keeping you alive.\n\n01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.440\nI feel like you guys are making a little too lightly of an actual injury that I have.\n\n01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.440\nMy neighbors, when I was a kid, we had the O'Sullivan to live next door, and there was 19\n\n01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.440\nof them because they were Irish Catholic.\n\n01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440\nErases!\n\n01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.440\nNo, there were fucking 19 O'Sullivans.\n\n01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.440\nAnd anytime, Bill, Jeff, my brother and I, like anytime you guys want to come up and\n\n01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.440\ntake a swim in our pools, we didn't have a pool.\n\n01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.440\nAnytime you guys want to walk up and have a swim, just make sure that their dog, the\n\n01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440\ntwo German shepherds, one was named Guinness.\n\n01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440\nI remember his name because I buried the scar on my chest.\n\n01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.440\nI feel like you have, like, you've put racist memories in your childhood.\n\n01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.440\nThe Irish people's dog was named Guinness?\n\n01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440\nThis is an actual fact.\n\n01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.440\nActually, my brother has a dog named...\n\n01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.440\nWe had a dog named Guinness because of that, because of that, too.\n\n01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440\nThe other was Shalely.\n\n01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440\nShalely?\n\n01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.440\nYeah, one was just called Drinking.\n\n01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440\nAnd...\n\n01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.440\nAnd a parakeet named Famine.\n\n01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.440\nYeah.\n\n01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.440\nPote.\n\n01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440\nToo soon.\n\n01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.440\nI mean, not funny enough?\n\n01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.440\nI hope you're groaning that was a bad joke.\n\n01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.440\nNot that I went too far.\n\n01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440\nI can't stop.\n\n01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.440\nI think about him thinking that it's somebody thinking that I don't live this car.\n\n01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.440\nAnd it's still making me laugh.\n\n01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.440\nI know, like, I feel like he shut that down too fast.\n\n01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.440\nYeah, I thought so.\n\n01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440\nYou and I were having a good time.\n\n01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440\nJust placating him about his scar.\n\n01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.440\nMom, I have bad news. I have a scar.\n\n01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.440\nAnd it bleeds, but it's not blood.\n\n01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.440\nYes, my scar bleeds long brown blood.\n\n01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.440\nYou don't know how to make these jokes funny.\n\n01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.440\nI'm trying to help your awesome premise, you guys.\n\n01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440\nWe're doing it.\n\n01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.440\nYou're literally shitting over our awesome jokes.\n\n01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.440\nDo your scar-y butthole.\n\n01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.440\nSometimes men come over to my apartment and fuck me in my scar.\n\n01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.440\nYou're not good at it.\n\n01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.440\nWhat?\n\n01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.440\nYou can't make this one.\n\n01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440\nIt's my scar.\n\n01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.440\nThat's maybe why you can't make it funny.\n\n01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.440\nI'm just trying to help you with your bulletproof premise.\n\n01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.440\nLong brown blood.\n\n01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.440\nYou've shown us that our premise maybe isn't so bulletproof.\n\n01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440\nYeah.\n\n01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440\nOkay, go ahead. So you're there with the dogs.\n\n01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.440\nThe guys said the dogs would be locked up.\n\n01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440\nWe got up there. The dogs were not locked up.\n\n01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.440\nAnd there were two giant German shepherds.\n\n01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.440\nAnd Guinness, of all people, comes running straight at me.\n\n01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.440\nAnd I had like a little bathing suit on.\n\n01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.440\nAnd I'm like, I'm defenseless.\n\n01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440\nI'm barefoot.\n\n01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.440\nI'm sorry, long brown blood just got funny to me.\n\n01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440\nSo gross.\n\n01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440\nNow?\n\n01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440\nYeah, I don't know why.\n\n01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:08.440\nIt's like a wrestler for a really, really low-caliber wrestling federation.\n\n01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.440\nThere comes long brown blood.\n\n01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.440\nHe's going up against scorpion scissors.\n\n01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.440\nOh, long brown blood.\n\n01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440\nLong brown blood.\n\n01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.440\nGo ahead.\n\n01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440\nSo the dog's running at me and my brother.\n\n01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.440\nBut the dog picks me the smaller of the two.\n\n01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.440\nI think that's good pack animal instincts.\n\n01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440\nTake the baby out.\n\n01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440\nI don't know, I was about six or something like that.\n\n01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440\nAnd I turned around and think, Heavens,\n\n01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440\nbecause he chopped me right where the essentials might have been.\n\n01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440\nAnd he took a piece out of my ass.\n\n01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440\nIt took a big chunk.\n\n01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440\nThat's the other thing, they go for your nuts.\n\n01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.440\nThat's what I was going to say.\n\n01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440\nOkay.\n\n01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440\nThey go for your crotch.\n\n01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.440\nBecause that's dog height.\n\n01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.440\nAnd it doesn't matter how much throat punching you use.\n\n01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.440\nWell, no, you kick them right when they're in mid-jump.\n\n01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440\nThey can't change direction.\n\n01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.440\nDude, there's more than one.\n\n01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.440\nThere's a lot of them.\n\n01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440\nYeah, well, they don't all jump at the same time.\n\n01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.440\nThat'd be silly.\n\n01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.440\nRight, because they don't want to get hurrican away by your kicks.\n\n01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440\nYeah.\n\n01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.440\nI trained under Trump.\n\n01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.440\nYour flurry of feet that you have unleashed\n\n01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440\nwas an unsuspecting pack.\n\n01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440\nYou saw that flurry of feet.\n\n01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440\nI know you don't like doing requests,\n\n01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.440\nbut I'm the only one that's going to have a video of this.\n\n01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.440\nCan you get up and demonstrate the...\n\n01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.440\nI really don't like doing requests.\n\n01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440\nCome on, I'll do my Sean Connery impression.\n\n01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.440\nIf you do your circle kick.\n\n01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440\nWe have to have it documented.\n\n01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.440\nFor science more than anything.\n\n01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.440\nI'm going to cry while I do it, though.\n\n01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440\nFine, all right, do it.\n\n01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440\nWhoo!\n\n01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440\nThis is so long.\n\n01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440\nOh.\n\n01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:58.440\nThat's how you fight off a pack of dogs.\n\n01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440\nI sold out.\n\n01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.440\nBy the way, this is the day that the podcast changed me.\n\n01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.440\nI sold out!\n\n01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.440\nHow pissed would you be if that was the ending to the gray?\n\n01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440\nThat's what he did at the end.\n\n01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440\nOh, that should be it.\n\n01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440\nThat'd be amazing.\n\n01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.440\nThat would have been amazing.\n\n01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.440\nThat's basically how Alice in Wonderland ended, right?\n\n01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.440\nThat's why they cut the ending out of the gray.\n\n01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.440\nHe kept teasing that crazy movie that he's got.\n\n01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.440\nSpencer, it doesn't matter how many of them come at you.\n\n01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.440\nI've got a special move on you.\n\n01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440\nWhat's it called?\n\n01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.440\nThe Meganeson.\n\n01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.440\nThe whirling Liam.\n\n01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.440\nAnd then they're like, can you show us the whirling Liam?\n\n01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440\nNo.\n\n01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.440\nDogs have to come at me in a certain...\n\n01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.440\nI have to be in circles and they have to come at me one by one.\n\n01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.440\nI'm perfectly counterclockwise.\n\n01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.440\nOops.\n\n01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440\nI spilled water everywhere.\n\n01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.440\nThat was so intimidated.\n\n01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.440\nAnd thrown.\n\n01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.440\nSpencer, I think I speak for all of us when I say we've missed you dearly, man.\n\n01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440\nYes.\n\n01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440\nIs...no?\n\n01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440\nOkay.\n\n01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.440\nYou know, Duncan Trussell was threatening to drop in on us,\n\n01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440\nbut it's also 9.30, so...\n\n01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.440\nThis show doesn't need him.\n\n01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440\nNo, I know, but...\n\n01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.440\nI have tears running down my face.\n\n01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440\nI cannot handle it.\n\n01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440\nHave you done that before?\n\n01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.440\nWas there a time when you were in your room and you were like,\n\n01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.440\nif dogs happen, I think I can do this?\n\n01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.440\nYeah, are you kidding?\n\n01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:36.440\nWhy do you think I had such confidence when I told you it's possible?\n\n01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.440\nYou don't just go into these situations half-cocked.\n\n01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440\nYou prepare.\n\n01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.440\nI also think if you're spinning around in a circle,\n\n01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.440\nyou're going to start, like, you know...\n\n01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440\nOh, yeah, that's why, you know, 6 or 7.\n\n01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.440\nNo, but you said 80, whatever.\n\n01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.440\nCheetos.\n\n01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.440\nWhat? Cheetos.\n\n01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.440\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.440\nBut again, at some point, you'd start stomping.\n\n01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.440\nIt'd be, you'd save energy.\n\n01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.440\nIt's self-defense.\n\n01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440\nThese are bloodthirsty cheetos.\n\n01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.440\nYeah, so I could commit violence against animals.\n\n01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.440\nWhat's wrong with that?\n\n01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.440\nIt's hypothetical.\n\n01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.440\nYeah.\n\n01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440\nIf it helps, these dogs are all racist.\n\n01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440\nSo...\n\n01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.440\nAnd Polish.\n\n01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.440\nAnd Polish patons.\n\n01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.440\nPaton coyotes.\n\n01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.440\nThe dog...\n\n01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.440\nYou know what?\n\n01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.440\nA paton coyote went into a bar.\n\n01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440\nAnd he's like,\n\n01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.440\nthis is how a paton coyote eats a...\n\n01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.440\neats a shih tzu.\n\n01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.440\nI held the shih tzu with my paws,\n\n01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.440\nput it over to the side.\n\n01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.440\nIt's Dan.\n\n01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.440\nIt's better they don't know.\n\n01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440\nDeconstructing the paton...\n\n01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.440\npaton joke formula.\n\n01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.440\nIt seems like they just have bad spatial...\n\n01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.440\nno death perception.\n\n01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.440\nThat is a big component of the paton joke.\n\n01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.440\nA lot of them suffer from a genesis of the basal colosum\n\n01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440\nor the corpus colosum,\n\n01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.440\nand they don't know where things are.\n\n01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440\nYeah.\n\n01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440\nFucking patons.\n\n01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.440\nCan you do the joke that Siike did?\n\n01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.440\nWhich is one line?\n\n01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.440\nOh, well, my dad...\n\n01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.440\nOh, God.\n\n01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.440\nOh, God.\n\n01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.440\nOh, dear God.\n\n01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:30.440\nMy dad was a globe manufacturer.\n\n01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440\nOh, oh, God damn it.\n\n01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.440\nQuick disclaimer, some kid wrote to me on Tumblr.\n\n01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.440\nI think it was Tumblr.\n\n01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.440\nI want to pull it up.\n\n01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.440\nLast week's episode, you know,\n\n01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.440\nI was in my cups, as Chevy calls it.\n\n01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440\nI was having fun.\n\n01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.440\nWhen I'm talking about therapy and stuff\n\n01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.440\nand how much I don't want to do it and blah, blah, blah,\n\n01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.440\nand I'm all self-righteous and indignant and all that stuff,\n\n01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.440\nI'm not in role model mode.\n\n01:20:54.440 --> 01:21:00.440\nAnd I never want anybody emulating me\n\n01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.440\nor taking anything I say seriously in that regard.\n\n01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.440\nWe apparently talk seek out of actual help.\n\n01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.440\nWell, yeah, I mean, he was, like,\n\n01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440\ninspired by your show.\n\n01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.440\nI go, well, don't say that.\n\n01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.440\nGod damn it.\n\n01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440\nWhere's the...\n\n01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.440\nI thought it was one of our Tumblr dealies.\n\n01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.440\nWhatever.\n\n01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.440\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.440\nI guess I wanted to give the person, you know,\n\n01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440\nread them their own words,\n\n01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.440\nbut I don't think I can find them, so whatever.\n\n01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.440\nIt was a kid writing in and saying, you know,\n\n01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.440\nI hope that, you know, because they said,\n\n01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.440\nI need help from professionals,\n\n01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.440\nand I hope that nobody interpreted your screed\n\n01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.440\nas, like, being a recommendation against seeking help\n\n01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.440\nfrom others as professional people and stuff like that.\n\n01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440\nNot only was I being ironic, like, in the end,\n\n01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.440\nlike, I self-deprecate and go, like,\n\n01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.440\nof course the whole point of this is that I'm crazy.\n\n01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440\nI'm in denial.\n\n01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440\nNobody needs therapy more than me,\n\n01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440\nand I like to have fun and say,\n\n01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440\nI don't need the therapy and therapists\n\n01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440\nare full of bullshit.\n\n01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.440\nI mean, I'm not kidding either.\n\n01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.440\nI'm expressing this indignation and like,\n\n01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.440\nI'm being a child.\n\n01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.440\nI'm sucking my thumb and having fun.\n\n01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.440\nBut I don't want any of you kids out there.\n\n01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.440\nI don't want anybody that thinks that they need\n\n01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.440\nto talk to somebody to think that they shouldn't,\n\n01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.440\nmy God, or that that's a bad choice.\n\n01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.440\nThat's so crazy.\n\n01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.440\nYou should see a shrink.\n\n01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.440\nGoing through a shrink is not going to hurt you at all\n\n01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440\nand could very well help you,\n\n01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.440\nand I'm only making fun of myself by saying,\n\n01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440\nindignantly, that I don't need to go,\n\n01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.440\nand I'm 41 and blah, blah, blah.\n\n01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.440\nSo I hope that that buys back any karma\n\n01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440\nthat I may have tainted.\n\n01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440\nAll right, back to being funny.\n\n01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.440\nAlso, races are good.\n\n01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:03.440\nIf I said anything and made you think your race is bad.\n\n01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440\nIt's good.\n\n01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440\nIt's a good way to know who to trust.\n\n01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440\nYeah, I think, you know, look,\n\n01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440\nwe all have our functions.\n\n01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.440\nGermans are like the Swiss army knife of races.\n\n01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.440\nWhat are the Swiss?\n\n01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:22.440\nSort of what I call them, the German shadow.\n\n01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.440\nWhat are the Dutch?\n\n01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.440\nThe Dutch are the dykes of men.\n\n01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.440\nThat's tough but fair.\n\n01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.440\nHe's tough but fair.\n\n01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:46.440\nThe blue people are black.\n\n01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440\nEl Salvadorans?\n\n01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.440\nThey love carrots.\n\n01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.440\nBut what are Peruvians famously afraid of?\n\n01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.440\nMosquitos.\n\n01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.440\nBut it's that fear that drives them.\n\n01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.440\nIt keeps them making bug zappers.\n\n01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.440\nThat's technically racist to say\n\n01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.440\nthat Peruvians make great bug zappers but they do.\n\n01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.440\nEl Salvadorans, what did you say?\n\n01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.440\nEl Salvadorans.\n\n01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.440\nThey're terrified of mosquitoes.\n\n01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:21.440\nI said it.\n\n01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440\nYou go down there.\n\n01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440\nYou do mission work like I did.\n\n01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440\nI work with them.\n\n01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.440\nI understand them and when you work with them\n\n01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.440\nyou learn to laugh at them.\n\n01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.440\nIt becomes okay.\n\n01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.440\nI have carried an El Salvadoran child into the ocean\n\n01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.440\nto drown him.\n\n01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.440\nTo show him mosquitoes.\n\n01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:53.440\nBecause that country has no extradition policy.\n\n01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.440\nOh my God.\n\n01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.440\nThere's been such great advice on this.\n\n01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.440\nIt's words to live by should be the title of the podcast.\n\n01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.440\nThat should be words to live by.\n\n01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.440\nOr Longbrown.\n\n01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440\nLongbrown.\n\n01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.440\nIt should be called do as I say and as I do.\n\n01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.440\nWe've learned how to fight dogs.\n\n01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.440\nImitate me.\n\n01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:25.440\nAnd the logo is just a fork going into an outlet.\n\n01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.440\nJust a happy kid staring into a happy son.\n\n01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:37.440\nSpencer, is this a thing that you've thought about\n\n01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440\nsince you were a kid?\n\n01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.440\nI really want to parse this.\n\n01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.440\nI grew up listening to coyotes outside my window.\n\n01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.440\nIs there going to be a time where they're going to be closer\n\n01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.440\nthan outside my window?\n\n01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.440\nI don't know.\n\n01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.440\nI definitely thought about it.\n\n01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.440\nI used to hike a shit ton.\n\n01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.440\nAgain, we lived in farmlands and you'd just go\n\n01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.440\nif you got a one mile anywhere, you'd be hiking.\n\n01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.440\nYou wouldn't just be walking on a street.\n\n01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.440\nThink about stuff.\n\n01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.440\nI used to fall asleep when I was a little kid in testin.\n\n01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.440\nBehind the house was just hills.\n\n01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.440\nThere was nothing there.\n\n01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.440\nNow it's totally developed.\n\n01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.440\nIt was just at night.\n\n01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.440\nIt was so cool.\n\n01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.440\nWe heard one last year.\n\n01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440\nWe lived in Silver Lake.\n\n01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.440\nWe actually went out.\n\n01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440\nEmily loves animals.\n\n01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.440\nIt was fine that someone went and it was just a coyote out there.\n\n01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.440\nI wish I'd known about the spin kick move.\n\n01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.440\nWhat about that?\n\n01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.440\nIs it a big ass mountain lion or a jaguar or some shit\n\n01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440\nthat lives up in the Hollywood Hills?\n\n01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440\nHave you seen this shit?\n\n01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.440\nThere's Cougars there.\n\n01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440\nI'm so sorry.\n\n01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.440\nPlease take that out.\n\n01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.440\nThat's it.\n\n01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440\nLeave it.\n\n01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.440\nSomebody put a motion sensor camera up\n\n01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.440\non the first Hollywood sign\n\n01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440\nand there's an awesome glamour shot of this giant mountain lion.\n\n01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.440\nIs it a mountain lion?\n\n01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.440\nIt's fucking enormous.\n\n01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440\nIt's a huge predator.\n\n01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.440\nThey just crossed the 134 freeway somehow.\n\n01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.440\nI don't know how you get there.\n\n01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.440\nYeah.\n\n01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440\nI remember when we were kids,\n\n01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.440\nwe went to one of our vacations\n\n01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.440\nor as we went to a different part of Pakistan\n\n01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.440\nto go hiking.\n\n01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440\nWe all day took us to get up this mountain,\n\n01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440\nmeet my family and their friends.\n\n01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.440\nNo.\n\n01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440\nIt's not.\n\n01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.440\nWe climbed the mountain by digging a hole.\n\n01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440\nSpatial jumps.\n\n01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440\nThey can't do a damn thing the right way.\n\n01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440\nWe finally got all the way up.\n\n01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.440\nWhat is a Patan sandwich made of?\n\n01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.440\nIt's just two pieces of meat\n\n01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.440\nwith a bread in between.\n\n01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.440\nThat is what it is.\n\n01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.440\nWe really figured this out.\n\n01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.440\nI saw\n\n01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.440\nthey wear glasses on their feet\n\n01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.440\nand shoes on their head.\n\n01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.440\nThey just have airplanes for hats.\n\n01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.440\nWe climbed all the way up.\n\n01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.440\nTook us all day.\n\n01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440\nAs soon as we got up there,\n\n01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.440\nit was like a very barren mountain.\n\n01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440\nWe got there and it was just one tree\n\n01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440\nand under that tree\n\n01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.440\nwas just sitting a big fucking lion\n\n01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.440\nlooking right at us.\n\n01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.440\nWe all walked up,\n\n01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.440\nsaw this lion\n\n01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440\nand hiked back down.\n\n01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440\nOur whole day was going to be hanging out\n\n01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440\non top of that mountain.\n\n01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440\nOn Lion Ridge.\n\n01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.440\nThis mountain is taken.\n\n01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.440\nWhat do you think, tough guy?\n\n01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.440\nYou got a little adventure.\n\n01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.440\nIs there anything else we need to wrap up\n\n01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.440\nbefore we go on a month-long break?\n\n01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.440\nI don't actually hate animals.\n\n01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.440\nThis is hypothetical.\n\n01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.440\nNone of us think you're actually going to fight.\n\n01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.440\nEveryone was disclaiming.\n\n01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.440\nI feel like I should have done it too.\n\n01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.440\nDon't let me jumpstart that.\n\n01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.440\nThere's nothing that you can say on this stage\n\n01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.440\nthat's so innocuous that someone's not going to\n\n01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.440\nhave a problem with it.\n\n01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.440\nNow I want to make that clear.\n\n01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.440\nThat's a good example.\n\n01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.440\nThat back pedal, whatever you call that.\n\n01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440\nI was saying that because I love\n\n01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.440\npeople and I want them to be happy\n\n01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.440\nand I don't want them to be in pain.\n\n01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.440\nThen there's this other culture of\n\n01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440\nwow, that was offensive technically.\n\n01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.440\nYou put your elbow on the table of language\n\n01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.440\nand it's like, I shouldn't have done that\n\n01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.440\nbecause I know that that hurt someone.\n\n01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.440\nI'm saying that's not...\n\n01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.440\nIt's like we blur the two\n\n01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.440\nand go like, you should apologize.\n\n01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.440\nI thought Natasha Legerro\n\n01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.440\nwas a

01:39:06.440\nIt's like a porcelain toilet.\n\n01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440\nYou don't even understand.\n\n01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440\nI pop my head back out.\n\n01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440\nYou

keep it in the bathroom?\n\n01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440\nBecause then if I have to get out of the house...\n\n01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.440\nIs that why they call you Whizball?\n\n01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.440\nNo.\n\n01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.440\nBut that's very clever.\n\n01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440\nWell, it's not on me.\n\n01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440\nI mean, it seems like that's something\n\n01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440\nthat might have occurred to you before.\n\n01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440\nNo. I never thought my bucket\n\n01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.440\nwould be questioned to be quite honest.\n\n01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.440\nWhizball, is there anybody\n\n01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440\nin Bill Mardigan's\n\n01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.440\ngreat expanse that

01:40:24.440\nIt's like Santa's chimney.\n\n01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440\nIt's like that bag that you guys came through.\n\n01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440\nYeah, okay.\n\n01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440\nI'm just throwing\n\n01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440\nthings out there.\n\n01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440\nI pee in his toilet,\n\n01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.440\nbut I don't

into.\n\n01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.440\nYou see him, he's surrounded by smoke\n\n01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.440\nbut then he leaps out of it, right?\n\n01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.440\nNo, I started

do.\n\n01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.440\nI think we could wave the bucket around\n\n01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.440\nand move all the smoke to that guy's bathroom.\n\n01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.440\nI was just going to push him\n\n01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.440\ninto the bucket\n\n01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.440\nand send him to the fucking bathroom.\n\n01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.440\nI feel

fight.\n\n01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.440\nOkay, this...\n\n01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.440\nguy.\n\n01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.440\nSmoke pours through the guy's mouth\n\n01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.440\nand is now kind of consuming\n\n01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.440\nthis whole room and smoke.\n\n01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:50.440\nYou guys are overcome with smooth flavor.\n\n01:59:50.440 -->

hostile.\n\n02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.440\nBut he does seem overwhelmingly powerful.\n\n02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.440\nAll right.\n\n02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440\nI don't think a bucket is going to
