Seryl Audio

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Bonjour and bonsoir mademoiselle

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
Welcome once again to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Harbin Town is now in session

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
While we're at it, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harbin Town, Dan Harbin

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Thank you

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Thank you

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Nothing really to talk about tonight

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Very busy, very sleepy

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
We're working on this G.I. Joe cartoon

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Wasn't it supposed to be turned in several months ago?

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, it airs Thursday

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Are you still making it?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
We're just got a couple more G.I. Joe's to draw

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Wait, so you have an animated episode of Community

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
That is, when was that supposed to be like a properly functioning studio network driven universe?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
When was that supposed to be in?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't know, months ago

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Months ago?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Well, you said that

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Now you're shocked by it

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Wasn't that supposed to be done months ago?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know, months ago

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I don't know what that means

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
We're putting on a show here, Dan

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm trying to involve these people and the crisis that is your life right now

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Well, I don't know, I just don't, I don't do time

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm not good with dates and things

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
And certainly it's all my fault

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
What time was your show air?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Eight o'clock

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
He does that time

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
It's all my fault because I took too long to write the script and all this stuff

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
So Schrab's kind of doing his Schrab thing and he's being an asshole

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
It's like saying stuff on Twitter implying I should be there instead of being here

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
If I went out to go do wedding plans with Aaron and then Rob was tweeting

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
Hope you're having fun while I'm over here animating this and stuff

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
So today I

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Oh, sweet

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
You don't have this on your iPad, do you?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
I might have it in my mail, do you want me to try to open it in there?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Will it then play on their speakers better?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Let's see if I have my mail

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
So today I went over and one of the last things I had to do was record the vocals for the G.I. Joe theme

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
We had Jonathan Kimmel, who's Jimmy's brother, who actually we used him for some vocal stuff on the Sarah Silverman show back in the day

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
And he's a great singer and he's particularly good at this G.I. Joe register for that well-known theme song

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
I have a question about it, but before we play it, is that so close that you guys are in jeopardy of copyright infringement?

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
No, it's with their permission, Hasbro's been very cooperative

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Because it's the melody

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It's the absolute song

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, we're caught, it's G.I. Joe

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
So I just did some alternate lyrics, I think we're allowed to play this because it's like fair use or parody or something, right?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I don't know

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Our show? I play the Beatles and shit, man

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, I mean, it's a podcast, let's hope we squeak by

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I mean, we're not going to make any money off of this or steal any money from it

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
What would the season desist be? Stop doing that next week?

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
It's being leaked, it's like the Chevy voicemails, it's a leak

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Okay

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I don't know who's doing this

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
TMZ, get your camera set, right?

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
So I didn't even listen to the regular lyrics of the theme song, because that's what people really want to hear

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
But I ran in with the, I was like, can you do one more take and just do these alternate lyrics so I can bring them back to the office to Schrab

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
So this is punishing Rob Schrab.who's dutifully directing the episode that you turned in too late

04:24.000 --> 04:48.000
And he's working around the clock

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
He'll never be nice, he's always mean, eating his own poop and drinking his pee

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Strawbass hole, strawbass hole is there

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Strawbass hole is the code name for America's biggest dumbest poop-eating asshole

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
His purpose? To tweet mean things at Dan Harmon, a TV writer determined to entertain nice people

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I also suspect he hits his wife

05:13.000 --> 05:25.000
He makes you feel bad when you write a script late, strawbass asshole, strawbass hole, strawbass hole

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Little unfair, but it's a good song

05:39.000 --> 05:52.000
It's accurate, he gets close to it deadline and then he's like, oh I hate you, I hate you for not turning the script on time or whatever

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Makes him feel better, gets him going

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
You know what's not healthy for me is a satisfied confident Schrab that feels sorry for me or is loyal to me

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
That's dangerous, him running around out there, I don't know

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Why is that?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't know, he's a devious guy

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
You know, remember when Sarah fired me?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
He kept working there

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Is that what this is about?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Don't bury the lead man

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
There's always a little of that underneath everything

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
You guys used to be inseparable best friends, you're not as close as you obviously were

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
What do you mean?

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
No, we had a year where we were actually not talking to each other, we were actually mad

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
In the wake of the Sarah thing, I actually spent a year not liking him and stuff for real

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
But then we made up, when Mike Ash died, Channel 101

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
We were at a memorial service for a guy who ended his life doing Channel 101 and it just felt like we're both there

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
And it just felt knobbish to continue to not like each other, kind of made up there

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Put it in your biopic

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
And then you wrote that song today

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
Alright, I don't have anything, in pop culture news

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I smell Bieber rant

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That was a goodie by the way

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
The new thing now, Jeff, is hashtags, you can use hashtags to cancel TV shows for being racist

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
You can pick which show you think is racist and you can hashtag cancel in the name of the show

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
And then voila, racism will go away

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Comedy will become incredibly sophisticated

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
The whole species will become smarter because obviously people that do that are already for really smart material to go into their heads

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
We're clearly at peak IQ as a nation here

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Yeah, it's just a new thing

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Do you have a for instance hashtag on your mind right now?

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
I would like to submit hashtag cancel Teen Wolf, I think Teen Wolf's racist

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Mondays at 1030

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
You know I created that show

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Aren't you racist?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It's racist as the day is long

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
So please watch me

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Jeff Bryan Davis, not the creator of Teen Wolf

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
People still are convinced that I created the goddamn show

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
But I have never seen nor would under any fucking circumstance

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Every time I tell people that, I get more Teen Wolf followers

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
And for some reason, in Portuguese

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
I did a series of tweets again about how I didn't create it but I started doing TNA

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm getting ahead of myself

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Teen Wolf Q&A, or as I call it, TNA

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Because my time is very valuable

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I answer questions about Teen Wolf as me

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
But people think that I am Jeff Davis, creator of Criminal Minds and Teen Wolf

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I just keep saying what a racist I am

09:20.000 --> 09:28.000
So cancel Teen Wolf and watch Rick and Morty on Mondays at 1030 instead

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That's my secret agenda

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Teen Wolf is the only show that gets higher ratings than Rick and Morty in our time slot

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Is that right?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
That's unfair

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I think I've made it pretty clear

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm not too hip to the modern TV shows and music and stuff like that

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I fucking love Rick and Morty

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
I watched it last week and I texted you about it, which I don't really do

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
That show delights me

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It makes me very happy

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Nice

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
It's a good show

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It's really...

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It's good

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
And I think I can say that objectively

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
And subtract my friendship with you and knowing Justin and knowing everybody involved with it

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I think I would like that show in a vacuum just as much

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Like Futurama, I've watched those, never did it

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
There's other animated shows, this is fucking good

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
I never really watched Futurama, I heard it was really good

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I should go back and start watching it

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm sure it is, I never got off the ground for it

10:25.000 --> 10:32.000
Okay, so I wanted to bring out some special friends and have a special show tonight

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Because we're going to take a little break for April

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
I had a little chance, I got a lot of shit going on

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
That's not really why, I can be busy and keep doing Harmontowns

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And I'll miss it as soon as we don't do it for a week

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But we're just going to take April off

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Because it's a show that never takes a hiatus

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Is it because Game of Thrones is also on Sunday?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
No

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And then there's people tweeting, oh shit, I'm coming in from Australia

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And I'm like okay, I'll have a drink with you

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And then someone else says, I'm coming in from Texas

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And I'm like okay, I'll have a drink with you

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I'm going to have a busier month because I'm taking it off

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
But I also just realized Aaron and I are now scheduling a trip to go to Cancun at some point

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
And I think that might overlap with the arrival of Levi

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Remember Levi with the bare feet in the business?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
How could I forget?

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
He's coming up here, and then I saw that and I was like, well that guy's not going to take

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Go to Cancun with Levi, take Levi to Cancun, it's built for bare feet

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
I feel like as long as the boat that's hitched to my car has at least one axle

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Levi will figure out a way to come down there

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Cape Fear reference

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Wow

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Okay, I have, Jesus

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Is that Robert Mitchum or?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Well I was referencing the De Niro movie

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Someone said both I think maybe, I never saw the Mitchum one

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
What a sizzler this tonight's show is

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Not that it's our job to sizzle, I don't know

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
We're a sizzler

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
I think iTunes called us the most notable sizzlers

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Are we on sizzle?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I don't have a lot of time

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
You don't have a lot of money?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Sizzler

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
So in what order should we bring people up?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I say in alphabetical

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I say first, is Duncan here yet?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Okay

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Spoiler

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Well first let's bring out Kumail then

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Hello

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Sorry, thank you for nailing that

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I have to say the iPad's been a little spotted today

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I've got to say I've had that

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Because I was at Star Burns earlier today for some other thing

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And you played me that song

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
It's been stuck in my head

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It's really catchy

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
If you see Rob on the street or something really

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
He'd really appreciate you

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
That's why I emailed it to his wife and all his friends

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
I've actually been doing fake lyrics to that melody all day

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Like cheddar cheese

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Favorite cheese on the sandwich

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Cheddar cheese is there

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It was so funny because you played it for me

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And Schrab was there

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And he's so good at that

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Where he's like, oh come on guys

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Please, no, come on

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
It was so funny to see his face

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
As we're listening to this

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
He loves being the victim

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
You remember when he comes on the show

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It's really fun to make fun of him

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
It really is

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
He makes it really fun

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
He does

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
He says stop doing it

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Are your parents still in town?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Mine?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
My parents in law

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
What do you say?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I was following your Instagrams

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
And I thought it was like your parents

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
You thought I had white parents?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Are you not paying attention at all?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
There were no photos

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I didn't see photos of your parents

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
There was just like captions that said

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Like my mom taking a picture of a thing

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh yeah, that was Emily's mom

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Yes, they are still in town

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Emily's wife?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah dude

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I scored

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Lucky devil

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
We don't see race at Harmontown

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Harmontown is

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Yes, we fucking do

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Harmontown is a race-free zone

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Which sounds bad

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Only one race allowed

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
No races

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I think if you go back

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and listen to all the Harmontowns

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I think that statement will stand up

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I obsess about race

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
because the rest of society

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
gets tangled in it, falters in it

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
I who see human beings as beacons of light

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Try to study

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
You're about to say the most racist thing yet

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Beacons of light

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
He means white people

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Beacons of light with different accents

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, that cancel thing was really bugging me too

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
because it was Colbert and SNL were the two ones

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
and it was for race stuff

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I invite people's

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
decision to start pushing comedy

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
to be more sophisticated

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
You don't do that by cancelling shows

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
and you don't cancel shows with hashtags

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
What is the hashtag?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Hashtag cancel it racist?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
No, it's cancel

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
You're terrible at coming up with hashtags

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
It's gotta be quick buddy

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Gotta be snappy

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
We only got 140 characters

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Get to it

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
What is the hashtag?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Cancel it racist

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Another hashtag

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Cancel Colbert

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and cancel SNL are the two hashtags

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
that I think Dan was before

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Why is race built into that hashtag?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Well, it's not

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
It's just two things in a row happen

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
where the Twitter account for Colbert

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Which is not run by the writers

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah, but also whatever

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
There was a joke on there that was

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
the first free joke in 20 years

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
that that show's been at a Twitter account

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I don't know what the joke was

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
but it really doesn't matter

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
It was sort of interpreted as

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I know what the joke was

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and it was just a quote from the show

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
the night before

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
and it was taken out of context

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
and quoted

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
and the point of it was

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
the owner of the Redskins

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
they're like

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
sort of you know how Colbert does

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
so it's like yeah, he's right

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
he should have a racist whatever

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
he's helping him

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and then it said

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
in the show he says like

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and we have the

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I'm gonna feel horrible

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
saying it

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
but it's like

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
we'll have the Qingchang Bingbong Foundation

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
to help Asian Americans

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
that was what

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Hashtag cancel Kumail Nanjiani

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
I can't be racist, I'm not white

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
That's racist

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
No, it's not

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Yes it is

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
No

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Kumail, I'm white

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
if I say it's racist, I'm right

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Fuck

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That's right

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
So something like that

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
even if you don't

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
You've learned nothing

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Even if you don't think the joke is funny

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
you at least get what they're going for

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
and it's not clearly something

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, it's called satire

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
which is lost on 95% of humanity

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And especially a new emerging

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
group of people

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I hate to shake my Gen X cane again

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
but it's just like

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
did we go through

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
some kind of censorship war

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
that we

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
so we understand

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
that it's always a bad idea

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
to start telling people

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
what's right and wrong

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
to say for free on the internet

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
but also what I hate is

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
so when this was happening

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
there were people sort of defending Colbert

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
and there were so many people being like

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
oh you're white

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
you don't get to talk about this

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
No, everybody gets to talk about it

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Right?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
And also comedy doesn't suffer

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
any discussion at all

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
and it doesn't

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
And how much comedy

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
or how much brilliant fucking

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
sophisticated comedy is going to come out

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
of these

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
arbiters of comedy

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
like these are the most joyless fucking people

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
in the world

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
what are they going to replace

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
bad jokes with

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
they're not going to replace them with good ones

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
no

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
they're not like

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
like Sudoku?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
what are we going to

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
because they don't seem like

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
bright people to me

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
it doesn't seem like

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
like if you can't

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
if you don't understand

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
ha ha ha ha

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I understand not

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
you guys cut that too right

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
I understand if you

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I understand if you

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
if you get a

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I wish there was a way to describe this

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
like an ironic

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
ironic racial humor

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
where it's like

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
oh I'm using the boomerang

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
the wrong way on purpose

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
blah blah blah

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
like racially

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
the

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
boomerang?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
is this about

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
the audience has gone down too?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
yeah

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
you're going to just take every race down

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
we're all beacons of light

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
but some are less bright than others

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
but honestly

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
the charge seems to be led by people who

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
actually

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
we're not even talking about the greatest

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
jokes in the world

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
and then we're talking about people who

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
actually don't seem to get them

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
yes exactly

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
like who actually

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
who actually parse language

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
in a joke

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
word for word

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
and like a spell check

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
like see a word

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
that they then connect a dot

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
to offensiveness with

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
and then categorize the joke as

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
therefore offensive

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
actually not getting the joke

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
and I'm not saying

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
so we're used to saying

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
if you don't get the joke

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
then that means that the joke is so much more

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
sophisticated than you

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
now we're talking about knock-knock jokes

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
that people aren't getting

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
because they involve race

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
it's like knock-knock who's there

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
black guy black guy who

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
hey I'm sorry I'm late

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
because the black people time stereotype

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
cancel Dan Harmon

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
like

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
like that's

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
that's a bad dumb

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
unsophisticated joke

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
just let them

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
let them stop getting laughs

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
like they're

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
it's not really not hurting anybody

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
it's not

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
and this idea that the television is going to

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
somehow

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
like you're going to

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
we're going to control television

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and make ourselves

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
less racist

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
because then the things

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
that we watch on the magic box

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
won't make us racist anymore

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
this is just all these racist people

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
are just going to go outside

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
and make the outdoors racist

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
if there's nothing racist

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
to watch on TV anymore

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
they're just going to

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I mean isn't the problem that

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
your neighbor is secretly racist

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
and he's just like

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
watching Big Bang Theory

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
and going yeah I got that

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
I hate Jews

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I mean don't you want

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
that guy glued to the tube

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
like do you want him in the woods

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
yeah

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
you don't want him out there

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
buying crosses and matches

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
and isn't there actual

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
racism happening somewhere

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
real racism

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
like actual ethnic cleansing

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
where someone goes up to a race

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
and says

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
me no like your race

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
because your race bad

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
and me want to eliminate

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
very problematic

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
10

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Japanese, Australian

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I was now the Chinese

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
is anybody saying

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
that was a caveman

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
not an Asian

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
you guys are racist

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
again

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
oh I can't be racist

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
he was a good killer bear

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
long time

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
see now

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
okay so there you go

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
there's the

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
so we're in this

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
we're in this realm

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
where we're trading

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
like pogs

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
like examples of socially

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
socially non-conscientious

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
I think it's racist just that

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
cavemen can't be Chinese

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
why can't they be Chinese cavemen

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
I'm sure there were

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
yeah I don't

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
I mean

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I don't know

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
if they were

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
it didn't sound

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
like that

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
you mean they didn't speak

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
English with a Chinese accent

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
like somebody told them

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
like you guys have to do this

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Chinese thing

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
I'm sorry

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Camille

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
and I don't want you

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
to think about the consequences

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I'm going to

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
I'm going to give you

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
a suggestion

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
and I want you just to do it

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
without considering the fallout

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
this is the end of my career

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
yeah yeah

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
what would a Chinese caveman sound like

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I think you did that great

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
we're both racist

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
there was a movie

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
but I can be racist

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
I'm allowed to be racist

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
no you've proven that

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
time and again

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
yeah yes

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
I make it look good

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
you know

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
it's more allowed

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
people that qualify as minority

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
are allowed to be

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
a little bit more

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
no I don't

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I mean it's

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Pakistani people are very very racist

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
which is a racist thing to say

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
white people are born racist

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
born racist

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
and I'm not saying this to

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
be glib

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I have a friend who is Assyrian

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
and his

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
what you would call your

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Pollock jokes

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
there are a certain

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
neighboring country

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
and I forget what it is

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
and that country's

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Pollock joke is the Turkish

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
oh yeah

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
you just supplant

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
everybody's shitting on it

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
somebody else

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
the worst premise of all time

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I grew up in Los Angeles

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I didn't know any Polish people

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
if they were Polish

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
they were a fifth Polish

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
you know

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
but still on the playground

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Polish jokes had traction

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
for some reason

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
yeah we had

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
we had our version of

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Polish jokes

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
who is it

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
we call them Pathan

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
but it's basically the

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
ethnicity that

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
sort of lives in Afghanistan

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
and the area of Pakistan

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
bordering Afghanistan

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
and they're called what

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
we call them Pathan

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
so what's a Pathan joke

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
it would be like

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
how does a Pathan

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
tie his shoe laces

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
and it would be that

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
you know that thing

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
or

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
okay

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
it's a visual joke

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
make it podcast-friendly

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
how does a Pathan

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
he lifted his shoe halfway

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
and then reached down

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
because you're supposed to sit

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
he puts one shoe

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
in the chair

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
and then reaches down

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
to the other foot

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
but he can't reach it

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
because he's a Pathan

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
a dirty

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
dirty

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
famously unintelligent

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
cost the Pathan

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Pathan sounds like

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
it sounds like

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
like a Star Wars

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
creature

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
that you would like

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
ride around

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
yeah I was too cold

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
so I killed a Pathan

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
and crawled inside him

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
what were those

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
what are those things called?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Tantans

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Tantans

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
we can't get away from this

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
hashtag

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
hashtag cancel Harmontown

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I'd rather sleep

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
on a giant

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
wanton

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
than a filthy Pathan

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I thought they smelled

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
bad on the outside

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
your groans are too late

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
you should have grown

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
to the beginning of the show

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
should have grown

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
to Empire Strikes Back

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I don't know

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
smelled bad on the outside

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I mean that was the perfect joke

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
for that situation

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
but I do

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
again I do

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
racist

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
we'll end this segment

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
which I'll call

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
let's talk about race again

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
on a positive note

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I really do think it's like

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
I don't want to be just

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
knee-jerk and say

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
like oh I don't tell me

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
what to do

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
don't tell people what to say

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
blah blah

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
slippery slope

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
you'll find out for yourself

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
I'm 41

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
you can have this planet

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
fuck off

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
but

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
you'll find out

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
on your own

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
kids

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
but also

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I think

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
if you want to clean up

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
the planet

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
and even if you just

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
want to clean up comedy

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
that's fucking good

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
but that's called being

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
a comedy snob

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
first thing you better do

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
is go watch

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Four Seasons of Mr. Show

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
and then you should

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
like

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
I don't know

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
read some books

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
that make you laugh

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
or like

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
watch all the Woody Allen

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
movies I don't know

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
like

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
become a student

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
of fucking comedy

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
become

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
a millennial

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Sid Caesar

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
and

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
start telling people

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
which jokes are funny

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
and which ones aren't

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
and let the

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
let the whole

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
you know the crutch

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
that is racial comedy

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
the hot button

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
you know because

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
if I had one leg

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
and I came out on stage

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
and I said

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I gotta know

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
what you guys are thinking

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
something about my one leg

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
and they're like

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
I would learn

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
as a one-legged comic

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
to get

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
to I would have the choice

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
of like

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
there would be a temptation

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
where you belong to

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
the

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
minority in question

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
or not

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
like racial comedy

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
has a kind of like

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
you know it gets a reaction

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
out of people

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
because it's on our minds

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
and stuff like that

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
and there's intelligent

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
racial comedy

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
and there's lowbrow

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
racial comedy

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
and there's downright racist

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
racial comedy

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
and there's

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
everything in between

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
but if

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
if you want to

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
police comedy

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
like great

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
like here's your

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
here's your lightsaber

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
here's your robe

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
like here's your

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
blast shield

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
like what

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
you just took your first

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
you're not going to get

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
a lot of jokes for a while

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
like you gotta

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
because if you're starting

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
your comedy

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
analyzation career

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
being so dumb

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
that you think

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
that shows should be

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
cancelled

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
and it can be

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
on Twitter

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
then I bet

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
you're going to find out

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
that you don't

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
want your jokes to be

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
too much smarter

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
but how does like

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
where does that

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
if somebody

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
writes the

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
cancelled this

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
who started that thing

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
well the one

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
for

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
yeah it was

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
you started it

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I got on the front row

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
raised your hand

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
I think for the

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Colbert it was

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
lady

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Sui Park

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Sui Park

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
she's a Korean American woman

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
and she started it

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
satirically

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
no she didn't

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
I read an article

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
that she wrote today

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
right

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
yeah

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
yeah she

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
is not being

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Sui Park

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
she's not being

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
can you not tell them apart

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
for the record Adam Goldberg

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
also racist

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
but accusing

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
accusing others of racism

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
let's say this is

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
yeah we all fall apart

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
which is a good thing

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
let's fall apart

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
let's deconstruct

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
interested in each other

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
and what makes us laugh

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
and what's appropriate

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
the way the internet works

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
and everybody wants

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
as many retweets

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
and likes

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
and you know

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
like they want as much

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
feedback as possible

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
like it's possible

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
people just do things

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
that are clearly going to

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
create energy

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
yeah

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
exactly

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
yeah

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
they're not really taking

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
any bold stance

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
they're just

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
well no that's the thing

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
that's the outrageous thing

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
no one's doing anything

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
they're not just

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
creating anything

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
they're just attacking

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
stuff that other people are

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
doing

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
you're not really doing

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
anything constructive

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
what

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
the thing I read

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
didn't make it seem like

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
she did it as a

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
satirical thing

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
she seemed very serious

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
about it

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I'm calling her yesterday

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
because she's starting

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
a little bit

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
like racist in a different way

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
it's like a whole different

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
like Native American thing

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
what

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
but yeah she said

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
yeah

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
because the original

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
just about Native American

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
yeah it was

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
it wasn't a Native American

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
yeah she's like

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
I helped like

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Indigenous people like this

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
and like

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
instead of saying like

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
yeah I did

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
take attention away from that

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
sorry

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
oh yeah

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
yeah

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
sure

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
all right

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
yeah she was saying

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
fine

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
she's saying like

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
hundreds of

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
like per hour

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
she's getting hundreds of

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
like rape and death threats

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
okay that is wrong

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
she shouldn't be getting

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
rape and death threats

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
but she did sort of

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
to start this thing

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
no I'm not saying

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
she asked for it

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I'm not

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
oh god

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
it's the end of the segment

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
thank you

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
this show brought to you by

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Chinese caveman

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
yeah

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I can't be racist

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
but

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
misogyny

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
that goes well with this color

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I wish there was

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
I wish there was some kind of

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
like machine

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
that could actually

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
measure genuine

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
offensiveness

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
you know

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
like actual

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
offense that a person

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
is actually taking

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
like because

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
like we have

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
it's become an exercise

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Dino

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Dino's tamatopolis

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
said that

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
society obviously peaked

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
with the invention of dessert

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
and that we were weird

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
because

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
because we were now

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
there was a part of your meal

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
that you were just like

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
I'm not hungry anymore

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
but

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
the thing that is

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
worst for me

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
and I think the dessert

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
of

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
culture

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
has become

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I mean our culture

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
and parts of the world

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
where there again

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
there are parts of our country

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
fuck it

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
where there is actual racism

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
going on

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
but like we

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
sitting in our chairs

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
at our laptops

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
tweeting and hashtagging

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
this is intellectual dessert

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
talking about

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
what's offensive

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
to someone else

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
and what is that

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I wish there was a way

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
to actually get out a yard stick

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
and really measure

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
like genuine

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
off the fence

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
yeah like you

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
like listen

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
you're only a two on

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
and I wish there was a different

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
word for

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
for peas and queues

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
like violations

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
that were technical violations

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
party fowls

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
if you will

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
is there some kind of word

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
for something that

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
absolutely isn't

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
even coming close

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
to hurting anybody

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
in any way

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
and yet

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
but you know

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
could be a valid topic

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
of conversation

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
if we want to be

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
such high minded

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
comedy snobs

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
and talk about

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
what's proper comedy

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
and not

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
because

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
that's the other thing

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
is like

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
well I mean

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
a woman who's

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
being tweeted

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
hundreds of thousands

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
of rape and death threats

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
that sounds

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
possibly distorted

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
like

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
like a hundred

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
I can't even picture

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
a hundred thousand

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
rape and death threats

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
like scrolling through them

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
but I'm

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
I'm certain

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
that

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
there's a lot of idiots

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
in the world

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
that

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
react

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
that are

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
having the same

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
unease

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
that I'm feeling

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
but are really terrible

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
people

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
like then

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
want to go like

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
I want to hit you in the face

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
with a rock

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
because

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
you're a bad person

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
and I'm a bad person

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
all this terrible shit

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
like

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
it is offensive

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
for somebody

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
to like

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
tweet at you

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
that they're going to

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
murder you

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
or

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
sexually assault you

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
to humble you

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
and put you back in your place

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
people think I created

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Teen Wolf

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
and I'm getting

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
rape and death threats

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
people like that show

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
by the way

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
a lot of people

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
really like

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Teen Wolf

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
congrats buddy

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
I'm sure it's a great show

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
if I go by

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
the vitriolic

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
praise

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
and

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
the superlative praise

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
and the vitriolic hate

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
that I get

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
as a wrong person

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
and now I've changed my bio

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
on Twitter

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
I did not create

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Teen Wolf

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
now that people click on that

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
I just

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I don't know how that came to be

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
but it's really

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
I just think that

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
I just think it should be

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
cancelled

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
I think the 1030 Monday

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
night slot should be

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
cleared of

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
racist television

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
and let

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
well Dan

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
let Rick and Morty

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
stand for

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
can I come clean a little bit

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
yeah

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
I actually did

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
create Teen Wolf

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
you finally figured out a way

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
to get my attention

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
and I

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
you have

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
my guarantee as a creator

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
of a television show

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
that you love and adore

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
that there will be no

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Patons on it

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
it's no Chinese cavemen

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
I'm a racist

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I want to be a Paton

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
it's a

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
it sounds so sci-fi

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I like

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
give me one more

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Paton joke

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
the Paton people will not be

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
denied their destiny

33:35.000 --> 33:39.000
that it takes 10 of them

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
to change a light bulb

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
it'll be like

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
you know like

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
a Polish joke

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
like how does a

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
how does a Paton

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
no no no

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
I'm doing the joke

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Camille just pulled out

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
a notebook

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
a standard

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
comedian's leather bound

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
joke book

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
just off the top of my head

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
no I mean

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
no I mean

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
let me look

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
yeah I mean

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
I've been doing this shit for years

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
it's bombing

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
nobody knows what Patons are here

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
it's under P

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
it's under P

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
yeah this is the Paton notebook

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
it's all

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
no it will be like

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
you know that joke

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
like how does a

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
how does a Paton

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
turn pages

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
it will be like

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
you know the

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't have the manual dictionary for it

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
that's exactly

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
he's licking one finger

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
as if in preparation

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
to turn a page

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
while his other hand

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
deftly turns the pages

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
sans licked finger

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
see that's

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
that's like

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
that's interesting

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
because that also

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I forget which Marx Brothers film

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
I think it's Harpo

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
or sugar

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Harpo Marx is dealing bridge

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Paton

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
and he licks

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
he has the deck in his left hand

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
and he licks his right thumb

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
but just deals with his left hand

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
there's a way to be high status

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
in that joke

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
and a way to be low status

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
in that joke

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
yeah so this is

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
it's just the standard

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
but then also

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
for any of you old enough to have been around

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
when Dan Quayle was vice president

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
he inherited all Polish jokes

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
well he wrote a lot of new ones

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
is he he's Polish?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
no no no

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
he just

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
he was just finally

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
we're like well

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
give the Polish people a break

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
we found an actual

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
we found an avatar

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
found a person who actually walks around

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
with a car door

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
so that if it gets hot

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
he can roll the window down

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
and he's our vice president

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
is it true that Dan Quayle

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
once tried to

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
spray graffiti on a chain link fence?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
is that true?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
yes

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
it was a chain link fence

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
he erected

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
with his own hammer

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
and nails

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
I saw him throwing

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
several of the nails away

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
he kept looking at them

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
and I said

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
why are you throwing

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
some of the nails away

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
and he said

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
the point is

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
facing the wrong side

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
the head's on the wrong side

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
please cross-reference

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
the earlier harm attempt

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
where Dan can't tell a joke

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
I don't know how to tell a joke

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
is that right?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
have you heard the number

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Dan tries to tell the duck joke?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
I can't tell jokes either

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
I can't do street jokes

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
what's the duck joke?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
oh I'll tell you

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
uh

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
there's a guy that walks

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Dan Harmon can't tell jokes

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I have the same problem

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
alright there's a guy that walks

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Dan before you start

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
before you start

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
I'm not trying to ice you

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
like a field goal kicker right now

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Camille

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
for those of you that are coming in

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
late to this party

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Dan I want you to

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
you've told this joke a bunch of times

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
I want you to

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
non-ironically

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
tell it as straight and as simple

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
I'm going to

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
do a joke

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
just tell us the joke

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
just take it right across the goal

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Dan Harmon

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
now presents the duck joke

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
okay so this guy goes to a whorehouse

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
and he goes to the

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
the matron of the

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
and he wants a whore

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
for money

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
and he says

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
I only have a dollar

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
but is that enough for a whore

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
and

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
you're distracting me with your

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
we'll be right back

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
for more Dan Harmon

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
tells the duck joke

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
the person says

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
the owner of the whorehouse says

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
the matron

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
the matron says

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
for a dollar

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
you get a duck

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
you get this duck

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
okay that's all you get

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
and he goes

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
okay and he takes it upstairs

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
and he comes back down later

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
and with the duck

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
and he gives the duck back

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
and he says

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I had a wonderful time

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
it was a great duck

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
there was a great duck sex session

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
and he leaves

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
and he may mutter something about

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
man I gotta come back

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
because then he does the next day

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
it doesn't matter

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
that he said

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
there's so much unnecessary detail

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I know but he

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
he does

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
and now

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
the shocking conclusion

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
of Dan Harmon

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
tells the duck joke

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
so he comes back

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
he comes back the next day

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
and he's got his dollar

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
he's all excited

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
he's like

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
yeah

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
I didn't even bother to bring more

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
because

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
and then

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
when I say conclusion

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
I mean

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
the conclusion

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
and he goes

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
I'll have

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
the duck please

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
and she gives him the duck

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
and he didn't

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
I fucked one thing up

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
he didn't give her a dollar yet

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
he just came

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
he just did that

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
he just came bounding in

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
and said

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
I'll have the duck please

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
and

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
the matron gives him the duck

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
he goes upstairs

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
he comes back down

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
and she says

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
that'll be seven dollars

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
and he goes

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
seven dollars

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
it only cost a dollar yesterday

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
and the prostitute matron says

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
yesterday's duck

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
fuck god damn it

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
it feels like

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
wait wait wait

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
shit shit shit shit

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
wait

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
fuck fuck fuck

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
hold on hold on hold on hold on

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
this is excruciating

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
it feels like you're coming up

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
with the joke

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
as you're telling it

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
and also learning the English language

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
he comes down

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
he gives back the duck

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
and she says

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
that'll be seven dollars

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
and he says

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
he says

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
this duck

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
he says

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
this this

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Skyrise TV comedy for a living

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
he says

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
okay okay I figured out how to word it

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
he says

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
he hands the duck back

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
and he says

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
here's the duck back

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
he didn't give the duck back

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
because this is the next day

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
come out come out

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
he doesn't have the duck yet

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
what do you mean

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
he took it upstairs

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
he had sex with it

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
the second day

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
he did seven dollars

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
he paid the seven

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
no he didn't pay the seven

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
he's coming down with it

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
it's pay after

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
okay

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
it's one of those

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
pay afterward

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
whorehouses

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
go ahead

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
so he gives the duck back

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
the whole prostitution industry

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
is based on trust

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
so

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
there's only one door

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
to the

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
whorehouse

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
and it's a small town

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
and it's not worth it

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
like to try to

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
you'll be blacklisted from

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
no

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
like

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
the matrons talk to each other

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
yeah

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
if the whores don't have trust

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
what do they have

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
yeah

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
this is a time

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
this is a region of the country

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
and a time in our history

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
when prostitution

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
isn't like

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
it's not

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
it's not respectful to women

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
but it's also not like

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
as

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
like

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
frowned upon

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
as an industry

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
and therefore there is

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
oversight

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
okay so

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
so he brings the duck down

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
on the second day

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
this is a

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
he went upstairs with it

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
he brings it down

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
he gives it to the woman

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
this is only the second day

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
no no no

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
yeah yeah

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
there's only two days

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
I'm with you

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
he gives it back

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
and she says

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
that'll be seven dollars

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
and he says

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
that's seven times

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
as much as yesterday's duck

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
and she says

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
that duck

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
didn't have aids

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
that was Dan Harmon

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
let's have the duck down

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
a worth the wait production

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
you should have said

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
this duck

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
doesn't have aids

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
doesn't have aids

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
no but

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
why is it more expensive then

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
because it doesn't have aids

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
alright right right

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
you don't want to fuck

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
the aids duck

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
alright

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
you don't want to fuck

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
the aids duck

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
wait no so he says

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
this duck

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
I had to say that duck

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
okay

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
the joke goes like this

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
a guy goes to her house

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
okay so the guy

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
goes that duck didn't have aids

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
it was so cheap

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
now

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
and she goes

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
this duck doesn't have aids

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
he's like oh

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
okay I get it

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
a guy goes to her house

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
he says all I have is a dollar

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
what can I get

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
and she hands him a duck

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
and he goes a duck

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
and she goes

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
that's all you get for a dollar

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
he goes upstairs

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
he comes back down

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
and he goes

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
not bad

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
he goes back the next day

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
and he says

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
I'll take the duck again

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
so he goes up

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
fucks the duck

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
and she goes

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
that'll be five dollars

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
and he goes five dollars

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
it was a dollar yesterday

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
but this duck doesn't have aids

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
and he does want it

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
for four for five

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
and she goes

42:35.000 --> 42:35.000
I need the duck

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
well congratulations

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
you're good at something silly

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
All right

42:41.000 --> 42:42.500
creating

42:42.500 --> 42:43.500
creating mercy

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
so just so you know

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
you can't tell a joke

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Jay, J Pedisty and Jan described

42:48.000 --> 42:49.080
half of us

42:49.080 --> 42:50.000
three of the funniest people I know

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
cannot tell joke jokes

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
does it help

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
that

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
in my head

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
the whole time

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
all the characters were Asian

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
in this joke

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
what does that say about me

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Racist.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
No, they weren't like stereotypical Asian.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
But you're saying that you're not going to tell straight jokes as well?

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
No, I can't do it. I think I'm doing a good job, but at the end nobody laughs.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And I just, then I have to like, I think.

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
I'd say like, the most nervous I think I ever get in the year is telling a joke.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
And even doing that just now, which is a joke I know.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
That was great, very, it's nerve-wracking.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
It raises, like my heart rate goes up, my left hand starts to tingle.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
Because if you say one wrong thing, you can fuck, that's the thing that fucks me up.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Like I end up like off-roading because I'm like, I'm trying not to drive wrong.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
I get really nervous.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
But you can bog down a miscellaneous and extraneous detail.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
My favorite part I have to say is when you say, when the guy comes in for the first time

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
and he says, I want to buy a whore for money.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
I think the for-money detail was probably...

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
Well, I wasn't, yeah. Also, matron, I liked, matron.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Matron was good. That was a great detail.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Did you mean madam?

43:59.000 --> 44:02.000
Yeah, I guess, I meant madam.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
But you're, I think that you're, like, there's, like, karaoke.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I did karaoke because karaoke makes me nervous.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
I could go on stage, like, nude at the Hollywood Bowl.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
But I don't think I'd be that nervous.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Karaoke gets me, like, I don't, I can't stand...

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But you're really great at karaoke.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Well, I can sing, but I don't want those people to get up there and like, perform.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
With a free hand, like flying around.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I hold the mic with both hands.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Well, I can sing, but, like, I don't, like, I don't, I don't feel comfortable

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
up on stage doing karaoke for some reason.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Okay, yeah, I don't do karaoke.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
I'm not good at it. I can't do it.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
But, like, stand up, I do, and I tell jokes.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
But only if it's jokes I've written.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I can't do other people's songs or anything.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Tell somebody else's joke.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
I'm kidding.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Okay, there's a guy who goes to the whorehouse

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
and there's only one door in the whorehouse.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
The matron who's there.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
And they say matron because English is not their first language.

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
So they're learning English as they're performing this transaction.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
I also love when he came back the next day

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
and he did the whole thing.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
$7, that's too much.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Oh, wait, no, okay. Forget that.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
He just takes the duck.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
He just takes the duck.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
And then he comes down.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
And then it's $7.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
I mean, that joke telling had so many gifts to give.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Although, even with our interruptions and interjections,

45:29.000 --> 45:34.000
you told that joke half as long as you did the last time you told me.

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
Yeah, there was a guy on the Harmontown tour.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
He had a t-shirt that he had made.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
It's filled with text and it's me trying to tell the duck joke.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
That's pretty good.

45:47.000 --> 45:59.000
All right, let's do our medical corner.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Medical corner.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Okay.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
All right.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
You know, we haven't seen it in a long, long time

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
and haven't checked in on him.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
And he has a dramatic update.

46:08.000 --> 46:26.000
Our good friend, Seek Donnelly.

46:26.000 --> 46:33.000
Seek, Seek for those who don't know is a multiple aneurysm survivor

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
who we established last time.

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
Because of his strange condition, his proclivity for something

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
that is catastrophic to anyone when it occurs randomly,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
he has a proclivity for aneurysms.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
And these doctors were cutting you a deal where they said,

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
well, because that's so weird, we'll give you free treatment.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
But it's for our purposes.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
It's for our studying and stuff like that.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
And you've got your own neurologist as well.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
But you were just telling me in the green room,

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
do you want to take it from there?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Well, sure, yeah.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
So one of the things I lost that I think I said in previous shows

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
was my visual memory.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
And so what that does is it cuts down on my short-term memory a lot

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
and it also makes it really hard.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
I'm an artist, so it makes me really hard to create artwork.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
So like the pieces I did for Harmontown,

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
where you guys are all Mega Man characters,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
I actually had nosebleeds trying to create that art.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Those are wonderful.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Oh, thank you.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
I had fun doing an indoor kids one with you and Emily.

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
And so it takes a lot out of me to create things.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
But I don't like being told I can't do stuff.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
So these doctors that I've been seeing for a couple of years now,

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
I had another coiling procedure done in November.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
And since then, they've kind of laid off some of the tests

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
they normally do on me.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
And in that time period where it was a longer period than I usually

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
have between tests, I started, at least I thought,

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
having some visual sense coming back.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
So I had a dream one night.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
And I haven't had a dream in a long time.

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
Haven't had a dream in a long time.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
That's not how you sound.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Jeff, stop doing that.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
I'm just saying he's stealing from Morris here.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
Who?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Visual memory.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
What is coiling?

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
Coiling is a procedure where they put,

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
it depends on where they feel the best is,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
but sometimes they go up in your inner thigh

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
and they run a calf that are up your entire body.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
What?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
That's the fastest way to get there?

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
No, it's not the fact, but it's one of the options, yeah.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
So either we could start up here or we could do the thigh.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We could do the thigh.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
No, that was my option.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
So I did that.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
So they're writing up an artery or a vein or something like that?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Yeah, and then they go straight up.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Good heavens.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
And then they put these coils into a kind of clip

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
and direct the aneurysms.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
And to drain them sometimes too.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
So they'll put them in and hold them in place.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
So since I have multiple ones that keep growing,

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
they have to do this procedure more often than they do.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
So if a new one comes up they go in and take care of it?

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
Yeah, well the last two times I didn't get one at a time.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
I got like two or three.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
So the last time I went in I got 14 coils put in.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
And then they stay there?

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
Yeah, I mean for a while.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Over time some of them dissolve.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Yeah, so they ran these tests.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
So I had this dream and then I was trying to explain the dream.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
And they were like, well because I have trouble saying things visually,

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
I was having trouble explaining the dream, but I knew I had one.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
So then they're like, oh, it's probably nothing, you know, whatever.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
So I said, okay, so then in like a week or two later,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
I could have sworn I had another dream.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
And then I said, okay, now I'm starting to connect a really major dot here.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
After my aneurysm there was a time when I was like writing and stuff again

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
that I would draw like doodle a little bit.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
And then since then I've been under this program

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
and that whole time it's been really hard for me to draw.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
And I felt neutered by the medication and the stuff they've been doing to me.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
I felt like it was stopping me from creating.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
So I basically told them, hey look, before we run any more tests,

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
I'd like some time off to see if I have more dreams,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
if I get more visual sense.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
And then so what ended up happening in that time off was I sculpted something.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
I started writing a song. I started painting.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
And I'm still having trouble with the visual sense.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
It's still hard for me to do these things.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
But the neat thing is that, or not the song so much,

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
but the neat thing is that I'm conquering it.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
Like I'm beating, I think, whatever this wall was that I was hitting.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
So recently I told those doctors like, hey, I appreciate all the help,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
but I want out of this program.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
And they're like, well, we advise against that because, you know,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
because they paid for a lot of my medical treatment.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
They're like, you know, you make no money at all.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
And even less than a normal artist because none of my stuff sells

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
and it's all for charity.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah, that's a terrible business plan for me.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
I'm not making money. I'm donating.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Well, it's funny that my last two jobs have been marketing jobs

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
and I'm like, I don't know how to pay my own bills.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Why do you want me to pay your bills?

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
So I just like creating.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
And I feel like that's my purpose.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
So I've made the decision, well, even if this kills me,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
not having you doctors around, I want to create this project.

51:49.000 --> 51:52.000
So I started this project that was inspired by Harmontown

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
because this is the only, I listen to this podcast religiously.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I've seen, I've heard every episode like 10 or 20 times.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
And I feel like this is my family.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
This is my home.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
These people who understand me, who don't judge me in a negative way.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
And so, and who also helped me create art, like create those prints for you guys.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
And so I wanted to, you know, do a big love letter to that

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
and the type of people we have come up here, like, like Jane, you know,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
who, our earth shine friend, who, you know, who's,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
he has some earth shine kit, follow him on Twitter.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
He'll tell you about it.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
And then we have like Levi and you have these people who are really great people

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
and they are in search for an identity.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
And I feel like that's what I'm in search for because my memories of childhood are gone.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
You know, like all my, I remember like up to about six, seven years ago.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
And then, yeah.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
You don't have any memories of when you were a kid?

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
I have some knowledge of them, but most of them are gone.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
When you say there's no visual memory, you can't picture your elementary school.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
You can't.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
No, no.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Or my mom.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Or child, really?

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
So that's why me and my mom have such a weird relationship now

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
is because she always says, oh, don't you remember when you do this, don't you remember that?

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
And I, it breaks my heart every time to tell her that I don't

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
because then I see the look on her face.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Do you feel that now that it's kind of trickling back in like your visual sense

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
that maybe memories might come?

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
I'm hoping.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
And that's why I want to explore it.

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
And like I said, it's, if anything's worth dying for, it's to find out who you are.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
You know, so I said, well, okay, so I don't want to die.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
I have my one neurologist, but everyone else, I'm like, you can all go away.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Like, let me explore this.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Let me see how deep this pool is.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
That's amazing.

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
And were they barking at it because they saw you as an investment for their own research?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
They put a lot of effort and money into you?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
There's that, but then there's also like, they do care for my well-being.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
They're doctors.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
You know, they're trying to make me a better me, obviously, but I don't want to help now.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.000
I want to find out who Seek is and I want to find out what kind of artist he is.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
So, you know, I heard you talk to Katie at South by Southwest and she said,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
oh, I'm trying to figure out what kind of artist I am.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
I want to paint.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
I want to draw.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
I want to, you know, create music.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
And you're like, do them all.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
So I was like, you know what?

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
I'm going to do them all too.

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
And so I'm releasing a book called Alain Vitale, which is French for vital force.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
And it's a book about the first robot that gets a soul.

54:07.000 --> 54:12.000
And in order to prove that he has a soul, he creates a bunch of different art styles.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
And so I'm creating the art styles like as the robot, obviously.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
And so every page is different art style.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
So I do purism, surrealism.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
I do sculpting.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
You know, I teach.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I choreograph a dance.

54:24.000 --> 54:31.000
Like I'm literally doing every art style I can think of and putting it all in one book as a big love letter to art,

54:31.000 --> 54:38.000
but also a big love letter to the people that inspired it, which is pretty much everyone that's ever heard or listened to or come to this show.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
And you guys, obviously.

54:40.000 --> 54:46.000
That's amazing.

54:46.000 --> 55:07.000
But there's this sobering, chilling edge to the whole thing where you're gambling like, you know, this thing that we all sometimes take for granted, but also are imprisoned by, which is like your well-being.

55:07.000 --> 55:21.000
You're already, you already have to deal with that being at risk all the time. And you've now made this decision that you're these guys that put coils up there and build levees and things and stuff.

55:21.000 --> 55:32.000
You know, you're associating their tests and treatments and things with a mitigation of your true self.

55:32.000 --> 55:41.000
And so you're just going to, like the guy in Into the Wild, kind of, you're going to go off and do the Alaska of not getting these coils anymore.

55:41.000 --> 55:51.000
And there could be poison berries or there could be amazing buses that you get to live in.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
I haven't seen that movie. Is that what happens?

55:53.000 --> 56:05.000
Yeah, yeah. But it's the story of a guy who's just kind of like, he does it wrong, but he gets to live his life. And then he does die in the end.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Into the wild?

56:06.000 --> 56:16.000
Yeah. But because you're crediting Harmontown with the inspiration for this decision, which I don't know if I would ever have the courage to make myself.

56:16.000 --> 56:23.000
I want to make sure that I've had an equal shot at inspiring you to make the other decision too.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
No.

56:24.000 --> 56:31.000
You know, have you, have you, have you, do you have a neurologist in your life and you've got these crazy sci-fi scientists in your life?

56:31.000 --> 56:40.000
Do you, do you have a, do you have a counselor of some kind in your life, somebody that you can talk to about this gigantic decision that's maybe a little more qualified than me?

56:40.000 --> 56:50.000
I mean, not currently. I had, right when, after I had my, the first aneurysm rupture, I met with a psychologist and we talked out, you know, stuff.

56:50.000 --> 57:00.000
And I know you guys were talking about that last week. So it was really cool to have someone to talk to, but I also suffered, like I said, some emotional damage from where the rupture happened.

57:00.000 --> 57:11.000
So I'm also like the most robotic person to talk to at times. Like I, I feel happy and stuff. And I get that. And then there are times where I feel sad, but in the middle there, it's like, that's where it gets weird.

57:11.000 --> 57:20.000
So, so that's why I wanted to write a book about a robot, because I'm like, I identify, you have people up here that identify when they're men, they identify as women and women who identify as men and vice versa.

57:20.000 --> 57:34.000
But it's, I identify as not human, if that makes any sense. And, but I love humanity. Like I, I want to be a part of humanity so much that I'm willing to cut that tether, because I think that's what's going to make me rejoin humanity.

57:34.000 --> 57:44.000
That's what's going to make me feel the most human before I, if I do die. And I don't know, I mean, I've been told twice now that, oh, you got this much time to live and I'm still here four years later.

57:44.000 --> 57:54.000
And I feel like I'm doing okay, like I'm walking, I'm talking pretty good. So, I mean, I'm not saying doctors don't know anything. I have utmost respect for doctors are the reason I'm here.

57:54.000 --> 58:03.000
But I, I think I have to just trust myself for once. And no, I have given it a lot of thought and I've talked about with a lot of friends, but ultimately it's my decision.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
And, and I'm going to stand by it. I think it's the right one.

58:06.000 --> 58:14.000
Absolutely. Of course. And we, I, when we stand by you, you're our friend. Thank you so much for.

58:14.000 --> 58:22.000
So, when you say you don't have like the memories, is there, is it like you do stuff and then sometimes you don't remember you've done it?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Sometimes lately it's been happening a lot more.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
So there's a chance you might not remember Dan's retelling of the duck joke.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Can I tell my favorite joke?

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Yes, of course.

58:32.000 --> 58:43.000
Yes. All right. It's real quick. I hate traveling. I think it's because my dad used to beat me with a globe.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
You see, Dan?

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Yeah.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
That's good.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
Yeah.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
Thank you, Steve.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Thank you.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Thanks so much.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
If I can plug it real quick.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, absolutely.

58:56.000 --> 59:04.000
I was talking about along the towel, the Kickstarter starts tomorrow and I'm looking to raise $5,000 to make a limited 500 print run of it.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Cool.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
So if anyone out there would like to donate, I would appreciate it.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Is it along like A-L-A-I-N?

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
E-L-A-N.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
Oh, E-Line.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
E-Line. Yeah.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Cool. All right. Thank you.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
All right.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
All right.

59:15.000 --> 59:26.000
Holy smoke.

59:26.000 --> 59:37.000
That guy asked to actually deal with one of the most offensive things in the world, which is our relationship with an unforgiving, unpredictable God.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
That's, you know, hashtag cancel humanity.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Don't cancel God.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Don't cancel God.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
You're racist.

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
That's why, yeah, your problem with a joke at Colbert.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Yeah.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
Like, I mean, the ice caps are melting you dicks.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Does anybody else in the room have, I don't know if it's sympathetic or empathetic pain where somebody describes an injury or an illness or whatever that you feel physically the thing.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Like, I have this thing where he talks about brain injury and my head starts hurting like crazy or someone says they had a friend that had a hernia like operation and my abdomen start hurting.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I don't know if anyone else has that was like, like he's up there and my head just starts, I don't get headaches that my head starts pounding during that.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Like, I don't know.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I don't know if I'm alone.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Applause? How many people have that?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Oh, good.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Okay.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Yeah.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
If someone like, like, like has a knee injury, it's like, Oh, God, damn it.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Like, it was knee starts dangling.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Oh, yeah.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I can't watch shows where people get hurt, like, like Tosh or whatever.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And so there's people getting wrecked.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Like, I can't.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I like the idea of someone who's like that, but the terrible knowledge of anatomy.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So like, the wrong parts of there.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
My appendix hurts.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Oh, my, my foot.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Is that a Patan joke?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
You know it, buddy.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
You're catching on.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Patan?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Is Duncan back there? Did he ever, did he ever show up?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Almost.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Okay.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Okay.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Well, why don't we bring Spencer up?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Yeah.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Bounding.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I'm just sending off.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Hold on.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Okay.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Spencer, you said a very strange thing in the green room.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Suck my dick.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I mean, that's not very strange out of place.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Sure.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You said you often think about how much you would enjoy fighting a pack of coyote.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Oh, yeah.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Yeah.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Okay.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
No.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I have follow-up questions.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So also you live in L.A.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You can make this dream come true.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Oh, I know.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
All you have to do is have a cat or a poodle.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yeah.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I used to live in Moorpark, which was kind of like a farming town.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
What?

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Did somebody just root for Moorpark?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
No.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Nobody's ever done that.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Yeah.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
No.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Seriously.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Check it.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Look it up on Urban Dictionary.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It has an entry.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.420
But there's a lot of farmland and stuff and you can go out and sometimes we go out hiking

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.500
just in the fields and stuff at night and you'd be able to hear coyotes or even just

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.500
not hiking.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.000
Like in my bed, I'd be able to hear coyotes like all the time and you'd hear a lot of

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
them.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
But like when we'd go on night hike, sometimes they'd sound really close and you'd be like,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
look at it.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It sounds like six or seven.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I'd love to hike.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'll probably be fine.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Now, when you picture yourself fighting a pack of coyotes, is it bare-handed?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Do you have a weapon of some sort?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Bare-handed.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I mean, the only thing I could ever imagine is like having a bag with me, like a backpack

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
that I'm hiking with because it's hiking.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So I'd like, you know, maybe swing, have to bag around.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But yeah, mostly bare-hand.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Do you think you could take a pack of coyotes?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I mean, how big we talk in Kumae?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
How big of a pack?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Six or seven.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I kind of feel like they're very powerfully scavengers.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I mean, they're...

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Oh, I'm talking about enraged, like, pissed off, like coyotes.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I don't know what's supposed to happen here.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Traveling down the roads of Moor Park, you stop when you hear a rustling.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
The red gleaming eyes from the bushes are all the information you need to realize what's

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000
on you, a pack of slightly chiming coyote.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So you have initiative.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
You can take six or seven coyotes.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I can say this just by looking at you.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
You're never flat-flittered against coyote.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah, no, that's definitely a bonus I earned in my travels.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I think he could do it, but not because if the six coyote actually is the plural coyote.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Coyotes.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I think it's coyotes.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Coyotes.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Coyotes.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Coyotes.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Coyotes.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Coyotai.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Coyotes.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Coyotes.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
What are you...

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
You're somebody's Sam?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Coyotes.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I think that if all six of them had, like, a rage virus that made them, whatever, that

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
made them, like, physically endeavor as a unit of six coyote, I think my dog could take

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
me out.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
What?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I could take your dog.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
No way, man.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
My dog...

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I mean, these...

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The thing about dogs is, like, all it takes is one blow to the throat.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I mean, sure.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So you've got to throw out your left arm, not your good arm, your left arm as a sacrifice,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
but once it's clamped on, it's just a quick knee in the throat and you're done.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Wait, but Rottweilers and those guys, like, kill people, kill people all the time?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.160
I hear a lot about people getting attacked and you literally never hear them going for

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160
the throat, ever.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.000
Well, because the stories aren't going to be like, the guy went for the throat and it

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
didn't work, because you can't even tell the pail, Spencer.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.560
You hear about the flailing they do and that they hit it on the top of the head or they

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.640
try and unwedge the jaw.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.640
That's not what you do.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.640
You just go for the throat.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.360
If they can't breathe, they're not going to be biting you.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
Where did you read...

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.640
Where did you read this?

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640
What is this information?

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.640
This is holistic knowledge.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.640
I've cleaned in my everyday life.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.640
What journal do you subscribe to?

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:38.960
Yeah, it's a dog throat attack monthly.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.840
Harvard Medical Coyote Edition.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840
I'm just saying.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.640
I mean, have you guys seen Coyotes?

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640
They're main gene.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.360
They're like maybe twice the size of a house cat.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360
They're not huge.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.440
They're main gene-looking skinny things.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.440
I don't think they really...

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.120
I've never seen them in really, what do I call, packs.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.360
I've seen them travel around that would look like small nuclear families.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.640
You see like mom and pop and maybe a kid.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.480
Yeah, that's probably more likely.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.320
And also, they're terrified of us.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320
Yeah.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.080
But I mean, again, we're talking about that's out of the equation here.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.120
So you're saying these are special coyotes?

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.120
I mean, they're just not going to be super timid.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120
That's what I'm saying.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.320
He just wants to fight them.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.560
So if they're timid, they're going to run away.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Yeah, that's not a fight.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.120
But you wouldn't want to fight a wolf because a wolf will kick you.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.120
No, no, sure.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:28.120
I mean, I might be able to take one wolf, maybe.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.120
Now, I say there's only one way to find out.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.120
I don't think...

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.120
Let's bring out our wolf.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.120
Spencer, we have great news.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.600
Spencer, do you think you could take a pit bull or a rottweiler?

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.120
I don't because, I mean, honestly, if you're talking like a coyote versus a pit bull, like...

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.440
Well, I mean, that's a crazy huge difference.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.440
That's what I'm saying.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.440
I mean, there's a lot of dogs that I'd feel more confident, you know, fighting against.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.440
Rottweilers and pit bulls probably aren't up there.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.440
I mean...

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.440
What about 80 Sheetsu?

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.440
Yeah, see, this is the whole thing.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.440
You can, when they're small enough, and I think you could pull this off with a coyote,

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440
all you have to do is spin around kicking.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440
That's not easy to do.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440
It's very easy to do.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440
This is a street fighter.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.440
It's not down-back kick.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.440
It is quite literally down-back kick.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.440
You just spin down and backwards while kicking.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440
How?

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.440
How?

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.440
I mean, show us, please.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.440
If somebody doesn't Instagram this right now, I'm going to kill all of us.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.440
It is such a bummer that this is an audio podcast.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.440
Goddamn it.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.440
Because that is one of the best things I've ever seen.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.440
Spencer did something between Jean-Claude Van Damme and Baryshnikov.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440
Pippi Longstocking, yeah.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.440
I don't see any of those kicks doing major damage.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.440
No, but you keep knocking them back.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.440
You just got to keep going.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.440
They would get you on the ground.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.440
I mean, not shitzus.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440
Oh, no, not shitzus.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:05.440
Honestly, you might have been born in the wrong era because there's a great book about the early New York,

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.440
the Five Points, and they made that terrible movie, Gangs of New York, about it.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.440
But Luke Santé wrote a book called Low Life.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440
And someone likes that movie?

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.440
You're the person that wooed it at Moore Park?

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:22.440
That movie stinks because it's a bad history.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440
Maybe it's a fine movie, but it's not good history.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.440
But there's a bunch of things, like entertainment back in the good old bad days of America.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.440
There were things like rat baiting and bear baiting.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.440
There was a thing called rat stomping where they would put a guy in a ring,

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:42.440
surrounded by a wooden pen, and they would put 100 or 200 rats in there.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.440
And you had to stomp them because they would come attack you.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.440
No, no, no, but is it like a sport?

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.440
You would bet rat or man.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.440
So these weren't prisoners.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.440
No, no, this is a bar.

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.440
This is a bar down, which is now the Bowery, and the Lower East Side of New York.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:08.440
And there'd be bear baiting, and there'd be dogs versus bears,

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:12.440
and you would bet money on dogs for dogs or bear.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440
I wouldn't want to win.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.440
I think that, Spencer, you might have taken to that rat stomping.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.440
Well, you were talking about rat stomping.

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440
You know those tiny monkeys that you see at the zoo?

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.440
The little tiny black ones.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.440
Like really, inches tall.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440
Yeah, those are adorable.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440
The first time I saw those, I was just like, man, don't you just want to squish one?

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.440
Oh, see now?

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440
Just stomp on it.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.440
I feel like Spencer's learning to fly.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.440
We're getting to the heart of the matter here.

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:50.440
So in your coyote fight fetish dreams, are you annihilating them?

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.440
Are you breaking their necks and ripping their hearts out?

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.440
No, no, I mean, well, you break a couple necks, sure.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.440
But not, I mean, just time-wise.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440
You've got to fight it back without breaking a couple necks.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440
I imagine if you want to make a coyote, I'm like,

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440
well, I mean, you've got to take it out of the fight, right?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440
Yeah.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.440
If fighting a bunch of coyote, I think the first thing you do is you break the biggest one's neck

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.440
and send a message to the rest of you.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.440
Well, yeah, again, this isn't assuming they're not just going to turn tail and run, obviously.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.440
Well, that's the thing, if you're just spinning around circles,

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.440
you kick about half the coyotes, they freak out and leave.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440
Okay, how about you, Spencer?

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:27.440
I will say this, that move you did is a lot less threatening than you think it is.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.440
It's not supposed to be threatening.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.440
It's specifically designed to take on hordes of small dogs.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:39.440
If I see a little dog and I see a guy doing that, I'm like, I got this.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.440
There's no way, also, you know, like, dogs, like any dog bigger than a shih tzu or any canine,

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.440
their objective is to get you down on the ground.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.440
And once that happens, you're in trouble.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440
Well, again, with coyotes, they're very light.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.440
So if you have three or four coyotes on, you just jump right up.

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.440
All right, but you can't jump up when these things got you.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.440
Yeah, buddy.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.440
My dog loves me, and sometimes he gets me at a disadvantage.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.440
What does that mean?

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.440
What?

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.440
That just sounds dangerous.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:19.440
Well, I'm just saying, he's a golden doodle, but he's like a five-foot child.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440
He could grab me.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.440
He would have the body mass of, like, six, five coyotes.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.440
They have mouths full of little 32-caliber bullets.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440
Coyotes do?

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.440
That's why you throw out the left arm.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.440
Yeah.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.440
They could kill you, man.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.440
Sometimes I lay in bed with this guy and I'm rubbing his belly in, and he's just like,

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.440
oh, and I look at his teeth, and I'm like, yeah, this fucker could kill me.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.440
That's what koo-toe is.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.440
Koo-toe goes bad.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.440
I had a scar on my ass, so my left butt cheek, like a shark tooth, like a triangle.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440
That's your butt hole.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:55.440
Is there poop coming out of it?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440
Is it right in the middle?

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440
Yeah.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.440
When you push the button and pull the chain, is that where the chocolate choo-choo train

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.440
comes out?

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.440
Because that's a butt hole.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440
Everyone has that scar.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.440
It's not a scar.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.440
Don't think of it that way.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.440
I feel like...

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.440
It's fucked up.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.440
Listen, it's not pretty, but that doesn't mean it's the scar.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440
It's not a wound.

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440
It's actually, if anything, it's keeping you alive.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:24.440
I feel like you guys are making a little too lightly of an actual injury that I have.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.440
My neighbors, when I was a kid, we had the O'Sullivan to live next door, and there was 19

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.440
of them because they were Irish Catholic.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440
Erases!

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:37.440
No, there were fucking 19 O'Sullivans.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.440
And anytime, Bill, Jeff, my brother and I, like anytime you guys want to come up and

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.440
take a swim in our pools, we didn't have a pool.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:48.440
Anytime you guys want to walk up and have a swim, just make sure that their dog, the

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440
two German shepherds, one was named Guinness.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440
I remember his name because I buried the scar on my chest.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.440
I feel like you have, like, you've put racist memories in your childhood.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.440
The Irish people's dog was named Guinness?

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440
This is an actual fact.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.440
Actually, my brother has a dog named...

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.440
We had a dog named Guinness because of that, because of that, too.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440
The other was Shalely.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
Shalely?

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:11.440
Yeah, one was just called Drinking.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.440
And...

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.440
And a parakeet named Famine.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:17.440
Yeah.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.440
Pote.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440
Too soon.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.440
I mean, not funny enough?

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.440
I hope you're groaning that was a bad joke.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.440
Not that I went too far.

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440
I can't stop.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.440
I think about him thinking that it's somebody thinking that I don't live this car.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.440
And it's still making me laugh.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.440
I know, like, I feel like he shut that down too fast.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:42.440
Yeah, I thought so.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440
You and I were having a good time.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440
Just placating him about his scar.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.440
Mom, I have bad news. I have a scar.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.440
And it bleeds, but it's not blood.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.440
Yes, my scar bleeds long brown blood.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.440
You don't know how to make these jokes funny.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.440
I'm trying to help your awesome premise, you guys.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440
We're doing it.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.440
You're literally shitting over our awesome jokes.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.440
Do your scar-y butthole.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.440
Sometimes men come over to my apartment and fuck me in my scar.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.440
You're not good at it.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.440
What?

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.440
You can't make this one.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440
Okay, go ahead.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440
It's my scar.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.440
That's maybe why you can't make it funny.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.440
I don't know.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.440
I'm just trying to help you with your bulletproof premise.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.440
Long brown blood.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.440
You've shown us that our premise maybe isn't so bulletproof.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.440
Yeah.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.440
Okay, go ahead. So you're there with the dogs.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.440
The guys said the dogs would be locked up.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440
We got up there. The dogs were not locked up.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.440
And there were two giant German shepherds.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.440
And Guinness, of all people, comes running straight at me.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.440
And I had like a little bathing suit on.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:54.440
And I'm like, I'm defenseless.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440
I'm barefoot.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.440
I'm sorry, long brown blood just got funny to me.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440
So gross.

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440
Now?

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440
Yeah, I don't know why.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:08.440
It's like a wrestler for a really, really low-caliber wrestling federation.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.440
There comes long brown blood.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:15.440
He's going up against scorpion scissors.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.440
Oh, long brown blood.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440
Long brown blood.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.440
Go ahead.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.440
So the dog's running at me and my brother.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.440
But the dog picks me the smaller of the two.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.440
I think that's good pack animal instincts.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.440
Take the baby out.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.440
I don't know, I was about six or something like that.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.440
And I turned around and think, Heavens,

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.440
because he chopped me right where the essentials might have been.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440
And he took a piece out of my ass.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440
It took a big chunk.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440
That's the other thing, they go for your nuts.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.440
That's what I was going to say.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.440
Okay.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440
They go for your crotch.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.440
Because that's dog height.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.440
And it doesn't matter how much throat punching you use.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.440
Well, no, you kick them right when they're in mid-jump.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440
They can't change direction.

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.440
Dude, there's more than one.

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.440
There's a lot of them.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.440
Yeah, well, they don't all jump at the same time.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.440
That'd be silly.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.440
Right, because they don't want to get hurrican away by your kicks.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Yeah.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.440
I trained under Trump.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.440
Your flurry of feet that you have unleashed

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440
was an unsuspecting pack.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440
You saw that flurry of feet.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440
I know you don't like doing requests,

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.440
but I'm the only one that's going to have a video of this.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.440
Can you get up and demonstrate the...

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.440
I really don't like doing requests.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:27.440
Come on, I'll do my Sean Connery impression.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.440
If you do your circle kick.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440
We have to have it documented.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.440
For science more than anything.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.440
I'm going to cry while I do it, though.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440
Fine, all right, do it.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440
Whoo!

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440
This is so long.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440
Oh.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:58.440
That's how you fight off a pack of dogs.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440
I sold out.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.440
By the way, this is the day that the podcast changed me.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.440
I sold out!

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.440
How pissed would you be if that was the ending to the gray?

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440
That's what he did at the end.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440
Oh, that should be it.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440
That'd be amazing.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.440
That would have been amazing.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:18.440
That's basically how Alice in Wonderland ended, right?

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.440
That's why they cut the ending out of the gray.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.440
He kept teasing that crazy movie that he's got.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.440
Spencer, it doesn't matter how many of them come at you.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.440
I've got a special move on you.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440
What's it called?

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.440
The Meganeson.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.440
The whirling Liam.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.440
And then they're like, can you show us the whirling Liam?

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440
No.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.440
Dogs have to come at me in a certain...

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.440
I have to be in circles and they have to come at me one by one.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:55.440
I'm perfectly counterclockwise.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.440
Oops.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440
I spilled water everywhere.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.440
That was so intimidated.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.440
And thrown.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.440
Spencer, I think I speak for all of us when I say we've missed you dearly, man.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440
Yes.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
Is...no?

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440
Okay.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.440
You know, Duncan Trussell was threatening to drop in on us,

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.440
but it's also 9.30, so...

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.440
This show doesn't need him.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440
No, I know, but...

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.440
I have tears running down my face.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440
I cannot handle it.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440
Have you done that before?

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.440
Was there a time when you were in your room and you were like,

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.440
if dogs happen, I think I can do this?

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.440
Yeah, are you kidding?

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:36.440
Why do you think I had such confidence when I told you it's possible?

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.440
You don't just go into these situations half-cocked.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:41.440
You prepare.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.440
I also think if you're spinning around in a circle,

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.440
you're going to start, like, you know...

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440
Oh, yeah, that's why, you know, 6 or 7.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.440
No, but you said 80, whatever.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.440
Cheetos.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.440
What? Cheetos.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.440
But again, at some point, you'd start stomping.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.440
It'd be, you'd save energy.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.440
It's self-defense.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440
These are bloodthirsty cheetos.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.440
Yeah, so I could commit violence against animals.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.440
What's wrong with that?

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.440
It's hypothetical.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.440
Yeah.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440
If it helps, these dogs are all racist.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.440
So...

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.440
And Polish.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.440
And Polish patons.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.440
Paton coyotes.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.440
The dog...

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.440
You know what?

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.440
A paton coyote went into a bar.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440
And he's like,

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.440
this is how a paton coyote eats a...

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.440
eats a shih tzu.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.440
I held the shih tzu with my paws,

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.440
put it over to the side.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.440
It's Dan.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.440
It's better they don't know.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440
Deconstructing the paton...

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.440
paton joke formula.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.440
It seems like they just have bad spatial...

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.440
no death perception.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.440
That is a big component of the paton joke.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.440
A lot of them suffer from a genesis of the basal colosum

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440
or the corpus colosum,

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.440
and they don't know where things are.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440
Yeah.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.440
Fucking patons.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.440
Can you do the joke that Siike did?

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.440
Which is one line?

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.440
Oh, well, my dad...

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.440
Oh, God.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.440
Oh, God.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.440
Oh, dear God.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:30.440
My dad was a globe manufacturer.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440
Oh, oh, God damn it.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.440
Quick disclaimer, some kid wrote to me on Tumblr.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.440
I think it was Tumblr.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.440
I want to pull it up.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.440
Last week's episode, you know,

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.440
I was in my cups, as Chevy calls it.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440
I was having fun.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.440
When I'm talking about therapy and stuff

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.440
and how much I don't want to do it and blah, blah, blah,

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.440
and I'm all self-righteous and indignant and all that stuff,

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.440
I'm not in role model mode.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:21:00.440
And I never want anybody emulating me

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:04.440
or taking anything I say seriously in that regard.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.440
We apparently talk seek out of actual help.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.440
Well, yeah, I mean, he was, like,

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.440
inspired by your show.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:14.440
I go, well, don't say that.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.440
God damn it.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440
Where's the...

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.440
I thought it was one of our Tumblr dealies.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:21.440
Whatever.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.440
It doesn't matter.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.440
I guess I wanted to give the person, you know,

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440
read them their own words,

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:30.440
but I don't think I can find them, so whatever.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:33.440
It was a kid writing in and saying, you know,

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.440
I hope that, you know, because they said,

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.440
I need help from professionals,

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.440
and I hope that nobody interpreted your screed

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.440
as, like, being a recommendation against seeking help

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:49.440
from others as professional people and stuff like that.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440
Not only was I being ironic, like, in the end,

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.440
like, I self-deprecate and go, like,

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.440
of course the whole point of this is that I'm crazy.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440
I'm in denial.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440
Nobody needs therapy more than me,

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440
and I like to have fun and say,

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440
I don't need the therapy and therapists

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440
are full of bullshit.

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.440
I mean, I'm not kidding either.

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.440
I'm expressing this indignation and like,

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.440
I'm being a child.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.440
I'm sucking my thumb and having fun.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.440
But I don't want any of you kids out there.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:22.440
I don't want anybody that thinks that they need

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.440
to talk to somebody to think that they shouldn't,

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.440
my God, or that that's a bad choice.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.440
That's so crazy.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.440
You should see a shrink.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:37.440
Going through a shrink is not going to hurt you at all

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.440
and could very well help you,

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:42.440
and I'm only making fun of myself by saying,

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440
indignantly, that I don't need to go,

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.440
and I'm 41 and blah, blah, blah.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.440
So I hope that that buys back any karma

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440
that I may have tainted.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440
All right, back to being funny.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.440
Also, races are good.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:03.440
If I said anything and made you think your race is bad.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440
It's good.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440
It's a good way to know who to trust.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440
Yeah, I think, you know, look,

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440
we all have our functions.

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:15.440
Germans are like the Swiss army knife of races.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:18.440
What are the Swiss?

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:22.440
Sort of what I call them, the German shadow.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.440
What are the Dutch?

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.440
The Dutch are the dykes of men.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.440
That's tough but fair.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.440
He's tough but fair.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:46.440
The blue people are black.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440
El Salvadorans?

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.440
They love carrots.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:56.440
But what are Peruvians famously afraid of?

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.440
Mosquitos.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.440
But it's that fear that drives them.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.440
It keeps them making bug zappers.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.440
That's technically racist to say

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.440
that Peruvians make great bug zappers but they do.

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.440
El Salvadorans, what did you say?

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.440
El Salvadorans.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.440
They're terrified of mosquitoes.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:21.440
I said it.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440
You go down there.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440
You do mission work like I did.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440
I work with them.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.440
I understand them and when you work with them

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.440
you learn to laugh at them.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.440
It becomes okay.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:40.440
I have carried an El Salvadoran child into the ocean

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.440
to drown him.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.440
To show him mosquitoes.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:53.440
Because that country has no extradition policy.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.440
Oh my God.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.440
There's been such great advice on this.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:02.440
It's words to live by should be the title of the podcast.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.440
That should be words to live by.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.440
Or Longbrown.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440
Longbrown.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.440
It should be called do as I say and as I do.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.440
We've learned how to fight dogs.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.440
Imitate me.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:25.440
And the logo is just a fork going into an outlet.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.440
Just a happy kid staring into a happy son.

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:37.440
Spencer, is this a thing that you've thought about

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440
since you were a kid?

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.440
I really want to parse this.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.440
I grew up listening to coyotes outside my window.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.440
Is there going to be a time where they're going to be closer

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.440
than outside my window?

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.440
I don't know.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.440
I definitely thought about it.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.440
I used to hike a shit ton.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.440
Again, we lived in farmlands and you'd just go

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.440
if you got a one mile anywhere, you'd be hiking.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.440
You wouldn't just be walking on a street.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.440
Think about stuff.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.440
I used to fall asleep when I was a little kid in testin.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.440
Behind the house was just hills.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.440
There was nothing there.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.440
Now it's totally developed.

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.440
It was just at night.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.440
It was so cool.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.440
We heard one last year.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.440
We lived in Silver Lake.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.440
We actually went out.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440
Emily loves animals.

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:30.440
It was fine that someone went and it was just a coyote out there.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.440
I wish I'd known about the spin kick move.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.440
What about that?

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.440
Is it a big ass mountain lion or a jaguar or some shit

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.440
that lives up in the Hollywood Hills?

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440
Have you seen this shit?

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.440
There's Cougars there.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.440
I'm so sorry.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.440
Please take that out.

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:50.440
That's it.

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.440
Leave it.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.440
Somebody put a motion sensor camera up

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.440
on the first Hollywood sign

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.440
and there's an awesome glamour shot of this giant mountain lion.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.440
Is it a mountain lion?

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.440
It's fucking enormous.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.440
It's a huge predator.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.440
They just crossed the 134 freeway somehow.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.440
I don't know how you get there.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.440
Yeah.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:12.440
I remember when we were kids,

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.440
we went to one of our vacations

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.440
or as we went to a different part of Pakistan

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.440
to go hiking.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440
We all day took us to get up this mountain,

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440
meet my family and their friends.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.440
No.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440
It's not.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.440
We climbed the mountain by digging a hole.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.440
Spatial jumps.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.440
They can't do a damn thing the right way.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.440
We finally got all the way up.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.440
What is a Patan sandwich made of?

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.440
It's just two pieces of meat

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.440
with a bread in between.

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.440
That is what it is.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.440
We really figured this out.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.440
I saw

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.440
they wear glasses on their feet

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.440
and shoes on their head.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.440
They just have airplanes for hats.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.440
We climbed all the way up.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.440
Took us all day.

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:04.440
As soon as we got up there,

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.440
it was like a very barren mountain.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440
We got there and it was just one tree

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.440
and under that tree

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.440
was just sitting a big fucking lion

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.440
looking right at us.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.440
We all walked up,

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.440
saw this lion

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.440
and hiked back down.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.440
Our whole day was going to be hanging out

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.440
on top of that mountain.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.440
On Lion Ridge.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.440
This mountain is taken.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.440
What do you think, tough guy?

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.440
You got a little adventure.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.440
Is there anything else we need to wrap up

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.440
before we go on a month-long break?

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.440
I don't actually hate animals.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.440
This is hypothetical.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.440
None of us think you're actually going to fight.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.440
Everyone was disclaiming.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.440
I feel like I should have done it too.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.440
Don't let me jumpstart that.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.440
There's nothing that you can say on this stage

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.440
that's so innocuous that someone's not going to

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.440
have a problem with it.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.440
Now I want to make that clear.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.440
That's a good example.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.440
That back pedal, whatever you call that.

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.440
I was saying that because I love

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.440
people and I want them to be happy

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.440
and I don't want them to be in pain.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:08.440
Then there's this other culture of

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440
wow, that was offensive technically.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.440
You put your elbow on the table of language

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.440
and it's like, I shouldn't have done that

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.440
because I know that that hurt someone.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.440
I'm saying that's not...

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.440
It's like we blur the two

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.440
and go like, you should apologize.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.440
I thought Natasha Legerro

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.440
was a non-apology for her...

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.440
That was great, huh?

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.440
Pearl Harbor joke.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.440
I thought that was amazing.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.440
Perfect.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.440
That reigned in a new era for me of like,

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.440
what the fuck are we doing?

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.440
We made some joke in a New Year's Eve show

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.440
about like, it was just like...

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.440
Didn't we talk about this already?

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.440
It was like a really innocuous joke

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.440
mainly about like, Pearl Harbor veterans

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.440
being older or something. It was a very

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.440
innocuous joke, yeah.

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.440
I don't know, SpaghettiOs

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.440
was sponsoring the show and she said that's good

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.440
because it's the only food that the Pearl Harbor veterans...

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.440
I had no idea.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.440
Redoing someone's joke

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.440
is not going to make it sound funny and blah blah blah

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.440
and it doesn't matter. No, we've proven that.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.440
Yeah.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.440
But her non-apology

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.440
like, blog

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.440
was great because she was like,

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.440
hello, so anyway,

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.440
I guess I'm supposed to apologize, but

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.440
you know, I'm not going to

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:24.440
because I don't really believe that the world's

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.440
greatest generation was in any way threatened

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.440
by my dumb joke about SpaghettiOs.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.440
I really refuse to believe it.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.440
I don't think Pearl Harbor got them down.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:34.440
You know, if they survive

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:36.440
Pearl Harbor,

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.440
you can make it through my joke.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.440
I think we apologize too much.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.440
And you know why? Because the D&D day

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.440
stands for day.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.440
I was wondering what D-day stands for.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.440
It's day-day. That's the stupidest shit in the world.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.440
D-day stands for

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.440
day-day.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440
I was like, what is D-day?

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440
What is the D&D day? It's day.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.440
Day-day. Like ATM machine?

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:00.440
Yeah, salsa sauce.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.440
Or Sierra mountains.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.440
Ah, right.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.440
Or Glendale. Glendale, which means valley-valley.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.440
Tautology,

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.440
I think they call it.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.440
No? Is that right? I don't know.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.440
Alright, fuck it.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.440
Day-day. Fuck your language.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.440
Fuck you Pearl Harbor assholes.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.440
I'm sorry.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.440
Spencer, can we dispense?

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.440
Do you...

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.440
While you unpack your gear...

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.440
Oh, are we continuing

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.440
the thing we were doing?

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.440
I hope so, yeah.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.440
Did you hear Aaron's in Dragons?

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.440
Yeah, it was amazing.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:42.440
I wish that she was here. I'd like her to DM me instead.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.440
So much less work.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.440
No, I'm kidding, I love it.

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.440
But, yeah, no, she was great.

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.440
It was great. I really like listening to it.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.440
She was thinking of starting a podcast

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.440
where she does a terrible job of dungeon mastering

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.440
some kind of game.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.440
And I think I was too much

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440
of an asshole about warning her

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.440
that it was like, you know, there's some rules to the game.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.440
Like, you should read some of the books.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.440
Like, it's not just improv.

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.440
Well, that's the thing. Like, if I was just

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.440
making stuff up, this would be so much easier.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.440
Yeah. But, you know, it's a lot harder

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.440
when you have to abide by rules and stuff.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.440
No offense to Aaron. Like, I'm not saying she had any faults.

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:18.440
She didn't do anything wrong. She was great.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.440
But...

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.440
I just wanted to disclaim it. I mean, no, she was great

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.440
because she did everything wrong. That's why it was great.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.440
Like, she willfully neglects the rules.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.440
I was in a blackout.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.440
I don't remember.

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.440
Yeah, what did happen when you were doing the charity that day?

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.440
You were tight as Dick's Hat Band.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.440
Yeah.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.440
I don't... I don't...

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.440
What is that? A Dick's Hat Band?

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.440
You never heard that? It's an old expression.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.440
That's weird, isn't it? I said, yeah, too.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.440
I'm like, yeah.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.440
That old chestnut.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.440
Tight as a Dick's Hat Band.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.440
Tight as Dick's Hat Band. That means you're drunk.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.440
What?

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.440
Look it up. I don't know. Dick, like,

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.440
it's probably...

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.440
It's one of those idioms that nobody knows exactly why it is.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.440
Privateized wear tight hats.

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.440
It's one of those idioms that I just made up 30 seconds ago.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.440
Yeah, the night I heard...

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.440
I was pissed as a parrot.

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.440
I think it's great. I don't know if the parrot's got drunk, but...

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.440
I like that.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.440
You know those wild parrots at Burbank?

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.440
Yeah.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.440
Right outside, like, the building. I came out and I saw it

01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.440
and I was like, what the...

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.440
What is going on? There's a bunch of parrots.

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.440
Spencer, how would you offend yourself?

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.440
Physically.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.440
Well, first you clip their wings and then you do the spin kick.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.440
No, it's spin punches. They're coming from the air.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.440
Spin punches?

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.440
Spin punches. They're coming from the air.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.440
I don't suppose we can see the spin punches.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.440
I can't kick that high.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.440
It looks the same, but I'm punching.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.440
Yeah.

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.440
Imagine it's so amazing.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440
Imagine a flock of parrots attacking Spencer

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440
and he's just going in a circle, punching left,

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:50.440
punching right, punching left.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.440
What if parrots and coyotes teamed up

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.440
and came at you at once?

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.440
I mean, it's tough

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440
because the whole spin kick thing

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440
is you're punching behind you.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.440
Oh, no!

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440
I didn't catch that.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.440
So you had a rear guard punch going on?

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.440
What's that guard?

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440
It's more of a decoy that also flails.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.440
You might smack something.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.440
I didn't even notice that.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.440
This is well-fought out.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.440
This is not just bullshit.

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.440
You're like a magician, man.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.440
You're distracting us with the

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:24.440
Yeah, we gotta see this.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:26.440
Yeah, if they jump at my back,

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440
they'll just get my arms.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.440
I can swing them around for a knee.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.440
Alright, Spencer, let's rejoin our campaign

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.440
in Dungeons and Dragons territory.

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.440
Oh, yeah, he's got his hands behind him.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.440
Yeah.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.440
It's better than getting your kidneys to bit.

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.440
Last time on Harmontown,

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:46.440
our heroes with the help

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.440
of a minotaur named Meredith

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.440
and her crazy ladder

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.440
had managed to climb out of their hole

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.440
and back into the frozen wastelands

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.440
of the north.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.440
They sought the Tarragon of Virtue,

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.440
nestled upon the Floating Isle of Paradise,

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.440
which was elusive as it was utopian.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.440
Mulraine jumped onto Coco

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.440
and began scouting out the nearby

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:08.440
landscape in all directions.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.440
In the vast featureless tundra,

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.440
the ranger discovered a sack

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.440
covered in gnomish script

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.440
and brought it back to the group

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.440
while the gang puzzled and debated over the sack.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440
Mulraine took initiative

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.440
and leapt into the sack

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.440
and into an equally magical city.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.440
The gang followed suit and soon they were met

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.440
with a gnome named Fizzbulb.

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440
Christopher quickly

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.440
solved the gnome's riddle,

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:34.440
granting them access to the magical city.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.440
But before the gang

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.440
could enjoy Bill Martigan's delights,

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.440
they were stricken

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.440
by agonizing pain,

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.440
a symptom of their bloody soul curses,

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.440
promises to slay Meredith,

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.440
their newfound ally.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.440
But could the gang break their curses

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.440
or would they be forced to slay Meredith?

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.440
And who was

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.440
Bill Martigan?

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.440
And did he have anything to say about this?

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:00.440
We'll find out tonight

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.440
on an all new Harmontown Time.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.440
Yay.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:14.440
Alright, so we're all

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.440
feeling the agony

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.440
of the soul curse in our heads right now.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.440
Yeah, you guys are still reeling from the massive pain

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.440
you just experienced.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.440
It was in your head and then you felt a burning

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.440
in your soul and it was like, ah.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.440
Is the gnome still with us?

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.440
Yeah, Fizzbulb.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.440
Yeah, Fizzbulb, he's sitting on a toadstool.

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.440
He just gave you the riddle and you solved it.

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:36.440
He's sitting. Let's go to Bill Martigan's, right?

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.440
Yeah, we gotta get there.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.440
Alright.

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.440
They have buffalo wings there that'll wipe you out.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.440
I want hot lights.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.440
A gnome appears in front of you.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:48.440
I mean, he doesn't appear.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.440
He leaps out of a bucket that he was in

01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.440
and he introduces himself.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:54.440
He says, my name is

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:56.440
Fizzbulb and I'm supposed to help you

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.440
get around the city.

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.440
How y'all doing today?

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.440
He comes out of a bucket?

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.440
Out of a bucket.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.440
Am I?

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.440
Am I?

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:10.440
I want to get high right now.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.440
Welcome to Bill Martigan's, the city

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.440
that's everywhere.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440
Well, you know where...

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440
Wait.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.440
I'm Fizzbulb.

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.440
Do you work at Bill Martigan's?

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440
I mean, I don't...

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.440
I have a job here, mostly I'm just...

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.440
In the bucket? No.

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.440
Sharpie, Sharpie, Bill Martigan's

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.440
everywhere. Okay.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.440
We're Fizzbulb.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.440
We're cursed.

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:40.440
We're cursed with a pain

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.440
that...

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.440
We were supposed to kill this minotaur, Meredith

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.440
over here and we didn't because we're good people

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:48.440
and now we're being punished.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.440
We're being punished for this deal that we made

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.440
that we would die if we didn't destroy this person.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.440
I'm behind on my mortgage.

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.440
You live in a fucking bucket.

01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.440
Oh, I thought we were just revealing personal truths.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.440
No.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.440
How much is the mortgage on your bucket?

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.440
No, that's not my house.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.440
It's a portal.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.440
That's a portal? Yeah.

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440
I stick my head in his bucket.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.440
You pop your head out of a bucket in a bathroom.

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:18.440
It's a small bathroom.

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.440
You live in a bathroom?

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:22.440
No, that's just where I keep the bucket.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.440
Wait, do you poop in the bucket?

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.440
No.

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.440
I use it for travel.

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.440
It would be great to poop in the bucket

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.440
and just send it to another dimension.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.440
But that would come out right before you.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.440
I pull my head out of the bucket and I look at

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.440
Whizball.

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.440
You live in a bathroom?

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.440
I have a bathroom in my house

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.440
where I keep a bucket.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.440
Do you poop in that bucket?

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.440
I feel like my life is so much weirder

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.440
than I've always thought.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.440
I

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:58.440
I poop my head in the bucket

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.440
and I look around for a toilet for confirmation

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440
that this is not the actual toilet.

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440
There's a toilet and there's a sink.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.440
It's like a porcelain toilet.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440
You don't even understand.

01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.440
I pop my head back out.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.440
You just keep the portal to this other dimension

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.440
in your bathroom at your other crib?

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440
Yeah.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.440
Why do you keep it in the bathroom?

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.440
Because then if I have to get out of the house...

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.440
Is that why they call you Whizball?

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:26.440
No.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:28.440
But that's very clever.

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.440
Well, it's not on me.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.440
I mean, it seems like that's something

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.440
that might have occurred to you before.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.440
No. I never thought my bucket

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.440
would be questioned to be quite honest.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:40.440
Whizball, is there anybody

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.440
in Bill Mardigan's

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.440
great expanse that could help us

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.440
lift this curse from us?

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.440
Bill Mardigan's a place of wonder.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.440
We got potion peddlers,

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.440
vape shops, barn grills,

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:54.440
Spitzwad's weird bungalow,

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.440
and of course the cigarette museum.

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.440
I go to Spitzbob's weird bungalow.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.440
I make a beeline

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.440
for Spitzwad's...

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.440
I'll cover the cigarette museum.

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:06.440
I'm going to go

01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.440
with that bucket.

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.440
Okay, so

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.440
Christopher emerges from the bucket

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.440
in a gnomish bathroom

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.440
while Quark heads over to...

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.440
How big is the bucket?

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.440
It's a magic bucket.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.440
You can fit through it?

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.440
It's like Santa's chimney.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.440
It's like that bag that you guys came through.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:28.440
Yeah, okay.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.440
I'm just throwing

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.440
things out there.

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.440
I pee in his toilet,

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.440
but I don't flush

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.440
because you know what they say,

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.440
if it's yellow, yellow, yellow,

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.440
if it's brown, let it drown.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.440
I don't know what the hell it goes.

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.440
If it's brown, let it drown.

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440
That's what my mother

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.440
said to me when I was born.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:54.440
That's not true.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.440
They were really hoping for a miracle.

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.440
I jump back out and I go,

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.440
are we all going to different things?

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.440
I'm going to Spitzbob's weird...

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:10.440
What's it called?

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.440
Weird bungalow.

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440
I want to go to the weird bungalow too.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.440
I was going to do a cigarette museum.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.440
I'm taking Meredith with me.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.440
There's a sign that says closed for renovation.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.440
That's why I wanted to knock that one out first.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.440
I pitch up to Spitzbob's weird bungalow.

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.440
You come up to

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.440
a shoddily constructed room.

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440
It's a one-room flat.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:36.440
It's got a very little...

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440
It's got a big table with chains

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.440
on either end that's just kind of

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.440
dominating the center of the room.

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:44.440
And on that table

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.440
sitting on it like it were a chair

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.440
or something citable, I guess it is citable,

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.440
is a gnome

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.440
who you take to be

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440
Spitzwad, especially because

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.440
he has a name tag that says it's such.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.440
He's got a big

01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.440
blue and orange beard, which is weird

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:02.440
even for gnomes.

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.440
He's sitting there.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.440
He's like, hey, what's up?

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.440
I

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.440
heard about your bungalow.

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.440
And

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440
look, my name is Quark.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440
I'm new here

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.440
at Bill Martigan's.

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.440
What's for sale

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440
here at the bungalow?

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.440
I'm a curse breaker

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.440
and a healer son of a bitch.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:30.440
Extraordinaire.

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.440
Nailed it.

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.440
I look at the bungalow.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.440
I look at the guys.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.440
I look over where I'm studying

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.440
the really complex cigarette museum hours.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.440
I'm going to try to figure out Mondays and Tuesdays

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.440
except Wednesdays.

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.440
What?

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.440
I got a curse breaker in here.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.440
Oh, shit.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.440
Yeah.

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.440
I go in there too.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440
So what seems

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.440
to be the problem?

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.440
We have a soul curse on us

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:04.440
and we made a deal to kill off

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.440
this minotaur here, Meredith.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.440
And we didn't want to because we took mercy.

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440
Yeah, we befriended her.

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:12.440
And we feel like we're being punished unjustly.

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.440
She's a stand-up minotaur

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.440
with a weird ladder.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.440
He waves his arms and pokes his eyes

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:20.440
with his hands and you see his eyes

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.440
kind of change color magically.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.440
And he's like, true vision.

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.440
And he looks at you guys

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:28.440
and just like...

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.440
It's just like detective mode

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:32.440
is a Batman vision.

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:34.440
That's stuck in there pretty good.

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.440
Yeah, it is kind of like that.

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.440
Kind of. I never played that game, probably.

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.440
Is there any way to get these curses

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.440
unbroken or broken?

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.440
They're in there pretty tight.

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.440
It's going to cost a pretty penny.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.440
Do you guys have any material wealth?

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:50.440
Hell yeah.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.440
I don't see anything in my money.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.440
You don't loot corpses after you kill them?

01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.440
Oh, fuck.

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.440
For any spare time?

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:00.440
Holy shit.

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:02.440
Spice-wide full disclosure,

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.440
we've killed a lot of people.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.440
That never occurred to us.

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.440
We're fucking broke right now.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.440
We've killed a lot of people.

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.440
I'm poorest Job's turkey over here.

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.440
I killed a million, a million people.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.440
We're doing the Patan's looting.

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440
Yeah.

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:20.440
Which is we give them money.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.440
We leave money in the corpses.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:24.440
Yeah.

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440
A Patan thief

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.440
dollar signs appear

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.440
in the corpses' eyes.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.440
Wrong eyes.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.440
I have a loot

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.440
of charming I'd be willing to part with.

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.440
I can't play the loot.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.440
That's pretty cool, though.

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.440
I could use 70 cartons of cigarettes.

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.440
Oh, shit.

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.440
Do you know to sell cigarettes at the

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:54.440
cigarette museum?

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.440
Because usually at museums,

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.440
they don't sell the stuff that they...

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.440
Guys.

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:02.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:04.440
Private Powell.

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.440
First of all, let's remember

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.440
to loot corpses from now on.

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.440
Yeah.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:12.440
That was a mistake.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.440
We could have retired by now.

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.440
Yeah, because we're definitely going to leave

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.440
some more corpses in our wake.

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:20.440
But we should have found some treasure

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.440
now and then.

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.440
Hey, buddy.

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.440
What part of Private Powell?

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.440
We should have locked butthole.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.440
We should have locked butthole.

01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:32.440
Do you not understand? I can hear everything.

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.440
It's a small butthole.

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:36.440
I'll leave.

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.440
No, no, stay here.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.440
No, no, no, stay.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.440
Stay. Who gives a shit?

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:44.440
Dan, I'm sorry.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.440
Sharpie, did you see...

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.440
You went over to the cigarette museum.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.440
Was it open? It's closed for renovations.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:52.440
It's an innovation being the key point.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440
They'll be expecting

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.440
men in white overalls

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.440
to be going in and out of there.

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.440
Okay.

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.440
How about maybe we see

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.440
if there's a store that sells cigarettes

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.440
before we...

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.440
We're not going to be able to loot any corpses

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.440
if we buy honest cigarettes.

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.440
We don't need to loot.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.440
I mean, we could just trade maybe.

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:16.440
I could give up my goggles of night.

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:20.440
Is this why... Does anybody sell carton cigarettes

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.440
in Bill Martigan's?

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.440
Oh, probably. This place is full of cigarettes.

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.440
I don't know about 70 cartons, though.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.440
It takes a long time to make money.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:30.440
Okay, guys, let's just go around.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.440
You guys make cigarettes?

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.440
If we need to, we can jump in the bucket

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.440
or back out the back.

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.440
Listen, they make cigarettes.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.440
That's what Bill Martigan's does.

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.440
Well, yeah, it's the main export.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.440
It's the city of smoking and riddles.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:46.440
Hey, guys, I'm a gnome.

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.440
We love smoking and riddles.

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440
But it seems fucked up to rob a museum

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
in the same town where you're buying curse breaks.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440
What?

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.440
How bad do you want these cigarettes?

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.440
I mean, how bad do you not want to die?

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.440
Okay.

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.440
He makes a good point, fellas.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.440
70 cartons.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440
So your export is cigarettes.

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.440
You guys are basically like North Carolina.

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.440
What?

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.440
All right, fair enough.

01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:14.440
Fair enough.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:16.440
Guys, look.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.440
My head is killing me.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.440
I don't know about you guys,

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440
but this whole curse has really taken its toll.

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:24.440
Let's not beat around the bush.

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.440
Let's just close museum.

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440
You know, we're seasoned veterans

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.440
of lots of battles.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.440
Let's just go in there, get these cigarettes,

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:34.440
pay the gun.

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.440
We'll get the soul's curse lifted.

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.440
We'll jump back through the sack

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.440
and we'll be back in our way.

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.440
We've been so afflicted about it

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:44.440
that we have to really keep it secret.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.440
That seems weird.

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440
We've committed so many weirder crimes.

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.440
We've killed our friends.

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:52.440
You've killed our friends.

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.440
I would like you to think back

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.440
on all of my behavior

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.440
throughout this campaign and realize that I...

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.440
Irrational?

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.440
Torrid asshole monsters

01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.440
that try to leverage us.

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.440
Authority issues.

01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.440
Yeah, so that's not the same as robbing us.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440
No museum.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.440
Cigarette museum?

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:14.440
Well, they do. They aren't bad for you.

01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:16.440
Yeah, we're getting rid of...

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.440
Cigarette museum?

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.440
That's not good for the kids.

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.440
But you think a museum is going to have

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.440
70 cartons of cigarettes?

01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.440
What's this museum about?

01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:28.440
Are there lots of cigarettes in there?

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440
I reckon. Why do you ask?

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440
You've never built?

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.440
Just because we really want to see what's...

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.440
We're just big fans.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.440
You know it's closed for renovations.

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.440
Yeah. Is there a cigarette factory around?

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.440
I... You know...

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.440
There really ought to be.

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440
I can't...

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:50.440
I can't think of one, but you can't imagine...

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440
You're the city that has everything.

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.440
Yeah, you don't know.

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:56.440
I admit that.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.440
You'd imagine that.

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.440
Guys, I think I see which side the bread is buttered on.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.440
Let's just go to the museum.

01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:04.440
I got a...

01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.440
Can I get a sub-power out?

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:08.440
Okay. Spiswad.

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.440
Cover your ears.

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440
I'll leave.

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.440
I got the old teleport cape.

01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:16.440
You know what I'm saying?

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:18.440
It's like...

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.440
This is going to be a breeze.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.440
Let's go get the spot in the alley

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440
and teleport to inside the Cigarette Museum.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.440
Can we all go in there?

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.440
I'll open the back door.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.440
We could also...

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.440
How about this?

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.440
If we get that guy's bucket,

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.440
we could... You could teleport in with the bucket

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440
and then we can climb through the bucket into the...

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.440
The bucket just leads to the guy's bathroom.

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:42.440
But if we move it from the guy's bathroom...

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.440
Although I don't know how you could carry the bucket

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.440
through itself.

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.440
If you get the...

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.440
I can teleport with the bucket into the museum

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.440
and then I can take a shit in that guy's bathroom

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440
from the museum.

01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.440
I don't know if this is going to help us.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.440
I say it's worth a try.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.440
I mean...

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:02.440
It's better to have a perfect crime.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.440
It's better to have it not want than not have it.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:06.440
I like the idea of bringing in a museum

01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.440
just to take a shit in their toilet.

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.440
Different guys toilet.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.440
Different guys...

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.440
Okay, let's...

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.440
I'm also... I'm going to keep talking like this.

01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.440
Alright, alright, alright.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440
I got...

01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.440
Do we have a bag of holding or something?

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.440
I could just pop in there

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.440
and I'll do this.

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.440
You go... We could go to one of the other spots

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.440
that's cool.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.440
Yeah, we'll make a diversion. You go in there and do it.

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.440
We'll just...

01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.440
Yeah, we'll create a diversion

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.440
that'll draw attention away from the

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.440
cigarette museum. Okay, cool.

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.440
Give me a bag of holding.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440
I got one. Okay.

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:46.440
Okay, great. Alright.

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:48.440
Hey, Spiswan!

01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.440
We're going to get you 70 parts.

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.440
Are there any brands

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440
you prefer?

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.440
Yeah.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.440
Give me some Narrow Burrow

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.440
Pinks.

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.440
What is this, the Flintstones?

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.440
That was way too...

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.440
I got way too good of a reaction.

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:08.440
Narrow Burrow.

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.440
It's like a terrible Matt magazine.

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.440
Spiswan,

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.440
is there a famous commercial

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.440
for Narrow Burrow Pinks?

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.440
There would be, probably.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.440
You'd think so, right?

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.440
Yeah.

01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.440
You know, they have the famous Narrow Burrow

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:28.440
Nan, who's the...

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.440
Isn't it Narrow Burrow? No.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.440
Narrow Burrow, no.

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:34.440
Alright.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:36.440
I think we figured out the best version of that joke.

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.440
Let's move on.

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:40.440
Alright, come on.

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.440
I don't want a cliffhank before this heist.

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.440
Alright, no, no, no. Let's go.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.440
So you do that, we're going to create a distraction.

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.440
Okay, we'll go outside

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.440
and if we see, we'll be lookouts.

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.440
If we come up and any 5-0 shows up,

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.440
we'll...

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.440
We should have some sort of signal

01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:58.440
that we can signal you if you're in there like,

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.440
hey, there's 5-0.

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.440
What's the signal?

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.440
Don't we have...

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.440
Oh, I'll play my lute of charming.

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.440
I could sing...

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.440
I could sing Lady in Red.

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.440
Okay, if there's trouble,

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.440
we'll start singing Lady in Red really loud.

01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.440
Yeah.

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.440
Okay.

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:20.440
Let's go to the cigarette museum.

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.440
Great song.

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:24.440
You do that. You're there.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.440
Alright.

01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.440
I go to a discreet spot

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.440
where I'm out of the view of the public

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.440
and I use the teleport cape

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.440
to teleport myself

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:36.440
through the wall of the museum.

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.440
You teleport into the museum,

01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:40.440
you see several things are like

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.440
covered up and papered over

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.440
for the renovation, but you see

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.440
the biggest thing you see

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:48.440
culminating the room next to posters of cigarettes

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.440
and all sorts of

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.440
breakdowns of models of cigarettes

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.440
and diagrams. You see,

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.440
a giant bust of a gnome

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.440
composed entirely of cigarette butts.

01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:00.440
Its eyes smolder

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.440
with smoke

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:04.440
and it seems to look at you

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.440
as you enter.

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.440
Bro, I think you just got fucked.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:12.440
I...

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.440
disguise

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.440
myself.

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:18.440
As you're casting the words,

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.440
you notice it definitely

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:22.440
is looking at you. It turns

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.440
towards you. A massive amalgamation

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.440
of cigarettes and opens

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.440
its mouth and says,

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.440
I am Bill Martigan.

01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:32.440
What do you in my

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:34.440
museum?

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:40.440
Lady in red!

01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:42.440
Dancing with me

01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.440
cheek to cheek.

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.440
Well,

01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.440
I

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:52.440
am Sharpie Buttsalot.

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:54.440
Which is sort of

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:56.440
a good descriptor for what this person is.

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.440
A lot of butts.

01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.440
Eat a lot of butts.

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.440
Yeah.

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.440
I am a human sorcerer

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.440
who has seen many adventures

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.440
and I am in your town because

01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.440
I am afflicted

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:12.440
by an unfair curse

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:14.440
that

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.440
wants me to kill a friend

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.440
which I cannot

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440
because in my world

01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:22.440
friendship

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.440
and cigarettes

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.440
are the

01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:28.440
foundation of life.

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.440
And

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.440
I came in here

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.440
to find cigarettes

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440
that I could use

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.440
to pay

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.440
to have my curse lifted

01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:44.440
and those cards are

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.440
on the table.

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.440
I'm not a good liar.

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.440
I don't think I could beat you in a fight.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:54.440
You're made of cigarettes.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.440
Even if I could.

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.440
Even if I could.

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.440
I wouldn't want to.

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:02.440
Because even if you did

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.440
he wouldn't loot you.

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.440
Bad looting

01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.440
full of my pockets and

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:10.440
I've never looted a single corpse in my life.

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.440
That should tell you something.

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.440
That's no excuse

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:18.440
for trespassing.

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:20.440
Even if you lack friendship and cigarettes

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.440
the two most important things

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.440
to me.

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.440
Sounds like there's some common ground.

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.440
You're absolutely right

01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.440
and I didn't think that I was

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.440
I wasn't thinking of it as trespassing.

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.440
I was thinking of it as

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.440
I saw the sign that said

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.440
you're under renovation.

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.440
Yeah, it's a dangerous place. You might get hurt.

01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.440
Yeah, and I actually

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.440
I've done a lot of carpentry

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.440
and things and so I

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.440
misinterpreted it with my tiny

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.440
non-cigarette brain

01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.440
as meaning that you needed

01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440
help renovating in here.

01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.440
And it was going to come in and help

01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.440
so I could come in and see the

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.440
cigarettes sooner. I fucked up.

01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.440
I'm admitting that.

01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.440
So you are

01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.440
lying.

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.440
We're outside.

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440
We're outside.

01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.440
He

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:18.440
his eyes seem to glow brighter

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.440
as if someone's taken a drag

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.440
from his eyes.

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.440
And then he opens his mouth and

01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.440
smoke billows out into the room.

01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:28.440
It swirls around you and consumes you

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.440
and choking acrid smog

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:32.440
it's hard to breathe but it doesn't

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.440
feel too bad. It feels smooth

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.440
and flavorful.

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.440
You have entered

01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:40.440
Null World Country.

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.440
Can I get at least like a

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.440
label about this or explaining

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.440
what it is?

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:52.440
No.

01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:54.440
Are we fighting?

01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.440
Just wait.

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.440
What are we doing outside?

01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:02.440
You guys are looking for guards.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:04.440
We think we're kicking ass.

01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.440
There's not very many guards.

01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.440
I look at Chris de Burgh

01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.440
and say this has taken too long.

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:12.440
You think something's bad?

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:14.440
It's 70 cards. I think it's going to take

01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:16.440
a while.

01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.440
Trust me, I think things are fine.

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.440
I'm

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.440
wearing my boots of spry springing.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.440
Does that mean I could like leap out of the smoke?

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.440
You can.

01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.440
Sure.

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.440
I say to the guy

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.440
hey listen, I'm wearing these boots of spry

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.440
springing and

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:40.440
I might leap out of the smoke.

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.440
Just really still

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:44.440
have an open dialogue with you

01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:46.440
and

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.440
want to lose your trust

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.440
and

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.440
create a cycle of mistrust

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.440
by avoiding

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.440
this smoke but at the same time

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.440
you're not explaining the smoke.

01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.440
I asked you

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:02.440
are you attacking me?

01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:06.440
You said just wait.

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:08.440
I could take that two ways.

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.440
Okay, can we go

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.440
I think something is wrong.

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:14.440
There's a chance that he's probably getting angry.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.440
You know what?

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.440
I say we go in there and help right now.

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:20.440
This has burst our way in, this has taken too long.

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.440
I'm going to go grab that P-bucket, that portal

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.440
just in case.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:26.440
Go to the guy's bathroom.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.440
That's a good getaway.

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.440
It's better to have.

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:32.440
I go grab the P-bucket

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:34.440
and I just burst with all my might

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.440
through the front door.

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.440
You burst with all your might

01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.440
through the front door

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.440
and into the area where Sharpie

01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:44.440
managed to pull himself into.

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:46.440
You see him, he's surrounded by smoke

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.440
but then he leaps out of it, right?

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.440
No, I started talking to the guy.

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:52.440
Then he's saying all these weird things.

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.440
You don't get what's going on.

01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:56.440
It's very confusing.

01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.440
There's a man made of cigarettes.

01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:00.440
Don't think that now's the time

01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:02.440
to injure into conflict.

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.440
While he's talking, I take the buckets

01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:06.440
and I see the cigarette monster, right?

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:08.440
You don't attack the cigarette monster.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.440
I just, I look.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.440
I go instinctively.

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:14.440
I think what we could do.

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.440
I think we could wave the bucket around

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.440
and move all the smoke to that guy's bathroom.

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.440
I was just going to push him

01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:22.440
into the bucket

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:24.440
and send him to the fucking bathroom.

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.440
I feel like...

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.440
Yeah, what if he doesn't want

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.440
to go to the bathroom?

01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.440
Well, he'll be in the bucket.

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.440
I think we could talk to him.

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:36.440
I think we could talk to this guy.

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.440
That's not fight.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.440
Okay, this...

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.440
guy.

01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.440
Smoke pours through the guy's mouth

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.440
and is now kind of consuming

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:48.440
this whole room and smoke.

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:50.440
You guys are overcome with smooth flavor.

01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.440
Hey, sense motive

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.440
on him, maybe?

01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:56.440
No.

01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:58.440
Hold on.

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:00.440
He's trying to get his flavor.

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.440
Um...

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.440
You think that he's, uh...

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.440
He doesn't seem hostile.

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.440
But he does seem overwhelmingly powerful.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.440
All right.

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440
I don't think a bucket is going to defeat this guy.

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:14.440
I light a torch and I throw it at him

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.440
to try to... No! No, please!

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.440
I intercept the torch.

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.440
Okay.

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:22.440
All right. I didn't throw. I had a cox.

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.440
I had a cox. And I go...

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440
Quark! What?

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.440
Please, let's talk to this guy.

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.440
Is he attacking? Hey!

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.440
Who are you asking?

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:34.440
Cigarette, buddy.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:36.440
I am Bill Mardigan.

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:38.440
Oh, it's Bill Mardigan!

02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:40.440
Holy shit!

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:42.440
Dude, your name is everywhere.

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.440
I am everywhere.

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:46.440
Are you attacking our friend

02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:48.440
or are things cold?

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.440
No. He's a true follower

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.440
of the curling smoke.

02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.440
He enjoys both cigarettes and friendship.

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:56.440
Oh! Oh!

02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.440
You almost said this guy.

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.440
No, no, no.

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.440
That's funny. You should say that.

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.440
It's very funny because I just lit this torch.

02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.440
I like smooth flavors.

02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.440
I smoke torches.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.440
This is like a big, really hard-core cigarette.

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.440
Great.

02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.440
All right. Hey, I love cigarettes also.

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.440
Then breathe in

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.440
the purifying smoke

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:20.440
of Narl Borough.

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.440
It's all right.

02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:24.440
You sense motive on him.

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.440
Yeah, I mean, it's just welcoming us

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.440
to Narl Borough country.

02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:30.440
He's gonna get killed by this guy.

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.440
No, no. He's a good guy.

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:34.440
You don't know. You just whip it in every three seconds.

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:36.440
It seems like he's... Okay.

02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.440
You're gonna regret me not lighting this fire on fire.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.440
This has happened a lot.

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:42.440
We've run into people who are our friends

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:44.440
and we end up fighting them. They're very powerful.

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:46.440
He's a cigarette monster.

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:48.440
I wouldn't put it past him to suppress research

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.440
about long-term effects of what's happening here.

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.440
But at the same time, in the short term,

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.440
I think he just wants us to be happy.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440
All right.

02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.440
10-10 cliffhanger.

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.440
I deeply inhale the smoke.

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:02.440
And I say, fuck it.

02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:04.440
You feel your curse being lifted.

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.440
Oh!

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.440
Oh, my God.

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440
You guys got to try this.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440
I also deeply inhale.

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.440
I hadn't inhaled yet.

02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.440
I know. You seem to be kind of resisting.

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.440
Oh, sorry. I was just...

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:20.440
I was talking. I assumed I was breathing the whole time.

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.440
I don't know.

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:26.440
The same happens to you.

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.440
Chris de Burgher's still possessed in general, though.

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.440
Oh, fuck right.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.440
No.

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:34.440
Fuck the cigarette monster.

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.440
Fuck you, buddy.

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.440
We can go back to Spiswad and maybe get your curse lifted.

02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.440
We can bring him some cigarettes.

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.440
I don't have a curse. I'm doing great.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.440
No, you're...

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.440
But our curses are lifted, you guys.

02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.440
We're so cursed for the time being.

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:52.440
We're good.

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.440
Meredith bursts in carrying a long ladder.

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.440
Uh-oh.

02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.440
Hey, what's up?

02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:00.440
We're good. We don't have to kill you now.

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.440
I'll put this away, then.

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.440
She leaves.

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.440
Cliffhanger!

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.440
Yay!

02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.440
All right, gang.

02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:14.440
Yeah.

02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.440
If you're crazy, go get professional help.

02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:18.440
If you're a race,

02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.440
love yourself and each other.

02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.440
If you're a comedy writer,

02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.440
embrace the challenge

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:26.440
of writing non-offensive comedy.

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.440
If you...

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.440
If you love Harmontown,

02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.440
we'll see you in May.

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:34.440
Yeah.

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.440
Thank you, Dustin Marshall.

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440
Thank you, Meltdown.

02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.440
Nerd, Melt.

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:42.440
And thank you, most of all, to the people that come here every week.

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.440
You guys are the best. We love you. We'll see you soon.

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.440
Thank you, Zach, the audio maniac.

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.440
We send you free on Sundays

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.440
to watch Game of Thrones in peace.

02:03:50.440 --> 02:04:16.440
Oh, yeah.
