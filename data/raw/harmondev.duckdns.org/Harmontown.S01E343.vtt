WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.640
There we are. Welcome y'all to MacArthur Park, which is melting in the dark is always super

00:07.640 --> 00:10.000
melting because it's hot as fuuuuck.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Harmontown is once again in session.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
What is that?

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Let's bring out the Game Master Spencer Crittenden.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm gonna call a Comptroller Audible and bring out Brandon Johnson.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Brandon to the stage.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Oh shit.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
He said to stop by.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
He had to stop by.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
What's up with these shoes and these shiny brown-

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
What do you got? Broke?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Walking that basket weave for y'all.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
We got the cap toe basket weave so hot in the summertime my feet need to breathe.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Let's bring out the Mayor of Hamilton.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Dan Harmon

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah!

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I refer to your normal speaking voice.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Tip to the hop.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, hip to the hop.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Got a big bunion on my sack.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Got a hat on my cot.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Rented a cot for my hat.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
And a mop took the mop and put it in a bucket.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Saw your mama last night and said fuck it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Alright, boring.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Thank you.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Have you given up on freestyle Dan?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Or have you just lost your...

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
You know, just happy.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
I think a lot of rapping has to do with, you know, you've got something you need to say.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I thought you were getting to a pretty good zone there.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I mean, you could hear the reaction.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
They were overwhelmed.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
In general, it's a great podcast.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
There's a lot left to say.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
I could launch now and do one of many segments that would be totally relatable to the people.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
That people are just waiting to gobble up.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm having some...

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I just saw some of the decorators proposals.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
And, you know, I was a little disappointed to learn that they were photos of just concepts and not my actual house.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You know, stuff like that, stuff that you guys want to hear.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Because it's 2019.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
Because right now you have a 17 bedroom, like Marques, like mansion going on.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
And you have a one-air mattress and there's no chairs.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm truly the voice of the next generation.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
From my blanche whiteness to my six-figure-a-week income to my...

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
He makes $700,000 a week just for doing nothing.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
To my complaints about my numerous gardeners.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
To my two houses.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
To my eight years in podcasting.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
I mean, the list goes on and on.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
I found it a little bit excessive that you have 17 Lipizonner horses in your house now.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
Look, you get into a zone where you're trying to chase that happy rabbit and you can't catch it anymore.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Lipizonners are very cost-prohibitive.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
Is it at all possible that anyone else here has something to complain about?

03:20.000 --> 03:27.000
Who here in the crowd thinks they have the most righteous indignation complaint right now?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
There's a hand went up over here in the corner.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
What was that?

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh, are you albino by any chance?

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Okay, would you like to come up?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Okay, come on up.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Bring that albino up.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Wait, I haven't plugged in.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Place some albino music.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
This is a guy with a resonant beef.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I also hate the sun.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
You're a friend of the podcast, aren't you?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
What was your name again?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Wait, don't tell me.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Jax.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Turbo.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Turbo.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Scorpion.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Kalen.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Kalen.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Kalen, yeah.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I knew it was cool.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Thank you.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
How have you been?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Not too bad.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
This heat wave, huh?

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
When you were talking about beef, we're living in a world where people complain about a lot of things,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
and I get that, and everybody should have the right.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
But every day I wake up, and the center of our solar system is actively trying to murder me.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
So what is your physical interaction with albinism?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
How do you say it?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
So I'm albinistic.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
So albinos have the pink eyes.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
This is going to be kind of, you know, clipping.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Triggering.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah, it's going to piss some people off.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Now, albiners have the cliff note.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
They have the pink eyes, and they can see well.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
But they look like pedophiles, and they're the ones who are freaks.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Come on now.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm under the radar.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
No, look at all the movies when the pink eye ones.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
So then I have the color in front of my eyes, but I have vision problems.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm legally blind, and the same amount of sun-burning happens.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
So you're saying more human being, like blue eyes, not that pink eyes aren't human being,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
like I was saying, like more...

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
This albino is racist.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
You're saying that having a more common color eye, you still have worse vision than a pink-eyed albino.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
So albinos, the albinos have 20-20 vision generally.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
They don't have any problems.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
They have just pink eyes.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
Albinistic people have vision problems, and they don't have the pink eyes.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
They're two different things, but when everybody says, hey, you albino, I'm like, yep.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Because I don't want to deal with the explanation.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Is your tongue abnormally red by albinistic things?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Nope.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I just had a red vine.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
You had a lovely cat.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
There you are.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I just had a red vine.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
You have a very shockingly red tongue right now.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah, so I'm glad it's filming, because I just had a red vine.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
I was like, I'm not going to go up.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I'm in the corner.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Well, that tracks with...

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Because our friend Victor Varnado has been our friend for ages.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
It occurs to me now that you're talking about this, that he has...

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
God, the language is a fucking minefield, because I want to say regular eyes, but...

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah, non-pink eyes.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't think I've ever actually talked to a person with the pink eyes, but it's interesting.

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
That's so weird to learn that they have 20-20 vision.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, they can drive.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So are you legally blind?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Legally blind, yeah.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
And you're wearing contacts?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I can't, because I have a stigmatism, so my eyes do this.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
What is your field of vision right now?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Do you have a blurry field of vision?

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
So what happens for me is, like, Brandon and I know each other, and so he wears great suits.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
So he's come to a couple shows, and as long as I know what color his suit is, it's great.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Otherwise, I'll walk by him, and he'll think I'm racist.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But it's just I don't recognize him.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
It's that you walk by and you go, get out of my way, nigger.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm just doing a character in my show.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Out of my way, brown eyes.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Wait, what do you mean?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
You have to know in advance what color suit he's wearing?

07:05.000 --> 07:13.000
So for me, to kind of deal with the world, when you see the sign that says, like, Ash Avenue,

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
you got your A, you got your S and H, what I see is...

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
I can spell.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
I see a green triangle and two little green squares.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
And I make the shapes out before I see them, because I can see color differentiation really well,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
but not anything else.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So you're allowed to have a driver's license?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Oh, no.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
So what is...

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
I don't know how deep you've dug into the science of it, but the interesting thing to me is that we're talking about

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
pigmentation here, and so isn't it that the albino folk, the reason their eyes are pink,

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
I assume, has something to do with an extension of this whole problem, which is like pigmentation.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Pigmentation, yeah.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
The eyes are pigmented, quote, unquote, adequately.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Why is it that the eyes are less functional?

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
So my brother and sister are both freakishly also albinistic, which is pretty much impossible,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
and they would know better than me because they studied it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
So that's not a recessive or dominant trait in parents?

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
No, it is, but the fact that it happened to all three of us is a freaking nature.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
According to Gregor Mendel, it should be happening to like one of you.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
If you have four kids.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Like, he learned that with the peas.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It should have happened once and not again.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
My mom and dad have a recessive gene.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
My dad is Italian.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
My mom is Irish.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
She's redhead.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
My dad's a Swar the Italian.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
This is not supposed to happen.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
My brother's older.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
It happened three times, but they know a lot about the eyes.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
The milk man is albino.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I'm sure this joke gets told every fucking family reunion.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I'm sorry, but...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
You know what?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
That's weird.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
My family has no sense of humor, I guess, because I thought they did, but that makes more sense

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
that one albino was just banging my mom three times.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
But a lot of...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
To cut you off, you have...

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Your hair is fantastic.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Like, you have...

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
A lot of people to pay a lot of money for is just this beautiful, like, silvery...

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I got 16 inches off last time I was here.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
16 inches?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yep.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
You donated to charity or something?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Absolutely not.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I was so poor I had to sell it to the movies.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Shit.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
To the movies?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
I had to, yeah.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
I would like to think, and I can't prove it, that the Targaryen chick is wearing mine.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Let's just plant that seed.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
You think Daenerys is wearing your hair?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I hope so.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm pretty sure that it went to Hulk Hogan.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Do you have any idea about...

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Or any of the Eagles.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Why it is mythically...

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
Because when I see an albinistic person with albinistic features,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
I can't avoid thinking about the word angel,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
which I'm sure is problematic to the albinistic community.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Our friend Victor has been cast as an angel many times.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Do you have any idea about that?

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
The origin of why we portray angels as white-haired?

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Well, in the Bible, in Revelation, when Jesus comes back the first time in the very beginning,

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
he talks about his hair dressed in white, his feet like burnished bronze.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
His whole like, you know, clothed in white, white, white, white thing.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
So I guess when albiners were born, that's why, you know,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
they're also getting cannibalized in Africa because they think they're magic as well.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Well, that's no way to treat magic.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Well, no, no.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
If you eat an albino thigh bone, you can raise the dead.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It's what they're thinking there.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Well, that is true.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, but I mean, is there a part of...

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It is, right?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
It's absolutely true.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Wait, just the thigh bone?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
That's an example.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
They take trophies from albinos because there's actually more albinism in African genes than in white...

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You mean after they die of natural causes?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
No.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Because I would eat the part of the albino that magically created more albinos.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
If I die, I'm going to do an organ donor thing that says,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
you can have whatever you want for you.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I appreciate your work.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Are there parts...

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Sorry, this is morbid, but are there other...

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Is it just raising the dead?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Are there any other...

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
There's all sorts of things.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
These people are doing cocaine and weird African gunpowder drugs and making children soldiers.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I'm not sure what they're doing there all around,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
but they think that they get power from eating albinos.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
If you're listening in Africa, we're sorry.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm going to help one day.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I don't want to overstep my comptroller powers,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
but I think there's only one way to prove this theory.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
You want the winky?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I want that thigh bone.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Why does this man insult me?

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
Did you happen to hear the episode recently where we had a kind of a shockingly adept,

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
self-effacingly, neophyte dermatological scientist up here?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
No.

12:02.000 --> 12:11.000
He counseled me on my Polish skin tags that are out of control, and I got to go get them removed and stuff.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
I don't know. I was curious about that.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
Do albinistic folk...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I make them sound like Irish fairies.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You just say albinos for quickness.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm trying to be PC, and I'm just making everyone sound like a fairy.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
No, this is the same space.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
What's the relationship between... You seem pretty young, so you probably wouldn't know.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Do you get fucking shit growing off you like I do?

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
I have little sunspots and stuff like that, and I don't go in the sun very often.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
You were saying that the reason you have a right to complain is that you have a hate relationship with the sun.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
If there's a crack in the window, I wake up every day and go,

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
fuck! There's a line of sunburn on my face.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I can burn about 20 minutes.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
And it's incredibly dangerous, because it's like a cancer ray.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Do you know numbers on that? Do you hear horror stories?

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
If I spent an hour and a half in the sun with nothing on, it would be lethal?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm so good at avoiding it.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm lucky enough to have a career where I can make my own hours,

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
but I don't know enough about North Hollywood and Hollywood Shade to run into the right corners.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
And also, I'm hoping that if every... It's a highlander thing.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Every albino or albinistic person that dies, I get stronger.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't want to educate anyone on this.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Because each of them has a pocket of darkness, shadow power,

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
so when they crack open and this dark energy goes into you, and it counteracts the sun.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Do you split between all the albino people, or do you just get all of the deaths worth of value?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I'm thinking that because of my lack of...

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Because I have a pretty strong vehicle, I could probably help.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
And since I'm not, I'm thinking that negative energy is pulling a little more my way.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Alright, you've got a stronger gravity.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
When you run into a full-on...

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
There's a delineation between albino and albinistic.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
When you meet somebody, I imagine you have, with the pink eye thing,

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
and you meet them, is there any kind of tension between that?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Have you seen the movie Warriors?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Like a rival gang?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I don't know. I'm so rent with them.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
You're never alone. You're never disconnected.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
The West Side Story kind of thing.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm so bound up with social anxiety.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Anyway, I've done a couple photo shoots for awareness and things like that.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
And so we had all kinds of different pigmentless people.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
And I met them and everything was fine.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
But at the same time, I'm just nervous around anybody.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
But in the back of my mind, I was like, you can drive, so fuck you.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, they've got privilege.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Who knows how many albinistic...

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
I know people you've met who have passed for albinistic and taken advantage of it.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
They could put contacts in those assholes.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
They could drive a car. It looks Scandinavian.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm Italian.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And I was like, are you Scandinavian?

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
No, I'm just sad.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Sorry, I'm getting fired up.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Well, as always, we appreciate you being vulnerable with us.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I wish I could believe me.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
The sun is my enemy too, but boy, the enemy of my enemy.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
I wish there was something we could do.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
I call the sun orange Hitler.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
And from this day forward, that makes it better.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Yeah, I hate it.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I want to put a hat over my pool.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You could put an umbrella that goes out.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I'm thinking about it.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And then I feel like people make fun and go, why do you want a pool?

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Those sexy like in the cabanas, like those curvy...

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
They go out like that, so you have a shady spot always.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And you swim there like, no, I'm being active.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I just happen to be swimming actively in the shade.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
You're not. You're just hanging out and hiding.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
I might build a wall around it and then put a ceiling on the walls.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And then an air conditioner.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
So it'd just be an indoor pool?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
That's called a house.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
You work hard enough, you deserve it.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
You do it.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Or have an indoor pool, I guess.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
If you've ever been to the Hearst Mansion, it's like,

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
he's getting pools where they start outside and then they go inside.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
But only if you're in the pool.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Like if you're a burglar, you could try to rob the house,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
but you'd have to go in the pool.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
And then there's like pools that have hallways, like pool hallways.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
That's so badass.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I mean, like if you have an indoor pool and people are swimming

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
and it's like, can you imagine, it's like, hey, come over here.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
People are like going down the pool hallway to do pool coke.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Wait, why is there a pool hallway?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Is there a pool bathroom?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
That's what I want to know.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
If you go around the corner, is there like...

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
You can hang up your towel under water over there.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
He's got pool rooms, so you have a pool right here,

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
and then you swim down a canal, and there's another pool over here,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
and he's got like three pools in one big pool house,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and it's the dopest shit.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
That's what I get.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
The only time I get excited about his dumb ass house underwater pool.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
The pool thing.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
The pool urinals are cool, but the pools sit down toilets.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
They're kind of like a work in progress.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
It's putting too much power in the hands of the consumer, in my opinion.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Usually it works, but then if you have diarrhea,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
we're working that out.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
If every single one of your guests is not totally trustworthy

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
and capable, it's a disaster.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You need a pool guard who watches what the people eat

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
before they go in the pool.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Shrimps of E.J., if you have two plates of that,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
you should not be in the pool.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
The pool dietician.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, like somebody who's just there ready.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
It's like vacuum, it's not going to work.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
How amazing would it be if you were so rich,

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
and technology was so accurate or whatever you call it,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
that people could come over to your house

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
and just hang out in your pool.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Your whole house just had a pool everywhere.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Every room had a little pool part of it

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
so that technically you could just swim to any room

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
and just be a different class of citizen.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm one of the aqua people.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Here I am in the charades game, bye.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
But at any point in that water, you could shit or piss

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
or puke or drop fucking anything,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
and it would all just go and just float away

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
to the nearest filter.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You just crystallized my dream.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
You could just float around like a little baby

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and pee in poo poo.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
You could just be in the water, you could do whatever.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
You go inside for the winter,

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
you start to see the seasons change,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
the leaves fall and you go out, you go in,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
and then you kind of hibernate and shit everywhere.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You're saying that you just want to live

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
in a very efficient toilet.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The biggest toilet.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
No toilet paper to worry about,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
don't have to get the bear anymore.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It's brilliant.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
That's kind of what the internet is, right?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
It's every human expressing how they'd like life to be.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Like, oh, I'd like to be in contact with every human being

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and I'd like to emit whatever I want,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
but I don't want to ever touch anything that comes out of me

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
or out of anyone else.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
The problem is the filter on the internet's bad

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
and we're all backed up,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
so now we're all knee deep and shit.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
The problem is we need a pool dietician for the internet.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Thank you.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
You get it.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Because they just shit.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
How would we elect this pool dietician?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I'll do it.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Pool dietician.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I second.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I don't really like,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I don't think people should,

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
friends should discuss religion or pool dietic.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Steve, can you bring the ice bucket?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Pool dietic.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
You just came up with like a 1980s...

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Wait, is that a first?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Pool dietic.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
No, you said pool dietic.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
He said pool dietician.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Oh, pool dietician.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I just stole,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I just appropriated Brandon's joke.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Okay.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Well, when I heard pool dietician,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I thought you misheard pool dietician.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, I thought it was pool dietician,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
but pool dietician is way better.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
He said pool nutrition.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Right.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
He said pool dietician.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
He said pool nutrition.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
And I say,

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
quit pooling around and vote for me.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
That's how it happened.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I just got every dad's vote in the joke coalition.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
Welcome to my political arty.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
What is, there's no pee in it.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Oh, let's keep it that way.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
What is going on with the conspicuous timing

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
of the, when did we...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I think Steve Levy likes to bring it out

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
in dramatic fashion in the middle of the show

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
to make like a...

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
We should get him a cape.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I think he's like the phantom of our opera

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
and he likes to bring out the...

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
We should get him a half mask.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
He likes to bring out the vodka.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Is he trying to tempt me into health?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Let's see how long it can...

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Don't do it.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I don't want to enable him.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I'm leaving it out until he really asks for it.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
And then I just look.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I'm here to help, but...

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Levy, you should just scream it

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
from the rooftops that you want it.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
I hear him coming.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Here it comes.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Yes, Steve Levy with the vodka.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Dramatic fashion.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
All right, Levy, sit.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Please sit down.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Sit.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
You can't just tell a human being to sit like a...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Like a carrier.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Explain yourself.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Half of it is forgetting

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
and half of it is strategy, I think.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Forgetting must be nice.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Unfortunately, my vodka's never out here.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Strategy for what?

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
What's the strategic ploy here?

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
You know, we keep it on the rails a little bit

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
in the beginning.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Oh.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Oh, shit.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
All right.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
To time out Dan's blackouts.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Forget which one it was, but you were like,

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
you know, I think I may have just too much in the beginning.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
And I was like, well, you know, if I don't...

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Give it 15 minutes.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Give you your 20.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Well, I think the danger is more like...

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It's about before the show.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
If I pre-game before the show, we're just fucked, you know?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Yeah, all right.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Yeah.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Shit.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Like the Yardley Smith episode, I just...

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
I got...

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah, I think that might have been the one where you were like,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
you know...

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I was nervous.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
It's ironic because they get nervous about certain people

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
and then I'm like, I want to do a good job.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
But then I'm like, well, that's not how you're going to do a good job.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You fucked up with Norman Lear.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
And then I'm like...

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So then I'm like, oh, a little Dutch courage.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
You didn't fuck up.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
That episode was classic.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It was classic.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
I was there.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I was there.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
I was afraid of Norman Lear.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And because he was facing you,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
any time I jumped in and said something

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
and he couldn't quite hear it,

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
I think he thought I was attacking him.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Yeah.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Well, you probably were.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
I would never attack Norman Lear.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
He told us that great story.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I forget which famous actor,

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
but it was like the dick in the hotel room.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Did he tell us that?

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, something about a dick in a hotel room.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
You know who I speak in a Norman Lear,

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
because you know who was in the green room

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
and I guess he couldn't wait to come out

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
and tell Norman Lear that he wasn't on the show.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
DeMorge, I ran into DeMorge on Hollywood Boulevard.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
I don't know, like 2.30 in the morning or something.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
He was straight sober.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
I was coming off of an adventure and just trying to...

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Did you play Spider-Man until about midnight?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Yeah.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
And then...

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
Yeah.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
But I just ran into him in the corner,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
like real close to where Sinus Base used to be.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And it was like, holy shit, it's DeMorge.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
And we talked for like, it felt like an hour.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
And then it was just like, deserted Hollywood Boulevard

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
and then I went on my way.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
It was nice to see him.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
What was the origin of your adventure?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
What did you just come off of?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I met with Joel McHale and Chris McKenna

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and that's already a lot of mix

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
to just throw at an evening.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
So by the time we finished dinner,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
McKenna and I were like,

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
really, Aaron the girl I was dating,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
not Erin McGathy,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
but Aaron who I was dating

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
when I was actively working at my hardest on community.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
She observed, she's like,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
you and McKenna bring out the best and worst in each other.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And like, McKenna and I were like,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
we were like yelling at McKale,

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
like, why do you love your family more than drinking?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Come out with us.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
Like, we were just 17 years old.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
We were just actively trying to get a man

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
to break up with his family

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
because we wanted to go to the Frolick Room

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
and then we didn't go to the Frolick Room.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
We stumbled into this other place that came before it.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
This dark bar that only had one other guy in it

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
and I will say to this guy's credit,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
he did the one thing that usually like,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't think I've ever heard

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
from the obnoxious drunk third guy at the bar,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
which is he just blatantly sad after listening to us

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
for 20 minutes, he's like, you know what?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I can't hear you that good

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and I'm fascinated by what you're saying,

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
so I'm going to move one down to Swack and Eavesdrop.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
That's quite a compliment.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
And I was like, all right, well, can't fault that.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
We're in a public place.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
If we wanted privacy, we'd leave.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And I was like, well, what do you do?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I'm a data scientist.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I'm a flavor chef.

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
It's rare when your job title belies the fakeness of it.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm a water surfer.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Okay, you wanted to make it sound a little more realistic,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
but you blew it.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Data scientist.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I asked him five questions.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
He's like, why is that so funny?

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm like, because literally all science is data science?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
All of it.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Does that mean he's one of those people

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
that just does data input?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
He's drunk.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
He's trying to live a secret life of Walter Middy.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
He just wanted to make up a job.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
The answer was whatever.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I don't know.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
He did something that had to do with like,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
it was like data.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
It was data, but it wasn't science.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
He goes and tries different flavors of Kellogg's, Corn Flakes,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
and sees that they're good.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That's data science.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
It was almost like data anti-science.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
If you want to know the truth,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
it had to do with housing loans.

26:31.000 --> 26:38.000
Banks hire him to make numbers faken dance

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
in favor of the status quo.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
What did you say?

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
He's like a book cooker.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
It's kind of like, you watch the documentaries

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
about the guys that were behind climate change denial

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
or tobacco.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
When politics meets science.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
He's like a think tanker.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Yeah, he's kind of a guy that you call.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
He's a data spinner.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Ain't no science about it.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
It's very much not science, what he does.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And he actually was getting drunk.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
And I think he was getting drunk because he's ashamed of it.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
When he actually got to the bottom of it

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and was explaining what he did.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Not like you that was trying to talk out.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
I'm getting drunk because I love what I do.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah, it's true.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I get drunk because I love myself.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm like, yay!

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Who wants to overhear me?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And then you just meet people are like,

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I'd like to spite my own wrists open.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That's why I'm drinking.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Not yourself. I won't remember.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But the bartender was also very interesting.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
12 years sober.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And sometimes you run into a bartender

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
who's like very rock solid sober.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
It takes you back a little,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
but there's a certain,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
there's a Venn diagram of people

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
between sober people and bartenders.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
It's like, I'm in my sweet spot.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
This is how I stay sober.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
They're great bartenders

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
because they were alcoholics once

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
and they're never going to be again.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
And they have empathy for people

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
that are there for the right or wrong reasons.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
They have a sharp instinct for when to cut off,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
when to over pour, when to 86, when to call a cab.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
And this guy was talking about how

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
it was 12 years ago

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
when he saw the episode of Cheers in reruns

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
where there's a specific episode of Cheers

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
that I remembered as he described it.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I was like, oh yeah, that episode for sure.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And the lights go out and Sam's alone in the bar

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and then he pours one and then he slides it down the bar.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
And he's like, yeah, yeah, that one, that one.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And I was like, you know, that got me going about Cheers

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and how Cheers is the greatest show

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
and everybody in my generation will tell you.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And Stephanie's like, he said something like,

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
he's like, yeah, and I think it was like,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
that was before Norm died.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
And I was like, Norm died.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
How many episodes of Cheers have you seen?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
He's like, oh, one or two.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
It's like, cheers changed your life

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
and you never watched another episode.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
How do you know the third episode you watch

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
of Cheers wouldn't make you a millionaire?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Like you watch one episode

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and it magically transforms your fucking life

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
and you're just like, fuck it, I'll watch Firescape now.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Did Norm die? Norm didn't die.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
No, he never died.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
And anyone that ever cared.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
He meant Coach.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
No, no, he did.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Well, okay, if he did mean that,

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
then it's just funny.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
He wasn't a Cheers fan.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
He just saw that episode and it changed his life.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
That's what's funny.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
He didn't then watch 200 episodes of Cheers.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
He just was like, what a fun episode

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
or whatever the fuck that was.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
We just got Milton about Cheers for a second about Coach.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I've told us straight before on the show

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
about being at a bar with George Wendt, right?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Probably, like...

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Yeah, well, long story short,

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Sudeikis is his nephew, George Wendt's nephew.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
We went out to...

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Which is why Nicholas Cage, he changed his name.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
He didn't want that Wendt status.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
What's going on?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
No, we went to see a band at the Troubadour,

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
which is a square or rectangular shaped bar.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
George Wendt was high

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
because he and Jason Sudeikis like to smoke a little weed

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
and Norm sat at the exact spot where Norm would sit at Cheers

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
on the corner of the left side of the bar

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
and people were losing their fucking minds.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Because everybody else is high, too.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
Like, I just moved here from Cincinnati

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
and fucking Norm is right there.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
Having a beer and the same stool that he would occupy

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
and he was like signing people's tits.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
He was awesome.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
Did you sign this chair on purpose?

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
And did that person ask for their tits to be signed?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
It was a different time.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
It was a simpler time.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
It was a different time.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
They wanted an autograph.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
They didn't have a napkin.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Cut to a Weepy Ratsenberger over in the corner.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Weepy Ratsenberger.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Weepy, how's your relationship going?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
You got a new squeeze?

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
Yeah, I got a new squeeze.

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
So here's something that concerns me.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I know where this is going.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Cody asked to see a photo of her

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
and you said you didn't have one.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
What?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
We hadn't taken pictures of each other.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
Also, she's not like a fan of being photographed.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
Does she live by Niagara Falls?

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Yeah.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
We want to respect her, obviously.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
But we also want to question her existence.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
How do we do this?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
How do we walk this tightrope?

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
How do we authenticate the fact that you actually have a girlfriend?

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Well, since that conversation, I actually took a photo of her.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
Cody wants to see her yelling at her, step straight.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
My boss's fiance wants to know you exist.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yeah, yeah.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
She was not thrilled to be taking the pictures.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
But yeah, I took a couple of pictures.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
All right.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Does she live in town?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Is she local?

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Yeah, she's local.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
And how long has this been going on?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Four months.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Are you happy?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
You feeling good?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Yeah.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Like Comic-Con, was she?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
No, no.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
Okay.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Yeah.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
All right.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
I was with you every step of the way through Comic-Con.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I know, because you were making out with that one girl and I was...

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Just kidding.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Shirley.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Let's call her Shirley.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
We won't.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Let's call her Shirley.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Shirley?

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, she could have like a code name, I guess.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Shirley.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
She could have been at Comic-Con and you wouldn't have known,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
because she'd be dressed up in some sort of...

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Harmon fan.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Yeah, she could have been at Mr. Meeseeks.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
She could have been at Meeseeks.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Yeah.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
She could have looked like anything Dan would have recognized.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
He doesn't know what she looks like.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Yeah.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
You might have seen my girlfriend at Comic-Con.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
She was dressed like Harley Quinn.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Shit.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Less Harley Quinn's this year.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Are you celebrating or demanding?

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
Just trying to offer up a subject.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Did you see the Harley Quinn trailer?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
No.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
The Harley Quinn show?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
There's a Harley Quinn animated show and she's like,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
shit, fuck that, Batman.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Shit.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Oh, shit, fuck.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
What the fuck's going on?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Shit.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
That's not your mom's Harley Quinn.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
It's weird, because it looks like all the other DC animated shows,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
but it's just like this...

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
Here's what makes this one different.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
She's just like, what the shit?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Fuck.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
And the Joker's like, wow, wow, wow, wow.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Joke me this.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
And she's like, fuck, fuck.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
There's something to be said for your mom's Harley Quinn, you know?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
I like the idea.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
What's also kind of funny about it though is I have this sneaking suspicion,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
because I watched the trailer only once,

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
but I'm like, Batman's not joining in on this game.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
So I imagine that they're like, look, Harley Quinn's kind of like Deadpool

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
or whatever.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You can go crazy with her.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
But she's surrounded by all these icons of the DC universe,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
drawn in that same style.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
But she's the only one.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
So one of them's just like, oh, fiddle sticks.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And she's like, fuckin' ain't right about that.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Shit, shit on a dick and pussy.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
We got a Joker.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Let's fuckin' kill Batman.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Ah, no sweat in my pet.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
She sounds like Harley Quinn.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Harley, Harley Quinn.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Harley, Harley, Harley Quinn.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm having a stroke and nobody's helping.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
Nobody is a Harley, Harley, Harley Quinn.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Rest in peace, Brandon Johnson.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
He died as he lives.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Hit him in the solar plexus.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
Committing to poorly fleshed out bits.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
He's like side armor.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Oh no.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Just sleep, sleep, sleep.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Go gentle into that good night.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Shit, he was the only guy I knew up here.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Spencer, have you ever cosplayed?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Have you ever gone out into the cosplay universe?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
No, I got, I got, this is like not,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
this is not a cool belief these days

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
because you're supposed to be, I don't know.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
I don't even want to label it.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
But I think that cosplays look really good

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
when you look something like the character.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Obviously anyone can be any character all the time.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
But like, I've always wanted to like,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
you know, find someone I look like

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
and I don't look like very much at anything.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Who would you go if you had to like,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
get styled as a cosplay character?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
You could, you know, whatever you wanted,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
look exactly like that person.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Who would it be?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
There's this guy's husband in an anime

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
that I look kind of like.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
He's like just this big fat guy.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
He's like, he's like giant.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
But you're not, you're not fat.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
You're skinny.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
But he's just like a big giant guy.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Okay.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
And if like,

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Spencer's anime fat.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, I'm anime guy,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
woman's husband fat for sure.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
What's the name of this character?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
I can't remember his name.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
He's generally called husband.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
The woman's called teacher.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
How much he's her husband?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
How much recognition do you think

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
that would get on the comic con floor?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
But people would be like,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I did not.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
But it's very generic.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
The costume.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
So like, I don't think,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
I think they just think I was a big fat guy.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But if they like, it's a,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
it's a if you nailed probably anime.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
If you nailed it to perfection.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Do you think someone go?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Oh fuck, you're the husband from the thing.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
I hope so.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Yeah, I would I would like to see you

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
gain a little of your weight back,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
shave your beard, cut your hair,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
and be the plump guy from

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
the original lion Voltron.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
And right and leave.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
You can be like the kid that like glasses one or whatever.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah, the green one with the glasses.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
I like that.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
You know these days you could go as fat Thor.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
It's great.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Not you like me.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
It's like anyone could be fat Thor now.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
It's a great cosplay for people who want to look like

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
their their characters.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Your Thor.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Yeah, I could barely sit down.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
It's for my favorite jokes.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Oh, okay.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
I got it.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I got there.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Hardly Quinn.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Hardly Quinn.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
He's back.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
Oh, Grandpa.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Oh, Grandpa.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
He survived.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Just, just died.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Put sugar in my coffee.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
We're going to make Hardly Quinn work.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Hardly.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Dan.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Cosplay.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Cosplay goal.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Like really knock it out of the park.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
You can walk down the main drag of the comic con and people

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
would freak the fuck out and take photos with you.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
Or you could just be like a real deep track that only a couple

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
people like were hip to.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Well, I can't go as Zizek.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
But like the what's his name?

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Don't know what that is.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
He's a philosopher guy.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
He's just a guy that looks so much like me that people are

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
just it wouldn't even.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
They'd be like, well, you wear a white t-shirt and it's got a

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
stain on it.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
Like it's the stains on a different spot.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
You Google them.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
You told a great story.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
The night we were walking from the boat back to the hotel,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
you're telling Adam.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
You reminded Adam divine how you first met them.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Oh, yeah.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I've told that story at least twice.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
How the the workaholics guys got got not really me,

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
but another guy.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Yeah.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
The fast forward version.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
There was a guy that was at this at this party and he kept

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
asking me questions about New Zealand.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
And I was like, I've I kept going like, no, I don't know.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
I'm not sure.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
And then it culminated me going, I've never been to New Zealand.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
So I don't know.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
He's like, OK, real funny.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
You've been to New Zealand.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And I'm like, no, I haven't.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
And he got you get this look on his face that just melted into

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
humiliation and rage and like all kinds of things.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
And he pointed a thrust his finger over to where the

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
workaholics guys were all standing and giggling and said,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
those guys told me you were Peter Jackson.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
But I kind of got two thirds of the workaholics back this

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Comic Con on accident because Justin and I somehow led

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
everybody over to the Hilton under the auspices of like,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
hey, everyone's going to the Hilton other we got to the

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Hilton and it was like, everybody's going to the Hilton

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
other we got to the Hilton and it was like, everyone with a

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
room here because we're going to bed.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I didn't mean to get him back and it certainly wasn't as art

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
to get another boat with the Game of Thrones people like no

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Game of Thrones people this year.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Farscape, right?

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Yeah, we talked about this last week, I believe.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
I was I was too busy.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Let's do it again.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I was being a water jug and not being on stage last week.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
That was fun.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
You remember when you put the hat on it?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Oh, yeah.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
God damn, Jeff.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Let's grow up.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
What?

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
I just I'm a I'm a delicate artist.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
I think that episode that people that don't subscribe to it

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
will be lost to time.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
But if you if you saw what I did with just found objects.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
Brandon, how's it going in the Rick and Morty Raiders room

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
in your opinion?

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
Every Jeff's coming to kill Dan.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
Oh, wait, come on.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
That is hilarious.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
Holding a thing is so I'm sad for you is hilarious.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
How is how is Rick and Morty?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Sorry.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
Every day is amazing.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Amazing.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
It's a great group.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm proud of that.

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
I don't even demoralize anybody that I'm like I'm like the I'm

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
like Beatle Bailey on my own army.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
I might come in and go.

41:13.000 --> 41:19.000
We really have to stop talking about goofy shit and work now.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
I mean, I don't think you're never going to meet Mr. A and W.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
You know that motherfucker does not know he's drinking out of the bottle.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Oh God.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
You have to have an intervention for Jeff.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
He's a he's a focus addict.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
He can't get enough focus.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
I think these are high concept bits.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
He's he's going to he's going to die of focus inhalation.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
Every plant got to get water.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
His species of plant is only viable upstage.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Yeah, where everyone has to turn their head.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
All right, what?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Why is the audience reacting differently?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I was literally moving a centimeter a second to try to steal some.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
And then the whole plan it took me like 20 minutes and then it was gone.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
Is there any correlation between albinism albinisticness and alcohol tolerance?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Well, I don't know.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
All I know is that some people say they're functioning alcoholics.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
I'd like to say that I'm a thriving alcoholic.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Is that a goddamn bottle of water?

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
It's a bottle of club.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
That's my concept shit.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I agree.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Who knows what'll be the next escalation if God wanted me to drink water.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
He wouldn't have made my body 80 percent of it.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
You see your your own mixer.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
You're like your own shaker.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
All you have to do is do a couple of butterflies and you're mixing your own

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
average. Dan put the or the Jeff put the drink on a art.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
You provoke him Dan.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
You provoked him.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
What do you call this instrument?

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
He put it on a wardrobe a shipper.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Yes, a Davenport.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
It's a yes.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Let's stop.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Let's stop doing the podcast.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
No.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
No.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Come on.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Hardly Quinn.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Come on.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Puletition was amazing.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
So amazing that it didn't even it was like at the high water mark.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Yeah.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
I made it from.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I was like poor Brandon.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
The sound system was like reverbing.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
Someone said pool dietitian and he's repeat repeating it wrong.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
And you're like you're bringing us up to a new level.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Puletition.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
It was good.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
I mean, you know, corn and cheese are my specialty.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
It was it was no hard.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It was no hardly Quinn.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Well, don't you're trying to sabotage them because you're jealous.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Where's the but you didn't you ended your bit right behind you on the thing.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Do you want me to get it Easter?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Oh, you got it.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
I'd go but I'd knock everything over.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
So where is that Easter?

43:53.000 --> 44:03.000
Milwaukee.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
That's when you're in a family unit where it's like, you know, the after school

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
specials, they pour the bottles down the sink triumphantly.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
That's sometimes it's a little more complicated that you go to the sink.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You're like, well, goddamn, we're not alcoholics.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
We should store this somewhere where we can have it.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Just in case we change our mind.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
He's the one with the problem.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm putting this in the backseat of my car.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
A few Mason jars.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Mom's not going to do any cherry jelly this year.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Just throw them in the back.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
We're a proud tribe, Milwaukeeans.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
You would like it there, I believe.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
I love the Midwest, especially in the winter.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Why?

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Because it's cold and dark.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Oh, OK.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
I'm fine with both of those things.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
I didn't know it was dark.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Oh, yeah.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
I was here.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
I was at the NPR radio lab is there.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
They're doing this multi-part series about the history of people studying

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
intelligence and all the problems that's caused throughout history.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
And talking about the eugenics craze that...

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Being very soft on eugenics, I feel.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Spencer was tweeting about this recently.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
It's not really upsetting.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Soft on eugenics?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Yeah, these past two episodes, they're like,

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
there's this crazy guy talking about this cool new science.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
They call it eugenics.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Are we talking about the same thing?

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Yeah, yeah.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
The G series?

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Yeah.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
The last two episodes, they've brought up.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
They've been like really diving in deaths.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
Oh, this guy invented it.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
He's a Nazi.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Like they're not talking about that.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
Like it's that the distinct links to Nazism.

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
Like both of those episodes, like Jad was like, these are Nazis.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Right.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Like an aside.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
But that's all the time they spent on it.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
It's like, no, that's the whole that all it is is these are Nazis.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
You say that once.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
It may be.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
I don't want to certainly don't want to be the devil's advocate in this

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
conversation.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
But yeah.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Do it.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Do it.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Because it's literally the devil I'm advocating for.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Sure.

45:53.000 --> 46:05.000
But I got the impression that they might have been more being more cautious than

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
they needed to be of Godwin's law kind of thing.

46:09.000 --> 46:18.000
So if we say Nazi Hitler shit every single time we evoke eugenics, like we're going to

46:18.000 --> 46:22.000
miss an opportunity to provoke thought about the root of this shit.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
But the root of it is Nazis.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
Well, but the part of their point is that the root of it isn't.

46:28.000 --> 46:34.000
And I hate to put this fucking arrow in the worst people in the world's quiver, but eugenics

46:34.000 --> 46:40.000
was a craze in America, like, like, like, yeah, like swept through us like right around

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
the.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
The reconstruction picked it up and then the Holocaust happened that like that's a very

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
important dot to connect for America or is it or is it so hot button that that people

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
stop listening and that that might otherwise actually think about.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Well, what are those problems?

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
The radio lab.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
No, I just I really made me uncomfortable because it's like you can you can have a bit

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
more context, like very interesting stuff they're discussing.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
But like at the end of the recent one, they're like, you know, some countries might say it's

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
fine to do eugenic birthing standards.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
And if you don't like that, doesn't that make you the real racist?

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
And then like he literally said that.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Whoa.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Okay.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
I didn't hear that one.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
You're imperialist racist in that context or something like that.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Yeah.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
It's really interesting stuff.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Don't get me wrong.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Well, yeah, I will.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
I'd rather have my needle as sensitive as yours.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
I'm afraid of mine getting number.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
I've achieved like a sort of fetish now for non divisiveness, which is another way of

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
like I listened to these guys, the guys that host stuff they don't want you to know.

47:48.000 --> 47:58.000
And I particularly fetishized their crazy like almost obsessive and highly skilled ability

47:58.000 --> 48:07.000
to go into areas that that traditionally are just like if your decision is to be non divisive

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
then you wouldn't bother to talk about any of this stuff in this area but because they're

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
a conspiracy theory kind of podcast, they constantly have to go into these areas.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
But they clearly like pride themselves and have said as much at a certain point after

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
I noticed it.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
And then they said it at one point I was like, oh, okay, so this is I wasn't hallucinating

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
this.

48:26.000 --> 48:34.000
You guys are like, they look at humanity's political frailties, good, bad, dark light as

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
like a souffle that they're not going to collapse by stomping around it.

48:37.000 --> 48:46.000
And they kind of like they have a gift for language that doesn't presuppose particularly

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
anything as they explain things like MK ultra and and all this stuff that you'd think would

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
be festooned with laser lines and stuff.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
And I don't want to be that person or rather I could never be that person.

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
So like I wouldn't I don't think the good version of me makes that a goal.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.000
But I at the same time I listen to these guys on the way to work now, and they kind of they

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
kind of bring me this Taoistic piece because they're so smart and they're so interested

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
in such fringe shit.

49:14.000 --> 49:20.000
And yet they clearly not because they're secretly on the side of the scum of the earth and don't

49:20.000 --> 49:26.000
want to lose those ratings but because they have some academic belief that proper like

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
exploration of stuff shouldn't necessarily ruffle anyone's feathers.

49:31.000 --> 49:38.000
And that they're just they just want to state things in some weird Jedi way that like doesn't

49:38.000 --> 49:44.000
necessarily like like like say Nixon was a bad person even like they they just kind of

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
like it's it's it's it's that's my kick right now.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
It's probably a dangerous kick.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
I should be.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
Yeah, I think not wanting to offend people that are Nazis is part of like why we're in

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
the problem we're having.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
You know, I don't think that's necessarily bad for conspiracy theorists.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
But there is this part of it all though that you do get to take a break.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Sure.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Yeah, like you don't have to be engaging in this bad.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
There are times I think where you can objectively just watch something just to tune the fuck

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
out for a second because it's been pretty.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
I think we all can agree that it's been like an onslaught for two years.

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
So I think you more than two years but like three.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
I said more.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.000
I like delivery in that shit someone three.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah, so I do think I do think you can watch something it be Nazi heavy and just be like

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
for a second I kind of just want to watch this thing.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.000
You know by contrast our nation's president executing like the absolute like divisive fucking

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
sword like the only thing that I'm taking in from the news and it should be noted that

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
I'm trying to actively avoid news so the shit that gets to me is fucking gravity fed and

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
it's coming through tons of gravel and like like like it's it's it seems uncanny to me

50:58.000 --> 51:06.000
that he is absolutely I I agree with what's his fuck.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
Newt Gingrich is observation that I read about.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I know you're brisk like you agree with Newt Gingrich.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
I agree with Newt Gingrich is observation that what Trump is doing right now strategically

51:16.000 --> 51:25.000
absolutely has to attempt to define everyone left of fascist as anarchist as socialist.

51:25.000 --> 51:32.000
He's he's he's he's looking at the numbers and he's going like I need to double down on

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
all of the race talk and all of the immigration talk good for the base but also what I need

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
to generally do to people out there who are dangerously trying to walk the tightrope.

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
He's basically looking at them as people who are trying to win some kind of like balance

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
game because there's Zen and he's shouting in their ear like so you're socialist so you're socialist

51:55.000 --> 52:01.000
like and trying to remove from their heads like he's trying to he wants the next election

52:01.000 --> 52:07.000
to be about oh boy there's just really boy I would hate to have my home taken away by

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
people of color so I mean I'm not that democratic.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
I thought about that with a reverse trajectory and I was thinking about yeah for a while

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
there wasn't there a little bit of a push to like wake people of color up to the fact that

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
Democrats had never actually had their back you know that cynical kind of thing where

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
where there was like that push ago like hey would you know look these people have never

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
taken care of you and all that stuff and that feels like that has been jettisoned because

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
the numbers just never turned around so now he's like he's condensing all of his strategy

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
on this idea of like he wants you to think that in the game of Coke versus Pepsi that

52:45.000 --> 52:53.000
Pepsi definitively means Alexandria Cortez gets all of your pants like whether you want

52:53.000 --> 52:59.000
he needs you to be thinking about that like the same way that you pound home like butter

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
emails you know Benghazi and all that stuff you just pound home that stuff's not all for

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
the hillbillies that stuff is to try to like scramble the signal of people who might otherwise

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
be tempted to eat a sandwich take a breath and vote their conscience to convince them

53:15.000 --> 53:23.000
that they're in a war between like crazy and what I had yesterday.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
I do I totally agree with Spencer and that people should like be vigilant but I also

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
am getting to the point where I understand that people probably are suffering some fatigue.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
But that's why I mean that's why I understand what you're saying is like not the time to

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
fetishizing centrism well I just think it's like really important context in a world where

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
there are white nationalists who are pointing to what they call science to justify their

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
race science and it's like it's an impressive analog that that's what we did for manifest

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
destiny that's how we justified the westward expansion and the trail of tears that followed

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
and then like that like Nazis literally looked at that and they're like well we're more

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
white than you so you must be on to something and like it is this very trackable thing that

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
started in America it's back in America arguably never left America and they're just leaving

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
that out in in a perfect contents to bring that up because a big part of their unit is

54:13.000 --> 54:19.000
it is problematic what these what these IQ generalities are doing and they do a great

54:19.000 --> 54:24.000
job of expressing like the people like for instance the black people can't get their IQ

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
test in the public school system because of this court case which is just this weird thing

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
because the IQ test was used to put black people in special ed when they didn't deserve

54:34.000 --> 54:39.000
it and like so they do a good job of talking about the bad elements and even when they're

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
talking about these last two episodes they were it's just like to me it's like it seems

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
doubly important to explain like the historical context of where it's developed and they did

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
that just a tiny tiny bit and I would just like to see you know yeah I could definitely

54:52.000 --> 54:58.000
understand I could picture them sitting in a room right exactly that's what piss me off do we do we connect this to today

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
overtly or do we or do we put one spark plug next to another I don't know how spark plugs work

55:04.000 --> 55:11.000
I don't think they're supposed to clearly they'd probably make it a wire if they wanted to connect

55:11.000 --> 55:18.000
them it looks cool do we put one diode next to another and like hope that and let the

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
listener like form you know I'm sure that's what they're banking on as an editor as a

55:24.000 --> 55:30.000
storyteller as a producer I would make an argument yeah I would it's like oh man are we

55:30.000 --> 55:38.000
gonna like we have this weird self-shaming instinct if you're at all left of anything

55:38.000 --> 55:44.000
you kind of tend to come equipped with this like self-policing and only exploitable thing where

55:44.000 --> 55:50.000
you're like oh was I getting too political oh did I accidentally like soapbox today like the other side

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
exactly doesn't have that self-policing instinct but they should continue to not have it that's what makes

55:56.000 --> 56:04.000
it the other side and we should continue to have it it I don't know man it's like you research like the

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
the back in my day when I was a kid and it was like when I wasn't participating in any of this shit but

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
there was this whole push of like the they used essentially the same trick on an atomic level

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
which was like accusing the left of controlling the media accusing the media of having a liberal bias

56:21.000 --> 56:29.000
and people who go into journalism are number one typically probably in their personal lives probably

56:29.000 --> 56:35.000
big fans of freedom of speech probably big fans of approaching things practically probably big fans

56:35.000 --> 56:41.000
of like like society but did generally you know as much as they would deny it and not want it to be a

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
thing it's probably true that if you major in journalism in college there's an increased chance of your

56:46.000 --> 56:52.000
personal politics being liberal however it like you use also an increased chance of you having a

56:52.000 --> 56:58.000
fucking huge power to like put that aside probably too much so and it was exploited throughout our

56:58.000 --> 57:04.000
history the right has that strategy they they drill down on it they know that they can accuse the

57:04.000 --> 57:10.000
left of being unfair and the left will hear the word unfair and just freeze like a rabbit and then

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
they'll just do whatever they want like while everyone's frozen because it's like you just call

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
time out in the game of duck duck goose and then you just say you're a goose I don't know that's not

57:19.000 --> 57:29.000
right politics quarters over but but yeah I don't know what to talk about so I hear you got any

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
anal warts doesn't I don't have anal warts sorry Spencer what are you let's talk about anal warts

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
no no no doesn't Joel McHale own a steakhouse I was gonna ask that yeah he does in downtown with

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
the Russo brothers with the Russo brothers yeah what's the deal with that you should eat at a steakhouse

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
look the Russo brothers are clearly sending me a message message received I'm sorry that I wasn't

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
more respectful I should have taken some though they they they tease the shit out of all those

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
comic-con fans with that that Troy and Abed clip huh that really when I saw that people are like

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
community movie and when I saw the actual clip I was like that's not what that portends you're just

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
no you're just believing what you want to be there it was good clickbait and then I was right but

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
I'm always right because I'm a genius and no one can make me not smart but I used to have to say it

58:17.000 --> 58:21.000
when it was like what about the community movie thank you I would be like oh Justin Lin will get the

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
community movie made because he's got this huge deal and he's like the fast furious guy I mean now

58:25.000 --> 58:32.000
it's like whoa that's good the Russo brothers being bored and successful is the greatest thing that

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
can happen for a potential community movie is there any theme to the is his name on it is he like

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
Mike Dicka in Chicago where he has yeah Joel McHale sweet steak no it's I don't know they have a

58:43.000 --> 58:53.000

59:40.000 --> 59:48.000
them it is a fantastic place like so over the top like I the steak knives look like throwing knives

59:48.000 --> 59:55.000
they're made of one piece of metal yeah and I was like I thought I was just an integral handle or

59:55.000 --> 01:00:04.000
a thruching I've been watching a lot of fortune for your fire yeah this blade will key will key it

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:06.000

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
of hoarders hoarders gives me anxiety because I man yeah but a y'all better cry to shark tank like

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.000

bring their whole families on a shark tank and be like before I pitch you this thing that takes

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.000
tops off of cans I have battled leg cancer for 14 months and then fucking this was the

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
invention that they came up with when they were in the hospital they just offer and like they just

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:49.000
asking for 20 grand pass I but yeah look we could talk about reality TV for the rest of the night

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
just gotta tell you about these steak knives yeah yeah yeah believe me all I want to know is more

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
about the last thing I want to do is I'm gonna be telling you I've never eaten in a restaurant where

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the steak knives they're not serrated but so sharp that they're steak knives and I like took a picture

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
of it was were they etched or the Damascus where they were you got oh I don't know I don't know you

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
have to go there but there's nothing you can eat there huh no I'm gonna just look at the knives

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000
and they have on display there I'm gonna take a knife and bring my own ballistics dummy in there

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and do a fucking bunch of kill tests and because Mikhail knows the people there like I was caught

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I was like these knives are amazing and he's like oh they asked the people about him whatever

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:39.000
this fucking giant bicep the size of a watermelon 1051 steel what do you got the 260 but there I believe

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
they said the steak knives cost $6,000 each to make yeah they charge you if you take they call the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
police right if you put one in your purse and leave and yes I'm implying that only women steal

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:03.000
you're welcome because you know what Dan it's time to even those scales Dan that joke he just said

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
will kill your career but but they tell you absolutely if you I mean people are very tempted

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I always tempted I was like I want these fucking knives I was gonna I wanted to ask them about

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
it because I wanted to order them on Amazon or whatever foolish me these fuckers are custom

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.000
made by a dwarf in the volcanic planet of Hephaestia and they're I think they said their

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
six grand each which makes sense because they were like they're like so like do you have

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
problems with people they're I get the numbers mixed up because they might have also said

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
there's only 600 of them in existence yeah and I and that they're worth something else

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
but sometimes people steal them and they simply call the police and they get the knife back

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
because it's grand larceny I sell them like if you really want them I think they'll sell

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
you the song to you at like full price and then they'll only have 599 of them well yeah

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
wait would you you're acting like you know what that's what I read in like they you know

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
they they had like press and stuff you read about the places they eat I am a big food

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
lover guy this guy started doing a food Instagram and then I stopped because I got shame that

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I gained weight back but I'm gonna posting about it once I get well once the house is

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
furnished and ready like I I want to start throwing knives again I'm gonna be a knife

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
thrower again Dan I was I was being why don't you you got the money you got the space for

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
it for sure let's build a backyard forage and let's get on fucking forging fire for

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000
your weapons yes in the backyard I was for I like I'm pretty sure if you give me a fucking

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
cold forage I'll fucking lay it down right now I don't know man you got to keep that

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
heat up but you got to keep the heat right you got to keep it even you got to you got

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
to watch that quench because it'll warp on you and I'm gonna throw you in I'm gonna throw

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
you in there don't you ever water quench never water quench or you got to put it in the

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
oil what about the burn tang what is that they don't burning it through the wood that's

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
a bad idea never do a burn through I mean you can do that if you got loads of time but

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
not in a two hour round never works out because this round of fortune is over thank you damn

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
the guy's name is Will Willis and I love him and I want to fucking hug everybody on that

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
show can I tell you about the episode of hoarders we watched the other night on the

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
recommendation of a hoarders addict who for ten seasons it's like they texted somebody

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and they gave us the top four Hulu recommendations like number one was like this so much poop

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and pee being stored they store the poop in the pee yeah and I think I was like they

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
said do you have a problem with poop and pee I was like fuck no I've seen a million hoarders

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
where there's like oh there's poop on your thing who cares what sort of vessels do they

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
store the poop in the pee it's so bad I literally almost it's like I was gagging watching it

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
because it's like full blown but I just it's like they hoard the poop it was it was it was

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
it was a woman who had it's always there's always a tragic story to it and there was

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
a woman who had lived with her mom her mom when she moved in with her her mom was a hoarder

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
and her mom was kind of like it whatever I'm not going to like ran out of poop one time

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
there was a there was a she never forgot it there's always there's always a crazy there's

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000
always this crazy maker break where the person is he has to like they have to like it's

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
make or break like they're either willing to like they just they kind of like they'll

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
come they'll come up with some thing and like this woman was like because they kept saying

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
to her like you know you know there's poop and pee everywhere here and she's like yeah

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I know it's but and it's also it's like musty and they're like no musty is like a thing

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
you say when there's not poop and pee everywhere but it still smells was there like is it in

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
mason jars or what's going on it was like it was like these these water jugs it was like

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
it was like I guess just even exchange of like you get water from Albertsons and you drink

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
it and then you pee and poop and whatever's left of those just it was it was voluminous

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
it was crazy it was just like piles of these individual canisters but the they kept they

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
kept warning her they're like like like this is this is septic conditions and you can't

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
all this stuff and like usually you expect the person to be in denial about the danger

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
of the conditions and she was in denial about that and then they started the cleaning process

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000
and then after and then there was like the chiron that said four four days into the cleaning

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
process like whatever her name is she has a meeting with the people in the backyard and

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000
she goes like look guys like all I'm telling you is I get it you're cleaning out the whole

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
house everything's going to go and I'm just telling you like you keep throwing away all

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000
this food that I have because you're telling me like it probably has poop in it and I'm

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
just telling you I'm like I need to I need to eat something from that house she's the

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
poop and they were like saying to her like what are you saying that you're like a junkie

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and that you you need one final blaze of glory before the intervention like you want to eat

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
potentially contaminate and she was just sort of like saying yeah that's that's what it

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
is I want to eat food that might have shit in it like she was it was almost heroic like

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
that's not that's not that's not any hero I've ever worshiped well it is when you get to

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
the point where you're like you're like clinging to anything that you're willing to fucking

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000
like you just want a little nibble I find hoarders fascinating because she poops in the food

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
or the food no she's got shit everywhere and then there's people like you're like telling

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
her it seems like the latter seasons of hoarders what they've done now is they've they didn't

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
want to lose viewers who tune in for the bullying which I don't like I don't like watching people

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
come into a hoarders place and go like holy shit it's like what the fuck job did you

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000
sign up for you asshole like I I like that I like that like the people that are like

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
clinically trained and like they come in the door they go okay all right so what's going

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
on with the mouse skeletons you know like valuable to you yeah yeah no I got to keep

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
those otherwise you never know like and it's like these people are obviously in need of

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
help but if you want to help them I just I kind of fetishize that like I like to judge

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
the judges I I'm like but now what they've done in the latter seasons of hoarders now

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
they've broken it into this like ghost hunters kind of a story B story where like they'll

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
have extreme cleaning experts spend the night in the house and so they do night vision like

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Blair which stuff like there's a turd next to me holy shit I've never cleaned anything

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:30.000
this extreme this old lady's soul has been crushed but but they're like cutting back

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000
the people that I it's like I like I'm inspired by the idea that you know like I have I have

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:45.000
relations to that breed of dysfunction like I but for the grace of God you know have a

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000
place that you can see the floor in and I've been in places where it's like I just I'm

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
endlessly fascinated by the ways that you can be in pain and crazy and the different definitions

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and total compulsion that you can pull out of and how you pull those people out of it

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
and stuff and I like like and for me personally as a guy who is teased a lot for hygiene and

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
stuff like that I I find it tremendously I go to that I like going to that well and I've

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
really never met anybody that wanted to watch hoarders as much as I do so I just never get

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
to see it that much and I understand no one wanting to watch it but I am like I love that

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I love watching kind people who are like have degrees in the amount of pain you have to

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000
have in order to get this bad and who who and watching them like just just be chill about

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
it and try to reach the person and then watching the person confront their wall like I've

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I've watched a few and I couldn't really like keep going because I think I saw a few where

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:58.000
the person felt tortured by having the the the the clutter removed and it was like it

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
was hurtful for them because they're they're they're they're they're losing yeah a stack

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000
of newspapers are never going to look at covered in rat droppings but like the losing that

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
was like having something ripped out of them yeah it's it's really I mean I tell you know

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
it's it that's why it's riveting to me because the outcome isn't always the same it's like

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.000
it's it's sometimes it's like okay we got it you you shit and peed in your house so much

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
that it would cost more to clean it than to tear it down your worst nightmare has arrived

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
like we don't even want to like sort through it goodbye you're going to you're going to

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
live with your aunt Stephanie now I thought you were going to talk about poop mountain

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
the the hoarders of you don't the poop mountain that's that's why I started gagging that

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000
that's probably the episode I'm talking about no there's there was a toilet that had poop

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
up to there they were storing it they decided to stop flushing it they were storing it they

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
were story they just and I that's what I don't watch the show because I have a gag reflex

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
yeah and they were they they just left the poop in the toilet and they just kept growing

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
and it and there's a picture online just look up hoarders poop no that oh yeah I'm not that's

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
why I was sad when he brought it up what I literally is a horde of poop there's a cousin

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
of the show there's an episode of hoarders that I saw a long time ago where the prison had

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000
like cats in the basement and cages and and I was like oh the animal ones fucking me I

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
can't handle this but apparently there's a and I can't judge these people because what

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
do I like but like apparently there's a huge audience of people that are like more of the

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
animals and there's like a whole animal hoarders show or it's just like mainlining that drug

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000
like maybe who's who's dark like like like you know because because they're they're identifying

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
with the hoarder of all those I don't know I don't know and it's hard I'd be hard pressed

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
to tell you what I'm doing watching it you know how much of it is me punching down and

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000
how much of it is me you know because your old place like your old Wilcox place you weren't

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
a hoarder you were just messy and I was I was a fucked up enough guy that you know if the

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
neighbor had a plumbing problem I you know I remember the shame of somebody knocking on

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
my door and being like fuck well who's this like you know and like just calling through

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
the people because they can't come in here they're gonna call something they're gonna call

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
the city I remember like a plug they're gonna call Mountain Dew and Domino's peeps and say

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
this guy should be working for you I remember I remember like a plumber coming in because

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
someone in the neighboring apartment had something wrong with their plumbing and they needed to

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
come to my place and look at my pipes and I had like not actual shit but shit in the sink

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
like cardboard just garbage in the sink like the sink was just full of like just like not

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
even just dirty dishes but just like I wasn't even allowed to go in cardboard and shit like

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
in my sink and like I remember the sound of the plumber and just going what the fuck and

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000
it's like it's yeah it's like that's part of what's interesting to me is like well I kept

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000
doing it like I got the opposite direction now you have this this expansive well because

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
because because palace because whatever is wrong with me I'm graced with a circuit board

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000
that had an output port on it that that connects to a money machine and I think that's part

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
of it too is my guilt like why I'm fascinated with the neurodiverse community is because

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I feel a little guilty sometimes of like well why did I get a fucking just like scratch off ticket

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000
that's like when you when you're gross you you don't have to work for a living and everyone

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000
like one micron to the side of me or one lithium drip different from me is like I have to live

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
under a bridge and the police police are gonna shoot me like like and I'm like like yeah

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I'm kind of like you know I just like it's just morbid fascination I guess like I maybe

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I'm looking for maybe I want to know that they also make bad choices like all right yeah

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
but you you you you you yeah I don't know the bad choice was storing the poop definitely

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
it's like I don't think if I could if I could if I if I didn't get to a if I didn't if I

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000
didn't get to a level while I was knee deep in pizza boxes and and and and pantyhose

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.000
and fucking shit like because there was a room in your place that you weren't ashamed

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000
to let me or Rob into your apartment but I was not allowed to go into the bedroom because

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
that door was always closed. That's where the mannequin legs were and like yeah like

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
and Jeffrey Dahmer famously before he started eating people like saw a mannequin in a window

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000
then he then he like hid all night in a store so he could steal the mannequin because he

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
was like thinking to himself like if only if I had a mannequin maybe I won't have to hurt people

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and like it was like an open joke with you guys it was like this looks like a serial killer's

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
lair and I'm like yeah I'm always thinking about that stuff I'm like oh jeez what separates me

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000
on this family tree of of monsters and maybe that's why I'm you know into prison advocacy

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and stuff not that I do anything about it but I'm like how do we how do we treat our

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
worst people like that that documentary about the the pervert park or whatever where it's

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
like every single person in there was abused as a child another they got you know anyways

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
anyways but the the the for the by the grace of fucking chaos by the random throws of dice

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000
like my being knee deep in all this garbage and hating myself and being ready to like whatever

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000
like it resulted in me being able to get in a bigger apartment and then and then hire a housekeeper

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and so then I had a person coming over every week like you you get to a point where you can

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
afford to hire someone that comes over every week they do your laundry they wash your dishes

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000
they swiffer your floor like you're you're done you can be as much a pig as you want and

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
that's like it's like a video game where it's good when you get that upgrade and you're

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
fucking done like I'm not tested anymore about what kind of filth I would live in if it was

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:02.000
up to me to clean up after myself an opportunity what's that you are hoarding opportunity and

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
hoarding opportunity yes no this is not me trying to shame you because like you and I

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
spend a lot of time in hotels you know one that's ever not shamed anybody started a sentence

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:19.000
that way but JFK never famously came out to announce the space program I'm not trying to

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:30.000
shame the country however we should go to the moon JFK was Davros sound like Davros I was

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000
shaming your impression it was a good enough when I stayed hotel like I unpack my suitcase

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000
and when I leave I clean the hotel almost completely before I leave but I've seen you

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
check into hotel and instantly there's just debris everywhere like your suitcase explodes

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000
into a cataclysm of underpants and socks and shoes and like I don't know if you're going

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
back to when me and McGathey were together or if that's because I am solo like that but me

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.000
and McGathey were like the key key master and gatekeeper of we would just somehow just we

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:15.000
both were like I remember we would check into a hotel in Scotland and we just got there and

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I would knock on your door and I come in and there was just there was not a single bit of

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
floor that was not covered in suitcase material like whatever you had packed it was just everywhere

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
like I don't know how you like how yeah how you got there that quickly it looked like yeah

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
you were sitting Nancy but just in a hurry yeah just sitting Nancy but in a hurry I mean

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I for my yeah it's like what I when you're alone in a hotel I mean do you like if you

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000
ever check into a hotel alone is it same way if I'm in a hotel alone I throw my duffel bag

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.000
down if you know I'm like like I'm on a I'm on a journey into darkness if I'm alone like

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000
so so I'll put I'm actually ironically probably a lot cleaner because I'll just put the bag

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000
down and I there's been trips where I'm like I oh three days in New York time to head back

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.000
to LA oh I guess I never unzipped this bag just kind of just wore the same just just flying

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.000
home with my that's how I got shingles pretty sure just like didn't didn't sleep that much

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
never like the bedspreads perfectly clean you could bounce a quarter off it because I slept

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:34.000
half on the floor with my head wedged behind the alarm clock I like New York there's a

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:42.000
drawing room on every corner yeah I could live in hotel I love the idea that if I'm

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
staying in a hotel for three days say I will put the do not disturb on the whole time because

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I don't really make that much of a mess I don't need new towels every moment like I could

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
use the same towel for three days and it'll be alright I can sleep in the same bed I'm

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000
the same way yeah but I do like the idea that if you're in the event that I've ever had

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000
to stay at a hotel for like a couple weeks the idea that you can take that do not disturb

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
thing off go out and have lunch and come back and you're in a brand new place I love that

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000

I leave them all over the place that there's your new hoarders episode it's like a big

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
rich monster exploded the best is Canada because the moment you get to Canada you

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
instantly have four pounds of coins in your pocket because they love metal money there

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
and I think the housekeepers there must just love it because he's like I fuck all this

about Spencer that's right I am a different gender

I'm on a Spencer vendor but I'm non-binary and I can sound like a canary and be a man

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
or a lady or something in between and greeting oh and I should be allowed to fight in the

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:21.000
arm services because I'm probably a really good soldier if I'm capable of patriotism

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000
in a country that does nothing but judge me you should fucking let me polish your torpedo

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:36.000

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:45.000

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.000
up for checking in with Spencer everybody check in with Spencer check in with Spencer

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:01.000
is a cornucopia everybody wants to fucking work your pony up

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.000
you want to Harmon quest is uh we're gonna announce Harmon quest tomorrow yeah that's

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
a bit of insider info that's coming that's going live we're gonna announce that it's

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
going to be released eventually right yeah I think that'll be the announcement I don't

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
even know they told me I can't fucking yeah I think it's 9 a.m. Pacific tomorrow it's

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000
a really good season is eastern 12 yeah I know it's a great season I've seen the

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.000
animatics not not even all of them but it's like amazing like just the team you know it's

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
just a testament to when you get that rare opportunity to keep a team on board and the

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
same people have to do the same thing again and they get to improve in their own ways

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000
like and it's just the it's just streamlined and amazing yeah when I bumped into like when

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I go to star burns and I bumped into like Dominic or some of the animators and whatever

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
they're all just like they have a giant smile on their face which it doesn't seem like they're

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
going into the coal mines to go do a hard job they they're really happy about it that's

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
what makes me feel good is it generally does seem like people are excited about the show

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
they like the show and they like working on it like you know I've never really made a

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
show outside Harmon quest so I don't I don't know if that's normal or not normal but it

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:28.000
feels you know cool it's extraordinary my fiance although she was you know she she had

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
a show before but she was working with a partner so she just finished rapping her 10 episode

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
thing for quibi and it was remarkable going to the rap party and I've seen the same thing

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
with your leadership that people are just so grateful to have clarity and vision at the

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000
end you know Cody you'll sometimes say to me like well you've done this more than me what

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000
do you think and I'll go no we're not all I've done more than you is what you've done but

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000
so differently that we're not I don't have more experience than you anymore like like

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I've watched Cody confront certain situations politically creatively where it's like you're

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
in post and then somebody's like they've got notes and someone else's got notes and the

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
way that people handle things and stuff and like my only experience is in this sort of

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
like I don't know this kind of thing where I'm like like yeah you know I gotta nip that

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
in the bud I'm gonna have to tell Ralph that he's not allowed to be in the edit bay anymore

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
this is this very like like cut and dry like you know not to be too hyperbolic but there's

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000
almost mafioso kind of thing where it's like we're at war and this is an army the war is

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
with lack of entertainment and we're an army and I'm the general it's not I've come to learn

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.000
all too late that it is that is not the right way to get things done there's way more like

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.000
being a hub of a wheel where you actually are dealing with more shit not less shit you're

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
not MacArthur at the top like someone can be turned into dust for questioning where you

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
park your tank it's like you're in the middle of it getting paid the most and so there's

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000
a bunch of people like worrying about shit and you radiate outward calm and leadership

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
and stuff like that I've seen Cody do it and seen you do it and see the difference in how

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
the production goes and it translates into dollars and cents being saved and you should

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
be very proud of yourself you're a great showrunner.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Thank you. It's a real skill it's not a it's something that just you're just good at it.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I was very lucky David our line producer is very good and also we have Dominic who Jeff mentioned

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000
he's like this big time guy from Simpsons and King of the Hill and stuff so we had a lot of great people.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I went out and like was doing like came over to Starbucks for a meeting or something like that

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000
or doing some other podcast thing and some of your I won't say employees but like some

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
of your you know your crew and like animators and directors and whatnot they they looked over

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
and they're like hey like it's the guy from the TV.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I forget her name I forget one of the animators she's like or maybe she's an editor but she's

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.000
like like Rosie I won't remember I'm sorry but I'm bad with names but she was like she looked

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
like she couldn't have been happier to be on the job on that thing and so that has to

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.000
that has to be a trickle down thing from the top of people like liking to show up for work

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
and being proud of what they're creating.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Yeah it's really cool this season we got who we got we got Matt Gorely we got Kate

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Makuchi we got Tony Newsome we got Reggie Watts we got Joel Kimbooster we got Jared Logan

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:48.000
we got Darcy Cardin we got Jess McKenna we got Carl Tartt and we got Tom Kenny and they

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
all really nail it.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Jess McKenna's episode was she the one that did like the legal thing?

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Yeah it was like a legal thing.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Yeah I mean without doing a spoiler I don't know how much I can spoil but there was a

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000
thing that I think was accidental that she happened there happened to be a legal like

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000
a courtroom scene and I don't think that that was by design right?

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
No we wanted to get Matt Gorely because he obviously did a great skeleton lawyer on Harmon

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Town right but he couldn't make it for that episode so we got Jess McKenna who was in

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
the big club.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
She apparently went to law school and it was one of the most good law school.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
She was like a mock courtroom champ in high school.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
It was devastating improv of like what the fuck like how did you?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It was a tour de force.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It really was like I just saw her recently and like that was outstanding.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
She's great her podcast is great holy shit.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Yeah it's a goody and then Tom Kenny of course is just a he's his own machine.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
He's I don't know it really feels like it escalates like towards the end and he really

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
he's screaming in the end of the episode and it's like man what a great way to finish

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
off this.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Have you seen his band Tom Kenny in the high seas?

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
No.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Has anybody?

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Yeah it's he sings like a soul singer like he's like Otis Redding or Sam Cook and he

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000
he has a giant band there's three women backup vocalists are great there's a bunch of horns

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000
they all have captain's hats on and he just screams for a living and never loses his voice

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
like he like SpongeBob doing soul music is very exciting.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
At the end of Hollywood's life Tom Kenny is going to be standing outside the gates as

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
the rest of it burns down behind him and he's going to be like I guess I won.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Yeah.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000
He's such an odd character on the chessboard of LA.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000
We were having dinner just ran into him and him and Jill Talley his wife was awesome also

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.000
and just like sitting next to them it's just like he has this ability to really make you

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000
happy and it doesn't seem like a put on he's just he just has childlike glee at all times.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
No he's definitely one of those guys that you'd have every opportunity to like second

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000
guess his glow and go like well that must come at the cost of being disingenuous somehow

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
or like you're so on I don't think he's ever been on this show has he?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
No.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:07.000
But you should bring Tom and Jill along and while I'm thinking of it Levy.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
He takes out his phone.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
If you're not too busy with your vampire girlfriend you can't take a photograph.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Andy kindler.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
We got the kindles back.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:24.000
We got the Andy kindler and Tom Kenny on in in in respect to some religion like are the

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
are the Gandalf and Saruman of.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Kindler so he's so he goes so dark God damn he's funny but anyways also we got we got Dave

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Foley he wants to be on the show too.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Yeah it's good to see him again.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I saw I saw Mark McKinney in San Diego and he was there with his fully adult son it's

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000
so weird to like look at like colleagues people the people that you admired when you were

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:55.000
a kid and then you're like McKinney and I are both the same puffiness we're the same age

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000
you know like we I I really like like hanging out with that guy and he's a delight and like

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I've I ran into him in San Diego and then and then went to see Tom Kenny at the farmers

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
market and Scott Thompson is walking Scott Thompson is sitting there with Dave Foley

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
over there.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I guess it's like the we did a show in Winnipeg with Foley and you know the who's live anyway

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
thing and that's where Kevin McDonald lives.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Kevin came to the show we brought him on stage and I sat in the green with him and I just

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
hugged him and he instantly just hugs you back.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
He's like he's everything you want out of Kevin McDonald.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
He's just a little love bug.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
It's really good.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
They all used to hate each other but they hated each other.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000
They're Canadian.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
They maybe like they didn't share a bus one time.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Well I think I think I think some of them got along with some of them hate each other.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Well they've lived of whatever like like they they they all definitely like each other.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
It's fun going down like being Atlanta with Dave Foley and he's sober now and he's been

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
sober for like I think like seven or eight years.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Oh yeah I was arrested there.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I passed out there was arrested like you get the Dave Foley kind of remembering where he

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
was been in the world before a tour.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
It's great.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Thank you sir.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That guy loves it.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:23.000
I will say it's like like Dave and Scott are like when you look at their faces I don't

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
know if Scott Thompson like drinks a lot but like that face app thing that was going around

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
where it's like all it does is just like you know it doesn't like those guys both they

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
just it's like okay clearly you're older put at the same time like it's not none of the

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
bad things it's simply just adding like lines of distinction.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000
But they still have a weird kind of childlike cherubic kind of thing going on.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
They're aging the way we all love.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
That's I think if that's not important also your body's not important.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I heard that app was the Russians.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Yeah shout out to all you people as I share my I'm like oh here's a pic of me or a video

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
of me diving into my pool.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Thank you so much everybody for your constructive criticism about my body from the people that

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000
think I skip leg day to the people that think that my legs are great and I need to work

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.000
on my upper body to the people that just want to say I look like a caramel apple.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
A ton of people just being like fucking awesome and just going like like like I don't want

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000
to say what you should say but what I would say to you if I was your if I was following

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
you and you were like here's me jumping in a pool and I had anything to say I'm pretty

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:44.000
sure I would either say hey you look fucking great like I love you or I'd shut the fuck

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
up.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I just think it's a but I think it's amazing like all the people that are like dude you

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
need to fucking work on your thighs and your legs so instead of like you click on every

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
single one of their names not that I've done this.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Always a locked account always because they're so proud of physical like like like beauty

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
and they're so focused on it that they love their life and they can't wait to celebrate

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
the shape of their body and they just that's why they have a locked account and they just

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000
go and comment on other people's pages your legs are too skinny.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You know what every bit of carbon dioxide that you exhale turns into fucking oxygen

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.000
through me I'm a plant apparently or a drunk mammal that's running other things to say.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000
You actually might be a caramel apple.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I may be a caramel apple look I did notice it too I do look a little it's a little odd

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
I think it might be a little bit of field of view thing like I definitely like I'm I

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.000
think it's a combination of not dieting drinking whenever I want but still working out and

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
like lifting and stuff like that plus just like but surprisingly we were in the pool

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
playing pool sports where we took some of their dogs like tennis ball like little like

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000
chew toys and we were just pitching it around and your hand-eye coordination is

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
fantastic like you like you're like you got a baseball player's like mitt on your

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I don't know why playing catch is fun in a pool but if you try to do it on land it'd be

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
like fuck you bully.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
It's because you can fall.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
There's something really fun about it like throwing a ball back and forth.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Because if you miss it you get to go swim over to it it's exciting it's really good.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I'm so sunburned right now I'm just pink.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I like my upper my upper body is.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000
You got it.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Sorry Katelyn sorry too soon.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Not cool.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Katelyn you're saying 20 minutes and what happens to you do you just roast or what?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I get I'm pink right now from 10 minutes of my sunscreen wearing off.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Under the stage lights?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I actually got heat rash on my legs from reading Calvin and Hobbes as a kid in my bathroom.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I didn't realize that there was a heat lamp above me and I was just reading it because

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
it was the only place I could get away from my family who I love.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And who are all albino.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Yeah just my brother's just yeah I realized that something was wrong when I could get heat

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I could get burned from that yeah put on sunscreen.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So it's not just UV light that gets you it's any kind of.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Every kind of everything sucks.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Convection radiation anything like that.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Yeah I'm not a fan.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Oh man did you did anybody happen to see the is your news algorithm the same as mine where

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
you get that Fox news story about the British girl that was snorkeling in Cuba?

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
No.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
No.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Click at your peril.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
It's fucking crazy.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
What happened?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
How's she doing?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
She lived.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000
There's just a photo of I've never it's like it's just a British girl who's fair skinned who

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
was down in Cuba and she swears she put on a million.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
She knew she was fair skin and put on all the sunscreen so it's like your instinct for victim

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
blaming like kicks in but it's like she's her parents are like I'm telling you I know teenagers

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.600
don't listen but I we we kept saying put on sunscreen and she kept doing it and she snorkeled

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.000
for an hour and like 30 degrees a goddamn horror show.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I've never I didn't know you just described my worst fears.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
It looks she said it felt she's she's getting on the plane to go back to England and she

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
said it felt like there were water balloons on my back because in fact there were water

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
balloons on her back.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000
You can't imagine it too extremely like like like like like whatever you could conjure

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000
in your head.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Imagine like we water balloons on a person's back.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
That's good.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Yeah.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Devil is alive.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
The devil is alive.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
The devil is alive.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
But I don't know.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I don't understand.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Like this poor girl.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.500
I mean bless her heart like she's viral because she did have bothered to do a Facebook post.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:42.000
You'd think like an adolescent girl would be inherently ashamed because something went

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.500
wrong with the way she looks or whatever and but she's like the reason she's viral and

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:54.200
it ends up on Fox News is because she was I felt like the the tone of her posts was like

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.000
she really wanted to make sure this didn't happen to anybody else.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.160
Like maybe we want to cry a little bit because she's been through enough like like and she's

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.000
just sort of like actually just really be careful because it's subtext.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
She is warming up and like there's no.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I want to follow up.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I want to know how she's doing.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I feel a kinship.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
She's okay.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
She's okay.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.720
I mean I mean she's she she may be permanently like whatever she's going to be permanently

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.000
anything that like she's healing.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Okay.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
But she's sorry.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Okay.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.120
What did you grow up with your hometown?

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.720
I was born here when I was eight.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.000
I moved to Northeast Washington right under Canada and by Idaho.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.360
So I was pretty happy because of the cloud cover or well we I mean we grew up like it

01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.560
was 92 when we moved so we had those big earthquakes and my parents were kind of like we grew up

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:38.560
here and fuck it.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560
Right.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.600
So like everybody else moved up there.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.080
So pool parties the beach was always out of the question for you.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.600
I would just bring my umbrella.

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:49.360
I like to go outside as long as I'm not in directs and I'll do like 10 minutes with a

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.720
hundred proof on and lay out there and be like yes.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.560
How far from the gorge were you?

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.960
I was four hours from the gorge.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.960
Great shows.

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.960
Yeah.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.960
Amazing.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.400
Great shows of the gorge but I loved it up there because winters were about six months

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.760
and it was dark at 4 p.m. and everybody else was sad for some reason which I don't understand.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.760
And it was great and it was a great place to be a goth.

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:16.480
I can't wear velvet in L.A. There's no way because he can't tell me about it baby.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480
I wear suits.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:20.680
I have 17 suits that don't if ever get out of the closet because it's too hot.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:21.680
I'm very similar.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:25.240
I have a closet full of them and yes I have to wait till I travel and I'm like yes.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.240
Right.

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.240
Oh I'm going to Sweden.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.240
I can bring all my cool shit.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.240
Yeah.

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:30.240
Kaelin always amazing suits.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240
Amazing suits.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.720
How do you guys know each other?

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.720
The suit star.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.080
My wife and him go way back.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.960
She knows a bunch of people and she's like I punched above my weight and we came here

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:45.960
for the first time and Brandon comes out he was comfortable and when you were sick with

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.960
your throat.

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.960
Uh huh.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.960
And she's like hi Brandon.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.960
I'm like what the fuck.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:50.960
What are you doing?

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:51.960
How do you know him?

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.920
And then I'm not jealous or anything because if they were lovers once I'd be fine with

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920
it.

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920
Wow.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:57.920
Were you?

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.600
And you don't have to wait my cuck.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:06.040
I find that I'm so kidding but your wife is so wonderful.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.040
It's that would be my favorite.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.440
She's not here right now.

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:12.160
You can say what you want.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.160
I love her.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.160
She's great.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.160
That's what I'm going to say.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:19.400
We worked on a show together called taxi cab confessions and it was a nightmare and we

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.840
were in South Padre and we were drivers.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:23.360
So it was a you were drivers.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.480
I feel like she my wife and him not me.

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:26.480
Yeah.

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:32.200
I didn't drive because I was like I'm just like it's so they hire they're they're not

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.680
real cab drivers.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.280
No they're they're like TV personalities at the time they were like sort of MTV young

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.480
sort of hip like dudes.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.960
That was the HBO show where they just chirp about their lives.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.000
This one was like a sort of a bootleg version of that.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.080
This wasn't I think ours was for I think ours was for MTV but it could have been the HBO

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.080
one.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:02.400
We tried to do a sketch or VH1 sketch show that Channel 101 inspired it was like a taxi

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.240
boat confessions or something.

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.440
Were you were you part of that?

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.440
Did you shoot?

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440
No.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.240
It was just like it was such a waste of money because the joke didn't land but it was like

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.320
it's just funny this was like people getting into a boat to go across a lake and then the

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:20.560
boat's like and like and there's just a person going like yeah I'm going across the lake

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:26.200
to sleep with a married woman because they can't you can't hear him over the motorless

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:33.520
sorry I can't I said I'm engaged in adultery right now and so that's part of the joke and

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:39.560
then the other part of the joke is it's just a lake so you have no time to oh okay we're

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:45.800
here all right I'll take it you need to resurrect that it's fucking good there was really no

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:52.800
way to couch that sketch I thought it was such a funny idea any who that'd be good

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000
It's not the heat.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
You just dropped.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
We're an idiot.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
You're an idiot.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I'm a fucking idiot.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Miami Vice.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Philip Michael Thomas.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000
William H. Macy is the name of the game.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.000
I'm about to blow my brains out all over the frame.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Go sleep on the couch.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Go on the couch, you fucking pussy.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Yo, Happy New Year's Eve.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
VHS is coming around.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
It's going to change the video and the sound.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:47.000
It's making it more duplicatable and pornography is rateable by the consumer and not in the

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
theater.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Everything's rentable and no one's going to eat her for longer than two minutes because

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
you can fast forward.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Oh shit.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Oh no.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Brent Reynolds is going down.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
No story anymore.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Get in the limo.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
I just want to be an artist.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I want to be an artist and I have no control over my own artist.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Roll the girls getting pissed.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Going to stomp on a guy's face because he was a dick.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Everyone's doing drugs.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Everyone is doing drugs.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Everyone's doing drugs.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
You're an idiot.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
You're an idiot.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
You're an idiot.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
You're an idiot.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
You're an idiot.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I wish there was Jesse's girl.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Firecrackers.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Camera trucking.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Alfred Molina.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Oh shit.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I just had an epiphany.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Return threshold going back to my family.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Going to pull out my fake dick in the mirror.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Everything's going to be fine now.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Where the fuck is tea right here?

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Big dick.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Big dick.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Big dick.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Big dick at the end of the movie.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Boogie Nights.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
That's it.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Yeah.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Boogie Nights.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Boogie Nights.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Everybody needs to have a Boogie Nights.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Boogie Nights.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Everybody needs to have a Boogie Nights.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Boogie Nights.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Boogie Nights.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Everybody needs to have a fucking Boogie Nights.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Whatever happened to the Boogie Days, the Boogie Afternoons?

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
When you're out by now, you don't want to go out there, man.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I want to have a Boogie brunch, a Boogie breakfast, a Boogie lunch.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Make sure it's under the cabana, man.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I don't want to wait until the sun goes down to get my Boogie on.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
My Boogie wants to go around the whole day like the sun in the sky.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
To the Boogie Nights.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Whatever happened to the Asian kid throwing firecrackers around?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Is he all right?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Probably got a scholarship to MIT.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Oh, that's good news.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I was worried about him.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.000
There wasn't silver lining.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Okay.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
All right.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Hornhub is coming.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Hornhub is coming.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Oh, no.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Hornhub is coming.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Did your kid pee in my pool?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Dumb cheetah in the cowboy hat.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Doing the final rap.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Played by Brandon Johnson for no other reason.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Yeah, got you.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I've been a kid.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
High five in the stereo store.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Walking with a couple beddies.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Maybe two, three, or four.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Ooh, sweet.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I'm a cowboy.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Stereo store set to destroy.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Trying to get that loan.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
So multiple board stores I can't employ.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Nine boys coming up looking mean.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Motherfuck it.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
It's straight up boy history.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Dick's so hard.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
It's a mystery.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But not drunk watching makes fuck.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Cliff Hanger.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Thank you all for coming.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Almost got me.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Almost got me.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Give it up for Katelyn Chase, everybody.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Cheer up.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Steve Levy.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Brandon Johnson.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Spencer Crittenden.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Then I'm Jeff Davis.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Your mayor is Jen Harmon.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Thank you all.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Drive fast.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Take chances.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Did you get any of that?

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's a good show.
