{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:07.640\nThere we are. Welcome y'all to MacArthur Park, which is melting in the dark is always super\n\n00:07.640 --> 00:10.000\nmelting because it's hot as fuuuuck.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:14.000\nHarmontown is once again in session.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:19.000\nWhat is that?\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:25.000\nLet's bring out the Game Master Spencer Crittenden.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:33.000\nI'm gonna call a Comptroller Audible and bring out Brandon Johnson.\n\n00:33.000 --> 00:35.000\nBrandon to the stage.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:38.000\nOh shit.\n\n00:38.000 --> 00:40.000\nHe said to stop by.\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.000\nHe had to stop by.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:45.000\nWhat's up with these shoes and these shiny brown-\n\n00:45.000 --> 00:47.000\nWhat do you got? Broke?\n\n00:47.000 --> 00:50.000\nWalking that basket weave for y'all.\n\n00:50.000 --> 00:56.000\nWe got the cap toe basket weave so hot in the summertime my feet need to breathe.\n\n00:56.000 --> 00:58.000\nLet's bring out the Mayor of Hamilton.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.000\nDan Harmon\n\n01:00.000 --> 01:02.000\nYeah!\n\n01:02.000 --> 01:06.000\nI refer to your normal speaking voice.\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:08.000\nTip to the hop.\n\n01:08.000 --> 01:10.000\nOh, hip to the hop.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:13.000\nGot a big bunion on my sack.\n\n01:13.000 --> 01:16.000\nGot a hat on my cot.\n\n01:16.000 --> 01:18.000\nRented a cot for my hat.\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:21.000\nAnd a mop took the mop and put it in a bucket.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.000\nSaw your mama last night and said fuck it.\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:26.000\nAlright, boring.\n\n01:26.000 --> 01:28.000\nThank you.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:31.000\nHave you given up on freestyle Dan?\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:33.000\nOr have you just lost your...\n\n01:33.000 --> 01:36.000\nYou know, just happy.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:41.000\nI think a lot of rapping has to do with, you know, you've got something you need to say.\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:44.000\nI thought you were getting to a pretty good zone there.\n\n01:44.000 --> 01:47.000\nYeah. Yeah, that's great.\n\n01:47.000 --> 01:49.000\nI mean, you could hear the reaction.\n\n01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\nThey were overwhelmed.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\nIn general, it's a great podcast.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:57.000\nThere's a lot left to say.\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:03.000\nI could launch now and do one of many segments that would be totally relatable to the people.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.000\nThat people are just waiting to gobble up.\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:07.000\nI'm having some...\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.000\nI just saw some of the decorators proposals.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:16.000\nAnd, you know, I was a little disappointed to learn that they were photos of just concepts and not my actual house.\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.000\nYou know, stuff like that, stuff that you guys want to hear.\n\n02:18.000 --> 02:20.000\nBecause it's 2019.\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:26.000\nBecause right now you have a 17 bedroom, like Marques, like mansion going on.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\nAnd you have a one-air mattress and there's no chairs.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:33.000\nI'm truly the voice of the next generation.\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:41.000\nFrom my blanche whiteness to my six-figure-a-week income to my...\n\n02:41.000 --> 02:45.000\nHe makes $700,000 a week just for doing nothing.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:48.000\nTo my complaints about my numerous gardeners.\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:50.000\nTo my two houses.\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:55.000\nTo my eight years in podcasting.\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:57.000\nI mean, the list goes on and on.\n\n02:57.000 --> 03:02.000\nI found it a little bit excessive that you have 17 Lipizonner horses in your house now.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:09.000\nLook, you get into a zone where you're trying to chase that happy rabbit and you can't catch it anymore.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:13.000\nLipizonners are very cost-prohibitive.\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:20.000\nIs it at all possible that anyone else here has something to complain about?\n\n03:20.000 --> 03:27.000\nWho here in the crowd thinks they have the most righteous indignation complaint right now?\n\n03:27.000 --> 03:29.000\nThere's a hand went up over here in the corner.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:31.000\nWhat was that?\n\n03:31.000 --> 03:36.000\nOh, are you albino by any chance?\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:39.000\nOkay, would you like to come up?\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:41.000\nOkay, come on up.\n\n03:41.000 --> 03:43.000\nBring that albino up.\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\nWait, I haven't plugged in.\n\n03:45.000 --> 03:46.000\nPlace some albino music.\n\n03:46.000 --> 03:48.000\nThis is a guy with a resonant beef.\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:49.000\nI also hate the sun.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:53.000\nYou're a friend of the podcast, aren't you?\n\n03:53.000 --> 03:54.000\nWhat was your name again?\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:55.000\nWait, don't tell me.\n\n03:55.000 --> 03:56.000\nJax.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:57.000\nTurbo.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:58.000\nTurbo.\n\n03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\nScorpion.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.000\nKalen.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:02.000\nKalen.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:03.000\nKalen, yeah.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:04.000\nI knew it was cool.\n\n04:04.000 --> 04:05.000\nThank you.\n\n04:05.000 --> 04:06.000\nHow have you been?\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:08.000\nNot too bad.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:12.000\nThis heat wave, huh?\n\n04:12.000 --> 04:17.000\nWhen you were talking about beef, we're living in a world where people complain about a lot of things,\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.000\nand I get that, and everybody should have the right.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:24.000\nBut every day I wake up, and the center of our solar system is actively trying to murder me.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:28.000\nSo what is your physical interaction with albinism?\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\nHow do you say it?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.000\nSo I'm albinistic.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.000\nSo albinos have the pink eyes.\n\n04:34.000 --> 04:36.000\nThis is going to be kind of, you know, clipping.\n\n04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\nTriggering.\n\n04:37.000 --> 04:38.000\nYeah, it's going to piss some people off.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\nNow, albiners have the cliff note.\n\n04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\nThey have the pink eyes, and they can see well.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\nBut they look like pedophiles, and they're the ones who are freaks.\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:47.000\nCome on now.\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:48.000\nI'm under the radar.\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:51.000\nNo, look at all the movies when the pink eye ones.\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:55.000\nSo then I have the color in front of my eyes, but I have vision problems.\n\n04:55.000 --> 04:59.000\nI'm legally blind, and the same amount of sun-burning happens.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:05.000\nSo you're saying more human being, like blue eyes, not that pink eyes aren't human being,\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\nlike I was saying, like more...\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:10.000\nThis albino is racist.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:19.000\nYou're saying that having a more common color eye, you still have worse vision than a pink-eyed albino.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:23.000\nSo albinos, the albinos have 20-20 vision generally.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:24.000\nThey don't have any problems.\n\n05:24.000 --> 05:25.000\nThey have just pink eyes.\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:31.000\nAlbinistic people have vision problems, and they don't have the pink eyes.\n\n05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\nThey're two different things, but when everybody says, hey, you albino, I'm like, yep.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:39.000\nBecause I don't want to deal with the explanation.\n\n05:39.000 --> 05:42.000\nIs your tongue abnormally red by albinistic things?\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.000\nNope.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:44.000\nI just had a red vine.\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:45.000\nYou had a lovely cat.\n\n05:45.000 --> 05:46.000\nThere you are.\n\n05:46.000 --> 05:47.000\nI just had a red vine.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.000\nYou have a very shockingly red tongue right now.\n\n05:48.000 --> 05:50.000\nYeah, so I'm glad it's filming, because I just had a red vine.\n\n05:50.000 --> 05:51.000\nI was like, I'm not going to go up.\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:52.000\nI'm in the corner.\n\n05:52.000 --> 05:53.000\nWell, that tracks with...\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:57.000\nBecause our friend Victor Varnado has been our friend for ages.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.000\nIt occurs to me now that you're talking about this, that he has...\n\n06:01.000 --> 06:07.000\nGod, the language is a fucking minefield, because I want to say regular eyes, but...\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\nYeah, non-pink eyes.\n\n06:09.000 --> 06:16.000\nI don't think I've ever actually talked to a person with the pink eyes, but it's interesting.\n\n06:16.000 --> 06:21.000\nThat's so weird to learn that they have 20-20 vision.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:22.000\nYeah, they can drive.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:23.000\nSo are you legally blind?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:24.000\nLegally blind, yeah.\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:26.000\nAnd you're wearing contacts?\n\n06:26.000 --> 06:29.000\nI can't, because I have a stigmatism, so my eyes do this.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:32.000\nWhat is your field of vision right now?\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:35.000\nDo you have a blurry field of vision?\n\n06:35.000 --> 06:41.000\nSo what happens for me is, like, Brandon and I know each other, and so he wears great suits.\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:45.000\nSo he's come to a couple shows, and as long as I know what color his suit is, it's great.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\nOtherwise, I'll walk by him, and he'll think I'm racist.\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:50.000\nBut it's just I don't recognize him.\n\n06:50.000 --> 06:55.000\nIt's that you walk by and you go, get out of my way, nigger.\n\n06:55.000 --> 06:58.000\nI'm just doing a character in my show.\n\n06:58.000 --> 07:00.000\nOut of my way, brown eyes.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:02.000\nWait, what do you mean?\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:05.000\nYou have to know in advance what color suit he's wearing?\n\n07:05.000 --> 07:13.000\nSo for me, to kind of deal with the world, when you see the sign that says, like, Ash Avenue,\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:17.000\nyou got your A, you got your S and H, what I see is...\n\n07:17.000 --> 07:18.000\nI can spell.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:23.000\nI see a green triangle and two little green squares.\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:29.000\nAnd I make the shapes out before I see them, because I can see color differentiation really well,\n\n07:29.000 --> 07:31.000\nbut not anything else.\n\n07:31.000 --> 07:33.000\nSo you're allowed to have a driver's license?\n\n07:33.000 --> 07:34.000\nOh, no.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.000\nSo what is...\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:39.000\nI don't know how deep you've dug into the science of it, but the interesting thing to me is that we're talking about\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:45.000\npigmentation here, and so isn't it that the albino folk, the reason their eyes are pink,\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:50.000\nI assume, has something to do with an extension of this whole problem, which is like pigmentation.\n\n07:50.000 --> 07:51.000\nPigmentation, yeah.\n\n07:51.000 --> 07:57.000\nThe eyes are pigmented, quote, unquote, adequately.\n\n07:57.000 --> 08:00.000\nWhy is it that the eyes are less functional?\n\n08:00.000 --> 08:05.000\nSo my brother and sister are both freakishly also albinistic, which is pretty much impossible,\n\n08:05.000 --> 08:09.000\nand they would know better than me because they studied it.\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:12.000\nSo that's not a recessive or dominant trait in parents?\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:17.000\nNo, it is, but the fact that it happened to all three of us is a freaking nature.\n\n08:17.000 --> 08:20.000\nAccording to Gregor Mendel, it should be happening to like one of you.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:21.000\nYeah.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.000\nIf you have four kids.\n\n08:22.000 --> 08:23.000\nLike, he learned that with the peas.\n\n08:23.000 --> 08:25.000\nIt should have happened once and not again.\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.000\nMy mom and dad have a recessive gene.\n\n08:26.000 --> 08:27.000\nMy dad is Italian.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:28.000\nMy mom is Irish.\n\n08:28.000 --> 08:29.000\nShe's redhead.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nMy dad's a Swar the Italian.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:33.000\nThis is not supposed to happen.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:34.000\nMy brother's older.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:37.000\nIt happened three times, but they know a lot about the eyes.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:40.000\nThe milk man is albino.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.000\nI'm sure this joke gets told every fucking family reunion.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:44.000\nI'm sorry, but...\n\n08:44.000 --> 08:45.000\nYou know what?\n\n08:45.000 --> 08:46.000\nThat's weird.\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.000\nMy family has no sense of humor, I guess, because I thought they did, but that makes more sense\n\n08:49.000 --> 08:53.000\nthat one albino was just banging my mom three times.\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.000\nBut a lot of...\n\n08:55.000 --> 08:57.000\nTo cut you off, you have...\n\n08:57.000 --> 08:59.000\nYour hair is fantastic.\n\n08:59.000 --> 09:01.000\nLike, you have...\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:06.000\nA lot of people to pay a lot of money for is just this beautiful, like, silvery...\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:08.000\nI got 16 inches off last time I was here.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:09.000\n16 inches?\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:10.000\nYep.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:12.000\nYou donated to charity or something?\n\n09:12.000 --> 09:13.000\nAbsolutely not.\n\n09:13.000 --> 09:14.000\nI was so poor I had to sell it to the movies.\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.000\nShit.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:16.000\nTo the movies?\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:17.000\nI had to, yeah.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:23.000\nI would like to think, and I can't prove it, that the Targaryen chick is wearing mine.\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:25.000\nLet's just plant that seed.\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.000\nYou think Daenerys is wearing your hair?\n\n09:27.000 --> 09:28.000\nI hope so.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:34.000\nI'm pretty sure that it went to Hulk Hogan.\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:35.000\nDo you have any idea about...\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.000\nOr any of the Eagles.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:39.000\nWhy it is mythically...\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:45.000\nBecause when I see an albinistic person with albinistic features,\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:49.000\nI can't avoid thinking about the word angel,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.000\nwhich I'm sure is problematic to the albinistic community.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:56.000\nOur friend Victor has been cast as an angel many times.\n\n09:56.000 --> 10:00.000\nDo you have any idea about that?\n\n10:00.000 --> 10:05.000\nThe origin of why we portray angels as white-haired?\n\n10:05.000 --> 10:10.000\nWell, in the Bible, in Revelation, when Jesus comes back the first time in the very beginning,\n\n10:10.000 --> 10:14.000\nhe talks about his hair dressed in white, his feet like burnished bronze.\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:17.000\nHis whole like, you know, clothed in white, white, white, white thing.\n\n10:17.000 --> 10:21.000\nSo I guess when albiners were born, that's why, you know,\n\n10:21.000 --> 10:25.000\nthey're also getting cannibalized in Africa because they think they're magic as well.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:28.000\nWell, that's no way to treat magic.\n\n10:28.000 --> 10:29.000\nWell, no, no.\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:32.000\nIf you eat an albino thigh bone, you can raise the dead.\n\n10:32.000 --> 10:34.000\nIt's what they're thinking there.\n\n10:34.000 --> 10:36.000\nWell, that is true.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:38.000\nYeah, but I mean, is there a part of...\n\n10:38.000 --> 10:39.000\nIt is, right?\n\n10:39.000 --> 10:40.000\nIt's absolutely true.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.000\nWait, just the thigh bone?\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.000\nThat's an example.\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:50.000\nThey take trophies from albinos because there's actually more albinism in African genes than in white...\n\n10:50.000 --> 10:52.000\nYou mean after they die of natural causes?\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:53.000\nNo.\n\n10:53.000 --> 10:54.000\nOkay.\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:58.000\nBecause I would eat the part of the albino that magically created more albinos.\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:00.000\nIf I die, I'm going to do an organ donor thing that says,\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.000\nyou can have whatever you want for you.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.000\nI appreciate your work.\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.000\nAre there parts...\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.000\nSorry, this is morbid, but are there other...\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:12.000\nIs it just raising the dead?\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:14.000\nAre there any other...\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.000\nThere's all sorts of things.\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:22.000\nThese people are doing cocaine and weird African gunpowder drugs and making children soldiers.\n\n11:22.000 --> 11:25.000\nI'm not sure what they're doing there all around,\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:29.000\nbut they think that they get power from eating albinos.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nIf you're listening in Africa, we're sorry.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nI'm going to help one day.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:36.000\nI don't want to overstep my comptroller powers,\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:39.000\nbut I think there's only one way to prove this theory.\n\n11:39.000 --> 11:41.000\nYou want the winky?\n\n11:41.000 --> 11:43.000\nI want that thigh bone.\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:47.000\nWhy does this man insult me?\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:55.000\nDid you happen to hear the episode recently where we had a kind of a shockingly adept,\n\n11:55.000 --> 12:01.000\nself-effacingly, neophyte dermatological scientist up here?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:02.000\nNo.\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:11.000\nHe counseled me on my Polish skin tags that are out of control, and I got to go get them removed and stuff.\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.000\nI don't know. I was curious about that.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:19.000\nDo albinistic folk...\n\n12:19.000 --> 12:21.000\nI make them sound like Irish fairies.\n\n12:21.000 --> 12:23.000\nYou just say albinos for quickness.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:25.000\nI'm trying to be PC, and I'm just making everyone sound like a fairy.\n\n12:25.000 --> 12:27.000\nNo, this is the same space.\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:34.000\nWhat's the relationship between... You seem pretty young, so you probably wouldn't know.\n\n12:34.000 --> 12:39.000\nDo you get fucking shit growing off you like I do?\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:44.000\nI have little sunspots and stuff like that, and I don't go in the sun very often.\n\n12:44.000 --> 12:50.000\nYou were saying that the reason you have a right to complain is that you have a hate relationship with the sun.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:52.000\nIf there's a crack in the window, I wake up every day and go,\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:57.000\nfuck! There's a line of sunburn on my face.\n\n12:57.000 --> 12:59.000\nI can burn about 20 minutes.\n\n12:59.000 --> 13:05.000\nAnd it's incredibly dangerous, because it's like a cancer ray.\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:09.000\nDo you know numbers on that? Do you hear horror stories?\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:13.000\nIf I spent an hour and a half in the sun with nothing on, it would be lethal?\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.000\nI'm so good at avoiding it.\n\n13:15.000 --> 13:18.000\nI'm lucky enough to have a career where I can make my own hours,\n\n13:18.000 --> 13:23.000\nbut I don't know enough about North Hollywood and Hollywood Shade to run into the right corners.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:27.000\nAnd also, I'm hoping that if every... It's a highlander thing.\n\n13:27.000 --> 13:30.000\nEvery albino or albinistic person that dies, I get stronger.\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:35.000\nI don't want to educate anyone on this.\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:39.000\nBecause each of them has a pocket of darkness, shadow power,\n\n13:39.000 --> 13:45.000\nso when they crack open and this dark energy goes into you, and it counteracts the sun.\n\n13:45.000 --> 13:50.000\nDo you split between all the albino people, or do you just get all of the deaths worth of value?\n\n13:50.000 --> 13:53.000\nI'm thinking that because of my lack of...\n\n13:53.000 --> 13:55.000\nBecause I have a pretty strong vehicle, I could probably help.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.000\nAnd since I'm not, I'm thinking that negative energy is pulling a little more my way.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:01.000\nAlright, you've got a stronger gravity.\n\n14:01.000 --> 14:06.000\nWhen you run into a full-on...\n\n14:06.000 --> 14:10.000\nThere's a delineation between albino and albinistic.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:16.000\nWhen you meet somebody, I imagine you have, with the pink eye thing,\n\n14:16.000 --> 14:22.000\nand you meet them, is there any kind of tension between that?\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:24.000\nHave you seen the movie Warriors?\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:27.000\nLike a rival gang?\n\n14:27.000 --> 14:29.000\nI don't know. I'm so rent with them.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:32.000\nYou're never alone. You're never disconnected.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.000\nThe West Side Story kind of thing.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:35.000\nI'm so bound up with social anxiety.\n\n14:35.000 --> 14:39.000\nAnyway, I've done a couple photo shoots for awareness and things like that.\n\n14:39.000 --> 14:44.000\nAnd so we had all kinds of different pigmentless people.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:47.000\nAnd I met them and everything was fine.\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:50.000\nBut at the same time, I'm just nervous around anybody.\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:54.000\nBut in the back of my mind, I was like, you can drive, so fuck you.\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:57.000\nYeah, they've got privilege.\n\n14:57.000 --> 14:59.000\nWho knows how many albinistic...\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:04.000\nI know people you've met who have passed for albinistic and taken advantage of it.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.000\nThey could put contacts in those assholes.\n\n15:06.000 --> 15:10.000\nThey could drive a car. It looks Scandinavian.\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.000\nI'm Italian.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:13.000\nAnd I was like, are you Scandinavian?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:16.000\nNo, I'm just sad.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:20.000\nSorry, I'm getting fired up.\n\n15:20.000 --> 15:24.000\nWell, as always, we appreciate you being vulnerable with us.\n\n15:24.000 --> 15:26.000\nI wish I could believe me.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:30.000\nThe sun is my enemy too, but boy, the enemy of my enemy.\n\n15:30.000 --> 15:33.000\nI wish there was something we could do.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:37.000\nI call the sun orange Hitler.\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:41.000\nAnd from this day forward, that makes it better.\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:43.000\nYeah, I hate it.\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:46.000\nI want to put a hat over my pool.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.000\nYou could put an umbrella that goes out.\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:50.000\nI'm thinking about it.\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:53.000\nAnd then I feel like people make fun and go, why do you want a pool?\n\n15:53.000 --> 15:56.000\nThose sexy like in the cabanas, like those curvy...\n\n15:56.000 --> 15:59.000\nThey go out like that, so you have a shady spot always.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nAnd you swim there like, no, I'm being active.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:04.000\nI just happen to be swimming actively in the shade.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:06.000\nYou're not. You're just hanging out and hiding.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:10.000\nI might build a wall around it and then put a ceiling on the walls.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nAnd then an air conditioner.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.000\nSo it'd just be an indoor pool?\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.000\nYeah.\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:16.000\nThat's called a house.\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:18.000\nYou work hard enough, you deserve it.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:19.000\nYou do it.\n\n16:19.000 --> 16:20.000\nYeah.\n\n16:20.000 --> 16:22.000\nOr have an indoor pool, I guess.\n\n16:22.000 --> 16:24.000\nIf you've ever been to the Hearst Mansion, it's like,\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:28.000\nhe's getting pools where they start outside and then they go inside.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\nBut only if you're in the pool.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:32.000\nLike if you're a burglar, you could try to rob the house,\n\n16:32.000 --> 16:33.000\nbut you'd have to go in the pool.\n\n16:33.000 --> 16:37.000\nAnd then there's like pools that have hallways, like pool hallways.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.000\nThat's so badass.\n\n16:39.000 --> 16:42.000\nI mean, like if you have an indoor pool and people are swimming\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:47.000\nand it's like, can you imagine, it's like, hey, come over here.\n\n16:47.000 --> 16:51.000\nPeople are like going down the pool hallway to do pool coke.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:53.000\nWait, why is there a pool hallway?\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:54.000\nIs there a pool bathroom?\n\n16:54.000 --> 16:55.000\nThat's what I want to know.\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:57.000\nIf you go around the corner, is there like...\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:01.000\nYou can hang up your towel under water over there.\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:04.000\nHe's got pool rooms, so you have a pool right here,\n\n17:04.000 --> 17:08.000\nand then you swim down a canal, and there's another pool over here,\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.000\nand he's got like three pools in one big pool house,\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.000\nand it's the dopest shit.\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:14.000\nThat's what I get.\n\n17:14.000 --> 17:17.000\nThe only time I get excited about his dumb ass house underwater pool.\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.000\nThe pool thing.\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:21.000\nThe pool urinals are cool, but the pools sit down toilets.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:23.000\nThey're kind of like a work in progress.\n\n17:23.000 --> 17:26.000\nIt's putting too much power in the hands of the consumer, in my opinion.\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:29.000\nUsually it works, but then if you have diarrhea,\n\n17:29.000 --> 17:31.000\nwe're working that out.\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:35.000\nIf every single one of your guests is not totally trustworthy\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:38.000\nand capable, it's a disaster.\n\n17:38.000 --> 17:40.000\nYou need a pool guard who watches what the people eat\n\n17:40.000 --> 17:42.000\nbefore they go in the pool.\n\n17:42.000 --> 17:44.000\nShrimps of E.J., if you have two plates of that,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.000\nyou should not be in the pool.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:47.000\nThe pool dietician.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.000\nYeah, like somebody who's just there ready.\n\n17:49.000 --> 17:52.000\nIt's like vacuum, it's not going to work.\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:54.000\nHow amazing would it be if you were so rich,\n\n17:54.000 --> 17:58.000\nand technology was so accurate or whatever you call it,\n\n17:58.000 --> 17:59.000\nthat people could come over to your house\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:01.000\nand just hang out in your pool.\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.000\nYour whole house just had a pool everywhere.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:05.000\nEvery room had a little pool part of it\n\n18:05.000 --> 18:08.000\nso that technically you could just swim to any room\n\n18:08.000 --> 18:10.000\nand just be a different class of citizen.\n\n18:10.000 --> 18:12.000\nI'm one of the aqua people.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:15.000\nHere I am in the charades game, bye.\n\n18:15.000 --> 18:19.000\nBut at any point in that water, you could shit or piss\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:21.000\nor puke or drop fucking anything,\n\n18:21.000 --> 18:24.000\nand it would all just go and just float away\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:27.000\nto the nearest filter.\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:29.000\nYou just crystallized my dream.\n\n18:29.000 --> 18:31.000\nYou could just float around like a little baby\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:33.000\nand pee in poo poo.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\nYou could just be in the water, you could do whatever.\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:36.000\nYou go inside for the winter,\n\n18:36.000 --> 18:38.000\nyou start to see the seasons change,\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:40.000\nthe leaves fall and you go out, you go in,\n\n18:40.000 --> 18:42.000\nand then you kind of hibernate and shit everywhere.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:44.000\nYou're saying that you just want to live\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.000\nin a very efficient toilet.\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:48.000\nThe biggest toilet.\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:49.000\nNo toilet paper to worry about,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:51.000\ndon't have to get the bear anymore.\n\n18:51.000 --> 18:52.000\nIt's brilliant.\n\n18:52.000 --> 18:54.000\nThat's kind of what the internet is, right?\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:56.000\nIt's every human expressing how they'd like life to be.\n\n18:56.000 --> 18:59.000\nLike, oh, I'd like to be in contact with every human being\n\n18:59.000 --> 19:01.000\nand I'd like to emit whatever I want,\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nbut I don't want to ever touch anything that comes out of me\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:05.000\nor out of anyone else.\n\n19:05.000 --> 19:07.000\nThe problem is the filter on the internet's bad\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:08.000\nand we're all backed up,\n\n19:08.000 --> 19:10.000\nso now we're all knee deep and shit.\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:13.000\nThe problem is we need a pool dietician for the internet.\n\n19:13.000 --> 19:14.000\nThank you.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.000\nYou get it.\n\n19:15.000 --> 19:17.000\nBecause they just shit.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nYeah.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nHow would we elect this pool dietician?\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.000\nI'll do it.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.000\nPool dietician.\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.000\nI second.\n\n19:26.000 --> 19:27.000\nI don't really like,\n\n19:27.000 --> 19:28.000\nI don't think people should,\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:32.000\nfriends should discuss religion or pool dietic.\n\n19:32.000 --> 19:34.000\nSteve, can you bring the ice bucket?\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nPool dietic.\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:38.000\nYou just came up with like a 1980s...\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:39.000\nWait, is that a first?\n\n19:39.000 --> 19:40.000\nPool dietic.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:41.000\nNo, you said pool dietic.\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\nHe said pool dietician.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\nOh, pool dietician.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\nI just stole,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:46.000\nI just appropriated Brandon's joke.\n\n19:46.000 --> 19:47.000\nOkay.\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:48.000\nWell, when I heard pool dietician,\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:50.000\nI thought you misheard pool dietician.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:51.000\nYeah, I thought it was pool dietician,\n\n19:51.000 --> 19:53.000\nbut pool dietician is way better.\n\n19:53.000 --> 19:55.000\nHe said pool nutrition.\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.000\nRight.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:57.000\nHe said pool dietician.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:58.000\nHe said pool nutrition.\n\n19:58.000 --> 20:00.000\nAnd I say,\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:05.000\nquit pooling around and vote for me.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:07.000\nThat's how it happened.\n\n20:07.000 --> 20:11.000\nI just got every dad's vote in the joke coalition.\n\n20:11.000 --> 20:15.000\nWelcome to my political arty.\n\n20:15.000 --> 20:17.000\nWhat is, there's no pee in it.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:19.000\nOh, let's keep it that way.\n\n20:19.000 --> 20:21.000\nWhat is going on with the conspicuous timing\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:23.000\nof the, when did we...\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.000\nI think Steve Levy likes to bring it out\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.000\nin dramatic fashion in the middle of the show\n\n20:27.000 --> 20:28.000\nto make like a...\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nWe should get him a cape.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:33.000\nI think he's like the phantom of our opera\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nand he likes to bring out the...\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:36.000\nWe should get him a half mask.\n\n20:36.000 --> 20:38.000\nHe likes to bring out the vodka.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:40.000\nIs he trying to tempt me into health?\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:42.000\nLet's see how long it can...\n\n20:42.000 --> 20:43.000\nDon't do it.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:45.000\nI don't want to enable him.\n\n20:45.000 --> 20:48.000\nI'm leaving it out until he really asks for it.\n\n20:48.000 --> 20:49.000\nAnd then I just look.\n\n20:49.000 --> 20:51.000\nI'm here to help, but...\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:53.000\nLevy, you should just scream it\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:55.000\nfrom the rooftops that you want it.\n\n20:55.000 --> 20:56.000\nI hear him coming.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:57.000\nHere it comes.\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.000\nYes, Steve Levy with the vodka.\n\n21:00.000 --> 21:02.000\nDramatic fashion.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.000\nAll right, Levy, sit.\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:04.000\nPlease sit down.\n\n21:04.000 --> 21:05.000\nSit.\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:08.000\nYou can't just tell a human being to sit like a...\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nLike a carrier.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:15.000\nExplain yourself.\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.000\nHalf of it is forgetting\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:22.000\nand half of it is strategy, I think.\n\n21:22.000 --> 21:23.000\nForgetting must be nice.\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:27.000\nUnfortunately, my vodka's never out here.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:28.000\nStrategy for what?\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:31.000\nWhat's the strategic ploy here?\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:34.000\nYou know, we keep it on the rails a little bit\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:35.000\nin the beginning.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:36.000\nOh.\n\n21:36.000 --> 21:37.000\nOh, shit.\n\n21:37.000 --> 21:38.000\nAll right.\n\n21:38.000 --> 21:40.000\nTo time out Dan's blackouts.\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:42.000\nForget which one it was, but you were like,\n\n21:42.000 --> 21:45.000\nyou know, I think I may have just too much in the beginning.\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.000\nAnd I was like, well, you know, if I don't...\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:49.000\nGive it 15 minutes.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:51.000\nGive you your 20.\n\n21:51.000 --> 21:53.000\nWell, I think the danger is more like...\n\n21:53.000 --> 21:55.000\nIt's about before the show.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:58.000\nIf I pre-game before the show, we're just fucked, you know?\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.000\nYeah, all right.\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.000\nYeah.\n\n22:02.000 --> 22:04.000\nShit.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:06.000\nLike the Yardley Smith episode, I just...\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:07.000\nI got...\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:09.000\nYeah, I think that might have been the one where you were like,\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:10.000\nyou know...\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:11.000\nI was nervous.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:13.000\nIt's ironic because they get nervous about certain people\n\n22:13.000 --> 22:15.000\nand then I'm like, I want to do a good job.\n\n22:15.000 --> 22:17.000\nBut then I'm like, well, that's not how you're going to do a good job.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:19.000\nYou fucked up with Norman Lear.\n\n22:19.000 --> 22:20.000\nAnd then I'm like...\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:22.000\nSo then I'm like, oh, a little Dutch courage.\n\n22:22.000 --> 22:23.000\nYou didn't fuck up.\n\n22:23.000 --> 22:24.000\nThat episode was classic.\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:25.000\nIt was classic.\n\n22:25.000 --> 22:26.000\nI was there.\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:27.000\nI was there.\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.000\nI was afraid of Norman Lear.\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:30.000\nAnd because he was facing you,\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:32.000\nany time I jumped in and said something\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:33.000\nand he couldn't quite hear it,\n\n22:33.000 --> 22:35.000\nI think he thought I was attacking him.\n\n22:35.000 --> 22:36.000\nYeah.\n\n22:36.000 --> 22:37.000\nWell, you probably were.\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:39.000\nI would never attack Norman Lear.\n\n22:39.000 --> 22:42.000\nHe told us that great story.\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:44.000\nI forget which famous actor,\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:49.000\nbut it was like the dick in the hotel room.\n\n22:49.000 --> 22:53.000\nDid he tell us that?\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:58.000\nYeah, something about a dick in a hotel room.\n\n22:58.000 --> 23:00.000\nYou know who I speak in a Norman Lear,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:01.000\nbecause you know who was in the green room\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.000\nand I guess he couldn't wait to come out\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nand tell Norman Lear that he wasn't on the show.\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:07.000\nDeMorge, I ran into DeMorge on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:11.000\nI don't know, like 2.30 in the morning or something.\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:13.000\nHe was straight sober.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:18.000\nI was coming off of an adventure and just trying to...\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:20.000\nDid you play Spider-Man until about midnight?\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:21.000\nYeah.\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nAnd then...\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:23.000\nYeah.\n\n23:23.000 --> 23:25.000\nBut I just ran into him in the corner,\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:28.000\nlike real close to where Sinus Base used to be.\n\n23:28.000 --> 23:30.000\nAnd it was like, holy shit, it's DeMorge.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:33.000\nAnd we talked for like, it felt like an hour.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:37.000\nAnd then it was just like, deserted Hollywood Boulevard\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:39.000\nand then I went on my way.\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nIt was nice to see him.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:42.000\nWhat was the origin of your adventure?\n\n23:42.000 --> 23:43.000\nWhat did you just come off of?\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:45.000\nI met with Joel McHale and Chris McKenna\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:47.000\nand that's already a lot of mix\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:52.000\nto just throw at an evening.\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:56.000\nSo by the time we finished dinner,\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.000\nMcKenna and I were like,\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:03.000\nreally, Aaron the girl I was dating,\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:04.000\nnot Erin McGathy,\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:05.000\nbut Aaron who I was dating\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:08.000\nwhen I was actively working at my hardest on community.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:09.000\nShe observed, she's like,\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.000\nyou and McKenna bring out the best and worst in each other.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:14.000\nAnd like, McKenna and I were like,\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nwe were like yelling at McKale,\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:21.000\nlike, why do you love your family more than drinking?\n\n24:21.000 --> 24:23.000\nCome out with us.\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:27.000\nLike, we were just 17 years old.\n\n24:27.000 --> 24:29.000\nWe were just actively trying to get a man\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:31.000\nto break up with his family\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:33.000\nbecause we wanted to go to the Frolick Room\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:36.000\nand then we didn't go to the Frolick Room.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:40.000\nWe stumbled into this other place that came before it.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:44.000\nThis dark bar that only had one other guy in it\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:48.000\nand I will say to this guy's credit,\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.000\nhe did the one thing that usually like,\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nI don't think I've ever heard\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:54.000\nfrom the obnoxious drunk third guy at the bar,\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:57.000\nwhich is he just blatantly sad after listening to us\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nfor 20 minutes, he's like, you know what?\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nI can't hear you that good\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:04.000\nand I'm fascinated by what you're saying,\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:08.000\nso I'm going to move one down to Swack and Eavesdrop.\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:10.000\nThat's quite a compliment.\n\n25:10.000 --> 25:13.000\nAnd I was like, all right, well, can't fault that.\n\n25:13.000 --> 25:15.000\nWe're in a public place.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.000\nIf we wanted privacy, we'd leave.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.000\nAnd I was like, well, what do you do?\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:21.000\nI'm a data scientist.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:24.000\nI'm a flavor chef.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:30.000\nIt's rare when your job title belies the fakeness of it.\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:33.000\nI'm a water surfer.\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:37.000\nOkay, you wanted to make it sound a little more realistic,\n\n25:37.000 --> 25:40.000\nbut you blew it.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.000\nData scientist.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:44.000\nI asked him five questions.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:46.000\nHe's like, why is that so funny?\n\n25:46.000 --> 25:50.000\nI'm like, because literally all science is data science?\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:52.000\nAll of it.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.000\nDoes that mean he's one of those people\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:56.000\nthat just does data input?\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:59.000\nHe's drunk.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:03.000\nHe's trying to live a secret life of Walter Middy.\n\n26:03.000 --> 26:06.000\nHe just wanted to make up a job.\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:08.000\nThe answer was whatever.\n\n26:08.000 --> 26:10.000\nI don't know.\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:13.000\nHe did something that had to do with like,\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:15.000\nit was like data.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nIt was data, but it wasn't science.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:20.000\nHe goes and tries different flavors of Kellogg's, Corn Flakes,\n\n26:20.000 --> 26:22.000\nand sees that they're good.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:24.000\nThat's data science.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.000\nIt was almost like data anti-science.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:29.000\nIf you want to know the truth,\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:31.000\nit had to do with housing loans.\n\n26:31.000 --> 26:38.000\nBanks hire him to make numbers faken dance\n\n26:38.000 --> 26:41.000\nin favor of the status quo.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:43.000\nWhat did you say?\n\n26:43.000 --> 26:45.000\nHe's like a book cooker.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:48.000\nIt's kind of like, you watch the documentaries\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:51.000\nabout the guys that were behind climate change denial\n\n26:51.000 --> 26:54.000\nor tobacco.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:57.000\nWhen politics meets science.\n\n26:57.000 --> 26:59.000\nHe's like a think tanker.\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:02.000\nYeah, he's kind of a guy that you call.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.000\nHe's a data spinner.\n\n27:05.000 --> 27:07.000\nAin't no science about it.\n\n27:07.000 --> 27:10.000\nIt's very much not science, what he does.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:12.000\nAnd he actually was getting drunk.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:15.000\nAnd I think he was getting drunk because he's ashamed of it.\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nWhen he actually got to the bottom of it\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:19.000\nand was explaining what he did.\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:22.000\nNot like you that was trying to talk out.\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:25.000\nI'm getting drunk because I love what I do.\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:27.000\nYeah, it's true.\n\n27:27.000 --> 27:29.000\nI get drunk because I love myself.\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:31.000\nI'm like, yay!\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:34.000\nWho wants to overhear me?\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:36.000\nAnd

I won't remember.\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nBut the bartender was also very interesting.\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:54.000\n12 years sober.\n\n27:54.000 --> 27:56.000\nAnd sometimes you run into a bartender\n\n27:56.000 --> 27:59.000\nwho's like very rock solid sober.\n\n27:59.000 --> 28:01.000\nIt takes you back a little,\n\n28:01.000 --> 28:03.000\nbut there's a certain,\n\n28:03.000 --> 28:05.000\nthere's a Venn diagram of people\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:07.000\nbetween sober people and bartenders.\n\n28:07.000 --> 28:09.000\nIt's like, I'm in my sweet spot.\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:12.000\nThis is how I stay sober.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:15.000\nThey're great bartenders\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:18.000\nbecause they were alcoholics once\n\n28:18.000 --> 28:20.000\nand they're never going to be again.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:22.000\nAnd they have empathy for people\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.000\nthat are there for the right or wrong reasons.\n\n28:25.000 --> 28:28.000\nThey have a sharp instinct for when to cut off,\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:31.000\nwhen to over pour, when to 86, when to call a cab.\n\n28:31.000 --> 28:34.000\nAnd this guy was talking about how\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:37.000\nit was 12 years ago\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:40.000\nwhen he saw the episode of Cheers in reruns\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:43.000\nwhere there's a specific episode of Cheers\n\n28:43.000 --> 28:45.000\nthat I remembered as he described it.\n\n28:45.000 --> 28:47.000\nI was like, oh yeah, that episode for sure.\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:49.000\nAnd the lights go out and Sam's alone in the bar\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:51.000\nand then he pours one and then he slides it down the bar.\n\n28:51.000 --> 28:53.000\nAnd he's like, yeah, yeah, that one, that one.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:55.000\nAnd I was like, you know, that got me going about Cheers\n\n28:55.000 --> 28:57.000\nand how Cheers is the greatest show\n\n28:57.000 --> 28:59.000\nand everybody in my generation will tell you.\n\n28:59.000 --> 29:01.000\nAnd Stephanie's like, he said something like,\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:06.000\nhe's like, yeah, and I think it was like,\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:09.000\nthat was before Norm died.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:11.000\nAnd I was like, Norm died.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:13.000\nHow many episodes of Cheers have you seen?\n\n29:13.000 --> 29:15.000\nHe's like, oh, one or two.\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:17.000\nIt's like, cheers changed your life\n\n29:17.000 --> 29:19.000\nand you never watched another episode.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:21.000\nHow do you know the third episode you watch\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:24.000\nof Cheers wouldn't make you a millionaire?\n\n29:24.000 --> 29:26.000\nLike you watch one episode\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.000\nand it magically transforms your fucking life\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:32.000\nand you're just like, fuck it, I'll watch Firescape now.\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:34.000\nDid Norm die? Norm didn't die.\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:35.000\nNo, he never died.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:37.000\nAnd anyone that ever cared.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:38.000\nHe meant Coach.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.000\nNo, no, he did.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:41.000\nWell, okay, if he did mean that,\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:42.000\nthen it's just funny.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:44.000\nHe wasn't a Cheers fan.\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.000\nHe just saw that episode and it changed his life.\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:47.000\nThat's what's funny.\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:50.000\nHe didn't then watch 200 episodes of Cheers.\n\n29:50.000 --> 29:52.000\nHe just was like, what a fun episode\n\n29:52.000 --> 29:54.000\nor whatever the fuck that was.\n\n29:54.000 --> 29:58.000\nWe just got Milton about Cheers for a second about Coach.\n\n29:58.000 --> 30:00.000\nI've told us straight before on the show\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.000\nabout being at a bar with George Wendt, right?\n\n30:04.000 --> 30:06.000\nProbably, like...\n\n30:06.000 --> 30:08.000\nYeah, well, long story short,\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:12.000\nSudeikis is his nephew, George Wendt's nephew.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:13.000\nWe went out to...\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:15.000\nWhich is why Nicholas Cage, he changed his name.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:18.000\nHe didn't want that Wendt status.\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:21.000\nWhat's going on?\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:23.000\nNo, we went to see a band at the Troubadour,\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nwhich is a square or rectangular shaped bar.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:28.000\nGeorge Wendt was high\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:32.000\nbecause he and Jason Sudeikis like to smoke a little weed\n\n30:32.000 --> 30:37.000\nand Norm sat at the exact spot where Norm would sit at Cheers\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:40.000\non the corner of the left side of the bar\n\n30:40.000 --> 30:43.000\nand people were losing their fucking minds.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nBecause everybody else is high, too.\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:49.000\nLike, I just moved here from Cincinnati\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:52.000\nand fucking Norm is right there.\n\n30:52.000 --> 30:56.000\nHaving a beer and the same stool that he would occupy\n\n30:56.000 --> 30:59.000\nand he was like signing people's tits.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:03.000\nHe was awesome.\n\n31:03.000 --> 31:06.000\nDid you sign this chair on purpose?\n\n31:06.000 --> 31:11.000\nAnd did that person ask for their tits to be signed?\n\n31:11.000 --> 31:14.000\nIt was a different time.\n\n31:14.000 --> 31:15.000\nIt was a simpler time.\n\n31:15.000 --> 31:16.000\nIt was a different time.\n\n31:16.000 --> 31:17.000\nThey wanted an autograph.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:20.000\nThey didn't have a napkin.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:24.000\nCut to a Weepy Ratsenberger over in the corner.\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:26.000\nWeepy Ratsenberger.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:29.000\nWeepy, how's your relationship going?\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:31.000\nYou got a new squeeze?\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nYeah, I got a new squeeze.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:39.000\nSo here's something that concerns me.\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:41.000\nI know where this is going.\n\n31:41.000 --> 31:43.000\nCody asked to see a photo of her\n\n31:43.000 --> 31:45.000\nand you said you didn't have one.\n\n31:45.000 --> 31:46.000\nWhat?\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:49.000\nWe hadn't taken pictures of each other.\n\n31:49.000 --> 31:52.000\nAlso, she's not like a fan of being photographed.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:57.000\nDoes she live by Niagara Falls?\n\n31:57.000 --> 32:01.000\nYeah.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:04.000\nWe want to respect her, obviously.\n\n32:04.000 --> 32:06.000\nBut we also want to question her existence.\n\n32:06.000 --> 32:07.000\nHow do we do this?\n\n32:07.000 --> 32:09.000\nHow do we walk this tightrope?\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:13.000\nHow do we authenticate the fact that you actually have a girlfriend?\n\n32:13.000 --> 32:17.000\nWell, since that conversation, I actually took a photo of her.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:23.000\nCody wants to see her yelling at her, step straight.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:26.000\nMy boss's fiance wants to know you exist.\n\n32:26.000 --> 32:28.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n32:28.000 --> 32:31.000\nShe was not thrilled to be taking the pictures.\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:34.000\nBut yeah, I took a couple of pictures.\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:36.000\nAll right.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:38.000\nDoes she live in town?\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nIs she local?\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:40.000\nYeah, she's local.\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:42.000\nAnd how long has this been going on?\n\n32:42.000 --> 32:43.000\nFour months.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:44.000\nAre you happy?\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:45.000\nYou feeling good?\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.000\nYeah.\n\n32:46.000 --> 32:47.000\nLike Comic-Con, was she?\n\n32:47.000 --> 32:48.000\nNo, no.\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:49.000\nOkay.\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:50.000\nYeah.\n\n32:50.000 --> 32:51.000\nAll right.\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:52.000\nI was with you every step of the way through Comic-Con.\n\n32:52.000 --> 32:55.000\nI know, because you were making out with that one girl and I was...\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.000\nJust kidding.\n\n32:57.000 --> 32:58.000\nShirley.\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nLet's call her Shirley.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nWe won't.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.000\nLet's call her Shirley.\n\n33:02.000 --> 33:03.000\nShirley?\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:06.000\nYeah, she could have like a code name, I guess.\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:07.000\nShirley.\n\n33:07.000 --> 33:09.000\nShe could have been at Comic-Con and you wouldn't have known,\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nbecause she'd be dressed up in some sort of...\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.000\nHarmon fan.\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:16.000\nYeah, she could have been at Mr. Meeseeks.\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:17.000\nShe could have been at Meeseeks.\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:18.000\nYeah.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nYeah.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:22.000\nShe could have looked like anything Dan would have recognized.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:25.000\nHe doesn't know what she looks like.\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nYeah.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:31.000\nYou might have seen my girlfriend at Comic-Con.\n\n33:31.000 --> 33:33.000\nShe was dressed like Harley Quinn.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:34.000\nShit.\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:37.000\nLess Harley Quinn's this year.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nAre you celebrating or demanding?\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:44.000\nJust trying to offer up a subject.\n\n33:44.000 --> 33:46.000\nDid you see the Harley Quinn trailer?\n\n33:46.000 --> 33:47.000\nNo.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:49.000\nThe Harley Quinn show?\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nThere's a Harley Quinn animated show and she's like,\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nshit, fuck that, Batman.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:54.000\nShit.\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:55.000\nOh, shit, fuck.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nWhat the fuck's going on?\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nShit.\n\n33:58.000 --> 34:00.000\nThat's not your mom's Harley Quinn.\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:03.000\nIt's weird, because it looks like all the other DC animated shows,\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:05.000\nbut it's just like this...\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:06.000\nHere's what makes this one different.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.000\nShe's just like, what the shit?\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:09.000\nFuck.\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:12.000\nAnd the Joker's like, wow, wow, wow, wow.\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:13.000\nJoke me this.\n\n34:13.000 --> 34:16.000\nAnd she's like, fuck, fuck.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:20.000\nThere's something to be said for your mom's Harley Quinn, you know?\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nI like the idea.\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:23.000\nWhat's also kind of funny about it though is I have this sneaking suspicion,\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\nbecause I watched the trailer only once,\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:29.000\nbut I'm like, Batman's not joining in on this game.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:32.000\nSo I imagine that they're like, look, Harley Quinn's kind of like Deadpool\n\n34:32.000 --> 34:33.000\nor whatever.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou can go crazy with her.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:39.000\nBut she's surrounded by all these icons of the DC universe,\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:41.000\ndrawn in that same style.\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:42.000\nBut she's the only one.\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:44.000\nSo one of them's just like, oh, fiddle sticks.\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\nAnd she's like, fuckin' ain't right about that.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:49.000\nShit, shit on a dick and pussy.\n\n34:49.000 --> 34:50.000\nWe got a Joker.\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nLet's fuckin' kill Batman.\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:55.000\nAh, no sweat in my pet.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:58.000\nShe sounds like Harley Quinn.\n\n34:58.000 --> 34:59.000\nYeah.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nHarley, Harley Quinn.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nYeah.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.000\nHarley, Harley, Harley Quinn.\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:07.000\nI'm having a stroke and nobody's helping.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\nNobody is a Harley, Harley, Harley Quinn.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:12.000\nRest in peace, Brandon Johnson.\n\n35:12.000 --> 35:14.000\nHe died as he lives.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:15.000\nHit him in the solar plexus.\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:20.000\nCommitting to poorly fleshed out bits.\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.000\nHe's like side armor.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:24.000\nOh no.\n\n35:24.000 --> 35:28.000\nJust sleep, sleep, sleep.\n\n35:28.000 --> 35:30.000\nGo gentle into that good night.\n\n35:30.000 --> 35:33.000\nShit, he was the only guy I knew up here.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:34.000\nYeah.\n\n35:34.000 --> 35:37.000\nSpencer, have you ever cosplayed?\n\n35:37.000 --> 35:39.000\nHave you ever gone out into the cosplay universe?\n\n35:39.000 --> 35:41.000\nNo, I got, I got, this is like not,\n\n35:41.000 --> 35:44.000\nthis is not a cool belief these days\n\n35:44.000 --> 35:47.000\nbecause you're supposed to be, I don't know.\n\n35:47.000 --> 35:48.000\nI don't even want to label it.\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:51.000\nBut I think that cosplays look really good\n\n35:51.000 --> 35:53.000\nwhen you look something like the character.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\nObviously anyone can be any character all the time.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.000\nBut like, I've always wanted to like,\n\n35:57.000 --> 35:59.000\nyou know, find someone I look like\n\n35:59.000 --> 36:01.000\nand I don't look like very much at anything.\n\n36:01.000 --> 36:03.000\nWho would you go if you had to like,\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:06.000\nget styled as a cosplay character?\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:08.000\nYou could, you know, whatever you wanted,\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.000\nlook exactly like that person.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:11.000\nWho would it be?\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.000\nThere's this guy's husband in an anime\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.000\nthat I look kind of like.\n\n36:14.000 --> 36:16.000\nHe's like just this big fat guy.\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.000\nHe's like, he's like giant.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:18.000\nBut you're not, you're not fat.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.000\nYou're skinny.\n\n36:19.000 --> 36:21.000\nBut he's just like a big giant guy.\n\n36:21.000 --> 36:22.000\nOkay.\n\n36:22.000 --> 36:23.000\nAnd if like,\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:24.000\nSpencer's anime fat.\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:25.000\nYeah.\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:26.000\nOh, I'm

--> 45:17.000\nYeah, yeah.\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:18.000\nThe G series?\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:19.000\nYeah.\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:20.000\nThe last two episodes, they've brought up.\n\n45:20.000 --> 45:22.000\nThey've been like really diving in deaths.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:23.000\nOh, this guy invented it.\n\n45:23.000 --> 45:24.000\nHe's a Nazi.\n\n45:24.000 --> 45:26.000\nLike they're not talking about that.\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:30.000\nLike it's that the distinct links to Nazism.\n\n45:30.000 --> 45:34.000\nLike both of those episodes, like Jad was like, these are Nazis.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.000\nRight.\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:36.000\nLike an aside.\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:38.000\nBut that's all the time they spent on it.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:41.000\nIt's like, no, that's the whole that all it is is these are Nazis.\n\n45:41.000 --> 45:42.000\nYou say that once.\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:43.000\nIt may be.\n\n45:43.000 --> 45:46.000\nI don't want to certainly don't want to be the devil's advocate in this\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:47.000\nconversation.\n\n45:47.000 --> 45:48.000\nBut yeah.\n\n45:48.000 --> 45:49.000\nDo it.\n\n45:49.000 --> 45:50.000\nDo it.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:52.000\nBecause it's literally the devil I'm advocating for.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:53.000\nSure.\n\n45:53.000 --> 46:05.000\nBut I got the impression that they might have been more being more cautious than\n\n46:05.000 --> 46:09.000\nthey needed to be of Godwin's law kind of thing.\n\n46:09.000 --> 46:18.000\nSo if we say Nazi Hitler shit every single time we evoke eugenics, like we're going to\n\n46:18.000 --> 46:22.000\nmiss an opportunity to provoke thought about the root of this shit.\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.000\nBut the root of it is Nazis.\n\n46:24.000 --> 46:28.000\nWell, but the part of their point is that the root of it isn't.\n\n46:28.000 --> 46:34.000\nAnd I hate to put this fucking arrow in the worst people in the world's quiver, but eugenics\n\n46:34.000 --> 46:40.000\nwas a craze in America, like, like, like, yeah, like swept through us like right around\n\n46:40.000 --> 46:41.000\nthe.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:42.000\nYeah.\n\n46:42.000 --> 46:45.000\nThe reconstruction picked it up and then the Holocaust happened that like that's a very\n\n46:45.000 --> 46:50.000\nimportant dot to connect for America or is it or is it so hot button that that people\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.000\nstop listening and that that might otherwise actually think about.\n\n46:53.000 --> 46:54.000\nWell, what are those problems?\n\n46:54.000 --> 46:58.000\nThe radio lab.\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:03.000\nNo, I just I really made me uncomfortable because it's like you can you can have a bit\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:06.000\nmore context, like very interesting stuff they're discussing.\n\n47:06.000 --> 47:10.000\nBut like at the end of the recent one, they're like, you know, some countries might say it's\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:12.000\nfine to do eugenic birthing standards.\n\n47:12.000 --> 47:15.000\nAnd if you don't like that, doesn't that make you the real racist?\n\n47:15.000 --> 47:18.000\nAnd then like he literally said that.\n\n47:18.000 --> 47:19.000\nWhoa.\n\n47:19.000 --> 47:20.000\nOkay.\n\n47:20.000 --> 47:21.000\nI didn't hear that one.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.000\nYou're imperialist racist in that context or something like that.\n\n47:24.000 --> 47:25.000\nYeah.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:26.000\nIt's really interesting stuff.\n\n47:26.000 --> 47:27.000\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n47:27.000 --> 47:28.000\nWell, yeah, I will.\n\n47:28.000 --> 47:34.000\nI'd rather have my needle as sensitive as yours.\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:37.000\nI'm afraid of mine getting number.\n\n47:37.000 --> 47:43.000\nI've achieved like a sort of fetish now for non divisiveness, which is another way of\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:48.000\nlike I listened to these guys, the guys that host stuff they don't want you to know.\n\n47:48.000 --> 47:58.000\nAnd I particularly fetishized their crazy like almost obsessive and highly skilled ability\n\n47:58.000 --> 48:07.000\nto go into areas that that traditionally are just like if your decision is to be non divisive\n\n48:07.000 --> 48:11.000\nthen you wouldn't bother to talk about any of this stuff in this area but because they're\n\n48:11.000 --> 48:15.000\na conspiracy theory kind of podcast, they constantly have to go into these areas.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:20.000\nBut they clearly like pride themselves and have said as much at a certain point after\n\n48:20.000 --> 48:21.000\nI noticed it.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:25.000\nAnd then they said it at one point I was like, oh, okay, so this is I wasn't hallucinating\n\n48:25.000 --> 48:26.000\nthis.\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:34.000\nYou guys are like, they look at humanity's political frailties, good, bad, dark light as\n\n48:34.000 --> 48:37.000\nlike a souffle that they're not going to collapse by stomping around it.\n\n48:37.000 --> 48:46.000\nAnd they kind of like they have a gift for language that doesn't presuppose particularly\n\n48:46.000 --> 48:51.000\nanything as they explain things like MK ultra and and all this stuff that you'd think would\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:55.000\nbe festooned with laser lines and stuff.\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:59.000\nAnd I don't want to be that person or rather I could never be that person.\n\n48:59.000 --> 49:03.000\nSo like I wouldn't I don't think the good version of me makes that a goal.\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:08.000\nBut I at the same time I listen to these guys on the way to work now, and they kind of they\n\n49:08.000 --> 49:12.000\nkind of bring me this Taoistic piece because they're so smart and they're so interested\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.000\nin such fringe shit.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:20.000\nAnd yet they clearly not because they're secretly on the side of the scum of the earth and don't\n\n49:20.000 --> 49:26.000\nwant to lose those ratings but because they have some academic belief that proper like\n\n49:26.000 --> 49:31.000\nexploration of stuff shouldn't necessarily ruffle anyone's feathers.\n\n49:31.000 --> 49:38.000\nAnd that they're just they just want to state things in some weird Jedi way that like doesn't\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:44.000\nnecessarily like like like say Nixon was a bad person even like they they just kind of\n\n49:44.000 --> 49:48.000\nlike it's it's it's it's that's my kick right now.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:49.000\nIt's probably a dangerous kick.\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:50.000\nI should be.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:54.000\nYeah, I think not wanting to offend people that are Nazis is part of like why we're in\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.000\nthe problem we're having.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:58.000\nYou know, I don't think that's necessarily bad for conspiracy theorists.\n\n49:58.000 --> 50:03.000\nBut there is this part of it all though that you do get to take a break.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.000\nSure.\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:07.000\nYeah, like you don't have to be engaging in this bad.\n\n50:07.000 --> 50:11.000\nThere are times I think where you can objectively just watch something just to tune the fuck\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.000\nout for a second because it's been pretty.\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:17.000\nI think we all can agree that it's been like an onslaught for two years.\n\n50:17.000 --> 50:21.000\nSo I think you more than two years but like three.\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:22.000\nI said more.\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:28.000\nI like delivery in that shit someone three.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:33.000\nYeah, so I do think I do think you can watch something it be Nazi heavy and just be like\n\n50:33.000 --> 50:36.000\nfor a second I kind of just want to watch this thing.\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:42.000\nYou know by contrast our nation's president executing like the absolute like divisive fucking\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:47.000\nsword like the only thing that I'm taking in from the news and it should be noted that\n\n50:47.000 --> 50:52.000\nI'm trying to actively avoid news so the shit that gets to me is fucking gravity fed and\n\n50:52.000 --> 50:58.000\nit's coming through tons of gravel and like like like it's it's it seems uncanny to me\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:06.000\nthat he is absolutely I I agree with what's his fuck.\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:09.000\nNewt Gingrich is observation that I read about.\n\n51:09.000 --> 51:11.000\nI know you're brisk like you agree with Newt Gingrich.\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:16.000\nI agree with Newt Gingrich is observation that what Trump is doing right now strategically\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:25.000\nabsolutely has to attempt to define everyone left of fascist as anarchist as socialist.\n\n51:25.000 --> 51:32.000\nHe's he's he's he's looking at the numbers and he's going like I need to double down on\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:39.000\nall of the race talk and all of the immigration talk good for the base but also what I need\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:45.000\nto generally do to people out there who are dangerously trying to walk the tightrope.\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:50.000\nHe's basically looking at them as people who are trying to win some kind of like balance\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:55.000\ngame because there's Zen and he's shouting in their ear like so you're socialist so you're socialist\n\n51:55.000 --> 52:01.000\nlike and trying to remove from their heads like he's trying to he wants the next election\n\n52:01.000 --> 52:07.000\nto be about oh boy there's just really boy I would hate to have my home taken away by\n\n52:07.000 --> 52:12.000\npeople of color so I mean I'm not that democratic.\n\n52:12.000 --> 52:16.000\nI thought about that with a reverse trajectory and I was thinking about yeah for a while\n\n52:16.000 --> 52:21.000\nthere wasn't there a little bit of a push to like wake people of color up to the fact that\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:25.000\nDemocrats had never actually had their back you know that cynical kind of thing where\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:30.000\nwhere there was like that push ago like hey would you know look these people have never\n\n52:30.000 --> 52:34.000\ntaken care of you and all that stuff and that feels like that has been jettisoned because\n\n52:34.000 --> 52:40.000\nthe numbers just never turned around so now he's like he's condensing all of his strategy\n\n52:40.000 --> 52:45.000\non this idea of like he wants you to think that in the game of Coke versus Pepsi that\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:53.000\nPepsi definitively means Alexandria Cortez gets all of your pants like whether you want\n\n52:53.000 --> 52:59.000\nhe needs you to be thinking about that like the same way that you pound home like butter\n\n52:59.000 --> 53:04.000\nemails you know Benghazi and all that stuff you just pound home that stuff's not all for\n\n53:04.000 --> 53:09.000\nthe hillbillies that stuff is to try to like scramble the signal of people who might otherwise\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:15.000\nbe tempted to eat a sandwich take a breath and vote their conscience to convince them\n\n53:15.000 --> 53:23.000\nthat they're in a war between like crazy and what I had yesterday.\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:28.000\nI do I totally agree with Spencer and that people should like be vigilant but I also\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:32.000\nam getting to the point where I understand that people probably are suffering some fatigue.\n\n53:32.000 --> 53:36.000\nBut that's why I mean that's why I understand what you're saying is like not the time to\n\n53:36.000 --> 53:41.000\nfetishizing centrism well I just think it's like really important context in a world where\n\n53:41.000 --> 53:46.000\nthere are white nationalists who are pointing to what they call science to justify their\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:51.000\nrace science and it's like it's an impressive analog that that's what we did for manifest\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:55.000\ndestiny that's how we justified the westward expansion and the trail of tears that followed\n\n53:55.000 --> 54:00.000\nand then like that like Nazis literally looked at that and they're like well we're more\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:04.000\nwhite than you so you must be on to something and like it is this very trackable thing that\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:09.000\nstarted in America it's back in America arguably never left America and they're just leaving\n\n54:09.000 --> 54:13.000\nthat out in in a perfect contents to bring that up because a big part of their unit is\n\n54:13.000 --> 54:19.000\nit is problematic what these what these IQ generalities are doing and they do a great\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:24.000\njob of expressing like the people like for instance the black people can't get their IQ\n\n54:24.000 --> 54:28.000\ntest in the public school system because of this court case which is just this weird thing\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:34.000\nbecause the IQ test was used to put black people in special ed when they didn't deserve\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:39.000\nit and like so they do a good job of talking about the bad elements and even when they're\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:43.000\ntalking about these last two episodes they were it's just like to me it's like it seems\n\n54:43.000 --> 54:48.000\ndoubly important to explain like the historical context of where it's developed and they did\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:52.000\nthat just a tiny tiny bit and I would just like to see you know yeah I could definitely\n\n54:52.000 --> 54:58.000\nunderstand I could picture them sitting in a room right exactly that's what piss me off do we do we connect this to today\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:04.000\novertly or do we or do we put one spark plug next to another I don't know how spark plugs work\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:11.000\nI don't think they're supposed to clearly they'd probably make it a wire if they wanted to connect\n\n55:11.000 --> 55:18.000\nthem it looks cool do we put one diode next to another and like hope that and let the\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:24.000\nlistener like form you know I'm sure that's what they're banking on as an editor as a\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:30.000\nstoryteller as a producer I would make an argument yeah I would it's like oh man are we\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:38.000\ngonna like we have this weird self-shaming instinct if you're at all left of anything\n\n55:38.000 --> 55:44.000\nyou kind of tend to come equipped with this like self-policing and only exploitable thing where\n\n55:44.000 --> 55:50.000\nyou're like oh was I getting too political oh did I accidentally like soapbox today like the other side\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:56.000\nexactly doesn't have that self-policing instinct but they should continue to not have it that's what makes\n\n55:56.000 --> 56:04.000\nit the other side and we should continue to have it it I don't know man it's like you research like the\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:09.000\nthe back in my day when I was a kid and it was like when I wasn't participating in any of this shit but\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:15.000\nthere was this whole push of like the they used essentially the same trick on an atomic level\n\n56:15.000 --> 56:21.000\nwhich was like accusing the left of controlling the media accusing the media of having a liberal bias\n\n56:21.000 --> 56:29.000\nand people who go into journalism are number one typically probably in their personal lives probably\n\n56:29.000 --> 56:35.000\nbig fans of freedom of speech probably big fans of approaching things practically probably big fans\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:41.000\nof like like society but did generally you know as much as they would deny it and not want it to be a\n\n56:41.000 --> 56:46.000\nthing it's probably true that if you major in journalism in college there's an increased chance of your\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:52.000\npersonal politics being liberal however it like you use also an increased chance of you having a\n\n56:52.000 --> 56:58.000\nfucking huge power to like put that aside probably too much so and it was exploited throughout our\n\n56:58.000 --> 57:04.000\nhistory the right has that strategy they they drill down on it they know that they can accuse the\n\n57:04.000 --> 57:10.000\nleft of being unfair and the left will hear the word unfair and just freeze like a rabbit and then\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:14.000\nthey'll just do whatever they want like while everyone's frozen because it's like you just call\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:19.000\ntime out in the game of duck duck goose and then you just say you're a goose I don't know that's not\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:29.000\nright politics quarters over but but yeah I don't know what to talk about so I hear you got any\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:34.000\nanal warts doesn't I don't have anal warts sorry Spencer what are you let's talk about anal warts\n\n57:34.000 --> 57:40.000\nno no no doesn't Joel McHale own a steakhouse I was gonna ask that yeah he does in downtown with\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:46.000\nthe Russo brothers with the Russo brothers yeah what's the deal with that you should eat at a steakhouse\n\n57:46.000 --> 57:50.000\nlook the Russo brothers are clearly sending me a message message received I'm sorry that I wasn't\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:55.000\nmore respectful I should have taken some though they they they tease the shit out of all those\n\n57:55.000 --> 58:02.000\ncomic-con fans with that that Troy and Abed clip huh that really when I saw that people are like\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:07.000\ncommunity movie and when I saw the actual clip I was like that's not what that portends you're just\n\n58:07.000 --> 58:12.000\nno you're just believing what you want to be there it was good clickbait and then I was right but\n\n58:12.000 --> 58:17.000\nI'm always right because I'm a genius and no one can make me not smart but I used to have to say it\n\n58:17.000 --> 58:21.000\nwhen it was like what about the community movie thank you I would be like oh Justin Lin will get the\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:25.000\ncommunity movie made because he's got this huge deal and he's like the fast furious guy I mean now\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:32.000\nit's like whoa that's good the Russo brothers being bored and successful is the greatest thing that\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:37.000\ncan happen for a potential community movie is there any theme to the is his name on it is he like\n\n58:37.000 --> 58:43.000\nMike Dicka in Chicago where he has yeah Joel McHale sweet steak

there's nothing you can eat there huh no I'm gonna just look at the knives\n\n01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000\nand they have on display there I'm gonna take a knife and bring my own ballistics dummy in there\n\n01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000\nand do a fucking bunch of kill tests and because Mikhail knows the people there like I was caught\n\n01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000\nI was like these knives are amazing and he's like oh they asked the people about him whatever\n\n01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:39.000\nthis fucking giant bicep the size of a watermelon 1051 steel what do you got the 260 but there I believe\n\n01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000\nthey said the steak knives cost $6,000 each to make yeah they charge you if you take they call the\n\n01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000\npolice right if you put one in your purse and leave and yes I'm implying that only women steal\n\n01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:03.000\nyou're welcome because you know what Dan it's time to even those scales Dan that joke he just said\n\n01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000\nwill kill your career but but they tell you absolutely if you I mean people are very tempted\n\n01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000\nI always tempted I was like I want these fucking knives I was gonna I wanted to ask them about\n\n01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000\nit because I wanted to order them on Amazon or whatever foolish me these fuckers are custom\n\n01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:25.000\nmade by a dwarf in the volcanic planet of Hephaestia and they're I think they said their\n\n01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000\nsix grand each which makes sense because they were like they're like so like do you have\n\n01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000\nproblems with people they're I get the numbers mixed up because they might have also said\n\n01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000\nthere's only 600 of them in existence yeah and I and that they're worth something else\n\n01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000\nbut sometimes people steal them and they simply call the police and they get the knife back\n\n01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000\nbecause it's grand larceny I sell them like if you really want them I think they'll sell\n\n01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000\nyou the song to you at like full price and then they'll only have 599 of them well yeah\n\n01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000\nwait would you you're acting like you know what that's what I read in like they you

got loads of time but\n\n01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000\nnot in a two hour round never works out because this round of fortune is over thank you damn\n\n01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000\nthe guy's name is Will Willis and I love him and I want to fucking hug everybody on that\n\n01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000\nshow can I tell you about the episode of hoarders we watched the other night on the\n\n01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000\nrecommendation of a hoarders addict who for ten seasons it's like they texted somebody\n\n01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000\nand they gave us the top four Hulu recommendations like number one was like this so much poop\n\n01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000\nand pee being stored they store the poop in the pee yeah and I think I was like they\n\n01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000\nsaid do you have a problem with poop and pee I was like fuck no I've seen a million hoarders\n\n01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000\nwhere there's like oh there's poop on your thing who cares what sort of vessels do they\n\n01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000\nstore the poop in the pee it's so bad I literally almost it's like I was gagging watching it\n\n01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000\nbecause it's like full blown but I just it's like they hoard the poop it was it was it was\n\n01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000\nit was a woman who had it's always there's always a tragic story to it and there was\n\n01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000\na woman who had lived with her mom her mom when she moved in with her her mom was a hoarder\n\n01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000\nand her mom was kind of like it whatever I'm not going to like ran out of poop one time\n\n01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000\nthere was a there was a she never forgot it there's always there's always a crazy there's\n\n01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000\nalways this crazy maker break where the person is he has to like they have to like it's\n\n01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000\nmake or break like they're either willing to like they just they kind of like they'll\n\n01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000\ncome they'll come up with some thing and like this woman was like because they kept saying\n\n01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000\nto her like you know you know there's poop and pee everywhere here and she's like yeah\n\n01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000\nI know it's but and it's also it's like musty and they're like no musty is like a thing\n\n01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000\nyou say when there's not poop and pee everywhere but it still smells was there like is it in\n\n01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000\nmason jars or what's going on it was like it was like these these water jugs it was like\n\n01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000\nit was like I guess just even exchange of like you get water from Albertsons and you drink\n\n01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000\nit and then you pee and poop and whatever's left of those just it was it was voluminous\n\n01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000\nit was crazy it was just like piles of these individual canisters but the they kept they\n\n01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000\nkept warning her they're like like like this is this is septic conditions and you can't\n\n01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000\nall this stuff and like usually you expect the person to be in denial about the danger\n\n01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000\nof the conditions and she was in denial about that and then they started the cleaning process\n\n01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000\nand then after and then there was like the chiron that said four four days into the cleaning\n\n01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000\nprocess like whatever her name is she has a meeting with the people in the backyard and\n\n01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000\nshe goes like look guys like all I'm telling you is I get it you're cleaning out the whole\n\n01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000\nhouse everything's going to go and I'm just telling you like you keep throwing away all\n\n01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000\nthis food that I have because you're telling me like it probably has poop in it and I'm\n\n01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000\njust telling you I'm like I need to I need to eat something from that house she's the\n\n01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000\npoop and they were like saying to her like what are you saying that you're like a junkie\n\n01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000\nand that you you need one final blaze of glory before the intervention like you want to eat\n\n01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000\npotentially contaminate and she was just sort of like saying yeah that's that's what it\n\n01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000\nis I want to eat food that might have shit in it like she was it was almost heroic like\n\n01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000\nthat's not that's not that's not any hero I've ever worshiped well it is when you get to\n\n01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000\nthe point where you're like you're like clinging to anything that you're willing to fucking\n\n01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000\nlike you just want a little nibble I find hoarders fascinating because she poops in the food\n\n01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000\nor the food no she's got shit everywhere and then there's people like you're like telling\n\n01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000\nher it seems like the latter seasons of hoarders what they've done now is they've they didn't\n\n01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000\nwant to lose viewers who tune in for the bullying which I don't like I don't like watching people\n\n01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000\ncome into a hoarders place and go like holy shit it's like what the fuck job did you\n\n01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000\nsign up for you asshole like I I like that I like that like the people that are like\n\n01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000\nclinically trained and like they come in the door they go okay all right so what's going\n\n01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000\non with the mouse skeletons you know like valuable to you yeah yeah no I got to keep\n\n01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000\nthose otherwise you never know like and it's like these people are obviously in need of\n\n01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000\nhelp but if you want to help them I just I kind of fetishize that like I like to judge\n\n01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000\nthe judges I I'm like but now what they've done in the latter seasons of hoarders now\n\n01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000\nthey've broken it into this like ghost hunters kind of a story B story where like they'll\n\n01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000\nhave extreme cleaning experts spend the night in the house and so they do night vision like\n\n01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:22.000\nBlair which stuff like there's a turd next to me holy shit I've never cleaned anything\n\n01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:30.000\nthis extreme this old lady's soul has been crushed but but they're like cutting back\n\n01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000\nthe people that I it's like I like I'm inspired by the idea that you know like I have I have\n\n01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:45.000\nrelations to that breed of dysfunction like I but for the grace of God you know have a\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000\nplace that you can see the floor in and I've been in places where it's like I just I'm\n\n01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000\nendlessly fascinated by the ways that you can be in pain and crazy and the different definitions\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000\nand total compulsion that you can pull out of and how you pull those people out of it\n\n01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000\nand stuff and I like like and for me personally as a guy who is teased a lot for hygiene and\n\n01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000\nstuff like that I I find it tremendously I go to that I like going to that well and I've\n\n01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000\nreally never met anybody that wanted to watch hoarders as much as I do so I just never get\n\n01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000\nto see it that much and I understand no one wanting to watch it but I am like I love that\n\n01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:33.000\nI love watching kind people who are like have degrees in the amount of pain you have to\n\n01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000\nhave in order to get this bad and who who and watching them like just just be chill about\n\n01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000\nit and try to reach the person and then watching the person confront their wall like I've\n\n01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000\nI've watched a few and I couldn't really like keep going because I think I saw a few where\n\n01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:58.000\nthe person felt tortured by having the the the the clutter removed and it was like it\n\n01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000\nwas hurtful for them because they're they're they're they're they're losing yeah a stack\n\n01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000\nof newspapers are never going to look at covered in rat droppings but like the losing that\n\n01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000\nwas like having something ripped out of them yeah it's it's really I mean I tell you know\n\n01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000\nit's it that's why it's riveting to me because the outcome isn't always the same it's like\n\n01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.000\nit's it's sometimes it's like okay we got it you you shit and peed in your house so much\n\n01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000\nthat it would cost more to clean it than to tear it down your worst nightmare has arrived\n\n01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000\nlike we don't even want to like sort through it goodbye you're going to you're going to\n\n01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000\nlive with your aunt Stephanie now I thought you were going to talk about poop mountain\n\n01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000\nthe the hoarders of you don't the poop mountain that's that's why I started gagging that\n\n01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000\nthat's probably the episode I'm talking about no there's there was a toilet that had poop\n\n01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000\nup to there they were storing it they decided to stop flushing it they were storing it they\n\n01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000\nwere story they just and I that's what I don't watch the show because I have a gag reflex\n\n01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000\nyeah and they were they they just left the poop in the toilet and they just kept growing\n\n01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000\nand it and there's a picture online just look up hoarders poop no that oh yeah I'm not that's\n\n01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000\nwhy I was sad when he brought it up what I literally is a horde of poop there's a cousin\n\n01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000\nof the show there's an episode of hoarders that I saw a long time ago where the prison had\n\n01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000\nlike cats in the basement and cages and and I was like oh the animal ones fucking me I\n\n01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000\ncan't handle this but apparently there's a and I can't judge these people because what\n\n01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000\ndo I like but like apparently there's a huge audience of people that are like more of the\n\n01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000\nanimals and there's like a whole animal hoarders show or it's just like mainlining that drug\n\n01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:39.000\nlike maybe who's who's dark like like like you know because because they're they're identifying\n\n01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000\nwith the hoarder of all those I don't know I don't know and it's hard I'd be hard pressed\n\n01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000\nto tell you what I'm doing watching it you know how much of it is me punching down and\n\n01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000\nhow much of it is me you know because your old place like your old Wilcox place you weren't\n\n01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000\na hoarder you were just messy and I was I was a fucked up enough guy that you know if the\n\n01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000\nneighbor had a plumbing problem I you know I remember the shame of somebody knocking on\n\n01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000\nmy door and being like fuck well who's this like you know and like just calling through\n\n01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000\nthe people because they can't come in here they're gonna call something they're gonna call\n\n01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000\nthe city I remember like a plug they're gonna call Mountain Dew and Domino's peeps and say\n\n01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000\nthis guy should be working for you I remember I remember like a plumber coming in because\n\n01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000\nsomeone in the neighboring apartment had something wrong with their plumbing and they needed to\n\n01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000\ncome to my place and look at my pipes and I had like not actual shit but shit in the sink\n\n01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000\nlike cardboard just garbage in the sink like the sink was just full of like just like not\n\n01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000\neven just dirty dishes but just like I wasn't even allowed to go in cardboard and shit like\n\n01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000\nin my sink and like I remember the sound of the plumber and just going what the fuck and\n\n01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000\nit's like it's yeah it's like that's part of what's interesting to me is like well I kept\n\n01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000\ndoing it like I got the opposite direction now you have this this expansive well because\n\n01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000\nbecause because palace because whatever is wrong with me I'm graced with a circuit board\n\n01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.000\nthat had an output port on it that that connects to a money machine and I think that's part\n\n01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000\nof it too is my guilt like why I'm fascinated with the neurodiverse community is because\n\n01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000\nI feel a little guilty sometimes of like well why did I get a fucking just like scratch off ticket\n\n01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000\nthat's like when you when you're gross you you don't have to work for a living and everyone\n\n01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000\nlike one micron to the side of me or one lithium drip different from me is like I have to live\n\n01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000\nunder a bridge and the police police are gonna shoot me like like and I'm like like yeah\n\n01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000\nI'm kind of like you know I just like it's just morbid fascination I guess like I maybe\n\n01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000\nI'm looking for maybe I want to know that they also make bad choices like all right yeah\n\n01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000\nbut you you you you you yeah I don't know the bad choice was storing the poop definitely\n\n01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000\nit's like I don't think if I could if I could if I if I didn't get to a if I didn't if I\n\n01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:07.000\ndidn't get to a level while I was knee deep in pizza boxes and and and and pantyhose\n\n01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.000\nand fucking shit like because there was a room in your place that you weren't ashamed\n\n01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000\nto let me or Rob into your apartment but I was not allowed to go into the bedroom because\n\n01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000\nthat door was always closed. That's where the mannequin legs were and like yeah like\n\n01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000\nand Jeffrey Dahmer famously before he started eating people like saw a mannequin in a window\n\n01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000\nthen he then he like hid all night in a store so he could steal the mannequin because he\n\n01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000\nwas like thinking to himself like if only if I had a mannequin maybe I won't have to hurt people\n\n01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000\nand like it was like an open joke with you guys it was like this looks like a serial killer's\n\n01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000\nlair and I'm like yeah I'm always thinking about that stuff I'm like oh jeez what separates me\n\n01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000\non this family tree of of monsters and maybe that's why I'm you know into prison advocacy\n\n01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000\nand stuff not that I do anything about it but I'm like how do we how do we treat our\n\n01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000\nworst people like that that documentary about the the pervert park or whatever where it's\n\n01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000\nlike every single person in there was abused as a child another they got you know anyways\n\n01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000\nanyways but the the the for the by the grace of fucking chaos by the random throws of dice\n\n01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:22.000\nlike my being knee deep in all this garbage and hating myself and being ready to like whatever\n\n01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000\nlike it resulted in me being able to get in a bigger apartment and then and then hire a housekeeper\n\n01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000\nand so then I had a person coming over every week like you you get to a point where you can\n\n01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000\nafford to hire someone that comes over every week they do your laundry they wash your dishes\n\n01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000\nthey swiffer your floor like you're you're done you can be as much a pig as you want and\n\n01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000\nthat's like it's like a video game where it's good when you get that upgrade and you're\n\n01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000\nfucking done like I'm not tested anymore about what kind of filth I would live in if it was\n\n01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:02.000\nup to me to clean up after myself an opportunity what's that you are hoarding opportunity and\n\n01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000\nhoarding opportunity yes no this is not me trying to shame you because like you and I\n\n01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000\nspend a lot of time in hotels you know one that's ever not shamed anybody started a sentence\n\n01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:19.000\nthat way but JFK never famously came out to announce the space program I'm not trying to\n\n01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:30.000\nshame the country however we should go to the moon JFK was Davros sound like Davros I was\n\n01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000\nshaming your impression it was a good enough when I stayed hotel like I unpack my suitcase\n\n01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000\nand when I leave I clean the hotel almost completely before I leave but I've seen you\n\n01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000\ncheck into hotel and instantly there's just debris everywhere like your suitcase explodes\n\n01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000\ninto a cataclysm of underpants and socks and shoes and like I don't know if you're going\n\n01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000\nback to when me and McGathey were together or if that's because I am solo like that but me\n\n01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:07.000\nand McGathey were like the key key master and gatekeeper of we would just somehow just we\n\n01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:15.000\nboth were like I remember we would check into a hotel in Scotland and we just got there and\n\n01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000\nI would knock on your door and I come in and there was just there was not a single bit of\n\n01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000\nfloor that was not covered in suitcase material like whatever you had packed it was just everywhere\n\n01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000\nlike I don't know how you like how yeah how you got there that quickly it looked like yeah\n\n01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000\nyou were sitting Nancy but just in a hurry yeah just sitting Nancy but in a hurry I mean\n\n01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000\nI for my yeah it's like what I when you're alone in a hotel I mean do you like if you\n\n01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000\never check into a hotel alone is it same way if I'm in a hotel alone I throw my duffel bag\n\n01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.000\ndown if you know I'm like like I'm on a I'm on a journey into darkness if I'm alone like\n\n01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:57.000\nso so I'll put I'm actually ironically probably a lot cleaner because I'll just put the bag\n\n01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000\ndown and I there's been trips where I'm like I oh three days in New York time to head back\n\n01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.000\nto LA oh I guess I never unzipped this bag just kind of just wore the same just just flying\n\n01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.000\nhome with my that's how I got shingles pretty sure just like didn't didn't sleep that much\n\n01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000\nnever like the bedspreads perfectly clean you could bounce a quarter off it because I slept\n\n01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:34.000\nhalf on the floor with my head wedged behind the alarm clock I like New York there's a\n\n01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:42.000\ndrawing room on every corner yeah I could live in hotel I love the idea that if I'm\n\n01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000\nstaying in a hotel for three days say I will put the do not disturb on the whole time because\n\n01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000\nI don't really make that much of a mess I don't need new towels every moment like I could\n\n01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000\nuse the same towel for three days and it'll be alright I can sleep in the same bed I'm\n\n01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000\nthe same way yeah but I do like the idea that if you're in the event that I've ever had\n\n01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000\nto stay at a hotel for like a couple weeks the idea that you can take that do not disturb\n\n01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000\nthing off go out and have lunch and come back and you're in a brand new place I love that\n\n01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000\nthat timing has never worked out for me ever right I'm never leaving as I like yeah I've\n\n01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000\nnever I call them I or if I walk down to the lobby I say hey can you have someone come\n\n01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000\nup I'm gonna be out for an hour and a half and can you have someone come and do the do\n\n01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:34.000\nfeels pretentious to me well then tip them I do okay I make a big mess with $20 bills\n\n01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000\nI leave them all over the place that there's your new hoarders episode it's like a big\n\n01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000\nrich monster exploded the best is Canada because the moment you get to Canada you\n\n01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000\ninstantly have four pounds of coins in your pocket because they love metal money there\n\n01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000\nand I think the housekeepers there must just love it because he's like I fuck all this\n\n01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:05.000\nshit and there's like $30 of coins and I found like 10 toonies I love the tunies

I know it's a great season I've seen the\n\n01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.000\nanimatics not not even all of them but it's like amazing like just the team you know it's\n\n01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000\njust a testament to when you get that rare opportunity to keep a team on board and the\n\n01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000\nsame people have to do the same thing again and they get to improve in their own ways\n\n01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000\nlike and it's just the it's just streamlined and amazing yeah when I bumped into like when\n\n01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000\nI go to star burns and I bumped into like Dominic or some of the animators and whatever\n\n01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000\nthey're all just like they have a giant smile on their face which it doesn't seem like they're\n\n01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000\ngoing into the coal mines to go do a hard job they they're really happy about it that's\n\n01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000\nwhat makes me feel good is it generally does seem like people are excited about the show\n\n01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000\nthey like the show and they like working on it like you know I've never really made a\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000\nshow outside Harmon quest so I don't I don't know if that's normal or not normal but it\n\n01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:28.000\nfeels you know cool it's extraordinary my fiance although she was you know she she had\n\n01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000\na show before but she was working with a partner so she just finished rapping her 10 episode\n\n01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000\nthing for quibi and it was remarkable going to the rap party and I've seen the same thing\n\n01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000\nwith your leadership that people are just so grateful to have clarity and vision at the\n\n01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000\nend you know Cody you'll sometimes say to me like well you've done this more than me what\n\n01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000\ndo you think and I'll go no we're not all I've done more than you is what you've done but\n\n01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000\nso differently that we're not I don't have more experience than you anymore like like\n\n01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000\nI've watched Cody confront certain situations politically creatively where it's like you're\n\n01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000\nin post and then somebody's like they've got notes and someone else's got notes and the\n\n01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000\nway that people handle things and stuff and like my only experience is in this sort of\n\n01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000\nlike I don't know this kind of thing where I'm like like yeah you know I gotta nip that\n\n01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000\nin the bud I'm gonna have to tell Ralph that he's not allowed to be in the edit bay anymore\n\n01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000\nthis is this very like like cut and dry like you know not to be too hyperbolic but there's\n\n01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000\nalmost mafioso kind of thing where it's like we're at war and this is an army the war is\n\n01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000\nwith lack of entertainment and we're an army and I'm the general it's not I've come to learn\n\n01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:51.000\nall too late that it is that is not the right way to get things done there's way more like\n\n01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.000\nbeing a hub of a wheel where you actually are dealing with more shit not less shit you're\n\n01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000\nnot MacArthur at the top like someone can be turned into dust for questioning where you\n\n01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000\npark your tank it's like you're in the middle of it getting paid the most and so there's\n\n01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.000\na bunch of people like worrying about shit and you radiate outward calm and leadership\n\n01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000\nand stuff like that I've seen Cody do it and seen you do it and see the difference in how\n\n01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000\nthe production goes and it translates into dollars and cents being saved and you should\n\n01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000\nbe very proud of yourself you're a great showrunner.\n\n01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:35.000\nThank you. It's a real skill it's not a it's something that just you're just good at it.\n\n01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000\nI was very lucky David our line producer is very good and also we have Dominic who Jeff mentioned\n\n01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000\nhe's like this big time guy from Simpsons and King of the Hill and stuff so we had a lot of great people.\n\n01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000\nI went out and like was doing like came over to Starbucks for a meeting or something like that\n\n01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000\nor doing some other podcast thing and some of your I won't say employees but like some\n\n01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000\nof your you know your crew and like animators and directors and whatnot they they looked over\n\n01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000\nand they're like hey like it's the guy from the TV.\n\n01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000\nI forget her name I forget one of the animators she's like or maybe she's an editor but she's\n\n01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.000\nlike like Rosie I won't remember I'm sorry but I'm bad with names but she was like she looked\n\n01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000\nlike she couldn't have been happier to be on the job on that thing and so that has to\n\n01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.000\nthat has to be a trickle down thing from the top of people like liking to show up for work\n\n01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000\nand being proud of what they're creating.\n\n01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000\nYeah it's really cool this season we got who we got we got Matt Gorely we got Kate\n\n01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000\nMakuchi we got Tony Newsome we got Reggie Watts we got Joel Kimbooster we got Jared Logan\n\n01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:48.000\nwe got Darcy Cardin we got Jess McKenna we got Carl Tartt and we got Tom Kenny and they\n\n01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000\nall really nail it.\n\n01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000\nJess McKenna's episode was she the one that did like the legal thing?\n\n01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000\nYeah it was like a legal thing.\n\n01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000\nYeah I mean without doing a spoiler I don't know how much I can spoil but there was a\n\n01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.000\nthing that I think was accidental that she happened there happened to be a legal like\n\n01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.000\na courtroom scene and I don't think that that was by design right?\n\n01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000\nNo we wanted to get Matt Gorely because he obviously did a great skeleton lawyer on Harmon\n\n01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000\nTown right but he couldn't make it for that episode so we got Jess McKenna who was in\n\n01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000\nthe big club.\n\n01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000\nShe apparently went to law school and it was one of the most good law school.\n\n01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000\nShe was like a mock courtroom champ in high school.\n\n01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000\nIt was devastating improv of like what the fuck like how did you?\n\n01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000\nIt was a tour de force.\n\n01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000\nIt really was like I just saw her recently and like that was outstanding.\n\n01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000\nShe's great her podcast is great holy shit.\n\n01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:41.000\nYeah it's a goody and then Tom Kenny of course is just a he's his own machine.\n\n01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000\nHe's I don't know it really feels like it escalates like towards the end and he really\n\n01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000\nhe's screaming in the end of the episode and it's like man what a great way to finish\n\n01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000\noff this.\n\n01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000\nHave you seen his band Tom Kenny in the high seas?\n\n01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000\nNo.\n\n01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000\nHas anybody?\n\n01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000\nYeah it's he sings like a soul singer like he's like Otis Redding or Sam Cook and he\n\n01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000\nhe has a giant band there's three women backup vocalists are great there's a bunch of horns\n\n01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000\nthey all have captain's hats on and he just screams for a living and never loses his voice\n\n01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000\nlike he like SpongeBob doing soul music is very exciting.\n\n01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000\nAt the end of Hollywood's life Tom Kenny is going to be standing outside the gates as\n\n01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000\nthe rest of it burns down behind him and he's going to be like I guess I won.\n\n01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000\nYeah.\n\n01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000\nHe's such an odd character on the chessboard of LA.\n\n01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000\nWe were having dinner just ran into him and him and Jill Talley his wife was awesome also\n\n01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:40.000\nand just like sitting next to them it's just like he has this ability to really make you\n\n01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000\nhappy and it doesn't seem like a put on he's just he just has childlike glee at all times.\n\n01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000\nNo he's definitely one of those guys that you'd have every opportunity to like second\n\n01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:55.000\nguess his glow and go like well that must come at the cost of being disingenuous somehow\n\n01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000\nor like you're so on I don't think he's ever been on this show has he?\n\n01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000\nNo.\n\n01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:07.000\nBut you should bring Tom and Jill along and while I'm thinking of it Levy.\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000\nHe takes out his phone.\n\n01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000\nIf you're not too busy with your vampire girlfriend you can't take a photograph.\n\n01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000\nAndy kindler.\n\n01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000\nWe got the kindles back.\n\n01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:24.000\nWe got the Andy kindler and Tom Kenny on in in in respect to some religion like are the\n\n01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000\nare the Gandalf and Saruman of.\n\n01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:34.000\nKindler so he's so he goes so dark God damn he's funny but anyways also we got we got Dave\n\n01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000\nFoley he wants to be on the show too.\n\n01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000\nYeah it's good to see him again.\n\n01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000\nI saw I saw Mark McKinney in San Diego and he was there with his fully adult son it's\n\n01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:48.000\nso weird to like look at like colleagues people the people that you admired when you were\n\n01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:55.000\na kid and then you're like McKinney and I are both the same puffiness we're the same age\n\n01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000\nyou know like we I I really like like hanging out with that guy and he's a delight and like\n\n01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000\nI've I ran into him in San Diego and then and then went to see Tom Kenny at the farmers\n\n01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000\nmarket and Scott Thompson is walking Scott Thompson is sitting there with Dave Foley\n\n01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000\nover there.\n\n01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000\nI guess it's like the we did a show in Winnipeg with Foley and you know the who's live anyway\n\n01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000\nthing and that's where Kevin McDonald lives.\n\n01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000\nKevin came to the show we brought him on stage and I sat in the green with him and I just\n\n01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000\nhugged him and he instantly just hugs you back.\n\n01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000\nHe's like he's everything you want out of Kevin McDonald.\n\n01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000\nHe's just a little love bug.\n\n01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000\nIt's really good.\n\n01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000\nThey all used to hate each other but they hated each other.\n\n01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.000\nThey're Canadian.\n\n01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000\nThey maybe like they didn't share a bus one time.\n\n01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.000\nWell I think I think I think some of them got along with some of them hate each other.\n\n01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:53.000\nWell they've lived of whatever like like they they they all definitely like each other.\n\n01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000\nIt's fun going down like being Atlanta with Dave Foley and he's sober now and he's been\n\n01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000\nsober for like I think like seven or eight years.\n\n01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000\nOh yeah I was arrested there.\n\n01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.000\nI passed out there was arrested like you get the Dave Foley kind of remembering where he\n\n01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000\nwas been in the world before a tour.\n\n01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000\nIt's great.\n\n01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000\nThank you sir.\n\n01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000\nThat guy loves it.\n\n01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:23.000\nI will say it's like like Dave and Scott are like when you look at their faces I don't\n\n01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000\nknow if Scott Thompson like drinks a lot but like that face app thing that was going around\n\n01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000\nwhere it's like all it does is just like you know it doesn't like those guys both they\n\n01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000\njust it's like okay clearly you're older put at the same time like it's not none of the\n\n01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000\nbad things it's simply just adding like lines of distinction.\n\n01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.000\nBut they still have a weird kind of childlike cherubic kind of thing going on.\n\n01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000\nThey're aging the way we all love.\n\n01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000\nThat's I think if that's not important also your body's not important.\n\n01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000\nI heard that app was the Russians.\n\n01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.000\nYeah shout out to all you people as I share my I'm like oh here's a pic of me or a video\n\n01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000\nof me diving into my pool.\n\n01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000\nThank you so much everybody for your constructive criticism about my body from the people that\n\n01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000\nthink I skip leg day to the people that think that my legs are great and I need to work\n\n01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.000\non my upper body to the people that just want to say I look like a caramel apple.\n\n01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000\nA ton of people just being like fucking awesome and just going like like like I don't want\n\n01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.000\nto say what you should say but what I would say to you if I was your if I was following\n\n01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000\nyou and you were like here's me jumping in a pool and I had anything to say I'm pretty\n\n01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:44.000\nsure I would either say hey you look fucking great like I love you or I'd shut the fuck\n\n01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000\nup.\n\n01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000\nI just think it's a but I think it's amazing like all the people that are like dude you\n\n01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000\nneed to fucking work on your thighs and your legs so instead of like you click on every\n\n01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000\nsingle one of their names not that I've done this.\n\n01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000\nAlways a locked account always because they're so proud of physical like like like beauty\n\n01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000\nand they're so focused on it that they love their life and they can't wait to celebrate\n\n01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000\nthe shape of their body and they just that's why they have a locked account and they just\n\n01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:18.000\ngo and comment on other people's pages your legs are too skinny.\n\n01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:24.000\nYou know what every bit of carbon dioxide that you exhale turns into fucking oxygen\n\n01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.000\nthrough me I'm a plant apparently or a drunk mammal that's running other things to say.\n\n01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.000\nYou actually might be a caramel apple.\n\n01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000\nI may be a caramel apple look I did notice it too I do look a little it's a little odd\n\n01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000\nI think it might be a little bit of field of view thing like I definitely like I'm I\n\n01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:53.000\nthink it's a combination of not dieting drinking whenever I want but still working out and\n\n01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000\nlike lifting and stuff like that plus just like but surprisingly we were in the pool\n\n01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000\nplaying pool sports where we took some of their dogs like tennis ball like little like\n\n01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000\nchew toys and we were just pitching it around and your hand-eye coordination is\n\n01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000\nfantastic like you like you're like you got a baseball player's like mitt on your\n\n01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000\nI don't know why playing catch is fun in a pool but if you try to do it on land it'd be\n\n01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000\nlike fuck you bully.\n\n01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000\nIt's because you can fall.\n\n01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000\nThere's something really fun about it like throwing a ball back and forth.\n\n01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000\nBecause if you miss it you get to go swim over to it it's exciting it's really good.\n\n01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000\nI'm so sunburned right now I'm just pink.\n\n01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000\nI like my upper my upper body is.\n\n01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000\nYou got it.\n\n01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000\nSorry Katelyn sorry too soon.\n\n01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nNot cool.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000\nKatelyn you're saying 20 minutes and what happens to you do you just roast or what?\n\n01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000\nI get I'm pink right now from 10 minutes of my sunscreen wearing off.\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000\nUnder the stage lights?\n\n01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000\nI actually got heat rash on my legs from reading Calvin and Hobbes as a kid in my bathroom.\n\n01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000\nI didn't realize that there was a heat lamp above me and I was just reading it because\n\n01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000\nit was the only place I could get away from my family who I love.\n\n01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000\nAnd who are all albino.\n\n01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000\nYeah just my brother's just yeah I realized that something was wrong when I could get heat\n\n01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000\nI could get burned from that yeah put on sunscreen.\n\n01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000\nSo it's not just UV light that gets you it's any kind of.\n\n01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000\nEvery kind of everything sucks.\n\n01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000\nConvection radiation anything like that.\n\n01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000\nYeah I'm not a fan.\n\n01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000\nOh man did you did anybody happen to see the is your news algorithm the same as mine where\n\n01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000\nyou get that Fox news story about the British girl that was snorkeling in Cuba?\n\n01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000\nNo.\n\n01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000\nNo.\n\n01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000\nClick at your peril.\n\n01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000\nIt's fucking crazy.\n\n01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000\nWhat happened?\n\n01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000\nHow's she doing?\n\n01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000\nShe lived.\n\n01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000\nThere's just a photo of I've never it's like it's just a British girl who's fair skinned who\n\n01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000\nwas down in Cuba and she swears she put on a million.\n\n01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000\nShe knew she was fair skin and put on all the sunscreen so it's like your instinct for victim\n\n01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000\nblaming like kicks in but it's like she's her parents are like I'm telling you I know teenagers\n\n01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.600\ndon't listen but I we we kept saying put on sunscreen and she kept doing it and she snorkeled\n\n01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.000\nfor an hour and like 30 degrees a goddamn horror show.\n\n01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000\nI've never I didn't know you just described my worst fears.\n\n01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000\nIt looks she said it felt she's she's getting on the plane to go back to England and she\n\n01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000\nsaid it felt like there were water balloons on my back because in fact there were water\n\n01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000\nballoons on her back.\n\n01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000\nYou can't imagine it too extremely like like like like like whatever you could conjure\n\n01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000\nin your head.\n\n01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000\nImagine like we water balloons on a person's back.\n\n01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000\nThat's good.\n\n01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000\nYeah.\n\n01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000\nDevil is alive.\n\n01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000\nThe devil is alive.\n\n01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000\nThe devil is alive.\n\n01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000\nBut I don't know.\n\n01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000\nI don't understand.\n\n01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000\nLike this poor girl.\n\n01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.500\nI mean bless her heart like she's viral because she did have bothered to do a Facebook post.\n\n01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:42.000\nYou'd think like an adolescent girl would be inherently ashamed because something went\n\n01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.500\nwrong with the way she looks or whatever and but she's like the reason she's viral and\n\n01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:54.200\nit ends up on Fox News is because she was I felt like the the tone of her posts was like\n\n01:37:54.200 -->
