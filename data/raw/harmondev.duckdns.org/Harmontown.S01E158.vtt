00:00.000 --> 00:18.400
Now, hello everybody, I am your guest comptroller, Ryan Ridley, Harmontown is now in session.

00:18.400 --> 00:29.920
Please welcome your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, and of course the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan

00:29.920 --> 00:42.520
Harmontown. Thank you very much. Thank you for having me back. Here, here in the City of

00:42.520 --> 00:47.920
Angels. Did you know that's what Los Angeles means? Yeah, of course. So where's the city

00:47.920 --> 00:53.320
part of that? That's a Los Angeles. Where does it, where's the, I know it's enough Spanish to know

00:53.320 --> 00:59.520
we're being taken for a ride. Yeah. It means the city of angels. No, I think it means the angels.

00:59.520 --> 01:06.760
Did you get, or, or, or Los Angeles is like short for some ridiculous, stupid, long name. Did

01:06.760 --> 01:13.840
you guys know that? Los Ciudad de Angeles? No, it's, it's, I mean, it's at least four times that

01:13.840 --> 01:22.720
many syllables, I believe. I don't know it. So this is worthless. I stopped listening because I was,

01:22.720 --> 01:28.680
not because, because I'm a flawed person is why I stopped listening. Well, I mean, you made the

01:28.680 --> 01:35.320
right choice. No, no, don't, don't self deprecate. It was a dead end. How are you doing, Ridley? I'm

01:35.320 --> 01:40.840
good. I'm a lot less nervous than the last time I was here. Yeah. Still more nervous than Jeff,

01:40.840 --> 01:47.720
though. Oh God, yeah. Yeah. Of course. He's never, is he ever nervous? Any, any time? I think he

01:47.720 --> 01:56.600
channels it via like tubes down his back, like actual, actual visible tubes down like, that's why

01:56.600 --> 02:05.600
he always wears a suit. It's, it's to mask his, his dune armor that like goes into his balls,

02:05.600 --> 02:13.280
obviously, because the more nervous he should be, the bigger his balls get, which makes you go,

02:13.280 --> 02:25.640
oh, he's not nervous. And he's like, not anymore. Not thanks to ball direct. And, and, and some of

02:25.640 --> 02:33.280
you ladies, and I'm not, I, I, I, I, my, my, my strong fierce, totally equal agency addicted

02:33.280 --> 02:40.800
Armenian females. You're going, what's the big deal with balls? What about the puffy parts of

02:40.800 --> 02:51.240
the labia? Is that the, do you don't, you don't go by where just the part where on the body where

02:51.240 --> 02:58.400
it hangs down? Yeah. No. All right. I'll keep researching. I was, I was trying to come in,

02:58.400 --> 03:01.480
you know, I was trying to be an understanding man, but I guess I need to look into it a little

03:01.480 --> 03:16.720
more. I know it's the ovaries. Okay, so my lovely speaking of labia, my wife, Erin McGathy, or as

03:16.720 --> 03:22.480
they call her in her homeland, Erin McGathy, she's over in Ireland right now. She left for New

03:22.480 --> 03:30.160
York to go on an out a month long vision quest. You said something like identity quest is what

03:30.160 --> 03:37.120
I said identity quest because vision quest sat, we say that now to, I think impune. If your friend,

03:37.120 --> 03:45.760
Kevin, you know, sarcastic, yeah, you're kind of like, Oh, Kevin's on his vision. Walk about, maybe

03:45.760 --> 03:52.720
we should bring back vision quest is kind of like, we need to let that soil heal. And let me shed

03:52.720 --> 03:57.800
an extra tear for the Native American people who came up with the vision quest as far as I know,

03:57.800 --> 04:06.160
only to see it go from being magical to hack. Like, imagine that they're like, now that first,

04:06.160 --> 04:14.600
first my life, then, then all this litter in the seven days. Now, now my comedic chops.

04:14.600 --> 04:22.280
They get it, they get a tough break. No, I'm, no, I'm the new Abe Lincoln,

04:22.280 --> 04:30.520
says a guy who's effectively slaughtered by Lincoln, slaughtered by him. Every slave he

04:30.520 --> 04:39.960
freed cost an Indian a life. Look it up. Don't look it up. Don't look it up because I'm afraid

04:39.960 --> 04:46.160
I'm wrong. Don't look it up because let's, don't, don't, don't spend your night that way. Don't,

04:46.160 --> 04:50.320
don't, don't look it up because you have people in your life that need you and neighbors that are

04:50.320 --> 04:55.000
afraid of you. I don't even know how you'd look that up. What would that even look like in a Google

04:55.000 --> 05:00.760
search? What would the results be? I don't want to answer the question because they'd have to break

05:00.760 --> 05:07.480
it down into funny things about actual genocidal statistics. Speaking of statistics, I don't know.

05:07.480 --> 05:14.040
I don't want to jump to that. Erin's in Ireland and she's done it different times outside. I don't

05:14.040 --> 05:19.560
know. She's sending me police brutality statistics. So we'll get, we'll check in with her department

05:19.560 --> 05:26.600
and just a while we've got, we've got Fred, Fred Rickson on the Fred floor. Fred, how's it go

05:26.600 --> 05:31.680
down with all those friends? Well, the friends are spread from floor to ceiling. It's a Fred room.

05:31.680 --> 05:38.760
All right, Fred. We'll more on that later. Now we go to Steve. Steve, what's going on in Hawaii?

05:38.760 --> 05:43.480
Well, I bet you thought there was going to be steves here, but I'm just in Hawaii. Back to you,

05:43.480 --> 05:53.720
Rick. Fred, Fred, are you okay? Oh my God, Fred's drowning in Fred's. Steve, do something. I'm in

05:53.720 --> 06:04.040
Hawaii, Rick. I can't do anything. Was your name Rick? So, so she's in Hawaii. She's not in Hawaii.

06:04.040 --> 06:18.040
She's in, she's in Ireland, Erin. And, you know, I had to, I, I, I have to, you know, I have, like,

06:18.040 --> 06:26.960
I like, you know, I was like, like, she was, she was registering a satyr things earlier before me,

06:26.960 --> 06:30.880
and then checking it with me and going, you know, I'm leaving for a month. And I'm like, yeah,

06:30.880 --> 06:36.280
yeah. And then she's like, well, are you sad that I'm leaving for a month? And I'm like,

06:36.280 --> 06:42.360
yeah, of course, I feel these things differently than you, you know, like, and I do. And I did.

06:42.360 --> 06:49.880
And I, but, and then I like an hour before she, her car pulled up to the hotel in New York,

06:49.880 --> 07:01.120
I was like, I just wave of panic with a maximum of three days ever. And I'm not seeing this person. And,

07:01.120 --> 07:07.120
and yeah, just, and then I was so excited to text her, I'm really pumped out. And she was like,

07:07.120 --> 07:15.520
yay. So, you know, stuck her in a car and off she goes to the airport to go to Ireland, her,

07:15.520 --> 07:23.280
her, her ancestral homeland, where she's, it's, it's a, it's a, you did that, you did the Israeli

07:23.280 --> 07:30.720
version of this. This is a, it's a goy kibbutz. Much more dangerous. Not that it's a competition,

07:30.720 --> 07:39.360
but I was definitely risking my life more. We must have talked about this on the show. But when

07:39.360 --> 07:44.200
you went, I had all other friends that went to Israel and did the thing and they said that they

07:44.200 --> 07:55.480
were decoy bus stops, decoy bus secret, secret real bus stops down in a secret place and then a big

07:55.480 --> 08:03.000
fake public Sesame Street bus stop for, for getting blown up. So it still results in people getting

08:03.000 --> 08:10.640
blown up? No, no, no, they don't send people to, no, it's they tell everybody, just for Jews,

08:10.640 --> 08:19.920
the secret, it's a secret. But look, I heard this from a Jewish guy. This is not me. I'm, I will

08:19.920 --> 08:24.880
be very happy to find out this isn't true. I mean, you guys sound like Smurfs a little bit. Well,

08:24.880 --> 08:32.040
nobody told me about the secret bus stops. I bet it was like one thing. I bet it was like a,

08:32.040 --> 08:37.480
I bet it was like a, I bet that's an urban legend created from somebody. I, from like one stretch

08:37.480 --> 08:43.200
of road where they built a, you know, like it was some apocryphal, like based on a real one real

08:43.200 --> 08:49.480
incident. The closest ever, I was in a bus stop in the West Bank and there was a concrete slab

08:49.480 --> 08:54.840
next to it. And they said it was because the snipers protected you from snipers. Just that was

08:54.840 --> 08:57.800
real. Just while you're at the West Bank, because that's where all the money is or

08:57.800 --> 09:07.320
that's the opposite. That's where all the money is not. When they, when they added the ATMs at

09:07.320 --> 09:15.800
the West Bank, they had to, they had to add a sniper barrier. Oh God, Dan. Get them while they're

09:15.800 --> 09:22.680
withdrawing their money from the West Bank. I'm going to look it up later and I'm going to have

09:22.680 --> 09:28.320
a really smart conversation about Israel. On the same side is the Indians slaves. Yes. Yeah. So

09:28.320 --> 09:35.800
geopolitically, I'm on it. And, and my, and so what, what Erin is on is sort of a, yeah, it's the,

09:35.800 --> 09:44.520
it's the, she, it's not, she, it's, it's like a website that like, I don't even know. I can't

09:44.520 --> 09:51.520
describe it without making it sound silly. It's a, it's a, it's a website that pairs people that

09:51.520 --> 09:58.320
are looking to travel with a organic farm, like non-profit kind of, a network of, a non-profit

09:58.320 --> 10:04.400
network of organic farms or businesses that, and then the people can go and like, I think work for

10:04.400 --> 10:09.480
room and board, but then you get to just stay there for, you know, so, so, you told me it was an

10:09.480 --> 10:16.000
Irish kebuts. An Irish kebuts. And then I understood what you meant. Yeah. What, what's a non-Irish kebuts?

10:16.000 --> 10:27.000
A kebuts. What is? The kind in Israel, I guess. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna describe a real kebuts

10:27.000 --> 10:32.320
because I, I'm, I, it'll somehow I'll walk over some tripwire. Say something anti-semitic again.

10:32.320 --> 10:37.120
Yeah. I'll, I'll sound, I won't say something anti-semitic. Talk in your description, possibly

10:37.120 --> 10:45.440
be more offensive than the ATM flypaper. Well, that's not, okay. See, you're drawing the anti-semitic

10:45.440 --> 10:50.760
dots of like, Jews and money. I get what you're drawing. The line came out of your mouth between

10:50.760 --> 11:05.640
the two dots. West, west bank, bank, it's a, the word bank. Oh my God. Wait, no one, that was just a

11:05.640 --> 11:14.800
horrible coincidence. Wait, so you guys were just hanging out in a world where I like, hate Jews

11:14.800 --> 11:20.480
and, and then I think it's hilarious that I hate them. And then I'm like, well, I got one. They're

11:20.480 --> 11:26.880
getting their money because they're Jews. I've been hanging out in that world for 10 years. That's

11:26.880 --> 11:32.320
as long as I've known you. Well, can somebody, can you put a special tone in the podcast recording?

11:32.320 --> 11:39.120
Because if they're a test group, then 2 million people are about to think that I, and they won't

11:39.120 --> 11:48.640
wait this long. You can't delete the Vulture headline. You can't unwrite the 20 pages that are

11:48.640 --> 11:56.760
about to get published in salon that you can write in 10 minutes. I think it'd be fine. I'm your

11:56.760 --> 12:14.000
Robin Quivers. All right. What's a kibbutz? It's like a commune, basically. Oh, in Israel. That's

12:14.000 --> 12:28.240
all it is. Okay. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what a commune is? Oh, yeah. Okay. Very disappointing.

12:28.240 --> 12:35.400
You go and you, you ho, you ho a potato or what's a Jewish potato? What's an Israeli potato? A lot.

12:35.400 --> 13:03.640
Oranges, actually. What did you say? A latke. A latke. You know, I was going to make that joke. I was like, say latke, it'll get a laugh. And I was like, no, give the real information. And I said oranges. Or dates. I was just so shaken by the bank thing. Like I was just like, yeah, I'm six years old. It's a bank, right? And everyone's like, Oh my God. But you were still talking about how the Jews were

13:03.640 --> 13:12.600
coming there to get money out. Well, who cares? Yeah, I'm not dumb. Like I'm not, I'm not, I'm not Peter Sellers and being there. I'm not, I'm not like, Oh, I'm so innocent. I'm just saying like my intent couldn't have been

13:12.600 --> 13:41.160
worth it. I was doing dumb wordplay. Yeah, I can still call them Jews and say that they're going there. I didn't mean that it wasn't making the. Yeah. No, oh, no, no. Okay, so Aaron's in Ireland. She's on a kibbutz, essentially, which you know, you now know what that is. I do. And she's gone. She's

13:41.160 --> 14:02.520
she's she's she's ethereal. She's watching. She's right there. But I mean, I can't touch her. And I thought, you know, the car drives away. And I went I had a little I had a little surprise cry in like a bathroom. But like, and then I was like, but I really and I pushed it down. There was the wrong kind of laugh from the back.

14:02.520 --> 14:22.000
Thank you. We now live in a world where we know the different kinds of laughs. That was a was the wrong kind of laugh. I'm not I'm not judging you. You're free to stay. But I know you are judging me. And I'm calling you out. Hashtag cancel the back row.

14:22.000 --> 14:51.000
So so, I but then so then I suppress it all and I suppress it with the fabric of I go, I get to play really, really uninterrupted video games, like, I don't think and I don't I don't I don't think that, you know, Aaron, the truth is Aaron never stopped me, you know, she was never the reason. But there was just like I just mean with impunity with no guilt, no shame, you know, like,

14:52.000 --> 14:56.580
Which is a dangerous thing because I have a lot of shit to do like Erin would always be she's like

14:56.580 --> 15:00.300
It's five in the morning, and I'd be like so what you're not my real mom

15:02.260 --> 15:06.740
But now it's just like oh shit, I forgot to feed the fish or something

15:06.740 --> 15:09.460
You know I was like I stuff will grow on me if I'm not careful

15:10.740 --> 15:18.420
So but but still I'm very excited and I and I hook up the the shadows of Mordor a game

15:18.460 --> 15:20.460
Yeah, these kids know what I'm talking about

15:20.460 --> 15:23.020
They like they like the shadows of Mordor

15:24.020 --> 15:31.780
And they're going through the tutorial, you know every video game now has the you know action video game has like the the parts where

15:31.820 --> 15:37.660
You know they they sometimes they work it into the narrative. Sometimes they just go. Hey, here's a tutorial a lot of them seem

15:38.380 --> 15:42.820
Hard-pressed to work into the narrative. I don't know why you couldn't just say me in the training part

15:42.820 --> 15:50.300
Yeah, I was like like it seems like we were about 15 years in now of all video games being ironic and working it into the narrative

15:50.300 --> 15:53.460
Mm-hmm. I don't know if I think they're putting too much effort on themselves

15:53.460 --> 15:55.260
I think I know I mean I don't play a lot of video games

15:55.260 --> 15:58.940
You're talking about in elder scrolls when you're in the prison and you in oblivion and you get

16:00.940 --> 16:01.740
That's good

16:01.740 --> 16:04.260
That's like a good version of it because you're doing real stuff

16:04.260 --> 16:08.940
But it's like the bad ones are like your friend winslow comes over and he's like for old-time stick

16:08.940 --> 16:10.940
Why don't you wave the stick around?

16:15.540 --> 16:20.060
You know I thought the weird the weird ones are the ones where they're actually telling you that

16:20.060 --> 16:22.060
I think the weirdest one so far is

16:22.700 --> 16:28.660
New Vegas because they your character is waking up from a near-fatal head wound

16:29.300 --> 16:33.820
A doctor has fixed your brain and is doing a checkup on you

16:33.820 --> 16:37.260
And so so he wants to make sure your brain works, right?

16:37.260 --> 16:38.900
So he asks you to

16:38.900 --> 16:44.860
Associate certain things and the whole time you're like well come on. I know I'm I know I know when you ask me that what you really mean is

16:44.940 --> 16:46.940
Do I want to be a demolitions expert?

16:46.940 --> 16:52.660
Uh-huh, but it also just weird that you're asking me to form my own brain from a head injury

16:52.660 --> 16:55.100
Like I'm always gonna think whatever I blow myself up later

16:55.100 --> 17:00.420
I'm gonna be like I bet I was supposed to be a sniper and I bet I'm and I bet they shot the judgment part out of my brain

17:01.420 --> 17:03.420
So I'm a monster in this game

17:03.660 --> 17:08.300
Anyways the so but they but they they always walk you through. Okay. Here's how you crouch

17:08.300 --> 17:14.180
Here's how you run here's how you and what are the big things this stealth attack at the beginning of of

17:14.180 --> 17:16.460
of

17:16.460 --> 17:23.100
Shadows of Mordor you're learning how to stealth attack, but they do a very clever thing because they're also weaving this horrible tragic thing

17:23.100 --> 17:29.060
But this guy who's lost his wife to orcs and goblins and things he's woke up woken up as a half-dead

17:29.660 --> 17:36.660
Wraith like being who's tied to another being's curse to be a spirit of vengeance against these orcs and mourners

17:37.100 --> 17:39.100
such an awesome game and

17:39.100 --> 17:46.460
The but and and so you you're having flashbacks as your tutorials on how to operate the character

17:46.460 --> 17:48.380
so the way you learn to

17:48.380 --> 17:55.100
Stealth kill people is like two minutes into the game where I'm like alright like I cried

17:55.100 --> 17:57.020
I missed my wife

17:57.020 --> 17:58.220
but

17:58.220 --> 18:00.420
Fucking on the other hand, huh?

18:01.540 --> 18:03.540
shadows of Mordor

18:03.540 --> 18:08.900
I know this and I wrote it down because it's it at the bottom of the screen you have it you literally have a

18:09.460 --> 18:11.460
bouquet of flowers in your hand and

18:11.780 --> 18:19.420
Your wife is up ahead and it and you it teaches you stealth by you hiding so that you can surprise her better

18:20.100 --> 18:24.420
And it says at the bottom of the screen while in stealth press X to kiss your wife

18:28.100 --> 18:30.100
And I just

18:30.100 --> 18:32.100
I

18:32.980 --> 18:36.180
Didn't start balling. I fucking nailed her. I gave her the flowers

18:37.700 --> 18:40.380
I'm gonna kick ass at splitting people's throats on this game

18:40.380 --> 18:43.620
But but I was giving her a flower that I was just crying

18:43.700 --> 18:47.940
That's like the equivalent of the wax on wax off like you learn

18:51.580 --> 18:53.580
You're slitting orc's throat

18:53.580 --> 18:56.540
You're saying for me or you for the character the character

18:56.540 --> 19:03.140
I think the character of the game learned how to slit throats, huh? They're not teaching you that he's learning how to

19:03.700 --> 19:05.700
Using flowers

19:10.460 --> 19:17.020
The craziest like mentor in the world because of his romance training he's able to be an elite assassin

19:17.020 --> 19:27.820
Yeah, or because he's such a lethal assassin recognizes the to kill his nose to love This is like a downer

19:27.820 --> 19:32.540
But there's like a call-a-duty game where like you attend a funeral and you can press X

19:32.540 --> 19:35.580
So you're supposed to press X to pay respects to the fallen

19:35.860 --> 19:40.420
But you can mess up like if you don't approach it at the wrong angle like you could press

19:40.420 --> 19:47.820
It'll also pop up press like control pad to vault over the gravestone. It's just some bad

19:48.820 --> 19:55.980
I love I love those unintentional social the things that like all video games have that to the extent that they try to simulate reality

19:56.300 --> 20:00.900
Try to simulate a world and individuality. There's always these gaps where it just it's like

20:01.220 --> 20:03.580
It's hilarious like like unavoidably

20:04.540 --> 20:08.700
sociopathic like the which are three that they like you walk into a guy's hut and

20:08.700 --> 20:15.540
He and and you go hey, I'm here about the thing you put on the board. Oh, yes, my Jessica

20:15.540 --> 20:21.060
Oh, they found her bones outside the troll cave, but the blood trail let off the cliff

20:21.060 --> 20:27.620
I keep telling the preacher that her soul won't come back tormented, but he's making me tie this ear to a branch

20:28.540 --> 20:34.660
I'm afraid ghouls will come and try to eat me because they'll be attracted by the my daughter's rotting human flesh

20:34.660 --> 20:42.060
So could you come with me and just stave off the ghouls so I can summon my daughter's ghost and just murder her

20:42.220 --> 20:44.220
With the arms of her lover

20:44.700 --> 20:47.220
To banish her soul for all of eternity

20:47.980 --> 20:54.300
And I'll give you I'll give you 20 silver pieces and then and then just just one of your four options is like

20:54.700 --> 20:56.700
How about a hand of Gwent?

20:57.980 --> 21:02.460
Which is like this card game and the thing it's just it's just like you

21:02.460 --> 21:05.100
Just going you know checkers

21:05.100 --> 21:11.120
Oh, you want it you're asking me if you'd rather play Gwent instead or you're offering them a deck of Gwent you're

21:12.300 --> 21:16.580
My punchline demands of really religious knowledge of what you're three

21:18.060 --> 21:23.940
And I apologize for that I was on a I was on a roll halfway through and I was like this is this train is not coming

21:23.940 --> 21:28.740
To the station they think it is and I could have ripped something, but then it would have been like I would you would have gotten like

21:28.740 --> 21:30.740
Why would you play checkers and I

21:30.740 --> 21:33.640
Stuck I tried I'm really sorry about everything that happened

21:36.020 --> 21:38.680
But but all those RPG games they're always like

21:39.180 --> 21:41.580
You know there's like somebody that's like they're just talking forever

21:41.940 --> 21:47.660
Sometimes about like corpses of their ancestors and stuff and you can always just go like so what have you got for sale?

21:49.500 --> 21:53.620
Because they just happen to also be a blacksmith could you make me a hammer?

21:53.620 --> 21:58.580
I love the idea of a guy that would really be like that

22:01.180 --> 22:03.180
People

22:05.580 --> 22:07.580
Listen about that thing earlier

22:08.700 --> 22:15.020
Here's your hammer so your wife. Oh God. Thank God. I guess you're just like a strange person, but I

22:15.020 --> 22:22.060
I hear I as I said at the top of the conversation your reputation precede you

22:25.060 --> 22:29.300
I'm very disturbed because I have shadows and borders and they're great. It's like a Batman thing

22:29.300 --> 22:32.580
Hey, what's this the video game show? I don't know. What did you think it was Troy?

22:34.220 --> 22:36.340
Is that somebody in the audience your picture? Yeah?

22:37.740 --> 22:39.740
Yeah, raise your hand Troy

22:39.740 --> 22:44.740
And your name might not be Troy. I hate video games, and I love Dan Harmon

22:46.620 --> 22:50.740
So I I did that person deserves actually a lot of attention

22:52.340 --> 22:54.340
I think I'm Troy

22:57.260 --> 23:02.580
But I just I'm just talking about in general like like you don't have to have any familiarity with video games for this conversation to

23:02.580 --> 23:10.060
Happen so as I've often said the thing that I love most about these video games is inventory management. I

23:11.700 --> 23:15.580
Love I love no matter what the games like I demand that it be really good

23:15.580 --> 23:21.500
But you know with the combat that I gotta kill a dinosaur and I gotta but I will always like 90% of the game as

23:21.980 --> 23:26.700
Anybody that's ever come into my home will tell you like it's just me that it's just a screen of tax

23:26.700 --> 23:28.700
And I'm just like sorting cabinets

23:28.700 --> 23:30.700
I

23:31.100 --> 23:37.700
Said and then once I do like I stop playing like I'm like these are my fishing rods. These are my

23:38.660 --> 23:44.420
Magical swords. These are these are my swords that I'm probably gonna sell because let's face it. I don't need them, but I

23:45.660 --> 23:50.140
Also don't need the money at this point because I kind of gotta think down to a system

23:51.100 --> 23:52.380
These are my wolf pelts

23:52.380 --> 23:58.460
These are my uncured wolf pelts because the thing is if you there's a guy in the other town that if you sell them to him

23:58.460 --> 24:02.060
He'll give you an extra gold piece if you do that a thousand times you that's a good way to spend an hour

24:04.500 --> 24:09.500
I just like I I'm obsessed I become obsessed with these things that I'm not obsessed with in real life

24:09.660 --> 24:13.260
But then the other the only other thing that I like Ryan

24:13.700 --> 24:18.340
Yeah, and this is this is come this is a segment called

24:18.340 --> 24:21.500
dark confessions

24:22.780 --> 24:27.420
Is there a music cue for I know I'm hitting you kind of off-card there

24:28.740 --> 24:30.740
Yeah

24:33.340 --> 24:35.140
Yeah

24:35.140 --> 24:40.780
So I the shadows of murder made me look friendly I connected the dots because I'm like why not I like this game

24:40.780 --> 24:47.340
I like Assassin's Creed. I like the Batman games. I like these aspects of these games. I like stalking and killing

24:47.340 --> 24:54.260
Yeah, I like specifically stalking and killing. Yeah, not fair fighting people

24:54.780 --> 24:58.140
Not being honorable. Like I like creepy

24:58.980 --> 25:00.980
Horrible I know this actually

25:01.540 --> 25:06.140
Like creepy like like like like like 70s serial killer

25:06.140 --> 25:09.860
You don't remember because we were the one time I did play video games ten years ago

25:09.860 --> 25:14.700
We were both playing oblivion and I found out that that was the difference between you and me

25:14.700 --> 25:18.300
Because I like to go charging into battle with the sword

25:18.860 --> 25:23.380
Swinging face-to-face with my opponents and you're like no I sneak up behind them and slip their throats

25:23.380 --> 25:25.380
And I was like what's the fun in that?

25:26.220 --> 25:29.420
Because you're because it's a lot. It's like not playing the game

25:31.900 --> 25:36.300
Who is the time I do I do

25:37.380 --> 25:40.660
Like if you would watch me well now you can with twitch

25:40.660 --> 25:46.180
But if you want but but but I would have like if you see me the way that I play video games

25:46.180 --> 25:52.980
Well, I'm like I like it's just I'm always thinking like like I'll just find some fucking cabinet or like like a little

25:53.100 --> 25:56.220
Railing or something where like it's shaped weird so the

25:57.100 --> 26:00.900
Wiggle in there and then the mind just wait for the monsters to go

26:05.140 --> 26:07.140
And then I'm like coward bomb

26:07.140 --> 26:11.020
And it takes like two damage away and they're like

26:12.020 --> 26:16.220
And I'm like I got you motherfucker. Yeah hole in the system

26:17.460 --> 26:21.420
It may only be two points of damage, but it's it adds up baby

26:21.420 --> 26:29.460
And so then someone will come in the room and go what are you doing? And I'll go I'm slowly blowing up an elephant gorilla

26:30.660 --> 26:33.100
That I could probably kill with three hits, but

26:33.100 --> 26:37.340
Then I'd have to suffer the indignity of that fucking thing touching me

26:39.500 --> 26:45.180
Thinking that it's better than me. I just I like these guys like these I like these shadows of Mordor is like

26:45.180 --> 26:49.380
It's the ultimate. This is the thing. It's like this is why I now know what I've been doing

26:49.740 --> 26:56.260
In with video games my whole life because shadows of Mordor says it you get your throat slit in the beginning of the game

26:56.260 --> 27:00.100
And you wake up a ghost man in hell world

27:00.100 --> 27:06.660
So you kind of don't belong there, but so like everyone's expendable. There's no guilt

27:06.860 --> 27:13.300
Everyone's an asshole. You're an asshole land which is run by the people that already killed you your wife's already dead

27:13.300 --> 27:18.860
Your kids are already dead. You have no idea what's going on, but there's a ghost man saying you have ghost powers now

27:18.860 --> 27:20.860
Go fucking kill people

27:21.460 --> 27:24.940
And but but and here's how you really kill him nice like over you get behind

27:24.940 --> 27:30.940
Oh, if you press the X button, then you just rub their windpipe and you suck their life essence into your sword

27:30.940 --> 27:36.060
And then you take your sword you stick it and the sword gets more power the harder you choke them

27:37.740 --> 27:43.860
And once your sword's full you can stick it in a stone and get a bigger hand for choking two throats at once

27:43.860 --> 27:45.860
I

27:59.660 --> 28:05.860
Dark confessions I fear now as a 42 year old like like as we enter the world of increased like virtual

28:05.860 --> 28:13.580
I now I now I'm now I'm my mom like now. I'm ready to say this is gonna be trouble

28:14.220 --> 28:17.980
Like now I'm willing to say I think of a 14-year-old kid could put on a helmet

28:17.980 --> 28:22.540
Yeah, and like walk around a virtual house with a knife and practice

28:23.140 --> 28:25.460
Being being Michael Myers from Halloween

28:26.140 --> 28:32.820
Like like I that that the kid I don't now I can't now. I don't know now. I'm now. I'm just old

28:32.820 --> 28:36.300
But but but I'm good to get to do it all

28:36.300 --> 28:42.620
But then I'm like a choker in the game wouldn't he be satisfied being Michael Myers and just the VR world

28:42.620 --> 28:49.660
You think you know, and then there's the question of like well if they have the technology to simulate that then they have the technology to simulate you

28:50.780 --> 28:57.180
Preventing it and you know understanding that it's wrong and stuff, which is what our current video games are there's I heard somebody make a titter

28:57.740 --> 28:59.740
You think that that's silly

28:59.740 --> 29:01.420
Oh

29:01.420 --> 29:06.260
Wow, I met that I said you mean do good but through video games

29:09.580 --> 29:10.580
Oh

29:10.580 --> 29:13.940
I think I think we're kind of seeing that shift right wait a minute

29:13.940 --> 29:19.460
My brother told me he did Oculus Rift demos and he said that one of them is you walk through a party

29:19.580 --> 29:24.260
Both as someone getting from the POV of someone getting date raped and also the date

29:25.100 --> 29:27.100
So like you kind of see you like

29:27.100 --> 29:29.520
Well, okay

29:31.660 --> 29:37.740
And it was meant to be an educational like don't date rape people not here's how you do it

29:40.500 --> 29:45.220
Well, that's I mean the funny thing is that's that's like a new face on something

29:45.220 --> 29:51.600
It was like empathizing with the victim or something the origins of pornography is like like it had to originally start as like

29:51.600 --> 29:58.040
Refor madness, you know, it's like show you let's show you people smoking pot. Let's show you what you you want to come

29:58.040 --> 30:01.760
You're fascinated with pot smoking. So you're gonna come see this movie called reefer madness

30:02.080 --> 30:08.080
We're gonna we're gonna be protected because we're gonna be telling you blah blah blah and then pornography started as sex ed

30:08.080 --> 30:12.320
Kind of videos. I like oh look at Sally the slut. Here's how you recognize her

30:12.720 --> 30:18.440
She'll be tromping around showing game when it's not called for to provide her job

30:18.440 --> 30:22.280
That's too much gam Sally

30:24.040 --> 30:28.560
You just got a you're a hope you got enough more gam to walk to the skid row

30:31.280 --> 30:33.520
And they said what if we take the narrator out

30:37.840 --> 30:39.840
That's the history of pornography, right

30:39.840 --> 30:50.120
I'd say after they slowly were like well, how educational is this I I just came back from a test screening of Sally slut and

30:50.680 --> 30:52.680
There weren't a lot of

30:54.240 --> 30:56.240
A lot of guys

30:56.320 --> 31:00.960
demurely respecting the the film craft by holding their hats in their laps

31:00.960 --> 31:17.480
I just I projected on to that like I just heard really like my older brother going like that's that's a sentence

31:18.680 --> 31:24.440
Well, it wasn't like it wasn't like a buckled over belly laugh is what you're probably hearing

31:24.440 --> 31:29.200
It was like a you know slow air escaping from a balloon. I guess that was kind of funny laugh

31:29.200 --> 31:36.120
Yeah, yeah, but don't you do that when something's really really unfunny sometimes. Yeah, yeah, it wasn't your best work

31:36.120 --> 31:40.840
No, no, I and you know what? I'm making it up as I go you asshole

31:46.360 --> 31:53.440
All right, so that when in stealth press X to kiss your wife just just that doesn't necessarily have to be the title of tonight's podcast

31:53.440 --> 31:57.440
But it it's I think I it's words to live by

31:57.440 --> 31:59.440
I

32:01.560 --> 32:07.640
Was gonna call. Oh, no see it now. Okay. Nope thought I had something to talk. Nope. All right. Nope

32:08.560 --> 32:10.040
Nope

32:10.040 --> 32:12.040
No, nothing much really to talk about

32:12.400 --> 32:14.400
Rick and Morty's doing doing doing good

32:14.400 --> 32:26.400
The last of the leaked episodes airs tonight. Yeah

32:27.600 --> 32:31.800
Well, yeah, zone chinks it baby. Did anybody watch it yet the leaked episode

32:34.640 --> 32:41.080
Really wait, so which one is tonight last week was the his ex-girlfriend. No, no, that's tonight. Oh really?

32:41.080 --> 32:47.080
Oh that one leaked. That's why everyone was telling me good. So it airs tonight. Okay. Yeah

32:48.360 --> 32:55.200
Kids that one's a bummer these kids hard to write for hard to sell to and then they go and steal it

33:04.120 --> 33:08.080
And then you try to give them something they think will be neat. Okay, you're into that stuff

33:08.080 --> 33:12.800
How about an Apple watch? They don't even buy it. They don't like it. They say it's dumb

33:12.800 --> 33:15.600
They say it's like a tiny iPhone on your wrist. Why would I have that? I?

33:16.600 --> 33:19.920
Need my free hand for for snoggin

33:23.320 --> 33:26.080
Polyamorous holographic snoggin

33:30.960 --> 33:34.320
Speaking of shifting definitions and things I don't want to I don't want to

33:34.320 --> 33:41.240
I don't even know what my job is in this situation, but I feel like I don't have a job. There is no job

33:41.240 --> 33:46.640
There's no policing. There's nothing going on, but I thought it's interesting like part of the conversation to bring up that like

33:46.960 --> 33:48.960
like very funny

33:48.960 --> 33:52.600
Rory Albany's on last week in New York and like I

33:53.440 --> 33:55.440
Was sitting there, so I think like

33:56.000 --> 34:00.520
Like there was a there was a really uncomfortable kind of coincidence that happened

34:00.520 --> 34:07.360
Which was that like I don't know Rory Rory was not looking at if you're if you're listening to the podcast Rory

34:07.360 --> 34:10.520
Is not looking at Jane. I don't think I don't think he knows

34:11.120 --> 34:16.440
Jane exists or where Jane is Rory is hearing about Jane verbally and

34:17.520 --> 34:24.240
And so you look like and then there's a point where Rory is a as a stand-up comic coming from a certain like

34:24.240 --> 34:34.160
some 90% of the time admirable like instinct for skepticism of of social trend and fad and group think and things is

34:35.000 --> 34:36.600
Still it was like like heard it

34:36.600 --> 34:41.800
I think got got the name wrong Jan or Jane or something wasn't looking at Jane

34:41.800 --> 34:47.400
But then like went on went into a kind of riff about and I know it's okay to have boobs these days

34:47.400 --> 34:51.960
And I was over whatever you want or is the transgender thing and I was like, oh god

34:51.960 --> 34:55.320
This is terrible. It's just Jane really Jane is a trans

34:56.560 --> 35:00.800
Harmontown fan and the the that that that's what happened

35:00.800 --> 35:03.280
It was just sort of a bumper car crash and I didn't you know

35:03.280 --> 35:09.040
I I thought it was good to let the traffic keep moving rather than stop down the entire show

35:09.040 --> 35:14.080
And yeah, like I knew that I knew that Jane would probably most likely be tickled by the whole thing

35:14.080 --> 35:18.600
But and I have no idea if anything happened online as a result of that. We're living in tender times

35:19.440 --> 35:21.080
and I

35:21.080 --> 35:28.480
But I but I did see a tweet or two that implied that maybe I don't know conversation got generated about that moment because it's like a really

35:29.200 --> 35:31.200
important like

35:31.400 --> 35:33.880
Bottle neck that we're going through all at the same time

35:34.400 --> 35:41.120
And so there's conversation generated on there. I just for for my part until I don't know any more information

35:41.120 --> 35:44.400
I just wanted to say I was sitting there on the stool and I know there was no

35:44.400 --> 35:50.960
That you you no one was witness to a microaggression. I almost feel dumb like like like being a traffic cop for that

35:50.960 --> 35:57.000
But I I I'm I'm always like the most bumped out about people hurting each other's feelings

35:57.800 --> 36:03.680
Because I know that nobody wants to I know nobody would ever there's so few people that would ever make that choice if somebody's actually

36:03.680 --> 36:08.660
By the way, here's a trick like if somebody's like saying something hurtful to you

36:08.660 --> 36:15.980
And it's either a misunderstanding or like they're putting so much energy into trying to hurt you that like they

36:17.020 --> 36:19.660
They must be anticipating the same from you

36:19.660 --> 36:22.260
There's no other reason why they would do that, you know

36:22.260 --> 36:27.420
And then they're always drawing that energy from some some other part of them. That's like a

36:28.100 --> 36:31.820
Great place for a sneak attack, which is like their respect receptor

36:31.980 --> 36:35.220
Like if somebody's like being a total piece of shit to you

36:35.220 --> 36:39.940
Like there's almost nothing to lose by even giving that that that first shot

36:39.940 --> 36:46.380
Which is just just being nice, which by the way Jane always does like Jane always meets that stuff with total resilience and and

36:47.100 --> 36:51.740
Compassion which is the makes you wobble and goes like oh, I thought this whole thing was about making me feel bad

36:53.220 --> 36:57.020
So anyways, I got high before the show and I

36:57.020 --> 37:04.340
I don't know who any of these people are I

37:06.860 --> 37:10.700
What's it only heard the episodes I've actually been on so it's two

37:12.860 --> 37:16.420
You can reference those episodes. I'll know what you're talking about

37:16.420 --> 37:22.940
But didn't he say he used to he played a lot of Gwent that guy Rory. I think yeah

37:22.940 --> 37:29.780
He's yeah, Rory Rory who's awesome by the way. I was doing this IFC pilot with us a really really really cool guy

37:31.460 --> 37:37.220
Yeah, he was it he said he stopped playing the game. I think because he was just playing Gwent. Yeah

37:38.620 --> 37:41.780
Well, if you overheard that then it was him for sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah

37:41.780 --> 37:46.540
He played he goes he plays for the Gwent for you with your three fans. That's some Witcher 3 comedy for you

37:47.300 --> 37:50.340
He plays for the Gwent. Holy shit. We're gonna bring our guests up. Jesus Christ

37:50.340 --> 37:53.700
What the fuck I was just gonna say something fuck

37:54.060 --> 37:59.580
What were you gonna say Ryan? I was gonna say let's keep the show moving because that's what a comptroller supposed to do

37:59.580 --> 38:06.620
Right in what way should we keep the troll show moving Comptroller Ridley? Let's bring up our guests. Oh shit, man

38:07.940 --> 38:14.060
Introduce our guests. Oh, that's all right. Sorry. I was reading text from from Aaron excellent Comptroller. Thank you

38:14.060 --> 38:20.380
Oh, well, we'll bring our guests up and then we'll read them police brutality statistics

38:22.540 --> 38:24.620
Okay, no, I gotta go back to the hold up

38:24.620 --> 38:30.820
I have to find the Dan was saying in the last four days 500 people have been killed by cops

38:31.820 --> 38:34.060
It's funny because it's not true right

38:34.860 --> 38:39.180
No, I got it. I got it. I got it a little wrong. All right. Jesus Christ

38:39.180 --> 38:44.180
Could somebody put kerosene on my face and light it on fire? Oh?

38:45.300 --> 38:47.540
To just burn off some of the sweat

38:50.380 --> 38:55.420
Or or is your towel dying up here. I'm like Louis Armstrong

38:59.820 --> 39:03.760
But I didn't I haven't earned it. I mean he's like blowing into a tube. Yeah

39:03.760 --> 39:13.920
So these guys are a recent addition recent relative to us were old-timers recent addition to the Feral Audio Network

39:13.920 --> 39:19.360
They had this show that they started doing called before you were funny, which is a really interesting concept

39:19.360 --> 39:23.520
We live in Los Angeles like we're surrounded by geniuses all the time and

39:24.240 --> 39:26.960
People we admire even ourselves sometimes

39:27.720 --> 39:33.600
And then you really like you open up to yourself yourself and your closest friends about the like really hack shit

39:33.600 --> 39:35.600
You did unless you're some kind of weird

39:36.280 --> 39:42.400
Deformed prodigy that was like writing good comedy when you were 13 years old you probably went through this horrible hack phase

39:42.440 --> 39:46.400
So it's a really refreshing show. I I took part in it Aaron's done it

39:46.400 --> 39:48.280
It's it's it's really great

39:48.280 --> 39:54.400
It's like when you get the right group of people these like really funny people that come together and reveal that when they were

39:54.400 --> 40:02.320
22 25 27 whatever it is that they wrote these horrible and funny things and they they read through them and they it's an

40:02.320 --> 40:06.360
Uplifting experience. It's not claustic. I wouldn't tolerate it otherwise

40:08.280 --> 40:14.280
Did you hear my 38 minute what is your point transgender monologue? I

40:16.560 --> 40:18.560
Obviously care

40:20.960 --> 40:22.960
About something

40:23.480 --> 40:29.840
That has clearly to do with me being perceived as a good person and and stops completely right there

40:29.840 --> 40:35.360
And does no one else any good. I just have this really tight bubble around me of good intention

40:35.360 --> 40:40.560
Yeah, you don't have to try so hard man. You are a good person if anyone's love ever finds himself looking over here

40:40.960 --> 40:42.960
In this corner of the room

40:43.040 --> 40:45.640
Just want you to notice I'm a feminist

40:45.640 --> 40:58.120
Hello boy, oh boy, is that bad what we do to black people? Hello?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.800
Just over here. I brought some

41:02.800 --> 41:13.320
Cal Cal Cal Cal Cal Calamari frozen. I don't know how to make it. I'm white. Ah, I'm so white

41:20.400 --> 41:22.400
When's the bachelor coming on

41:24.400 --> 41:26.240
Okay, I

41:26.240 --> 41:30.480
Had to give him a place for my improv training put him at a bachelor

41:30.480 --> 41:32.480
Viewing party

41:34.080 --> 41:37.120
So these guys have the show it's called before you were funny

41:37.120 --> 41:43.520
Let's let's meet them and pick their brains about this weird ver done that they live in Justin Michael and Jacob Reed

41:55.680 --> 41:58.920
Hello, hello, how are you? Sorry about the wait

41:58.920 --> 42:04.560
Wait was great. I'm not we learned about a lot of social issues. Okay. Good. Yeah

42:04.760 --> 42:11.360
Are you guys all you guys air tight now and how to feel about yeah about me? Yeah? I'm a good person

42:12.720 --> 42:14.400
I

42:14.400 --> 42:18.760
Don't know how to tell you how to feel about gun controls global warming transgenders

42:20.120 --> 42:26.600
What do we got it? We need a noun that describes the issue the because I keep going transgender

42:26.600 --> 42:28.600
movement

42:28.840 --> 42:30.440
Yeah

42:30.440 --> 42:36.760
Transgender issue trans genderism transgen. Yep. Yeah, I'll take that. I don't know that that makes it tell

42:37.240 --> 42:41.080
That's what if we just refer to BT rights. Huh?

42:42.120 --> 42:45.320
I look to you like you were saying that and that was now you

42:45.960 --> 42:51.280
I'm not gonna memorize the bunch of letters that don't spell something. I says I can remember

42:51.280 --> 42:59.280
Lgbt why I don't know whether to respect it or get order it

43:00.760 --> 43:02.560
So if those

43:02.560 --> 43:07.640
If those if that acronym had vowels in it and made a word then it would be better

43:07.640 --> 43:13.240
Yeah, like if it like us and it would have to spell something cool like the tree or something

43:14.280 --> 43:16.280
sword

43:16.280 --> 43:20.840
If he rearranged them enough it would spell something. I mean, it's like but quibital quibital

43:23.000 --> 43:27.280
Equipital a thing that you slice somebody with yeah quibital for a week when I would have a flu

43:28.840 --> 43:34.160
So if you guys and you're how many how many how long have you been doing this experiment of

43:34.560 --> 43:42.380
Inviting people to bring their really the shit that they would never want anyone to hear if they were invested in protecting their image

43:43.160 --> 43:45.160
three years

43:45.160 --> 43:52.720
As like a good show yeah, and then like six years probably we did it six years ago like twice and then

43:53.200 --> 43:57.480
Stopped because there was zero audience for the first year

43:57.480 --> 44:03.640
Yeah, and then and we table they were like we should wait until we until more of our friends become famous and want to do this

44:03.640 --> 44:05.640
right

44:06.160 --> 44:11.320
And also yeah, the thing I'm curious about in in that time

44:11.320 --> 44:14.720
So I'm trying to I'm trying to be a better interviewer

44:15.120 --> 44:20.600
But so part of it was me realizing that you're not supposed to ask things that you think an interviewer should ask

44:20.600 --> 44:24.520
He's supposed to ask things that you actually want to know so I was thinking about what I want to know and

44:25.040 --> 44:29.520
The thing is when you hear it, it's not gonna be that you're gonna be like we can't answer that

44:30.840 --> 44:32.840
But what I really want to know is

44:33.640 --> 44:39.480
Like when you're like who there's must be you now have you guys have

44:39.480 --> 44:41.480
You guys have an encyclopedic

44:43.120 --> 44:44.840
library of

44:44.840 --> 44:52.920
Diff of the ways people handle embarrassing themselves. Oh, yeah, so you must you do you have a shorthand for oh

44:52.920 --> 44:54.200
He's a Henry

44:54.200 --> 44:59.240
Like like he's gonna he's gonna bring he's gonna bring in the shit that he actually thinks is funny

44:59.240 --> 45:03.320
And you're gonna be able to tell you do bring in things that they think is funny

45:03.320 --> 45:07.960
And then you know but and then they're like oh it didn't go over well because people are expecting bad things

45:07.960 --> 45:12.120
Right, I think it's a defense mechanism because you're like wow is that bring your most terrible stuff

45:12.120 --> 45:18.000
But I'll bring my stuff. It's still a show which is the word. I mean that's such an understandable logical decision

45:18.000 --> 45:25.360
But yeah, so you can see how that's I think isn't that isn't that what we're all doing all the time. Aren't we all going?

45:25.960 --> 45:28.600
well, you know they say

45:29.560 --> 45:36.560
You love me, but you know like you I guess that is that you'd love me more if I was a little different

45:36.560 --> 45:39.880
Like and we don't we don't we're not ourselves therefore

45:39.880 --> 45:46.880
We know our warts are not showing therefore our our actual like most amazing moments are kind of through a weird gauze

45:47.120 --> 45:54.240
The best stuff is always this stuff that people are horrified when they realize how bad it is like a lot of the time people will

45:54.240 --> 45:57.440
Will send us stuff without having read it ahead of time, which is what we suggest

45:57.440 --> 46:02.760
But I mean I would read stuff before I send it to someone. I think you'd be crazy not to but a lot of people

46:02.760 --> 46:07.560
Do what we ask and send it sight unseen and then as they're reading it

46:07.560 --> 46:12.040
They realize how truly terrible it is and those are the best reactions in the world

46:12.040 --> 46:18.240
Yeah, we had one that they realized halfway through the sketch that only the stage direction was racist

46:20.760 --> 46:25.160
The sketch itself was not but the way in which they described right it was very

46:25.760 --> 46:30.560
specifically mentioning the ethnicity of characters who were coming in but it didn't play into the sketch

46:30.560 --> 46:37.360
Well that one when you say it that way that says racist as three years ago in network TV like that

46:38.320 --> 46:42.600
But but I thought I thought you meant like like it would say like like

46:43.160 --> 46:48.920
Demorige and the boys are hanging out like that's how I mean there is stuff like that for sure

46:48.920 --> 46:54.600
Yeah, Demorige Demorige is regularly on the show and he is that he had a story about a commercial that the

46:54.600 --> 47:00.840
Matches that definition that the descriptions were racist. There is anything they were saying that the guy though

47:00.840 --> 47:08.280
They were spelling it wrong because they were I'm assuming because a group of black people like there's some of the vowels come out and stuff

47:08.280 --> 47:10.640
Because the just in the state in the stage direction

47:11.440 --> 47:14.440
anyways, the I'm a good person and

47:14.440 --> 47:23.040
And if I had been at that audition, I would have pulled the more John of there. I said you're better than this

47:26.720 --> 47:33.840
What is it about us at like at that a because I I brought in something to your show that it's like whatever

47:34.280 --> 47:38.520
It was something from when I was like 12 or 13 or something in Jack. No

47:38.520 --> 47:43.360
Very early he visioned that was actually meant to be a compliment

47:43.360 --> 47:47.160
We just we just screamed it and everyone enjoyed it and then what do we call the show?

47:47.160 --> 47:52.080
But I think you guys recommend don't bring stuff in from your childhood because then it's like what you know the line between like

47:52.080 --> 47:58.160
Oh, how adorably bad at writing. I was at 12. Yeah, but like the really important thing is this idea that

47:58.600 --> 48:00.360
that

48:00.360 --> 48:06.280
You know, I don't know what age we think it is in our heads, but like oh my god, you're gonna read that thing

48:06.280 --> 48:10.200
I wrote when I was 23. I think it's college

48:10.960 --> 48:16.680
Yeah, I mean, it's it's that it's that age between and I don't know what's supposed to happen to you in that age

48:16.680 --> 48:25.080
Except for you writing badly that's supposed to make you so good on the other side. Do we worship the idea of are we supposed to be?

48:25.680 --> 48:30.120
Perfect, that's how it feels sometimes like we're supposed to we're supposed to never have done anything wrong

48:30.120 --> 48:33.440
Which is very it doesn't make any logical sense when you think about it

48:33.440 --> 48:36.920
But it is how we feel right you're never supposed to have done anything wrong

48:37.680 --> 48:44.760
Yeah, I think I mean I think what for me what I would put please keep turn your phone on

48:46.080 --> 48:48.080
Vibrate we have people I

48:50.080 --> 48:52.080
Think

48:52.120 --> 48:58.960
Yeah, it would what is fun about it for me is getting to see people who I admire who I'm friends with and

48:58.960 --> 49:06.920
Realize that we were all and sometimes still are just like terrible at what we all love doing and even even great

49:06.920 --> 49:10.800
People will bring in stuff that's like maybe a year old that just wasn't

49:11.160 --> 49:16.680
Good, they're just throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks, but I think it's like oh, they're trying right right

49:16.680 --> 49:19.680
And there's this idea that like when you watch people you love you're like oh

49:19.680 --> 49:25.960
They must have been perfect the whole time right and there I mean do you think that do you think that Salinger like?

49:25.960 --> 49:31.720
I mean, I haven't read catcher on the rise as they made me read a chapter and then I just fucking got the cliff notes

49:31.720 --> 49:38.560
But like supposedly isn't this really I mean that was his whole trip is that he dedicated his life to this idea that like

49:39.000 --> 49:45.280
Now his books are gonna come out of a magic chest once a year whatever everything was like batten down like like no

49:45.840 --> 49:48.000
Look, there's no there's no transparency there

49:48.000 --> 49:51.600
Who wants to who wants to listen to Anne Rice disown the vampire movies?

49:51.600 --> 49:57.840
Who wants to I don't want to see what JK Rowling's having for breakfast. I there's holes everything's of the where these people were creative

49:57.840 --> 50:01.200
And now they're just now they're just boring terrible people JD Salinger

50:01.200 --> 50:08.600
He wrote one book one book the most perfect book ever and then he done any boarded himself up in a basement

50:10.480 --> 50:13.120
But you could hear the typewriter clicking away

50:13.120 --> 50:20.520
And every once in a while they say the squirrel's breath carries a paper pulp on it

50:21.480 --> 50:28.560
But well the one day form and they say there's a New York Times is holding the last will and the JD Salinger

50:28.560 --> 50:34.280
Well once again have written the second perfect book. Well, what if it what if it was like better than anyways?

50:34.720 --> 50:36.720
Like how wait why?

50:37.120 --> 50:41.160
Now I'm being rhetorical because I know we're all asking the same question, right? But like like what?

50:41.160 --> 50:45.120
What the fuck what kind of person would that be would we even like that person?

50:45.120 --> 50:50.080
We always think it about the people that we admire we think that they're better than us

50:50.080 --> 50:52.840
We know we don't just think oh, they must have fucked up really bad

50:52.840 --> 50:56.200
We have had a couple people who bring stuff that's like that they

50:56.520 --> 51:00.800
They truly think it's terrible like they're not trying to trick the show by bringing stuff

51:00.800 --> 51:06.120
They think is great, but they are just so funny that even their terrible stuff is great

51:06.120 --> 51:10.760
And yeah hate them for it because they just have been funny

51:11.600 --> 51:16.560
They're humiliated by an amazing sketch, right or like we had a Rob Delaney

51:16.560 --> 51:21.840
Did it early stand-up set that like almost verbatim of how he would have done it back in the day?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.720
But then pointed out like it was all very funny

51:24.720 --> 51:28.840
But he pointed out with each joke like why he doesn't think it's funny now

51:29.280 --> 51:35.280
And it was more of just like I wouldn't make that he was saying like he wouldn't make that kind of joke now because that's just not

51:35.280 --> 51:40.920
What a sense of humor is so sometimes it's it's not as much about like oh you were shitty then it's like oh

51:40.920 --> 51:44.280
You've been funny the whole time, but your perspective has changed, right?

51:45.720 --> 51:47.720
That's not a funny answer, but

51:48.160 --> 51:55.560
That's the truth. I mean maybe one day in the future. You'll have the perfect funny funniest answer. No, that's the answer. I wanted

51:57.320 --> 51:59.320
No, it's not what am I talking about?

51:59.960 --> 52:02.440
There was a random answer. I don't want to read that

52:02.440 --> 52:07.440
I thought it was a very interesting like I it's it's because I wouldn't Aaron did the show

52:07.760 --> 52:15.200
Arons was amazing. Yeah, so like late bears. She she was she was writing. She was she wasn't there weren't letters to her

52:16.400 --> 52:22.520
English teacher plays they were plays, but they were clearly like she was it was fanfiction for her own life

52:25.120 --> 52:30.160
Then only she had read before right and and yeah, and then yeah, and did like it was

52:30.160 --> 52:31.840
a

52:31.840 --> 52:37.320
Very transparent like attempt at a sort of seduction of this teacher

52:37.320 --> 52:40.320
I think I think the plan was that she was going to

52:41.040 --> 52:47.400
Everyone in her class had to write these plays these like one act and hers involved a character loosely based on her and a character

52:47.400 --> 52:49.160
loosely based on her teacher

52:49.160 --> 52:50.480
having a

52:50.480 --> 52:56.160
Liaison after school, but having kind of a snarky like it was definitely not it was clearly this

52:56.160 --> 53:01.720
And this is the thing that would like make me cringe the most like we were talking about these bear wires that I think

53:01.960 --> 53:06.760
Your show at its best is like this was energy is coming from these exposed wires

53:07.280 --> 53:10.400
the most the to me listening to those

53:11.800 --> 53:16.560
Pieces she was reading the craziest thing about them was that she didn't

53:17.080 --> 53:22.440
She didn't just want to have sex with her teacher like she the way she was

53:22.440 --> 53:28.880
Explored like she wanted to be married to him and she wanted to like she wanted to have sassafras with her like she

53:28.880 --> 53:30.520
Wanted like like like it didn't have it

53:30.520 --> 53:34.760
I mean it was like they were talking about sex, but it was more like like it was like if a 16-year-old

53:35.200 --> 53:39.160
Like what a 16-year-old thinks that all of that stuff would be yeah

53:39.160 --> 53:42.880
Like like yeah, she wanted to have like this repartee and like yeah

53:42.880 --> 53:46.920
And and that was like like crazier than if she had just said his hand touches her boom

53:46.920 --> 53:48.920
I

53:53.040 --> 53:55.040
Was just telling them what boobs do

53:57.560 --> 54:02.080
What did you say oh just the idea that a teacher says they're that long after class to is like

54:02.080 --> 54:06.760
Oh, you must be burning the midnight oil every night an element or a middle school teacher

54:07.640 --> 54:12.080
Walking out and getting the fuck home. Yeah, exactly, but it is it's exposed

54:12.800 --> 54:15.920
I think that's that's the thing. It's like nobody

54:15.920 --> 54:22.520
What is that like like it's when your intent is so clear when it's like crystal clear

54:22.520 --> 54:28.960
I think the best stuff comes from the end of high school and the beginning of college because that's when you

54:29.240 --> 54:35.280
You're at the center of the world to yourself more than the world's so big

54:35.280 --> 54:40.600
Right like you just realize the world's bigger than it's ever been and you're gonna be a part of your right at this

54:40.600 --> 54:42.600
I don't know that you're wrong

54:42.600 --> 54:46.640
And everything that you do is something you're inventing because you haven't seen

54:47.280 --> 54:50.120
Hardly anything you've got you've had a chance to see four things

54:50.120 --> 54:53.240
So you're definitely not gonna write where the red fern grows again

54:53.680 --> 54:57.800
But everything else you're convinced you're creating you're like holy shit, man

54:57.800 --> 54:59.800
I'm gonna like and it's so

55:00.320 --> 55:04.800
Like like God forbid that you ever get that insulation

55:04.800 --> 55:06.800
I feel like your friends that go to film school

55:07.080 --> 55:09.880
You know that was always the cliche when we first came out here to LA

55:09.880 --> 55:14.880
It was like oh, he must have gone to film school because we just had an hour lunch with him and we talked about 20 movies

55:14.880 --> 55:19.680
And he never smiled, you know, and we talked about what kind of movie we want to make with our

55:20.280 --> 55:27.000
You know camcorders and he you know, he was paralyzed because he must have gone to film school because you're you're for four years

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
You're sitting there watching everything and learning

55:29.600 --> 55:36.360
What everybody's ever thought that ever picked up a camera and it fills you with like well who's little old me

55:36.360 --> 55:39.560
Yeah, it's before you realize that I think

55:40.560 --> 55:44.040
When you become an adult, which I'm not claiming to be but you

55:44.440 --> 55:48.760
You realize like someone has done a good version of a lot of different things already and it's

55:49.200 --> 55:51.960
Crippling because what the fuck are you gonna add?

55:52.360 --> 55:55.400
But yeah, that at the heart of that fear though

55:55.400 --> 56:01.640
It can't just possibly be because we're not that noble that we would just think well, I wouldn't want to be I wouldn't want to do a

56:01.640 --> 56:03.640
worse job of writing a

56:03.640 --> 56:11.560
Book about a car that eats people than Stephen King. It's it's there's a there's a one thing right after that

56:11.560 --> 56:17.040
And that's actually what we're worried about. It's the then everyone will make fun of me, right?

56:17.040 --> 56:20.280
Then everybody it's not it's not actually the book being bad

56:20.280 --> 56:26.280
It's like people will think that I'm stupid people will think that I think that I invented

56:26.480 --> 56:31.160
Cars that eat people and and then they'll be like, you know, you didn't invent that, right?

56:31.160 --> 56:34.340
And I'll be like fuck you fuck you like like I just I'm not gonna

56:34.720 --> 56:40.040
No, no, no, I'm not gonna enter this game until I'm safely away from all the double Dutch

56:40.040 --> 56:45.200
And like I'm gonna do this perfect Mary Lou Retton this handspring through it. What the what in the fucking

56:45.720 --> 56:47.720
42 year old man

56:48.240 --> 56:53.080
And then I'm gonna land a Frogger game and just get the Pokemons

56:54.480 --> 56:58.120
We started in a car that eats people. Yeah. Yeah, Christine

56:58.120 --> 57:01.880
Yeah, I'm holding that up. I was like, oh, I didn't want to get anything wrong about Anna Karenina the

57:03.280 --> 57:09.520
The thing is by the way Stephen King himself has done multiple versions of the I'm gonna one up the car that eats people

57:09.520 --> 57:15.640
It's a washing machine that eats people. Yeah, and he has a lot of trucks that eat people like he's done his own

57:15.920 --> 57:18.360
Most of the people that you think are great

57:18.360 --> 57:22.320
Which is why I brought up salinger because I think he's kind of one of the exceptions because we just can't you know

57:22.840 --> 57:26.800
People want to find salinger failing and it's like oh, we wrote catcher on the right

57:26.800 --> 57:33.380
I mean the literary equivalent of the episode of Seinfeld where George decides to just leave after he gets one joke in in a meeting

57:36.920 --> 57:42.000
Everybody else that you admire in fact quite, you know, like Stephen King is a great example

57:42.160 --> 57:44.680
as I'm sure now it's now it's kind of hip to kind of

57:45.520 --> 57:51.240
Not say he's good at anything, but certainly one of the most prolific like sorry Stephen

57:51.240 --> 57:56.760
If you're listening or your son or anyone that loves you your caretakers. Why am I? Why do I do that?

57:58.520 --> 58:01.200
But not that anyone thinks Stephen King's good

58:05.720 --> 58:09.760
Honey, what was it Dean has something against Stephen King, I don't know

58:11.040 --> 58:13.960
But I think it's cool that you're driving even though I'm a guy

58:13.960 --> 58:19.520
They got to get to that I'm the guy to my voice is just a higher register

58:22.160 --> 58:24.160
Why are why are you?

58:24.680 --> 58:29.600
Holding those ice cream cones and lifting them up and down. I thought you might like one or the other

58:31.720 --> 58:33.720
Do you like vanilla or chocolate I

58:35.240 --> 58:38.240
Don't feel very secure in this conversation. So I don't know if I'm gonna

58:38.240 --> 58:43.040
Volunteer information about what I like, but I'll tell you chocolate

58:44.600 --> 58:49.760
Without letting you know whether that's why there is no chocolate. Fuck you see that doesn't hurt me because as I was saying

58:49.920 --> 58:54.560
You don't have the power to hurt me and appreciate if you just let me out up here. Nope fucking problem at all

58:55.280 --> 59:00.920
Moving these ice cream cones to the right. Yeah, just word of advice. I don't want your advice

59:00.920 --> 59:05.800
Word of advice though in case you don't want your fucking advice close the fucking door close the fucking door word of advice

59:05.800 --> 59:08.320
Don't you fucking don't you fucking physically to me?

59:08.760 --> 59:12.720
Don't you physically intimidate me? Oh, give me a fucking break. Fuck you. Fuck you

59:19.680 --> 59:21.680
Freeze

59:27.320 --> 59:29.760
Freeze put the towels down

59:29.760 --> 59:41.960
Give me give me the handcuffs. Where are the extra handcuffs? There's like four people here. We don't have enough handcuffs for all these corpses

59:44.920 --> 59:47.840
Should we check in on the police brutality statistics? Yes

59:49.440 --> 59:55.640
Okay, now these are coming in from Aaron who's our correspondent in Ireland. I don't know why she knows this about us

59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.840
And so I'm not like I'm not saying these are accurate. So I

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.040
Feel like this huge I want to put this big giant

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.600
asterisk on this and say if I haven't said this already

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.120
Can you you have to believe one of two things which is that all cops are bad?

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.760
If you don't believe that which began that's a crazy thing to believe because it's just a dev absolute thing and none of

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.160
Those are true then what has to be true is that there's good cops out there and they must their hearts must be fucking broken right now

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.800
And that's I and I know it's not a great time to be like what about them

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.040
But I just I do I was like it's so easy to just be like but they're a fucking epidemic. Here's the numbers

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:43.000
The the well, here's the numbers from Aaron if she's wrong remember when that guy from Yahoo said we were one of 11 sitcoms to

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.600
Know, you know good to oh, yeah, and then people are like what about Sanford and son. It was like, okay one of 238 sitcoms. Uh-huh

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:05.040
By mark by March of 2015 US cops had killed more civilians this year than they did in the UK over the last hundred years

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:13.280
Yeah, so it's up. It's a hundred times more than Europe. Yeah every yeah year

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.080
US cops kill at an average rate of 70 times higher than other countries

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.280
Yeah, well whatever and then there's some there's some crazy shit that the it's it's an epidemic and

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.040
Dan cops are like Stephen King books

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.680
Most of them are very good

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.680
But occasionally he lets through a the mangler

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.320
Do you want to flip that? I think there's a there's a couple hits like there's a couple good ones and then

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.440
Only a couple good Stephen King books

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:01.240
It the stand the dark tower quadrilogy

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.440
Plus two more or whatever

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.960
Whatever seven books are in a series

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.320
He is writing for like middle school kids

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.880
It's all like eighth grade vocabulary. I

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.160
Mean that's the target audience

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.640
Fuck you

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.240
All right, well

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:37.520
Do you guys have any parting words for people who are interested in we police brutality

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.080
I mean, obviously people are gonna look for your podcast. It's called before you were funny

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.520
Which is funny calm? We're on feral audio on itunes, you know, if you look up before you're funny

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.720
You'll find it. Yeah, there's a lot of fun episodes with great people. Your episodes great Aaron had an episode. It's great

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.880
I'm not gonna say any episodes are bad. They're mostly very very

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.160
And who is the worst person that you ever? Oh, that's that's easy. No, I'm just kidding

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.480
It's a great a lot of great people have been on the show

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.040
And I'm certainly not going to publicly announce the ones that haven't been great

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.200
We do have a thing. Oh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's there's probably not

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.080
Like with blindly so this is something when you did the show that we didn't have time to

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:34.480
We haven't we haven't read it so I truthfully don't know what it is. Oh, no

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.640
Thank you feel free to say yes or no wait, I don't even know well

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.360
I'm just saying. Oh, no, but I mean we have to I mean we're not gonna do all that conversation of them

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.680
I don't I just I just I'm getting that weird like I'm seeing this and I'm recognizing. I think I

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080
There's no date or anything on it

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.280
This has got to be it's done on a regular typewriter like a word processor typewriter

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.640
So it's got to be like it's heavily indented. Yes. Yeah, it's too heavily

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.200
Like I was learning to set margins while I was doing it

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:15.520
Yeah, I'm gonna I mean I I'm gonna guess like I was like I like fit that could be anywhere from 15 to

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.560
19 writing this

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:34.120
And but what how do we read it? I think it's a short story. So yeah, we can I'll do that

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.080
I'll do that. Well, it doesn't it seem like there's I see that there's a guy and a girl in this

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:49.920
So and so what if I what if I did this did the all the narrative and then and then one of you be Dan and one of you

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.920
be

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080
Ashley

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:08.160
All right, and then the way that the podcast works is that anyone can chime in with with questions or thoughts

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.760
About what's being read. So if you guys have questions or thoughts or as you remember, maybe what this is from

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:23.640
You can tell us. Well, don't tell them they can ask questions. Sorry. Sorry. No offense guys

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.360
You're you're but they're very empowered sure

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.600
You know, there's like a kid with a gun like that would be like that would be like an adult with a gun

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080
All right

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.720
So and and and my job my job like I'm a pussy if I don't just fucking commit to this

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.720
Like if I have to keep ruling my eyes and apologizing for it

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:57.200
You have to go for it like like that's I'm just talking to myself like I'm not gonna use like like like we get it

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.120
You don't think you you wrote good whatever like like like okay

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:08.280
This is by the way when you were asking about are there certain kinds of guests. This is what Sean Clements called the front porcher

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:13.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're really front porch to the sketch so you don't have to get to it ever

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.040
Okay, Dan stood on the beach his feet firmly planted in the sand

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:27.280
He stared out at the ocean the Sun was a fist-sized orange ball

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800
Nestled and this is long so

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.800
You can't you can't see this but we talked about indenting this first paragraph is so indented

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.400
You can't see some of the letters in the sentences. I am. Yeah, I'm guessing at the word sand and soft. Yes

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.080
Fist-sized orange ball nestled and soft horizon long clouds

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.440
That's a long cloud. Ah, it's the standard cloud length also

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.760
It's as long as they can be

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.760
I

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.240
Seagulls were making calm passes in search and then the paragraph ends

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.880
So I think this is me like stopping and starting this is like 80s style

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.280
Oh, yeah, Dan stood on the beach his feet firmly planted in the sand

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:24.600
He stared out at the ocean the Sun was a fist-sized orange ball nestled in soft horizon long clouds

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.240
seagulls were making calm passes in search of food and

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:34.600
And their rhythmic cries countered the ponderous soothing bellow of the water stroking the shore

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320
Thank you so much

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:53.880
But paragraph two the war was over

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.080
I'm starting to get kind of proud of this

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.400
The cities were leveled and empty

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.720
The humans were dead

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.640
All of them if it wasn't clear

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:33.400
If they hadn't died in the war they had plugged themselves into the utopia net and

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:46.800
And uploaded their minds There was no way for them to come back, but they didn't want to

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.240
No one could all one word. No one all one word. No one is all one word. Nope

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280
Noon could resist

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.480
The immortality and the omnipotence

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.480
Not one person

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.000
Thought that having the whole planet to them self was better than utopia

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.480
Utopia was forever and it was anything you wanted it to be and yes, this predates the matrix

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:27.760
It was nothing Dan didn't want to hang around either, but he had to his mind was incompatible with the network

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760
I'm starting to do a sarcastic read

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.280
Ashley surprised him from behind with a tall glass of milk

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.520
Why didn't you guys come out with this on a flagpole, why did you save this? Oh before we go

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.480
By the way, we only have 30 seconds left, but we want to bring this really long story

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:58.000
Okay, so so Ashley surprised behind with a tall glass of milk. I thought you might be back here

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.440
She said listen, there's a lot of stuff. I want to do

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:09.400
Do you think Disneyland will work? I mean do the electric companies keep going and stuff?

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.120
We got to find all that out. We're not getting any younger

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.560
Her mind was also tragically non-uploadable

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:26.800
So so earlier when we said that all of the people who were alive

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:35.160
No one was alive. We met except for these two people. Yeah, well everyone that didn't die in the war plug themselves into utopia net

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.400
And and and I'm I'm stuck getting to have sex for the first time in my life

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.720
Over a nice glass of milk

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.840
What's the big deal I'm

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.480
I'm as old as 19 I

01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.200
Dan touch Dan touched your cheek and smiled a genuine smile

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.160
Pumpkin we're the youngest people in the world

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:17.680
Not really honey, not if life begins with conception

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:29.840
Which which it does which it does this isn't true you find out later it does

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.640
I'm pretty sure I'm kind of pregnant. This is before Joss Whedon

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:49.720
Well, if you're not already you're sure gonna be

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.720
I

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:17.000
Figure it's unavoidable what with a drastic decrease in the prices of hotels and champagne

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.840
Due to everyone but us being dead

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.960
Is that ironic that seems like winking at itself almost she giggled a

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:43.360
Person dying was sad five people dying was horrible ten people dying would make you cry

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.960
and

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.960
Seeing a hundred bite it

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:57.040
Might give you nightmares for the rest of your life. I don't then walk you all the way up through the Holocaust

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080
Five million five hundred thousand

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.120
The logic is that a hundred is once it becomes insane and then after that hundred and one hundred and two six million

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.760
Yes, exactly

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.360
I'm making a major but South American invasions are only upsetting as is third world famine and

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.280
and the sinking of an American battleship and

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.560
everyone on the

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.120
And everyone on the planet being dead except for you and your boyfriend

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.280
Hell that's just fucking hilarious

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.040
So they both laughed for about a minute

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:45.800
Embraced kissed and made love there in the warm sand

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.920
An hour later they were walking hand-in-hand

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:06.200
I got to make sure she's pregnant

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.560
The hour later they were walking hand-in-hand through previously unsafe neighborhoods top topical

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.640
They were on fire for the most part looter looters

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.640
Unsafe

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.800
Looters during the past few days had seen the end of the world as a great opportunity to steal television sets and shoot each other

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.520
No, that's television. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I thought you said television set like a singular

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:45.640
Typo nice one Spencer. Hey, that's Ryan. That's what you're you all are waiting for when I was gonna get him back, right? I

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.480
found my moment

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.040
In the green room Ryan

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.920
Was saying that he was a mensch for trying to get his friend in for free to the show Spencer you dick

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.400
That was not my friend. That was a stranger named Connor. Where are you Connor? Do I know you?

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.600
That was exactly what happened. I heard you say I can't get in I can't get in I drove 45 minutes and I said

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.920
Watch what this guy does

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.640
And I went into the green room and I pulled some strings and now look at you second row

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.120
Well, well, I take that back. Yeah. Yeah, you really are a mensch. Yeah, thank you

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.000
I thought that was a friend. I'm a mensch now back to you. I don't think

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.560
that

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.400
Do they know Spencer you don't point out that you're a mensch. I

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.440
Don't think back to you Dan. Yeah, I mean I'm like on the like where it was television sets

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.080
Uh television sets of looters during the public shoot each other. That was funny, too

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960
This was before Columbine

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.360
Well, it was charismatic to not care as a 15 year old and no one had done anything about it yet

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.680
They found an undamaged Buick with the key and Buick like I know what a car is

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.680
They found an undamaged Buick with the keys and the ignition and drove it to Dan's home

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:15.680
But it was completely burnt to the ground son of a bitch Dan said I had a thousand dollars worth of computer equipment in there

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.440
Wait, what do we make of that? That was that was that was

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:35.280
All right, it's a ton of money plus also if you're gonna be uploading people to utopia net you need a computer equipment. Yeah

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.400
Ashley's place wasn't hurt at all. I think that was my equivalent of going like I lost my skateboard

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.600
You know, like I thought that having that much a computer equipment made me cool. I

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.480
Ashley's place wasn't hurt at all. So they spent an hour there

01:16:49.480 --> 01:17:01.200
And we know what takes an hour there's no it's only one thing takes an hour

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.880
Ashley Ashley cried

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.040
And cried and then laughed and they took her parents Pontiac

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.520
Grand Am because it had a CD player at it and because my parents had a potty at Grand Am

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.960
And they were already starting to miss the constant barrage of broadcast information

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320
We don't age to

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.720
Were you about to say we don't have to read the whole thing I just know you guys have stuff to get to

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.080
Well, let's let's let's just go a little faster. Let's go a little faster

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.960
Well, wait, no wait, this is a different thing

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.680
Really? Yeah, this is not what is this? I like this. What is I mean?

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.920
This is the file. I don't know. Yeah, this is I don't know what this is pretend this is part of the same story

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.920
Maybe why don't we save this for next week because this looks this looks this looks a thousand times more embarrassing

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.280
I know

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.000
I always say what we're gonna play we're gonna play shadow run

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.160
Alright, you're fine. Alright, fuck you guys. Alright, we'll read it. This is the thing

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.040
But I'm telling you I could just tell I just it's just it's just wafting off of it

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.840
I'm like I'm seeing random words and we're going no I know because I think this is like I don't even think this is a story

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.160
I ride ahead. It's not as compelling. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.200
I think this is like free writing or something. Yeah, this is not how do we read how do we read this one?

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.480
Do we do we even know what to do with it? Yeah, I don't know if there's characters or we could do it looks

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:46.520
I'm thinking that by and large it looks like a dialogue between two people. Yeah, so if you try to go every other line

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.760
I mean, do you guys just want to try it? Yeah, that's it

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.640
You know what these are John what beautiful man? They're cool. Seriously don't lie to me about stuff like that

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.640
I don't lie John

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.800
If I thought they were shitty photographs and and your bed looked nice, I'd tell you your bed looked nice

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:14.600
As it turns out though your bed is a bear come stained mattress and your photographs are great to be clear

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.760
That's B. A. R. E. Not a bear, you know animal

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640
That would be weird

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.760
There's a world where could happen

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.640
A friend of mine told me that there's a place in Chicago that like discovers amateur photographers

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.320
I got their number and stuff this friend of his or something made like a whole bunch of money through them

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.820
And he's like fucking famous now. Mmm

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960
Maybe that was like a mm-hmm like

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.240
Deuce do so you think I could make money doing stuff like this. What do you want money for and what is this?

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.240
No offense, but it's not real clear

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.840
Well, you know, why does anyone want money for food and stuff?

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.640
That's a picture of a soda cup in a theater. I split it. It's not real good built it. Come on. Oh, sorry

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.160
In fairness that was spelled correctly. We ever spilt it built it built it

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.400
It's not a real good photograph

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.600
But I wanted to remember it because I kind of got like this big idea in my head when it happened

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600
This is before American Beauty

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.600
It

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:27.360
Was one of those things like on TV when something happens to somebody or they see something that kind of changes their life

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.520
Laugh in parentheses

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:38.240
Well, what happened wait, don't tell me you spilled your soda and your friends ridiculed you and got loud and someone in back said

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:43.720
Shut up to them and they said shut up back and a fight broke out later and they blame the entire thing on you

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160
No, nothing like that

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.000
Really shut down that nameless friend. Oh

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.440
Well, that happened to me I guess so

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.200
so

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.280
No, I spilled my soda right and I'm like pretty much in the middle of the theater and the floor slopes down, you know

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.520
So the soda big fucking soda, man

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:14.280
This is probably after reservoir dogs, I'm just assuming I don't know I can't tell why is that in parentheses

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.320
Is he speaking in parentheses? No, I think I didn't know how I didn't know you just do a dash

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.960
Oh, I think this is before reservoir dogs and after I read something by David Mamet

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.520
I'm trying to place this. Oh, I see. Yeah, it's big cuz like that's your foot, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.520
So it's like bigger than my foot and um

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.720
There's a lot of soda and it flows downhill into everyone's feet that's sitting in front of me makes sense

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.040
All the people in front of me start turning around and looking back like who's spilling shit on my feet, man

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.160
And they're all looking at me. So, you know what you're gonna, you know, what are you gonna do you?

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800
turn around

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.080
I

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:59.280
Turn around and the guys behind me. They ain't got no soda on their feet, but they do got 50 people turning around looking at them. So

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.560
They turn around because they're thinking are they looking at something really neat behind me and every everybody's doing this

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.280
And there's this loudmouth big guy

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:16.320
That's everyone's afraid about a quarter everyone's afraid of presumably about a quarter way from the back and he starts up

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:22.680
What the hell's going on? What and all of a sudden the movie goes out of oh, that's not I don't think that's dialogue anymore

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.360
There was no end quote, right. Oh, excuse the fuck

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.320
And the movie goes out of focus see I think a guy in the booth

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.520
Thing up there. I thought that everyone was turning around going what the hell because it was out of focus

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:43.200
So he tried focusing, but he fucked it all up. So then everybody really does start yelling all caps focus

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.160
Focus and so he eventually gets it back to normal

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.040
That's before Play-Doh's cave

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.520
Play-Doh's Play-Doh's cave had not happened yet

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960
Okay, well

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:09.600
I'm really glad I didn't spend the whole interview going like what's with these fucking assholes have come up with this shit

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.600
That's embarrassing. What's wrong with them?

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.800
Because I know it would have been like you too

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.720
That's amazing that you guys kept that stuff around Jacob and Justin everybody

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:31.840
Before you were funny is the name of their show and when you listen to it your spirit will grow

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:38.640
It will grow from the pain that you feel inside because when you were younger your ego was wide

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:48.720
I remember when you made that sound over there, buddy. I'd said something I thought was funny and you were like

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.920
Well, it sounds like you're making a shit sound with your mouth

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.280
You're killing me

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:09.600
Two different sounds for a reason laughter other than the poop sound

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720
It's like a boo

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Get your shit together

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.720
Did you when you were a kid when you were younger, did you did you write a lot a little bit? Yeah, you got anything

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.120
Around you. Yeah, I've got some archives. I

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.240
Mean to be honest, I'm at this level now

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.760
Well as we are kind of approaching with them and it's sort of a it's it's sort of a subjective thing

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.280
Cuz I kind of feel like I feel like the people in the audience like

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.480
Having been them and heard hearing like other people be so laid bare

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:57.400
It's like it's it's not it's for the person that it's for that's sharing the stuff. It's like

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:06.160
God, I don't know the metaphor is it's like like everyone the actual cut is as deep and it's like nice to learn

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.360
That it's not that deep but but it's interesting to see that the person that's

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.320
The person that's receiving the cut thinks that it's gonna cut their whole arm off

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.480
And then watching it not do that because everyone's just like

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.280
Yeah, what is what how good a writer do you think you are now and uh?

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:28.320
Well, how much do you think I care if you were ever a good writer and also

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.560
Like isn't that the first honest the last honest thing you ever wrote in your life because you were like I try to get you pregnant

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.960
Because you're like you didn't know you're just like honest expressing something was that part of some longer

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.760
Story novella. I was only I was just I was I was a wrote a thousand of those things

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.680
It was just like I was trying to like I was like, oh, I can see it

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.120
We can see

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.200
You can see myself getting laid on a beach because the world ended because of robots about utopian that I

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.840
Want to know more about yeah, that's the trouble

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.000
That's when you really have to write a story and stuff

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.400
But I was just more into the you know like when Michaels Michael Scott when they find the posters that he made for his movie

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.640
I know it's one of those people, but I couldn't drop posters

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:19.000
You know, so I just wrote page ones of a lot of like really really immersive

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Stories about me getting laid

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.880
When I was really young I would write sequels to movies. It's like watch thing. Yeah, I'm a match

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.720
I was in the middle of something or I would have said bless you

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.200
So really you should have said I'm sorry because I was in the middle of something

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.280
Bless you. Thank you

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.080
You're sorry, it's okay

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.520
Bless you

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.800
All right, what was I taught who cares I wrote a bunch of stuff when I was a kid who cares. All right. I also used to

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.320
No, never mind. I

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.040
When I was first when I was first masturbating I

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.560
I uh, I would I

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.560
Go on I would I would do I was a kneeler and

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:27.040
And I there was no lock on my bedroom door, so and I just like at the height of my frenzy I

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.240
Would just go into my bedroom door

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.720
close the door

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:34.240
drop my pants

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.160
kneel and jerk off right under the door and

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:48.080
Much like Philip Seymour Hoffman's character and happiness I would I would not like clean it up. I would like um wonderful

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320
This is all part of the thing

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.520
Like because I thought like well, who would ever know what that is

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.280
No one's that's not gonna be anyone's first guess

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:04.720
Who would think a good person would come that much on a door?

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.160
What color was your door?

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:14.160
What what color was your door after a while yellow?

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:25.080
Let's move on I

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:30.520
Was I was just that that's what that's the memory that came back to me

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.520
Well, I was reading that when the guy going like you know gonna you're gonna get pregnant pretty soon for if I know me

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.240
Like and then just like that's all I was was just like this little

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.200
Useless that jackhammer. Did you have this in your hand while you're doing that? I didn't jerk off to my own writing Ridley

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.120
Why not? I

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.240
Did write stuff that I did where I tried to cheat the system with the pornography

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.440
Did you ever did you ever write you were right?

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.120
porn for yourself, of course I

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.040
drew it to

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.040
I'm not ashamed

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.240
Yeah, thank you

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.640
All you non-wors

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.740
Loosen up. Did you find that it worked? Yeah

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.160
Still does

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:25.000
Wait, wait, what do you mean still does what you still you don't still write you don't type out

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.280
Sexual scenarios and then masturbate to them you do

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.480
if you do if you do then let me retract all of my

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:40.800
Funny faces like I because we want to know that'd be a weird podcast people reading the pornography that they

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.800
That would be fucking insane. That would be the most thing that would be the most extreme, right?

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:47.320
Especially from when you were 15

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.120
Which is when I was really doing it man. Oh

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.400
Gravy

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:59.120
What would that even have been I don't even know everyone remember how judgmental Dan was when I first brought it up and now

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.120
He's just confessing

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.440
Flood gates are open. Yeah. All right Ridley

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.240
Yeah, let's bring up to morge

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.160
For God's sake

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:18.080
Can we for God's sake can we can we get to morge up here?

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.480
Is that what you heard it was more laconic I

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.720
Was like let's bring up to morge. Like I was like grumpy like

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.800
Like I needed you the whole time, but I wasn't willing to admit it

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:45.280
That's not what you know what we got it like like this isn't this isn't the right time of the show to do maintenance, but

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.480
for next week and all

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.600
Weeks thereafter

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.200
We got to get some kind of

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:58.200
Implement for the ice because when I want to make people a drink. I don't want to touch their ice

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.720
Tom claw Tom's

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.800
Tom's would be fine a scoop a

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.400
large spoon

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.160
And you know what we've never asked anything of this venue

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.320
We let them sell their comic books up front and they

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:19.560
And we do our little show back here, and it's always been it's been a it's been a detente

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:25.960
But if shit goes down if there's if there's not some tongs here next week

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.040
I don't know what that is that the Star Trek theme

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:34.840
It's like a Confederate harmonica fireside sort of

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:44.040
Whimsy Chris McKenna had the theme from the last Starfighter in his iphone

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:49.840
And he would start playing it every time I every time I went into a rant about something

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:56.840
And then I would say that it was like this weird feedback loop where I was like, do you like me or hate me?

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.040
Therapist told me to breathe

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:12.440
Wusha Wusha. What's what was that? Oh, it's just yeah. Oh, you just made it work make up it. Well, you will okay

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.200
Allow it into yourself. I might have been up might have been a small racist part of me

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.560
That thought that maybe that was a real word that you were teaching us

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.600
And might have been the most racist part of my brain of all

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.800
They're like, uh, mouth noises. Oh, yes, I'm sorry. Sorry

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.680
Roll them around like savory pieces of meat

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.760
Allow the flavors to tell you what they tell you about yourself

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:50.240
It's that you're on do research. It's that time of the show

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.160
When we when we play shadow run

01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:03.160
And it's that time of the show when we we haven't had a we haven't had a lady up when it's only just a coincidence

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.440
So I'd like to ask if anyone wants to come up to the stage

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:15.160
But I won't be picking you if you if you have a if you present as a male

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:21.520
Rex I got you said you said I'll come up you raised your hand first, but but but or I actually you were in my field of vision

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:26.920
She's been up that clinches it you haven't you haven't been up to have you

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.360
All right

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.040
You're from where? Oh from Australia. Okay shit. You won't you

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:40.520
You won't be our first Australian, but we we we love them. We love them. We don't love them all

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:43.680
We don't know that there might be bad people for most of us a fond of you as well

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:51.000
Yeah, excellent. I'm working on what's your name? I'm Melanie. Hi Melanie. Hello. This is DeMorge. My name is Dan Harmon

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.520
I got high before the show and that's Ryan Ridley and it's that's the audience. That's Anna Tolle

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.360
He puts his feet way out

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360
It's fine. You don't have to tuck them in

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:07.880
I'm disappointed. There's no cat sweater. Yeah, and it told you to hear your Russian friends

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:11.800
They're like, oh the puller ice caps are melting that means we can put our legs out on the globe

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:20.360
And they and each leg will suck in more oil so we can make more ice cap melting yeah, you guys are crazy

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:34.240
I told Dan about that vice segment at dinner tonight. You guys got dinner? Yeah. I

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.240
Sure didn't I?

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.680
Yeah, yeah, I care

01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:49.840
He asked me why you don't drive me to the to the show and I said cuz I cuz it's his it's his time

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.520
To make his D&D's. That's true. I make yep

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:02.000
He was not making any D&D's. Oh, no this D&D was made months ago

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.040
All right, let's so Melanie. Have you have you heard the show?

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:12.200
I have yes, so you kind of is there a character you you've always wanted to play we'll give you first choice

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.200
I'd like to play dr. Friend if I could okay, all right

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.720
I feel like he would go off well as an Australian

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800
We gonna find out

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.080
That's called Washawn what he just did

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.920
I'm taking that back to Australia. I'm gonna introduce it to the people wait. Okay. Well, can you guys figure it out?

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:39.800
It's top-down. Okay. Well, you always get okay. That always happens one that says it down the morges

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:45.080
There we go. All right, and we're good with this. This is the number of people we need right?

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.760
So you're right. You're Jeff Davis. Thank you, Ridley. You have no idea what you're doing, right?

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:55.640
You're playing Eve Liberty. That's Jeff Davis's character. I don't know where we are either two more just two more

01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.360
Just play Aaron Aaron is not here. Do we need a replacement for her? No

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.360
Oh

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:09.440
No, we have no face person. I mean anyone's a face person if you believe

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.960
All it takes is a face

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:21.640
All right, well you get a recap and then we'll just let's just jump in and see how it goes

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.120
Yeah, oh um, so I made an email address

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.200
It's it's Harmontown Run if you have a Harmontown Shadow Run recap

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.840
Just send it to Harmontown Run at Gmail that'll make it easier for everyone

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.760
This one was brought to you by ebb and burgoon who also wrote a different one that I said he didn't do but he did it

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.520
Okay

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.520
That's all taken care of

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.680
last time on Shadow Run

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:54.800
With one last drink in a decision the gang hopped into their uber and set out to claim their reward from Johnson

01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:03.000
After some shrewd negotiations the crew handed over the BTL chip research and yellowman to the scheming corporate stooge

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.920
They were all smiles as Johnson gave them the hefty attache case

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.840
Filled with the sweet sweet paper money of this digital age

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:18.760
Those smiles quickly faded to horror as they watched their nefarious employer shoot out the

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.720
Or shoot the unarmed yellowman his splattered blood now on their hands pants and faces

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:31.440
The question of their ethics barely coming into question until the noise from the Johnson driving away

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.200
Turned to the sound of muted beeps from their briefcase

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.320
Will our shadow runners ever get that next drink will they soon join Jesse yellowman in

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:50.040
In nanohell is the meter still running on their uber and do they take paper money? We find out now on Harmontown

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.880
Well

01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.880
I'm I'm thinking

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.640
This is gonna go the briefcase is beeping and start running

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.920
We can't just throw it out of window. This is your apartment

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.520
I think we're in a you're in a you're in a parking lot fence sort of area like a transpose lot

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.200
So I I'm I'm just running

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:25.680
Can I not throw a physical barrier up around the suitcase? You absolutely can do that. I'm gonna do that. All right

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.240
Well, I'll just say whilst we're running

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.080
Well, well, you have to concentrate

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:38.000
I'm gonna concentrate and do that while everyone else runs. I'm gonna nobly sacrifice sacrifice myself possibly all right

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.080
Nobly sacrificing yourself you throw up a force dome

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:49.440
Around the briefcase as it's beeping is muted by the the sound or not the sound by the barrier

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.480
You can't hear it beeping. It's just chilling

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.360
It's just chilling and may have made a mistake

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.560
We now can't hear it beeping

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.660
So if it beeps faster as it counts dead, let's run

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:11.600
No, I'm right. I'm well, I'm I've seen her doing this and I'm so now I'm I'm I need to play off my shame and go like

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.840
Oh good. Yeah, I was good. I was good. I was clearing everybody out

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:17.880
So I think it's good what you're doing. That's good

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.720
We shouldn't be able to hear it beeping that the beeping comes through the explosion medium. Well

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:33.200
We should maybe move away if you can back up while you're creating that barrier. I'll make sure the path behind you is clear

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.480
Holder guard

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.720
runs to dr. Friend wraps an arm around dr. Friend lifts dr. Friend up and

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.680
Runs away with the package using strength and agility

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.000
The package the person of the friend

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.320
Okay, yeah, you run away towards the ends of the transpo lot. You don't see anything happen

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.720
Now you're just far away from a force field dome

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.920
You hear the sounds the sounds of people moving maybe some sort of crowd or March

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.840
People are moving footstep sounds coming from far off. You realize you're not in the best area of town

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:20.240
Using my ability to detect enemies

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.720
I'm trying to see if there is anything that sparks inside of me

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:33.240
Using your detect enemy skill your perception shifts and you can start to see the flickering souls of life around you in the

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.080
Transpo lot you can see the warm auras of your friends

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.120
sparkling with vitality

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:45.000
But also much dimmer flickers many many flickers something some

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:53.520
Entities have damaged souls some sort of weird magical interference, but there's lots of them and they're they're all surrounding you

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.800
So those of us with weapons should probably find them

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.280
close at hand and we should stick together and

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.000
Look to be prepared

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.400
For some sort of what what are you looking at? What are you talking about? Well? I just have a feeling that they're sort of

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.360
It's things are going to go a bit Minnesota in a minute

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.800
You hear hissing and moaning is that Minnesota?

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.680
It certainly is in California. I'll tell you that month

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.480
But I digress I

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:37.440
Mean like that kind of sound like zombies or something they kind of do

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:41.960
Why are they flickering are they like hologram zombies?

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.160
His his enemy sense has the ability to read people's auras

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:53.200
But people who are unhealthy or maybe afflicted by various things might have flickering or damaged auras

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.200
All right, well just tell me where to shoot

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200
I

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.880
Don't say anybody does any

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.040
Way that I can get location on this or there's just sort of in the on the periphery

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:11.520
There's easily more than 30 30 individuals. They're kind of all surrounding the general neighborhood

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:15.720
It's like they're fanning out walking around as if something's roused them

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:21.120
Why have lifted my Ari's Alpha assault rifle with the left hand and on the right the combat axe

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.920
You guys do the best you can do

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:29.280
I'm sure I find find what weapon you have do we have a place we could all meet in case we get separated

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.840
Well, I can't physically hurt someone who hasn't hurt me first. So I'm sticking with you

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600
Okay

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.600
You can carry me right

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.280
Get these smart link perhaps

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.840
Smart link to future Uber or whatever this vehicle is and possibly get some thought of exit to egress from this situation

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.840
Yeah, you could hail an Uber

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.200
Then this is what this is what I have done

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.520
So we're not gonna hang around and check it out at all

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.400
It's doing that thing where you can see all those cars, but no one's biting, you know

01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.880
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go up to the roof so that I can protect everybody

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.680
You're in a fenced area just like a like a parking lot. All right. I'm gonna go over the fence

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:28.000
To this and then I'm gonna seek higher ground like a brave cat

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:38.160
At the at the humane society in a cage with one shelf at the top

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:46.420
Just higher ground. It makes me more comfortable. I I saw I saw a guy get killed on the ground once

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.680
and

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.680
Kind of triggers me

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:56.320
So I'm gonna go up. I could cover you from here

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Perhaps I know I'm

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:07.400
From what what what just muzzle raised. I'm covering you in case some sort of action should happen. No, I'm

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.000
You said you're going. Well, I'm good. I was good. I thought we were all gonna go. Oh

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.360
It's a team operation. We're retreating. I

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:21.640
Thought you're just going on the roof to watch out for us. I was gonna go up the roof because I'm scared, okay?

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.000
Okay, obviously it's come got you that one us to follow you. I

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.720
Don't think you can so I think I have to leave you behind and go up to a higher place where I don't die

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.080
So the one who is so full of so much bluster with monologues and everything. Do you have a monologue for insecurity? I

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.960
Don't think there's time for it. I'm scared. I'm scared of things on the ground. It's my thing

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:48.400
But but the money's on the ground. So so via com link or whatever that is sure

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.120
What's the sitch what do you see people do you see zombies? What's going on? No, he said he saw

01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.880
I haven't seen anything yet

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.320
Tell us what you see look around. I'm

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.760
What I see is my hands climbing over a chain link fence getting out of the fence area

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:13.560
And I'm asking if I also see you guys coming with me or if I have to make up a lie about what happened to you

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.560
To my friends at the bar

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.440
I'm in

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.800
Might I try and is there some sort of distance that can I try to mind link with some of these darker souls?

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:30.000
What does this you're not within range of any any mind linkable as I suspected

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.160
So what I did well to there's two votes in that direction

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.520
So I would say that then hold the guard will follow as will dr. Friend

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:45.680
Heading over the fence you climb upon the roof of an old devastated gas station. Told you there's a roof

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.680
What you see is people milling about they look all weird and screwed up

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.440
They definitely have sorts of skin conditions as well as white skin

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.920
like white white like pale

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:09.040
Albino style white you see their eyes are crusted over as if they are blinded and they're

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:16.280
In their hands are covered in gnarled claws as if they've been twisted by some sort of dark force or virus

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:23.360
You recognize them to be ghouls. That is to say people who have been infected by the HMH VV virus

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.600
Too soon

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:35.120
They're milling about they haven't noticed you but something has brought them out of the woodwork

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:43.360
They haven't noticed us. No, no, they're just milling about blind style. Oh, how many lots like ocean

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.840
No, like like 40 40

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.240
Do I do have I encountered ghouls before oh, yeah, I mean ghouls they're everywhere

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.880
It's it possible to use spell casting to sort of I

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:05.200
Feel like we should just fight them right? I mean this is dying up here. I mean come on. Let's do something. Come on

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:07.200
Let's fight

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:11.240
Do we fight one or do we separate one and see if we can cure them

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.080
We could easily run away

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.040
The only thing that's keeping us here is that do we want to fight 40 ghouls for a briefcase full of paper money?

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:25.480
That's ticking right beeping. They've got HMH V, man. How hard can they be to defeat?

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:35.000
It's I got all kinds of magic spells and stuff. I'm sure you guys got some weapons

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.560
Let's do this. You and the doctor maybe take

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.760
Take your shot

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.600
Well, can I Spencer? Yeah, this says can't physically hurt someone who hasn't hurt me first true

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:50.600
Are they technically trying to hurt me? Well, uh, you haven't seen them try and hurt you

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.600
But you know your morals they slacken from time to time. So

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.280
Let's do this. Well, what if they thank you? All right, fine. I'm with you sister

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.880
Talking to Ridley. Yeah, I'm Eve libertine

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:12.040
All right. Well, okay, I guess I'll guess for lack of anything better to do as the guy who can only shoot guns

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.040
I'll just run down and go

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.040
Ah and shoot my gun

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:24.520
I'm sure you'll be right there to help me. Absolutely. Um, I have severe seafood addiction a

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.160
Distinctive style I'm sure that

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:37.840
Well, how do I kill things Spencer? What do I do? Where am I looking here? I mean you have like some guns somewhere

01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:39.840
I'm like I shoot them

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:50.620
All right, where at the ghouls, okay, and Dan you're just running you're running down. I'm going

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.840
I have both guns in my hand and I'm just firing

01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:00.480
Okay, just what I got also is firing part of what I'm doing is sarcastic

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:03.920
Because I'm tired of people saying I'm a coward

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:10.360
But the truth is the I'm a tactician and a and a procrastinator

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.760
But if this is bravery

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.760
So who's all doing stuff I got you to anyone else doing anything

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:27.520
Can I fire the audience assault rifle? Just yep blanket the area

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.420
Sure now we're talking and I have a ranged weapon. Mm-hmm. I'd like to shoot that as well. Okay

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:36.240
So everyone's just shooting. All right

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:45.080
Jim nightblade leaps off the top of the gas station and launches himself into the fray firing while yelling

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960
semi-sarcastic Lee

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:58.640
He pops two or three ghouls in their body parts as Eve libertine also fires her weapons

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.840
Oh, yeah at the ghouls dropping. Let me use some of this astral combat too. Oh

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.600
I see there's a four next to it. That's not a gun though. It's combat

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:19.520
All right utilizing his astral combat, he realizes all the ghosts he could be attacking right now

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Oh ha ha ha

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440
I'll get to them later

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:38.400
Continuing to hail to hail the enemy with their fiery bullets. I don't know what the fuck

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.040
Anyway firing many automatic weapons

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.600
bullets plunge into the zombies

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
killing at least

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.920
Killing seven of them. No, see that's good. It's good

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.920
Three surround Jim nightblade, but the rest seem to be scared and running away. Did you say 30 three? Oh

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.480
Not not too bad. Yeah

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:07.960
They lunge nano whip. Well, they're lunging. Well, nano whip their lunge. They

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:17.840
Lunge and you yeah, no, you definitely dodge out of the way. Whoa, it seems that ghouls

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:30.640
Are not too dexterous looks like you guys aren't too dexterous

01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:35.080
Might I recommend some calisthenics in the morning and oh not being a ghoul

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.640
Ghoul burn

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.640
I

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:53.440
Where'd you go? Yeah, what happened? Yeah, I mean obviously take a shit, right? No other reason to leave

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.440
very subtle

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:03.880
Horde guard with his combat sense expertly drops a few zombies as an adduce

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.120
Then he sees Jim nightblades being surrounded

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:13.120
Being surrounded by ghouls. I called in the airstrike. Oh

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.640
Horde guard you got you got crazy reflexes. You're the only one who can act right now

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.640
So obviously your skills of focus on it the negative, right? I

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.560
I guess it could have been a peepee. No

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
It was it was the latter

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.760
That was fast on

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:48.920
You didn't yeah, yeah, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about later

01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.760
Soil and soil and blue is not what it used to be

01:52:52.760 --> 01:53:01.160
Um save him horde guard from zombies

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400
Using a

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.120
Blades I'm tossing blades

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.200
Okay, what what blades do you have to toss?

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:25.560
The what the sort of blades I think the combat hatchets the only the only blade you have so I'm going to

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.160
Actually, I'm not going to toss. I'm gonna wield it. I'm gonna walk into the situation

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.640
Moving as fast as I can reacting quickly and swinging

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:40.160
Wait, what with me? Okay murderous intent with anything that is a problem

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:43.080
Walking quickly with murderous intent

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.080
You

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:51.880
Wield your axe wildly you leap off the gas station roof you land on top of a zombie

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:59.480
Coming down with your hatchet you cleave the other one in half in twain. This is like I what I'd like to call it right in twain

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:05.200
Cleft in twain was it's a really old D&D thing we did once

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.920
Yeah episode 8 it's something like those are the days

01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.480
One zombie remains

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.480
Really really oh a lot of them scan last he just killed two now. We're the bad guys. We're just gonna gather

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.480
Just start taunting it and waiting for a zombie cop to show up to say is it possible that horde guard could fly off

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:45.120
A fire off a flashback. Yep flashbang sure to possibly stop stop the zombie in his tracks. Well, it's blind

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.000
But the concussion sure might do a thing

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.320
Do we need to question this zombie sorry before we kill yeah, yeah find out what it knows I

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:03.720
Know I'm the overzealous one, but everybody Eve Eve's everybody stand down Eve's gonna question the zombie the ghoul

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:06.160
All right get in there

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.360
I mean I can heal things well what I'm saying. Well if he doesn't talk or she then

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:19.080
We don't heal. We'll say tell us the truth and she'll heal you right. Yeah, all right

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.760
You get what I'm saying you guys you guys your fingers in the pools of the ghoul population

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.960
What I'm doing is I'm pushing my thumb into the ghoul's wound trying to you know

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:36.400
Get it to talk you want to make physical contact with an infected good waiting in HHM VVV

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.560
Well, just okay ghoul you come on come on ghoul

01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:54.360
The future and trying to eat people why are you here powers? There's no ghoul captain

01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.200
We're not that they just came out of a play they didn't come out of the suitcase. There's no

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.400
We can't reason with the middle. Yeah, why are you assuming all this?

01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.080
Even if we could is what I'm saying if what if they were the smartest rats in the world

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.640
But what are you doing rat? He'd be like, what do you think I'm walking around and shit?

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:19.860
You're here in my story. It's not I'm interrogating you the ghoul should be asking us. What where can I eat you?

01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:25.980
He has no information for us. He's a mouth with legs

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:33.980
This is some kind of crazy cyber steampunk world. I don't know the rules are it's half magic half technology

01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:39.900
I don't know what ghouls are in this world. I have some facility with spell casting. Is there some sort of a spell?

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.060
I'm searching my brain trying to pull out something that might

01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:52.300
Latch on to that kernel of human that might still be left within the zombies consciousness

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:59.180
I mean, I don't know man. You got to check your spells. I have said the level is five. I don't I'm looking at

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:05.940
I'm gonna go over to the briefcase. Well, this is happening. Okay, is it still so while Spencer is laughing

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:08.740
Does it still have the barricade on it? Yeah. Yeah, it does I

01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:14.940
I uh, I go. Hey, you want to lower the barricade up this encounters make me

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:22.900
Ancy sure I'll lower the barricade you do that you hear beeping I

01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:32.740
Open the briefcase you see nothing inside except for a small transiefer fucking cock getting beeping shit fucker

01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:41.620
The ghoul that Ridley was talking to starts going crazy and craze it starts thrashing around trying to swipe at anything within reach

01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:46.780
But they put a fucking ghoul magnet and the goddamn God gold is tricking the fucking book

01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:49.980
Fucking ghoul magnet

01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:55.860
We fell for the goddamn three-card money of 2057

01:57:57.300 --> 01:57:59.300
Fucking ghoul magnet

01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:04.100
It's like it's like what are we fucking idiots?

01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:12.620
So are you stomping on it or anything or do you want me to put the barrier back up again?

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:17.740
Oh, just I mean no take the ghoul magnet. It's if we can sell it at a fair

01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:25.780
What can we turn it off? Well, okay? I mean can you turn it off really by killing the ghoul like the ghoul magnet?

01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:33.060
I mean honestly, I you're talking to a person who's just at the end of his rope

01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:36.780
I just feel like such an idiot. I've changed my mind so many times on this job

01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:42.780
No, we get the guy killed. We didn't do anything right. I'm a bad shadow runner. We got tricked by a ghoul magnet

01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:49.980
Hold a gun fires off a shock round in the direction of the flashing threeling threshing beast

01:58:49.980 --> 01:59:00.020
In the hopes that this will stop him from hoping you mean the ghoul, right? Yes, the ghoul you do that and it does that

01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.020
I noted Melissa

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:04.740
So at least we've solved this

01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:10.340
Melanie no, I know my place now. That's okay

01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:21.500
The ghoul is down for the count ghoul magnet

01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:28.860
All right, well, but not forever in the interim you two can work this out for yourselves

01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:32.940
Well, now you know what happens. We're gonna figure out how they end the end of the chapter

01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:36.140
dramatic pickup of the briefcase

01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:42.260
The brief it's an empty briefcase. Somebody gave us this ghoul magnet, right? Yeah

01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:50.260
Oh, but who the people that we're here and shot every but I wasn't I don't know I'm new to this story. I don't know

01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:56.580
It's the people they hired us. They they we don't know who they are. They're the people that wanted the

01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:03.980
Information about the BTL chicks. Can we look at like a serial number on the ghoul magnet trace it back to its manufacturer?

02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:06.740
And then find out who ordered and all that kind of stuff

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:11.820
Why not? I mean the funniest thing in the world would be if we ended up on a different adventure at a ghoul magnet factory

02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:18.620
That's a big response. Thank you for responding

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:20.620
Oh

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.460
hard poop and soccer fan

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.140

Nemesis Chris our director in the back and Kevin
