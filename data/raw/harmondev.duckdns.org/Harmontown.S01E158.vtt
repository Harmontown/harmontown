{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.400\nNow, hello everybody, I am your guest comptroller, Ryan Ridley, Harmontown is now in session.\n\n00:18.400 --> 00:29.920\nPlease welcome your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden, and of course the Mayor of Harmontown, Dan\n\n00:29.920 --> 00:42.520\nHarmontown. Thank you very much. Thank you for having me back. Here, here in the City of\n\n00:42.520 --> 00:47.920\nAngels. Did you know that's what Los Angeles means? Yeah, of course. So where's the city\n\n00:47.920 --> 00:53.320\npart of that? That's a Los Angeles. Where does it, where's the, I know it's enough Spanish to know\n\n00:53.320 --> 00:59.520\nwe're being taken for a ride. Yeah. It means the city of angels. No, I think it means the angels.\n\n00:59.520 --> 01:06.760\nDid you get, or, or, or Los Angeles is like short for some ridiculous, stupid, long name. Did\n\n01:06.760 --> 01:13.840\nyou guys know that? Los Ciudad de Angeles? No, it's, it's, I mean, it's at least four times that\n\n01:13.840 --> 01:22.720\nmany syllables, I believe. I don't know it. So this is worthless. I stopped listening because I was,\n\n01:22.720 --> 01:28.680\nnot because, because I'm a flawed person is why I stopped listening. Well, I mean, you made the\n\n01:28.680 --> 01:35.320\nright choice. No, no, don't, don't self deprecate. It was a dead end. How are you doing, Ridley? I'm\n\n01:35.320 --> 01:40.840\ngood. I'm a lot less nervous than the last time I was here. Yeah. Still more nervous than Jeff,\n\n01:40.840 --> 01:47.720\nthough. Oh God, yeah. Yeah. Of course. He's never, is he ever nervous? Any, any time? I think he\n\n01:47.720 --> 01:56.600\nchannels it via like tubes down his back, like actual, actual visible tubes down like, that's why\n\n01:56.600 --> 02:05.600\nhe always wears a suit. It's, it's to mask his, his dune armor that like goes into his balls,\n\n02:05.600 --> 02:13.280\nobviously, because the more nervous he should be, the bigger his balls get, which makes you go,\n\n02:13.280 --> 02:25.640\noh, he's not nervous. And he's like, not anymore. Not thanks to ball direct. And, and, and some of\n\n02:25.640 --> 02:33.280\nyou ladies, and I'm not, I, I, I, I, my, my, my strong fierce, totally equal agency addicted\n\n02:33.280 --> 02:40.800\nArmenian females. You're going, what's the big deal with balls? What about the puffy parts of\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:51.240\nthe labia? Is that the, do you don't, you don't go by where just the part where on the body where\n\n02:51.240 --> 02:58.400\nit hangs down? Yeah. No. All right. I'll keep researching. I was, I was trying to come in,\n\n02:58.400 --> 03:01.480\nyou know, I was trying to be an understanding man, but I guess I need to look into it a little\n\n03:01.480 --> 03:16.720\nmore. I know it's the ovaries. Okay, so my lovely speaking of labia, my wife, Erin McGathy, or as\n\n03:16.720 --> 03:22.480\nthey call her in her homeland, Erin McGathy, she's over in Ireland right now. She left for New\n\n03:22.480 --> 03:30.160\nYork to go on an out a month long vision quest. You said something like identity quest is what\n\n03:30.160 --> 03:37.120\nI said identity quest because vision quest sat, we say that now to, I think impune. If your friend,\n\n03:37.120 --> 03:45.760\nKevin, you know, sarcastic, yeah, you're kind of like, Oh, Kevin's on his vision. Walk about, maybe\n\n03:45.760 --> 03:52.720\nwe should bring back vision quest is kind of like, we need to let that soil heal. And let me shed\n\n03:52.720 --> 03:57.800\nan extra tear for the Native American people who came up with the vision quest as far as I know,\n\n03:57.800 --> 04:06.160\nonly to see it go from being magical to hack. Like, imagine that they're like, now that first,\n\n04:06.160 --> 04:14.600\nfirst my life, then, then all this litter in the seven days. Now, now my comedic chops.\n\n04:14.600 --> 04:22.280\nThey get it, they get a tough break. No, I'm, no, I'm the new Abe Lincoln,\n\n04:22.280 --> 04:30.520\nsays a guy who's effectively slaughtered by Lincoln, slaughtered by him. Every slave he\n\n04:30.520 --> 04:39.960\nfreed cost an Indian a life. Look it up. Don't look it up. Don't look it up because I'm afraid\n\n04:39.960 --> 04:46.160\nI'm wrong. Don't look it up because let's, don't, don't, don't spend your night that way. Don't,\n\n04:46.160 --> 04:50.320\ndon't, don't look it up because you have people in your life that need you and neighbors that are\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:55.000\nafraid of you. I don't even know how you'd look that up. What would that even look like in a Google\n\n04:55.000 --> 05:00.760\nsearch? What would the results be? I don't want to answer the question because they'd have to break\n\n05:00.760 --> 05:07.480\nit down into funny things about actual genocidal statistics. Speaking of statistics, I don't know.\n\n05:07.480 --> 05:14.040\nI don't want to jump to that. Erin's in Ireland and she's done it different times outside. I don't\n\n05:14.040 --> 05:19.560\nknow. She's sending me police brutality statistics. So we'll get, we'll check in with her department\n\n05:19.560 --> 05:26.600\nand just a while we've got, we've got Fred, Fred Rickson on the Fred floor. Fred, how's it go\n\n05:26.600 --> 05:31.680\ndown with all those friends? Well, the friends are spread from floor to ceiling. It's a Fred room.\n\n05:31.680 --> 05:38.760\nAll right, Fred. We'll more on that later. Now we go to Steve. Steve, what's going on in Hawaii?\n\n05:38.760 --> 05:43.480\nWell, I bet you thought there was going to be steves here, but I'm just in Hawaii. Back to you,\n\n05:43.480 --> 05:53.720\nRick. Fred, Fred, are you okay? Oh my God, Fred's drowning in Fred's. Steve, do something. I'm in\n\n05:53.720 --> 06:04.040\nHawaii, Rick. I can't do anything. Was your name Rick? So, so she's in Hawaii. She's not in Hawaii.\n\n06:04.040 --> 06:18.040\nShe's in, she's in Ireland, Erin. And, you know, I had to, I, I, I have to, you know, I have, like,\n\n06:18.040 --> 06:26.960\nI like, you know, I was like, like, she was, she was registering a satyr things earlier before me,\n\n06:26.960 --> 06:30.880\nand then checking it with me and going, you know, I'm leaving for a month. And I'm like, yeah,\n\n06:30.880 --> 06:36.280\nyeah. And then she's like, well, are you sad that I'm leaving for a month? And I'm like,\n\n06:36.280 --> 06:42.360\nyeah, of course, I feel these things differently than you, you know, like, and I do. And I did.\n\n06:42.360 --> 06:49.880\nAnd I, but, and then I like an hour before she, her car pulled up to the hotel in New York,\n\n06:49.880 --> 07:01.120\nI was like, I just wave of panic with a maximum of three days ever. And I'm not seeing this person. And,\n\n07:01.120 --> 07:07.120\nand yeah, just, and then I was so excited to text her, I'm really pumped out. And she was like,\n\n07:07.120 --> 07:15.520\nyay. So, you know, stuck her in a car and off she goes to the airport to go to Ireland, her,\n\n07:15.520 --> 07:23.280\nher, her ancestral homeland, where she's, it's, it's a, it's a, you did that, you did the Israeli\n\n07:23.280 --> 07:30.720\nversion of this. This is a, it's a goy kibbutz. Much more dangerous. Not that it's a competition,\n\n07:30.720 --> 07:39.360\nbut I was definitely risking my life more. We must have talked about this on the show. But when\n\n07:39.360 --> 07:44.200\nyou went, I had all other friends that went to Israel and did the thing and they said that they\n\n07:44.200 --> 07:55.480\nwere decoy bus stops, decoy bus secret, secret real bus stops down in a secret place and then a big\n\n07:55.480 --> 08:03.000\nfake public Sesame Street bus stop for, for getting blown up. So it still results in people getting\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:10.640\nblown up? No, no, no, they don't send people to, no, it's they tell everybody, just for Jews,\n\n08:10.640 --> 08:19.920\nthe secret, it's a secret. But look, I heard this from a Jewish guy. This is not me. I'm, I will\n\n08:19.920 --> 08:24.880\nbe very happy to find out this isn't true. I mean, you guys sound like Smurfs a little bit. Well,\n\n08:24.880 --> 08:32.040\nnobody told me about the secret bus stops. I bet it was like one thing. I bet it was like a,\n\n08:32.040 --> 08:37.480\nI bet it was like a, I bet that's an urban legend created from somebody. I, from like one stretch\n\n08:37.480 --> 08:43.200\nof road where they built a, you know, like it was some apocryphal, like based on a real one real\n\n08:43.200 --> 08:49.480\nincident. The closest ever, I was in a bus stop in the West Bank and there was a concrete slab\n\n08:49.480 --> 08:54.840\nnext to it. And they said it was because the snipers protected you from snipers. Just that was\n\n08:54.840 --> 08:57.800\nreal. Just while you're at the West Bank, because that's where all the money is or\n\n08:57.800 --> 09:07.320\nthat's the opposite. That's where all the money is not. When they, when they added the ATMs at\n\n09:07.320 --> 09:15.800\nthe West Bank, they had to, they had to add a sniper barrier. Oh God, Dan. Get them while they're\n\n09:15.800 --> 09:22.680\nwithdrawing their money from the West Bank. I'm going to look it up later and I'm going to have\n\n09:22.680 --> 09:28.320\na really smart conversation about Israel. On the same side is the Indians slaves. Yes. Yeah. So\n\n09:28.320 --> 09:35.800\ngeopolitically, I'm on it. And, and my, and so what, what Erin is on is sort of a, yeah, it's the,\n\n09:35.800 --> 09:44.520\nit's the, she, it's not, she, it's, it's like a website that like, I don't even know. I can't\n\n09:44.520 --> 09:51.520\ndescribe it without making it sound silly. It's a, it's a, it's a website that pairs people that\n\n09:51.520 --> 09:58.320\nare looking to travel with a organic farm, like non-profit kind of, a network of, a non-profit\n\n09:58.320 --> 10:04.400\nnetwork of organic farms or businesses that, and then the people can go and like, I think work for\n\n10:04.400 --> 10:09.480\nroom and board, but then you get to just stay there for, you know, so, so, you told me it was an\n\n10:09.480 --> 10:16.000\nIrish kebuts. An Irish kebuts. And then I understood what you meant. Yeah. What, what's a non-Irish kebuts?\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:27.000\nA kebuts. What is? The kind in Israel, I guess. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna describe a real kebuts\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:32.320\nbecause I, I'm, I, it'll somehow I'll walk over some tripwire. Say something anti-semitic again.\n\n10:32.320 --> 10:37.120\nYeah. I'll, I'll sound, I won't say something anti-semitic. Talk in your description, possibly\n\n10:37.120 --> 10:45.440\nbe more offensive than the ATM flypaper. Well, that's not, okay. See, you're drawing the anti-semitic\n\n10:45.440 --> 10:50.760\ndots of like, Jews and money. I get what you're drawing. The line came out of your mouth between\n\n10:50.760 --> 11:05.640\nthe two dots. West, west bank, bank, it's a, the word bank. Oh my God. Wait, no one, that was just a\n\n11:05.640 --> 11:14.800\nhorrible coincidence. Wait, so you guys were just hanging out in a world where I like, hate Jews\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:20.480\nand, and then I think it's hilarious that I hate them. And then I'm like, well, I got one. They're\n\n11:20.480 --> 11:26.880\ngetting their money because they're Jews. I've been hanging out in that world for 10 years. That's\n\n11:26.880 --> 11:32.320\nas long as I've known you. Well, can somebody, can you put a special tone in the podcast recording?\n\n11:32.320 --> 11:39.120\nBecause if they're a test group, then 2 million people are about to think that I, and they won't\n\n11:39.120 --> 11:48.640\nwait this long. You can't delete the Vulture headline. You can't unwrite the 20 pages that are\n\n11:48.640 --> 11:56.760\nabout to get published in salon that you can write in 10 minutes. I think it'd be fine. I'm your\n\n11:56.760 --> 12:14.000\nRobin Quivers. All right. What's a kibbutz? It's like a commune, basically. Oh, in Israel. That's\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:28.240\nall it is. Okay. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know what a commune is? Oh, yeah. Okay. Very disappointing.\n\n12:28.240 --> 12:35.400\nYou go and you, you ho, you ho a potato or what's a Jewish potato? What's an Israeli potato? A lot.\n\n12:35.400 --> 13:03.640\nOranges, actually. What did you say? A latke. A latke. You know, I was going to make that joke. I was like, say latke, it'll get a laugh. And I was like, no, give the real information. And I said oranges. Or dates. I was just so shaken by the bank thing. Like I was just like, yeah, I'm six years old. It's a bank, right? And everyone's like, Oh my God. But you were still talking about how the Jews were\n\n13:03.640 --> 13:12.600\ncoming there to get money out. Well, who cares? Yeah, I'm not dumb. Like I'm not, I'm not, I'm not Peter Sellers and being there. I'm not, I'm not like, Oh, I'm so innocent. I'm just saying like my intent couldn't have been\n\n13:12.600 --> 13:41.160\nworth it. I was doing dumb wordplay. Yeah, I can still call them Jews and say that they're going there. I didn't mean that it wasn't making the. Yeah. No, oh, no, no. Okay, so Aaron's in Ireland. She's on a kibbutz, essentially, which you know, you now know what that is. I do. And she's gone. She's\n\n13:41.160 --> 14:02.520\nshe's she's she's ethereal. She's watching. She's right there. But I mean, I can't touch her. And I thought, you know, the car drives away. And I went I had a little I had a little surprise cry in like a bathroom. But like, and then I was like, but I really and I pushed it down. There was the wrong kind of laugh from the back.\n\n14:02.520 --> 14:22.000\nThank you. We now live in a world where we know the different kinds of laughs. That was a was the wrong kind of laugh. I'm not I'm not judging you. You're free to stay. But I know you are judging me. And I'm calling you out. Hashtag cancel the back row.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:51.000\nSo so, I but then so then I suppress it all and I suppress it with the fabric of I go, I get to play really, really uninterrupted video games, like, I don't think and I don't I don't I don't think that, you know, Aaron, the truth is Aaron never stopped me, you know, she was never the reason. But there was just like I just mean with impunity with no guilt, no shame, you know, like,\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:56.580\nWhich is a dangerous thing because I have a lot of shit to do like Erin would always be she's like\n\n14:56.580 --> 15:00.300\nIt's five in the morning, and I'd be like so what you're not my real mom\n\n15:02.260 --> 15:06.740\nBut now it's just like oh shit, I forgot to feed the fish or something\n\n15:06.740 --> 15:09.460\nYou know I was like I stuff will grow on me if I'm not careful\n\n15:10.740 --> 15:18.420\nSo but but still I'm very excited and I and I hook up the the shadows of Mordor a game\n\n15:18.460 --> 15:20.460\nYeah, these kids know what I'm talking about\n\n15:20.460 --> 15:23.020\nThey like they like the shadows of Mordor\n\n15:24.020 --> 15:31.780\nAnd they're going through the tutorial, you know every video game now has the you know action video game has like the the parts where\n\n15:31.820 --> 15:37.660\nYou know they they sometimes they work it into the narrative. Sometimes they just go. Hey, here's a tutorial a lot of them seem\n\n15:38.380 --> 15:42.820\nHard-pressed to work into the narrative. I don't know why you couldn't just say me in the training part\n\n15:42.820 --> 15:50.300\nYeah, I was like like it seems like we were about 15 years in now of all video games being ironic and working it into the narrative\n\n15:50.300 --> 15:53.460\nMm-hmm. I don't know if I think they're putting too much effort on themselves\n\n15:53.460 --> 15:55.260\nI think I know I mean I don't play a lot of video games\n\n15:55.260 --> 15:58.940\nYou're talking about in elder scrolls when you're in the prison and you in oblivion and you get\n\n16:00.940 --> 16:01.740\nThat's good\n\n16:01.740 --> 16:04.260\nThat's like a good version of it because you're doing real stuff\n\n16:04.260 --> 16:08.940\nBut it's like the bad ones are like your friend winslow comes over and he's like for old-time stick\n\n16:08.940 --> 16:10.940\nWhy don't you wave the stick around?\n\n16:15.540 --> 16:20.060\nYou know I thought the weird the weird ones are the ones where they're actually telling you that\n\n16:20.060 --> 16:22.060\nI think the weirdest one so far is\n\n16:22.700 --> 16:28.660\nNew Vegas because they your character is waking up from a near-fatal head wound\n\n16:29.300 --> 16:33.820\nA doctor has fixed your brain and is doing a checkup on you\n\n16:33.820 --> 16:37.260\nAnd so so he wants to make sure your brain works, right?\n\n16:37.260 --> 16:38.900\nSo he asks you to\n\n16:38.900 --> 16:44.860\nAssociate certain things and the whole time you're like well come on. I know I'm I know I know when you ask me that what you really mean is\n\n16:44.940 --> 16:46.940\nDo I want to be a demolitions expert?\n\n16:46.940 --> 16:52.660\nUh-huh, but it also just weird that you're asking me to form my own brain from a head injury\n\n16:52.660 --> 16:55.100\nLike I'm always gonna think whatever I blow myself up later\n\n16:55.100 --> 17:00.420\nI'm gonna be like I bet I was supposed to be a sniper and I bet I'm and I bet they shot the judgment part out of my brain\n\n17:01.420 --> 17:03.420\nSo I'm a monster in this game\n\n17:03.660 --> 17:08.300\nAnyways the so but they but they they always walk you through. Okay.

They're not teaching you that he's learning how to\n\n19:03.700 --> 19:05.700\nUsing flowers\n\n19:10.460 --> 19:17.020\nThe craziest like mentor in the world because of his romance training he's able to be an elite assassin\n\n19:17.020 --> 19:27.820\nYeah, or because he's such a lethal assassin recognizes the to kill his nose to love This is like a downer\n\n19:27.820 --> 19:32.540\nBut there's like a call-a-duty game where like you attend a funeral and you can press X\n\n19:32.540 --> 19:35.580\nSo you're supposed to press X to pay respects to the fallen\n\n19:35.860 --> 19:40.420\nBut you can mess up like if you don't approach it at the wrong angle like you could press\n\n19:40.420 --> 19:47.820\nIt'll also pop up press like control pad to vault over the gravestone. It's just some bad\n\n19:48.820 --> 19:55.980\nI love I love those unintentional social the things that like all video games have that to the extent that they try to simulate reality\n\n19:56.300 --> 20:00.900\nTry to simulate a world and individuality. There's always these gaps where it just it's like\n\n20:01.220 --> 20:03.580\nIt's hilarious like like unavoidably\n\n20:04.540 --> 20:08.700\nsociopathic like the which are three that they like you walk into a guy's hut and\n\n20:08.700 --> 20:15.540\nHe and and you go hey, I'm here about the thing you put on the board. Oh, yes, my Jessica\n\n20:15.540 --> 20:21.060\nOh, they found her bones outside the troll cave, but the blood trail let off the cliff\n\n20:21.060 --> 20:27.620\nI keep telling the preacher that her soul won't come back tormented, but he's making me tie this ear to a branch\n\n20:28.540 --> 20:34.660\nI'm afraid ghouls will come and try to eat me because they'll be attracted by the my daughter's rotting human flesh\n\n20:34.660 --> 20:42.060\nSo could you come with me and just stave off the ghouls so I can summon my daughter's ghost and just murder her\n\n20:42.220 --> 20:44.220\nWith the arms of her lover\n\n20:44.700 --> 20:47.220\nTo banish her soul for all of eternity\n\n20:47.980 --> 20:54.300\nAnd I'll give you I'll give you 20 silver pieces and then and then just just one of your four options is like\n\n20:54.700 --> 20:56.700\nHow about a hand of Gwent?\n\n20:57.980 --> 21:02.460\nWhich is like this card game and the thing it's just it's just like you\n\n21:02.460 --> 21:05.100\nJust going you know checkers\n\n21:05.100 --> 21:11.120\nOh, you want it you're asking me if you'd rather play Gwent instead or you're offering them a deck of Gwent you're\n\n21:12.300 --> 21:16.580\nMy punchline demands of really religious knowledge of what you're three\n\n21:18.060 --> 21:23.940\nAnd I apologize for that I was on a I was on a roll halfway through and I was like this is this train is not coming\n\n21:23.940 --> 21:28.740\nTo the station they think it is and I could have ripped something, but then it would have been like I would you would have gotten like\n\n21:28.740 --> 21:30.740\nWhy would you play checkers and I\n\n21:30.740 --> 21:33.640\nStuck I tried I'm really sorry about everything that happened\n\n21:36.020 --> 21:38.680\nBut but all those RPG games they're always like\n\n21:39.180 --> 21:41.580\nYou know there's like somebody that's like they're just talking forever\n\n21:41.940 --> 21:47.660\nSometimes about like corpses of their ancestors and stuff and you can always just go like so what have you got for sale?\n\n21:49.500 --> 21:53.620\nBecause they just happen to also be a blacksmith could you make me a hammer?\n\n21:53.620 --> 21:58.580\nI love the idea of a guy that would really be like that\n\n22:01.180 --> 22:03.180\nPeople\n\n22:05.580 --> 22:07.580\nListen about that thing earlier\n\n22:08.700 --> 22:15.020\nHere's your hammer so your wife. Oh God. Thank God. I guess you're just like a strange person, but I\n\n22:15.020 --> 22:22.060\nI hear I as I said at the top of the conversation your reputation precede you\n\n22:25.060 --> 22:29.300\nI'm very disturbed because I have shadows and borders and they're great. It's like a Batman thing\n\n22:29.300 --> 22:32.580\nHey, what's this the video game show? I don't know. What did you think it was Troy?\n\n22:34.220 --> 22:36.340\nIs that somebody in the audience your picture? Yeah?\n\n22:37.740 --> 22:39.740\nYeah, raise your hand Troy\n\n22:39.740 --> 22:44.740\nAnd your name might not be Troy. I hate video games, and I love Dan Harmon\n\n22:46.620 --> 22:50.740\nSo I I did that person deserves actually a lot of attention\n\n22:52.340 --> 22:54.340\nI think I'm Troy\n\n22:57.260 --> 23:02.580\nBut I just I'm just talking about in general like like you don't have to have any familiarity with video games for this conversation to\n\n23:02.580 --> 23:10.060\nHappen so as I've often said the thing that I love most about these video games is inventory management. I\n\n23:11.700 --> 23:15.580\nLove I love no matter what the games like I demand that it be really good\n\n23:15.580 --> 23:21.500\nBut you know with the combat that I gotta kill a dinosaur and I gotta but I will always like 90% of the game as\n\n23:21.980 --> 23:26.700\nAnybody that's ever come into my home will tell you like it's just me that it's just a screen of tax\n\n23:26.700 --> 23:28.700\nAnd I'm just like sorting cabinets\n\n23:28.700 --> 23:30.700\nI\n\n23:31.100 --> 23:37.700\nSaid and then once I do like I stop playing like I'm like these are my fishing rods. These are my\n\n23:38.660 --> 23:44.420\nMagical swords. These are these are my swords that I'm probably gonna sell because let's face it. I don't need them, but I\n\n23:45.660 --> 23:50.140\nAlso don't need the money at this point because I kind of gotta think down to a system\n\n23:51.100 --> 23:52.380\nThese are my wolf pelts\n\n23:52.380 --> 23:58.460\nThese are my uncured wolf pelts because the thing is if you there's a guy in the other town that if you sell them to him\n\n23:58.460 --> 24:02.060\nHe'll give you an extra gold piece if you do that a thousand times you that's a good way to spend an hour\n\n24:04.500 --> 24:09.500\nI just like I I'm obsessed I become obsessed with these things that I'm not obsessed with in real life\n\n24:09.660 --> 24:13.260\nBut then the other the only other thing that I like Ryan\n\n24:13.700 --> 24:18.340\nYeah, and this is this is come this is a segment called\n\n24:18.340 --> 24:21.500\ndark confessions\n\n24:22.780 --> 24:27.420\nIs there a music cue for I know I'm hitting you kind of off-card there\n\n24:28.740 --> 24:30.740\nYeah\n\n24:33.340 --> 24:35.140\nYeah\n\n24:35.140 --> 24:40.780\nSo I the shadows of murder made me look friendly I connected the dots because I'm like why not I like this game\n\n24:40.780 --> 24:47.340\nI like Assassin's Creed. I like the Batman games. I like these aspects of these games. I like stalking and killing\n\n24:47.340 --> 24:54.260\nYeah, I like specifically stalking and killing. Yeah, not fair fighting people\n\n24:54.780 --> 24:58.140\nNot being honorable. Like I like creepy\n\n24:58.980 --> 25:00.980\nHorrible I know this actually\n\n25:01.540 --> 25:06.140\nLike creepy like like like like like 70s serial killer\n\n25:06.140 --> 25:09.860\nYou don't remember because we were the one time I did play video games ten years ago\n\n25:09.860 --> 25:14.700\nWe were both playing oblivion and I found out that that was the difference between you and me\n\n25:14.700 --> 25:18.300\nBecause I like to go charging into battle with the sword\n\n25:18.860 --> 25:23.380\nSwinging face-to-face with my opponents and you're like no I sneak up behind them and slip their throats\n\n25:23.380 --> 25:25.380\nAnd I was like what's the fun in that?\n\n25:26.220 --> 25:29.420\nBecause you're because it's a lot. It's like not playing the game\n\n25:31.900 --> 25:36.300\nWho is the time I do I do\n\n25:37.380 --> 25:40.660\nLike if you would watch me well now you can with twitch\n\n25:40.660 --> 25:46.180\nBut if you want but but but I would have like if you see me the way that I play video games\n\n25:46.180 --> 25:52.980\nWell, I'm like I like it's just I'm always thinking like like I'll just find some fucking cabinet or like like a little\n\n25:53.100 --> 25:56.220\nRailing or something where like it's shaped weird so the\n\n25:57.100 --> 26:00.900\nWiggle in there and then the mind just wait for the monsters to go\n\n26:05.140 --> 26:07.140\nAnd then I'm like coward bomb\n\n26:07.140 --> 26:11.020\nAnd it takes like two damage away and they're like\n\n26:12.020 --> 26:16.220\nAnd I'm like I got you motherfucker. Yeah hole in the system\n\n26:17.460 --> 26:21.420\nIt may only be two points of damage, but it's it adds up baby\n\n26:21.420 --> 26:29.460\nAnd so then someone will come in the room and go what are you doing? And I'll go I'm slowly blowing up an elephant gorilla\n\n26:30.660 --> 26:33.100\nThat I could probably kill with three hits, but\n\n26:33.100 --> 26:37.340\nThen I'd have to suffer the indignity of that fucking thing touching me\n\n26:39.500 --> 26:45.180\nThinking that it's better than me. I just I like these guys like these I like these shadows of Mordor is like\n\n26:45.180 --> 26:49.380\nIt's the ultimate. This is the thing. It's like this is why I now know what I've been doing\n\n26:49.740 --> 26:56.260\nIn with video games my whole life because shadows of Mordor says it you get your throat slit in the beginning of the game\n\n26:56.260 --> 27:00.100\nAnd you wake up a ghost man in hell world\n\n27:00.100 --> 27:06.660\nSo you kind of don't belong there, but so like everyone's expendable. There's no guilt\n\n27:06.860 --> 27:13.300\nEveryone's an asshole. You're an asshole land which is run by the people that already killed you your wife's already dead\n\n27:13.300 --> 27:18.860\nYour kids are already dead. You have no idea what's going on, but there's a ghost man saying you have ghost powers now\n\n27:18.860 --> 27:20.860\nGo fucking kill people\n\n27:21.460 --> 27:24.940\nAnd but but and here's how you really kill him nice like over you get behind\n\n27:24.940 --> 27:30.940\nOh, if you press the X button, then you just rub their windpipe and you suck their life essence into your sword\n\n27:30.940 --> 27:36.060\nAnd then you take your sword you stick it and the sword gets more power the harder you choke them\n\n27:37.740 --> 27:43.860\nAnd once your sword's full you can stick it in a stone and get a bigger hand for choking two throats at once\n\n27:43.860 --> 27:45.860\nI\n\n27:59.660 --> 28:05.860\nDark confessions I fear now as a 42 year old like like as we enter the world of increased like virtual\n\n28:05.860 --> 28:13.580\nI now I now I'm now I'm my mom like now.

There's nothing going on, but I thought it's interesting like part of the conversation to bring up that like\n\n33:46.960 --> 33:48.960\nlike very funny\n\n33:48.960 --> 33:52.600\nRory Albany's on last week in New York and like I\n\n33:53.440 --> 33:55.440\nWas sitting there, so I think like\n\n33:56.000 --> 34:00.520\nLike there was a there was a really uncomfortable kind of coincidence that happened\n\n34:00.520 --> 34:07.360\nWhich was that like I don't know Rory Rory was not looking at if you're if you're listening to the podcast Rory\n\n34:07.360 --> 34:10.520\nIs not looking at Jane. I don't think I don't think he knows\n\n34:11.120 --> 34:16.440\nJane exists or where Jane is Rory is hearing about Jane verbally and\n\n34:17.520 --> 34:24.240\nAnd so you look like and then there's a point where Rory is a as a stand-up comic coming from a certain like\n\n34:24.240 --> 34:34.160\nsome 90% of the time admirable like instinct for skepticism of of social trend and fad and group think and things is\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:36.600\nStill it was like like heard it\n\n34:36.600 --> 34:41.800\nI think got got the name wrong Jan or Jane or something wasn't looking at Jane\n\n34:41.800 --> 34:47.400\nBut then like went on went into a kind of riff about and I know it's okay to have boobs these days\n\n34:47.400 --> 34:51.960\nAnd I was over whatever you want or is the transgender thing and I was like, oh god\n\n34:51.960 --> 34:55.320\nThis is terrible. It's just Jane really Jane is a trans\n\n34:56.560 --> 35:00.800\nHarmontown fan and the the that that that's what happened\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:03.280\nIt was just sort of a bumper car crash and I didn't you know\n\n35:03.280 --> 35:09.040\nI I thought it was good to let the traffic keep moving rather than stop down the entire show\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:14.080\nAnd yeah, like I knew that I knew that Jane would probably most likely be tickled by the whole thing\n\n35:14.080 --> 35:18.600\nBut and I have no idea if anything happened online as a result of that. We're living in tender times\n\n35:19.440 --> 35:21.080\nand I\n\n35:21.080 --> 35:28.480\nBut I but I did see a tweet or two that implied that maybe I don't know conversation got generated about that moment because it's like a really\n\n35:29.200 --> 35:31.200\nimportant like\n\n35:31.400 --> 35:33.880\nBottle neck that we're going through all at the same time\n\n35:34.400 --> 35:41.120\nAnd so there's conversation generated on there. I just for for my part until I don't know any more information\n\n35:41.120 --> 35:44.400\nI just wanted to say I was sitting there on the stool and I know there was no\n\n35:44.400 --> 35:50.960\nThat you you no one was witness to a microaggression. I almost feel dumb like like like being a traffic cop for that\n\n35:50.960 --> 35:57.000\nBut I I I'm I'm always like the most bumped out about people hurting each other's feelings\n\n35:57.800 --> 36:03.680\nBecause I know that nobody wants to I know nobody would ever there's so few people that would ever make that choice if somebody's actually\n\n36:03.680 --> 36:08.660\nBy the way, here's a trick like if somebody's like saying something hurtful to you\n\n36:08.660 --> 36:15.980\nAnd it's either a misunderstanding or like they're putting so much energy into trying to hurt you that like they\n\n36:17.020 --> 36:19.660\nThey must be anticipating the same from you\n\n36:19.660 --> 36:22.260\nThere's no other reason why they would do that, you know\n\n36:22.260 --> 36:27.420\nAnd then they're always drawing that energy from some some other part of them. That's like a\n\n36:28.100 --> 36:31.820\nGreat place for a sneak attack, which is like their respect receptor\n\n36:31.980 --> 36:35.220\nLike if somebody's like being a total piece of shit to you\n\n36:35.220 --> 36:39.940\nLike there's almost nothing to lose by even giving that that that first shot\n\n36:39.940 --> 36:46.380\nWhich is just just being nice, which by the way Jane always does like Jane always meets that stuff with total resilience and and\n\n36:47.100 --> 36:51.740\nCompassion which is the makes you wobble and goes like oh, I thought this whole thing was about making me feel bad\n\n36:53.220 --> 36:57.020\nSo anyways, I got high before the show and I\n\n36:57.020 --> 37:04.340\nI don't know who any of these people are I\n\n37:06.860 --> 37:10.700\nWhat's it only heard the episodes I've actually been on so it's two\n\n37:12.860 --> 37:16.420\nYou can reference those episodes. I'll know what you're talking about\n\n37:16.420 --> 37:22.940\nBut didn't he say he used to he played a lot of Gwent that guy Rory. I think yeah\n\n37:22.940 --> 37:29.780\nHe's yeah, Rory Rory who's awesome by the way. I was doing this IFC pilot with us a really really really cool guy\n\n37:31.460 --> 37:37.220\nYeah, he was it he said he stopped playing the game. I think because he was just playing Gwent. Yeah\n\n37:38.620 --> 37:41.780\nWell, if you overheard that then it was him for sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah\n\n37:41.780 --> 37:46.540\nHe played he goes he plays for the Gwent for you with your three fans. That's some Witcher 3 comedy for you\n\n37:47.300 --> 37:50.340\nHe plays for the Gwent. Holy shit. We're gonna bring our guests up. Jesus Christ\n\n37:50.340 --> 37:53.700\nWhat the fuck I was just gonna say something fuck\n\n37:54.060 --> 37:59.580\nWhat were you gonna say Ryan? I was gonna say let's keep the show moving because that's what a comptroller supposed to do\n\n37:59.580 --> 38:06.620\nRight in what way should we keep the troll show moving Comptroller Ridley? Let's bring up our guests. Oh shit, man\n\n38:07.940 --> 38:14.060\nIntroduce our guests. Oh, that's all right. Sorry. I was reading text from from Aaron excellent Comptroller. Thank you\n\n38:14.060 --> 38:20.380\nOh, well, we'll bring our guests up and then we'll read them police brutality statistics\n\n38:22.540 --> 38:24.620\nOkay, no, I gotta go back to the hold up\n\n38:24.620 --> 38:30.820\nI have to find the Dan was saying in the last four days 500 people have been killed by cops\n\n38:31.820 --> 38:34.060\nIt's funny because it's not true right\n\n38:34.860 --> 38:39.180\nNo, I got it. I got it. I got it a little wrong. All right. Jesus Christ\n\n38:39.180 --> 38:44.180\nCould somebody put kerosene on my face and light it on fire? Oh?\n\n38:45.300 --> 38:47.540\nTo just burn off some of the sweat\n\n38:50.380 --> 38:55.420\nOr or is your towel dying up here. I'm like Louis Armstrong\n\n38:59.820 --> 39:03.760\nBut I didn't I haven't earned it. I mean he's like blowing into a tube. Yeah\n\n39:03.760 --> 39:13.920\nSo these guys are a recent addition recent relative to us were old-timers recent addition to the Feral Audio Network\n\n39:13.920 --> 39:19.360\nThey had this show that they started doing called before you were funny, which is a really interesting concept\n\n39:19.360 --> 39:23.520\nWe live in Los Angeles like we're surrounded by geniuses all the time and\n\n39:24.240 --> 39:26.960\nPeople we admire even ourselves sometimes\n\n39:27.720 --> 39:33.600\nAnd then you really like you open up to yourself yourself and your closest friends about the like really hack shit\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:35.600\nYou did unless you're some kind of weird\n\n39:36.280 --> 39:42.400\nDeformed prodigy that was like writing good comedy when you were 13 years old you probably went through this horrible hack phase\n\n39:42.440 --> 39:46.400\nSo it's a really refreshing show. I I took part in it Aaron's done it\n\n39:46.400 --> 39:48.280\nIt's it's it's really great\n\n39:48.280 --> 39:54.400\nIt's like when you get the right group of people these like really funny people that come together and reveal that when they were\n\n39:54.400 --> 40:02.320\n22 25 27 whatever it is that they wrote these horrible and funny things and they they read through them and they it's an\n\n40:02.320 --> 40:06.360\nUplifting experience. It's not claustic. I wouldn't tolerate it otherwise\n\n40:08.280 --> 40:14.280\nDid you hear my 38 minute what is your point transgender monologue? I\n\n40:16.560 --> 40:18.560\nObviously care\n\n40:20.960 --> 40:22.960\nAbout something\n\n40:23.480 --> 40:29.840\nThat has clearly to do with me being perceived as a good person and and stops completely right there\n\n40:29.840 --> 40:35.360\nAnd does no one else any good. I just have this really tight bubble around me of good intention\n\n40:35.360 --> 40:40.560\nYeah, you don't have to try so hard man. You are a good person if anyone's love ever finds himself looking over here\n\n40:40.960 --> 40:42.960\nIn this corner of the room\n\n40:43.040 --> 40:45.640\nJust want you to notice I'm a feminist\n\n40:45.640 --> 40:58.120\nHello boy, oh boy, is that bad what we do to black people?

We need a noun that describes the issue the because I keep going transgender\n\n42:26.600 --> 42:28.600\nmovement\n\n42:28.840 --> 42:30.440\nYeah\n\n42:30.440 --> 42:36.760\nTransgender issue trans genderism transgen. Yep. Yeah, I'll take that. I don't know that that makes it tell\n\n42:37.240 --> 42:41.080\nThat's what if we just refer to BT rights. Huh?\n\n42:42.120 --> 42:45.320\nI look to you like you were saying that and that was now you\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:51.280\nI'm not gonna memorize the bunch of letters that don't spell something. I says I can remember\n\n42:51.280 --> 42:59.280\nLgbt why I don't know whether to respect it or get order it\n\n43:00.760 --> 43:02.560\nSo if those\n\n43:02.560 --> 43:07.640\nIf those if that acronym had vowels in it and made a word then it would be better\n\n43:07.640 --> 43:13.240\nYeah, like if it like us and it would have to spell something cool like the tree or something\n\n43:14.280 --> 43:16.280\nsword\n\n43:16.280 --> 43:20.840\nIf he rearranged them enough it would spell something. I mean, it's like but quibital quibital\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:27.280\nEquipital a thing that you slice somebody with yeah quibital for a week when I would have a flu\n\n43:28.840 --> 43:34.160\nSo if you guys and you're how many how many how long have you been doing this experiment of\n\n43:34.560 --> 43:42.380\nInviting people to bring their really the shit that they would never want anyone to hear if they were invested in protecting their image\n\n43:43.160 --> 43:45.160\nthree years\n\n43:45.160 --> 43:52.720\nAs like a good show yeah, and then like six years probably we did it six years ago like twice and then\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:57.480\nStopped because there was zero audience for the first year\n\n43:57.480 --> 44:03.640\nYeah, and then and we table they were like we should wait until we until more of our friends become famous and want to do this\n\n44:03.640 --> 44:05.640\nright\n\n44:06.160 --> 44:11.320\nAnd also yeah, the thing I'm curious about in in that time\n\n44:11.320 --> 44:14.720\nSo I'm trying to I'm trying to be a better interviewer\n\n44:15.120 --> 44:20.600\nBut so part of it was me realizing that you're not supposed to ask things that you think an interviewer should ask\n\n44:20.600 --> 44:24.520\nHe's supposed to ask things that you actually want to know so I was thinking about what I want to know and\n\n44:25.040 --> 44:29.520\nThe thing is when you hear it, it's not gonna be that you're gonna be like we can't answer that\n\n44:30.840 --> 44:32.840\nBut what I really want to know is\n\n44:33.640 --> 44:39.480\nLike when you're like who there's must be you now have you guys have\n\n44:39.480 --> 44:41.480\nYou guys have an encyclopedic\n\n44:43.120 --> 44:44.840\nlibrary of\n\n44:44.840 --> 44:52.920\nDiff of the ways people handle embarrassing themselves. Oh, yeah, so you must you do you have a shorthand for oh\n\n44:52.920 --> 44:54.200\nHe's a Henry\n\n44:54.200 --> 44:59.240\nLike like he's gonna he's gonna bring he's gonna bring in the shit that he actually thinks is funny\n\n44:59.240 --> 45:03.320\nAnd you're gonna be able to tell you do bring in things that they think is funny\n\n45:03.320 --> 45:07.960\nAnd then you know but and then they're like oh it didn't go over well because people are expecting bad things\n\n45:07.960 --> 45:12.120\nRight, I think it's a defense mechanism because you're like wow is that bring your most terrible stuff\n\n45:12.120 --> 45:18.000\nBut I'll bring my stuff. It's still a show which is the word. I mean that's such an understandable logical decision\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:25.360\nBut yeah, so you can see how that's I think isn't that isn't that what we're all doing all the time. Aren't we all going?\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:28.600\nwell, you know they say\n\n45:29.560 --> 45:36.560\nYou love me, but you know like you I guess that is that you'd love me more if I was a little different\n\n45:36.560 --> 45:39.880\nLike and we don't we don't we're not ourselves therefore\n\n45:39.880 --> 45:46.880\nWe know our warts are not showing therefore our our actual like most amazing moments are kind of through a weird gauze\n\n45:47.120 --> 45:54.240\nThe best stuff is always this stuff that people are horrified when they realize how bad it is like a lot of the time people will\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:57.440\nWill send us stuff without having read it ahead of time, which is what we suggest\n\n45:57.440 --> 46:02.760\nBut I mean I would read stuff before I send it to someone. I think you'd be crazy not to but a lot of people\n\n46:02.760 --> 46:07.560\nDo what we ask and send it sight unseen and then as they're reading it\n\n46:07.560 --> 46:12.040\nThey realize how truly terrible it is and those are the best reactions in the world\n\n46:12.040 --> 46:18.240\nYeah, we had one that they realized halfway through the sketch that only the stage direction was racist\n\n46:20.760 --> 46:25.160\nThe sketch itself was not but the way in which they described right it was very\n\n46:25.760 --> 46:30.560\nspecifically mentioning the ethnicity of characters who were coming in but it didn't play into the sketch\n\n46:30.560 --> 46:37.360\nWell that one when you say it that way that says racist as three years ago in network TV like that\n\n46:38.320 --> 46:42.600\nBut but I thought I thought you meant like like it would say like like\n\n46:43.160 --> 46:48.920\nDemorige and the boys are hanging out like that's how I mean there is stuff like that for sure\n\n46:48.920 --> 46:54.600\nYeah, Demorige Demorige is regularly on the show and he is that he had a story about a commercial that the\n\n46:54.600 --> 47:00.840\nMatches that definition that the descriptions were racist. There is anything they were saying that the guy though\n\n47:00.840 --> 47:08.280\nThey were spelling it wrong because they were I'm assuming because a group of black people like there's some of the vowels come out and stuff\n\n47:08.280 --> 47:10.640\nBecause the just in the state in the stage direction\n\n47:11.440 --> 47:14.440\nanyways, the I'm a good person and\n\n47:14.440 --> 47:23.040\nAnd if I had been at that audition, I would have pulled the more John of there. I said you're better than this\n\n47:26.720 --> 47:33.840\nWhat is it about us at like at that a because I I brought in something to your show that it's like whatever\n\n47:34.280 --> 47:38.520\nIt was something from when I was like 12 or 13 or something in Jack. No\n\n47:38.520 --> 47:43.360\nVery early he visioned that was actually meant to be a compliment\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:47.160\nWe just we just screamed it and everyone enjoyed it and then what do we call the show?\n\n47:47.160 --> 47:52.080\nBut I think you guys recommend don't bring stuff in from your childhood because then it's like what you know the line between like\n\n47:52.080 --> 47:58.160\nOh, how adorably bad at writing. I was at 12. Yeah, but like the really important thing is this idea that\n\n47:58.600 --> 48:00.360\nthat\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:06.280\nYou know, I don't know what age we think it is in our heads, but like oh my god, you're gonna read that thing\n\n48:06.280 --> 48:10.200\nI wrote when I was 23. I think it's college\n\n48:10.960 --> 48:16.680\nYeah, I mean, it's it's that it's that age between and I don't know what's supposed to happen to you in that age\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:25.080\nExcept for you writing badly that's supposed to make you so good on the other side. Do we worship the idea of are we supposed to be?\n\n48:25.680 --> 48:30.120\nPerfect, that's how it feels sometimes like we're supposed to we're supposed to never have done anything wrong\n\n48:30.120 --> 48:33.440\nWhich is very it doesn't make any logical sense when you think about it\n\n48:33.440 --> 48:36.920\nBut it is how we feel right you're never supposed to have done anything wrong\n\n48:37.680 --> 48:44.760\nYeah, I think I mean I think what for me what I would put please keep turn your phone on\n\n48:46.080 --> 48:48.080\nVibrate we have people I\n\n48:50.080 --> 48:52.080\nThink\n\n48:52.120 --> 48:58.960\nYeah, it would what is fun about it for me is getting to see people who I admire who I'm friends with and\n\n48:58.960 --> 49:06.920\nRealize that we were all and sometimes still are just like terrible at what we all love doing and even even great\n\n49:06.920 --> 49:10.800\nPeople will bring in stuff that's like maybe a year old that just wasn't\n\n49:11.160 --> 49:16.680\nGood, they're just throwing shit at a wall and seeing what sticks, but I think it's like oh, they're trying right right\n\n49:16.680 --> 49:19.680\nAnd there's this idea that like when you watch people you love you're like oh\n\n49:19.680 --> 49:25.960\nThey must have been perfect the whole time right and there I mean do you think that do you think that Salinger like?\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:31.720\nI mean, I haven't read catcher on the rise as they made me read a chapter and then I just fucking got the cliff notes\n\n49:31.720 --> 49:38.560\nBut like supposedly isn't this really I mean that was his whole trip is that he dedicated his life to this idea that like\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:45.280\nNow his books are gonna come out of a magic chest once a year whatever everything was like batten down like like no\n\n49:45.840 --> 49:48.000\nLook, there's no there's no transparency there\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:51.600\nWho wants to who wants to listen to Anne Rice disown the vampire movies?\n\n49:51.600 --> 49:57.840\nWho wants to I don't want to see what JK Rowling's having for breakfast. I there's holes everything's of the where these people were creative\n\n49:57.840 --> 50:01.200\nAnd now they're just now they're just boring terrible people JD Salinger\n\n50:01.200 --> 50:08.600\nHe wrote one book one book the most perfect book ever and then he done any boarded himself up in a basement\n\n50:10.480 --> 50:13.120\nBut you could hear the typewriter clicking away\n\n50:13.120 --> 50:20.520\nAnd every once in a while they say the squirrel's breath carries a paper pulp on it\n\n50:21.480 --> 50:28.560\nBut well the one day form and they say there's a New York Times is holding the last will and the JD Salinger\n\n50:28.560 --> 50:34.280\nWell once again have written the second perfect book. Well, what if it what if it was like better than anyways?\n\n50:34.720 --> 50:36.720\nLike how wait why?\n\n50:37.120 --> 50:41.160\nNow I'm being rhetorical because I know we're all asking the same question, right? But like like what?\n\n50:41.160 --> 50:45.120\nWhat the fuck what kind of person would that be would we even like that person?\n\n50:45.120 --> 50:50.080\nWe always think it about the people that we admire we think that they're better than us\n\n50:50.080 --> 50:52.840\nWe know we don't just think oh, they must have fucked up really bad\n\n50:52.840 --> 50:56.200\nWe have had a couple people who bring stuff that's like that they\n\n50:56.520 --> 51:00.800\nThey truly think it's terrible like they're not trying to trick the show by bringing stuff\n\n51:00.800 --> 51:06.120\nThey think is great, but they are just so funny that even their terrible stuff is great\n\n51:06.120 --> 51:10.760\nAnd yeah hate them for it because they just have been funny\n\n51:11.600 --> 51:16.560\nThey're humiliated by an amazing sketch, right or like we had a Rob Delaney\n\n51:16.560 --> 51:21.840\nDid it early stand-up set that like almost verbatim of how he would have done it back in the day?\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:24.720\nBut then pointed out like it was all very funny\n\n51:24.720 --> 51:28.840\nBut he pointed out with each joke like why he doesn't think it's funny now\n\n51:29.280 --> 51:35.280\nAnd it was more of just like I wouldn't make that he was saying like he wouldn't make that kind of joke now because that's just not\n\n51:35.280 --> 51:40.920\nWhat a sense of humor is so sometimes it's it's not as much about like oh you were shitty then it's like oh\n\n51:40.920 --> 51:44.280\nYou've been funny the whole time, but your perspective has changed, right?\n\n51:45.720 --> 51:47.720\nThat's not a funny answer, but\n\n51:48.160 --> 51:55.560\nThat's the truth. I mean maybe one day in the future. You'll have the perfect funny funniest answer. No, that's the answer. I wanted\n\n51:57.320 --> 51:59.320\nNo, it's not what am I talking about?\n\n51:59.960 --> 52:02.440\nThere was a random answer. I don't want to read that\n\n52:02.440 --> 52:07.440\nI thought it was a very interesting like I it's it's because I wouldn't Aaron did the show\n\n52:07.760 --> 52:15.200\nArons was amazing. Yeah, so like late bears. She she was she was writing. She was she wasn't there weren't letters to her\n\n52:16.400 --> 52:22.520\nEnglish teacher plays they were plays, but they were clearly like she was it was fanfiction for her own life\n\n52:25.120 --> 52:30.160\nThen only she had read before right and and yeah, and then yeah, and did like it was\n\n52:30.160 --> 52:31.840\na\n\n52:31.840 --> 52:37.320\nVery transparent like attempt at a sort of seduction of this teacher\n\n52:37.320 --> 52:40.320\nI think I think the plan was that she was going to\n\n52:41.040 --> 52:47.400\nEveryone in her class had to write these plays these like one act and hers involved a character loosely based on her and a character\n\n52:47.400 --> 52:49.160\nloosely based on her teacher\n\n52:49.160 --> 52:50.480\nhaving a\n\n52:50.480 --> 52:56.160\nLiaison after school, but having kind of a snarky like it was definitely not it was clearly this\n\n52:56.160 --> 53:01.720\nAnd this is the thing that would like make me cringe the most like we were talking about these bear wires that I think\n\n53:01.960 --> 53:06.760\nYour show at its best is like this was energy is coming from these exposed wires\n\n53:07.280 --> 53:10.400\nthe most the to me listening to those\n\n53:11.800 --> 53:16.560\nPieces she was reading the craziest thing about them was that she didn't\n\n53:17.080 --> 53:22.440\nShe didn't just want to have sex with her teacher like she the way she was\n\n53:22.440 --> 53:28.880\nExplored like she wanted to be married to him and she wanted to like she wanted to have sassafras with her like she\n\n53:28.880 --> 53:30.520\nWanted like like like it didn't have it\n\n53:30.520 --> 53:34.760\nI mean it was like they were talking about sex, but it was more like like it was like if a 16-year-old\n\n53:35.200 --> 53:39.160\nLike what a 16-year-old thinks that all of that stuff would be yeah\n\n53:39.160 --> 53:42.880\nLike like yeah, she wanted to have like this repartee and like yeah\n\n53:42.880 --> 53:46.920\nAnd and that was like like crazier than if she had just said his hand touches her boom\n\n53:46.920 --> 53:48.920\nI\n\n53:53.040 --> 53:55.040\nWas just telling them what boobs do\n\n53:57.560 --> 54:02.080\nWhat did you say oh just the idea that a teacher says they're that long after class to is like\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:06.760\nOh, you must be burning the midnight oil every night an element or a middle school teacher\n\n54:07.640 --> 54:12.080\nWalking out and getting the fuck home. Yeah, exactly, but it is it's exposed\n\n54:12.800 --> 54:15.920\nI think that's that's the thing. It's like nobody\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:22.520\nWhat is that like like it's when your intent is so clear when it's like crystal clear\n\n54:22.520 --> 54:28.960\nI think the best stuff comes from the end of high school and the beginning of college because that's when you\n\n54:29.240 --> 54:35.280\nYou're at the center of the world to yourself more than the world's so big\n\n54:35.280 --> 54:40.600\nRight like you just realize the world's bigger than it's ever been and you're gonna be a part of your right at this\n\n54:40.600 --> 54:42.600\nI don't know that you're wrong\n\n54:42.600 --> 54:46.640\nAnd everything that you do is something you're inventing because you haven't seen\n\n54:47.280 --> 54:50.120\nHardly anything you've got you've had a chance to see four things\n\n54:50.120 --> 54:53.240\nSo you're definitely not gonna write where the red fern grows again\n\n54:53.680 --> 54:57.800\nBut everything else you're convinced you're creating you're like holy shit, man\n\n54:57.800 --> 54:59.800\nI'm gonna like and it's so\n\n55:00.320 --> 55:04.800\nLike like God forbid that you ever get that insulation\n\n55:04.800 --> 55:06.800\nI feel like your friends that go to film school\n\n55:07.080 --> 55:09.880\nYou know that was always the cliche when we first came out here to LA\n\n55:09.880 --> 55:14.880\nIt was like oh, he must have gone to film school because we just had an hour lunch with him and we talked about 20 movies\n\n55:14.880 --> 55:19.680\nAnd he never smiled, you know, and we talked about what kind of movie we want to make with our\n\n55:20.280 --> 55:27.000\nYou know camcorders and he you know, he was paralyzed because he must have gone to film school because you're you're for four years\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.000\nYou're sitting there watching everything and learning\n\n55:29.600 --> 55:36.360\nWhat everybody's ever thought that ever picked up a camera and it fills you with like well who's little old me\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:39.560\nYeah, it's before you realize that I think\n\n55:40.560 --> 55:44.040\nWhen you become an adult, which I'm not claiming to be but you\n\n55:44.440 --> 55:48.760\nYou realize like someone has done a good version of a lot of different things already and it's\n\n55:49.200 --> 55:51.960\nCrippling because what the fuck are you gonna add?\n\n55:52.360 --> 55:55.400\nBut yeah, that at the heart of that fear though\n\n55:55.400 --> 56:01.640\nIt can't just possibly be because we're not that noble that we would just think well, I wouldn't want to be I wouldn't want to do a\n\n56:01.640 --> 56:03.640\nworse job of writing a\n\n56:03.640 --> 56:11.560\nBook about a car that eats people than Stephen King. It's it's there's a there's a one thing right after that\n\n56:11.560 --> 56:17.040\nAnd that's actually what we're worried about. It's the then everyone will make fun of me, right?\n\n56:17.040 --> 56:20.280\nThen everybody it's not it's not actually the book being bad\n\n56:20.280 --> 56:26.280\nIt's like people will think that I'm stupid people will think that I think that I invented\n\n56:26.480 --> 56:31.160\nCars that eat people and and then they'll be like, you know, you didn't invent that, right?\n\n56:31.160 --> 56:34.340\nAnd I'll be like fuck you fuck you like like I just I'm not gonna\n\n56:34.720 --> 56:40.040\nNo, no, no, I'm not gonna enter this game until I'm safely away from all the double Dutch\n\n56:40.040 --> 56:45.200\nAnd like I'm gonna do this perfect Mary Lou Retton this handspring through it. What the what in the fucking\n\n56:45.720 --> 56:47.720\n42 year old man\n\n56:48.240 --> 56:53.080\nAnd then I'm gonna land a Frogger game and just get the Pokemons\n\n56:54.480 --> 56:58.120\nWe started in a car that eats people. Yeah. Yeah, Christine\n\n56:58.120 --> 57:01.880\nYeah, I'm holding that up. I was like, oh, I didn't want to get anything wrong about Anna Karenina the\n\n57:03.280 --> 57:09.520\nThe thing is by the way Stephen King himself has done multiple versions of the I'm gonna one up the car that eats people\n\n57:09.520 --> 57:15.640\nIt's a washing machine that eats people. Yeah, and he has a lot of trucks that eat people like he's done his own\n\n57:15.920 --> 57:18.360\nMost of the people that you think are great\n\n57:18.360 --> 57:22.320\nWhich is why I brought up salinger because I think he's kind of one of the exceptions because we just can't you know\n\n57:22.840 --> 57:26.800\nPeople want to find salinger failing and it's like oh, we wrote catcher on the right\n\n57:26.800 --> 57:33.380\nI mean the literary equivalent of the episode of Seinfeld where George decides to just leave after he gets one joke in in a meeting\n\n57:36.920 --> 57:42.000\nEverybody else that you admire in fact quite, you know, like Stephen King is a great example\n\n57:42.160 --> 57:44.680\nas I'm sure now it's now it's kind of hip to kind of\n\n57:45.520 --> 57:51.240\nNot say he's good at anything, but certainly one of the most prolific like sorry Stephen\n\n57:51.240 --> 57:56.760\nIf you're listening or your son or anyone that loves you your caretakers. Why am I? Why do I do that?\n\n57:58.520 --> 58:01.200\nBut not that anyone thinks Stephen King's good\n\n58:05.720 --> 58:09.760\nHoney, what was it Dean has something against Stephen King, I don't know\n\n58:11.040 --> 58:13.960\nBut I think it's cool that you're driving even though I'm a guy\n\n58:13.960 --> 58:19.520\nThey got to get to that I'm the guy to my voice is just a higher register\n\n58:22.160 --> 58:24.160\nWhy are why are you?\n\n58:24.680 --> 58:29.600\nHolding those ice cream cones and lifting them up and down. I thought you might like one or the other\n\n58:31.720 --> 58:33.720\nDo you like vanilla or chocolate I\n\n58:35.240 --> 58:38.240\nDon't feel very secure in this conversation. So I don't know if I'm gonna\n\n58:38.240 --> 58:43.040\nVolunteer information about what I like, but I'll tell you chocolate\n\n58:44.600 --> 58:49.760\nWithout letting you know whether that's why there is no chocolate. Fuck you see that doesn't hurt me because as I was saying\n\n58:49.920 --> 58:54.560\nYou don't have the power to hurt me and appreciate if you just let me out up here. Nope fucking problem at all\n\n58:55.280 --> 59:00.920\nMoving these ice cream cones to the right. Yeah, just word of advice. I don't want your advice\n\n59:00.920 --> 59:05.800\nWord of advice though in case you don't want your fucking advice close the fucking door close the fucking door word of advice\n\n59:05.800 --> 59:08.320\nDon't you fucking don't you fucking physically to me?\n\n59:08.760 --> 59:12.720\nDon't you physically intimidate me? Oh, give me a fucking break. Fuck you. Fuck you\n\n59:19.680 --> 59:21.680\nFreeze\n\n59:27.320 --> 59:29.760\nFreeze put the towels down\n\n59:29.760 --> 59:41.960\nGive me give me the handcuffs. Where are the extra handcuffs? There's like four people here. We don't have enough handcuffs for all these corpses\n\n59:44.920 --> 59:47.840\nShould we check in on the police brutality statistics? Yes\n\n59:49.440 --> 59:55.640\nOkay, now these are coming in from Aaron who's our correspondent in Ireland. I don't know why she knows this about us\n\n59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.840\nAnd so I'm not like I'm not saying these are accurate. So I\n\n01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.040\nFeel like this huge I want to put this big giant\n\n01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.600\nasterisk on this and say if I haven't said this already\n\n01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.120\nCan you you have to believe one of two things which is that all cops are bad?\n\n01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.760\nIf you don't believe that which began that's a crazy thing to believe because it's just a dev absolute thing and none of\n\n01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.160\nThose are true then what has to be true is that there's good cops out there and they must their hearts must be fucking broken right now\n\n01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.800\nAnd that's I and I know it's not a great time to be like what about them\n\n01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.040\nBut I just I do I was like it's so easy to just be like but they're a fucking epidemic. Here's the numbers\n\n01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:43.000\nThe the well, here's the numbers from Aaron if she's wrong remember when that guy from Yahoo said we were one of 11 sitcoms to\n\n01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.600\nKnow, you know good to oh, yeah, and then people are like what about Sanford and son. It was like, okay one of 238 sitcoms. Uh-huh\n\n01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:05.040\nBy mark by March of 2015 US cops had killed more civilians this year than they did in the UK over the last hundred years\n\n01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:13.280\nYeah, so it's up. It's a hundred times more than Europe. Yeah every yeah year\n\n01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.080\nUS cops kill at an average rate of 70 times higher than other countries\n\n01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:28.280\nYeah, well whatever and then there's some there's some crazy shit that the it's it's an epidemic and\n\n01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.040\nDan cops are like Stephen King books\n\n01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.680\nMost of them are very good\n\n01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.680\nBut occasionally he lets through a the mangler\n\n01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.320\nDo you want to flip that? I think there's a there's a couple hits like there's a couple good ones and then\n\n01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.440\nOnly a couple good Stephen King books\n\n01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:01.240\nIt the stand the dark tower quadrilogy\n\n01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.440\nPlus two more or whatever\n\n01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.960\nWhatever seven books are in a series\n\n01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.320\nHe is writing for like middle school kids\n\n01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.880\nIt's all like eighth grade vocabulary. I\n\n01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.160\nMean that's the target audience\n\n01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.640\nFuck you\n\n01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.240\nAll right, well\n\n01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:37.520\nDo you guys have any parting words for people who are interested in we police brutality\n\n01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.080\nI mean, obviously people are gonna look for your podcast. It's called before you were funny\n\n01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.520\nWhich is funny calm? We're on feral audio on itunes, you know, if you look up before you're funny\n\n01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.720\nYou'll find it. Yeah, there's a lot of fun episodes with great people. Your episodes great Aaron had an episode. It's great\n\n01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.880\nI'm not gonna say any episodes are bad. They're mostly very very\n\n01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.160\nAnd who is the worst person that you ever? Oh, that's that's easy. No, I'm just kidding\n\n01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.480\nIt's a great a lot of great people have been on the show\n\n01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.040\nAnd I'm certainly not going to publicly announce the ones that haven't been great\n\n01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.200\nWe do have a thing. Oh, yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's there's probably not\n\n01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.080\nLike with blindly so this is something when you did the show that we didn't have time to\n\n01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:34.480\nWe haven't we haven't read it so I truthfully don't know what it is. Oh, no\n\n01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.640\nThank you feel free to say yes or no wait, I don't even know well\n\n01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.360\nI'm just saying. Oh, no, but I mean we have to I mean we're not gonna do all that conversation of them\n\n01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.680\nI don't I just I just I'm getting that weird like I'm seeing this and I'm recognizing. I think I\n\n01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.080\nThere's no date or anything on it\n\n01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:59.280\nThis has got to be it's done on a regular typewriter like a word processor typewriter\n\n01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.640\nSo it's got to be like it's heavily indented. Yes. Yeah, it's too heavily\n\n01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.200\nLike I was learning to set margins while I was doing it\n\n01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:15.520\nYeah, I'm gonna I mean I I'm gonna guess like I was like I like fit that could be anywhere from 15 to\n\n01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.560\n19 writing this\n\n01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:34.120\nAnd but what how do we read it? I think it's a short story. So yeah, we can I'll do that\n\n01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.080\nI'll do that. Well, it doesn't it seem like there's I see that there's a guy and a girl in this\n\n01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:49.920\nSo and so what if I what if I did this did the all the narrative and then and then one of you be Dan and one of you\n\n01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.920\nbe\n\n01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.080\nAshley\n\n01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:08.160\nAll right, and then the way that the podcast works is that anyone can chime in with with questions or thoughts\n\n01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:14.760\nAbout what's being read. So if you guys have questions or thoughts or as you remember, maybe what this is from\n\n01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:23.640\nYou can tell us. Well, don't tell them they can ask questions. Sorry. Sorry. No offense guys\n\n01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.360\nYou're you're but they're very empowered sure\n\n01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.600\nYou know, there's like a kid with a gun like that would be like that would be like an adult with a gun\n\n01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080\nAll right\n\n01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.720\nSo and and and my job my job like I'm a pussy if I don't just fucking commit to this\n\n01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.720\nLike if I have to keep ruling my eyes and apologizing for it\n\n01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:57.200\nYou have to go for it like like that's I'm just talking to myself like I'm not gonna use like like like we get it\n\n01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:01.120\nYou don't think you you wrote good whatever like like like okay\n\n01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:08.280\nThis is by the way when you were asking about are there certain kinds of guests. This is what Sean Clements called the front porcher\n\n01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:13.920\nOh, yeah, yeah, you're really front porch to the sketch so you don't have to get to it ever\n\n01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.040\nOkay, Dan stood on the beach his feet firmly planted in the sand\n\n01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:27.280\nHe stared out at the ocean the Sun was a fist-sized orange ball\n\n01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.800\nNestled and this is long so\n\n01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.800\nYou can't you can't see this but we talked about indenting this first paragraph is so indented\n\n01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:45.400\nYou can't see some of the letters in the sentences. I am. Yeah, I'm guessing at the word sand and soft. Yes\n\n01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.080\nFist-sized orange ball nestled and soft horizon long clouds\n\n01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.440\nThat's a long cloud. Ah, it's the standard cloud length also\n\n01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.760\nIt's as long as they can be\n\n01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.760\nI\n\n01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.240\nSeagulls were making calm passes in search and then the paragraph ends\n\n01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.880\nSo I think this is me like stopping and starting this is like 80s style\n\n01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.280\nOh, yeah, Dan stood on the beach his feet firmly planted in the sand\n\n01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:24.600\nHe stared out at the ocean the Sun was a fist-sized orange ball nestled in soft horizon long clouds\n\n01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.240\nseagulls were making calm passes in search of food and\n\n01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:34.600\nAnd their rhythmic cries countered the ponderous soothing bellow of the water stroking the shore\n\n01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320\nThank you so much\n\n01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:53.880\nBut paragraph two the war was over\n\n01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.080\nI'm starting to get kind of proud of this\n\n01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.400\nThe cities were leveled and empty\n\n01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.720\nThe humans were dead\n\n01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.640\nAll of them if it wasn't clear\n\n01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:33.400\nIf they hadn't died in the war they had plugged themselves into the utopia net and\n\n01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:46.800\nAnd uploaded their minds There was no way for them to come back, but they didn't want to\n\n01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.240\nNo one could all one word. No one all one word. No one is all one word. Nope\n\n01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280\nNoon could resist\n\n01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.480\nThe immortality and the omnipotence\n\n01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.480\nNot one person\n\n01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.000\nThought that having the whole planet to them self was better than utopia\n\n01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.480\nUtopia was forever and it was anything you wanted it to be and yes, this predates the matrix\n\n01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:27.760\nIt was nothing Dan didn't want to hang around either, but he had to his mind was incompatible with the network\n\n01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760\nI'm starting to do a sarcastic read\n\n01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.280\nAshley surprised him from behind with a tall glass of milk\n\n01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.520\nWhy didn't you guys come out with this on a flagpole, why did you save this? Oh before we go\n\n01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.480\nBy the way, we only have 30 seconds left, but we want to bring this really long story\n\n01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:58.000\nOkay, so so Ashley surprised behind with a tall glass of milk. I thought you might be back here\n\n01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.440\nShe said listen, there's a lot of stuff. I want to do\n\n01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:09.400\nDo you think Disneyland will work? I mean do the electric companies keep going and stuff?\n\n01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.120\nWe got to find all that out. We're not getting any younger\n\n01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.560\nHer mind was also tragically non-uploadable\n\n01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:26.800\nSo so earlier when we said that all of the people who were alive\n\n01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:35.160\nNo one was alive. We met except for these two people. Yeah, well everyone that didn't die in the war plug themselves into utopia net\n\n01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.400\nAnd and and I'm I'm stuck getting to have sex for the first time in my life\n\n01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.720\nOver a nice glass of milk\n\n01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.840\nWhat's the big deal I'm\n\n01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.480\nI'm as old as 19 I\n\n01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.200\nDan touch Dan touched your cheek and smiled a genuine smile\n\n01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.160\nPumpkin we're the youngest people in the world\n\n01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:17.680\nNot really honey, not if life begins with conception\n\n01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:29.840\nWhich which it does which it does this isn't true you find out later it does\n\n01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:41.640\nI'm pretty sure I'm kind of pregnant.

I don't then walk you all the way up through the Holocaust\n\n01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.080\nFive million five hundred thousand\n\n01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.120\nThe logic is that a hundred is once it becomes insane and then after that hundred and one hundred and two six million\n\n01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.760\nYes, exactly\n\n01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.360\nI'm making a major but South American invasions are only upsetting as is third world famine and\n\n01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.280\nand the sinking of an American battleship and\n\n01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.560\neveryone on the\n\n01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.120\nAnd everyone on the planet being dead except for you and your boyfriend\n\n01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.280\nHell that's just fucking hilarious\n\n01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.040\nSo they both laughed for about a minute\n\n01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:45.800\nEmbraced kissed and made love there in the warm sand\n\n01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.920\nAn hour later they were walking hand-in-hand\n\n01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:06.200\nI got to make sure she's pregnant\n\n01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.560\nThe hour later they were walking hand-in-hand through previously unsafe neighborhoods top topical\n\n01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.640\nThey were on fire for the most part looter looters\n\n01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.640\nUnsafe\n\n01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.800\nLooters during the past few days had seen the end of the world as a great opportunity to steal television sets and shoot each other\n\n01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.520\nNo, that's television.

That was a stranger named Connor. Where are you Connor? Do I know you?\n\n01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.600\nThat was exactly what happened. I heard you say I can't get in I can't get in I drove 45 minutes and I said\n\n01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.920\nWatch what this guy does\n\n01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.640\nAnd I went into the green room and I pulled some strings and now look at you second row\n\n01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:23.120\nWell, well, I take that back.

I\n\n01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.440\nDon't think back to you Dan. Yeah, I mean I'm like on the like where it was television sets\n\n01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.080\nUh television sets of looters during the public shoot each other. That was funny, too\n\n01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.960\nThis was before Columbine\n\n01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.360\nWell, it was charismatic to not care as a 15 year old and no one had done anything about it yet\n\n01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:01.680\nThey found an undamaged Buick with the key and Buick like I know what a car is\n\n01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.680\nThey found an undamaged Buick with the keys and the ignition and drove it to Dan's home\n\n01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:15.680\nBut it was completely burnt to the ground son of a bitch Dan said I had a thousand dollars worth of computer equipment in there\n\n01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.440\nWait, what do we make of that? That was that was that was\n\n01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:35.280\nAll right, it's a ton of money plus also if you're gonna be uploading people to utopia net you need a computer equipment. Yeah\n\n01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.000\nYeah\n\n01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.400\nAshley's place wasn't hurt at all. I think that was my equivalent of going like I lost my skateboard\n\n01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.600\nYou know, like I thought that having that much a computer equipment made me cool. I\n\n01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.480\nAshley's place wasn't hurt at all. So they spent an hour there\n\n01:16:49.480 --> 01:17:01.200\nAnd we know what takes an hour there's no it's only one thing takes an hour\n\n01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.880\nAshley Ashley cried\n\n01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.040\nAnd cried and then laughed and they took her parents Pontiac\n\n01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.520\nGrand Am because it had a CD player at it and because my parents had a potty at Grand Am\n\n01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:24.960\nAnd they were already starting to miss the constant barrage of broadcast information\n\n01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320\nWe don't age to\n\n01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.720\nWere you about to say we don't have to read the whole thing I just know you guys have stuff to get to\n\n01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.080\nWell, let's let's let's just go a little faster. Let's go a little faster\n\n01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.960\nWell, wait, no wait, this is a different thing\n\n01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.680\nReally? Yeah, this is not what is this? I like this. What is I mean?\n\n01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.920\nThis is the file. I don't know. Yeah, this is I don't know what this is pretend this is part of the same story\n\n01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.920\nMaybe why don't we save this for next week because this looks this looks this looks a thousand times more embarrassing\n\n01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.280\nI know\n\n01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.000\nI always say what we're gonna play we're gonna play shadow run\n\n01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.160\nAlright, you're fine. Alright, fuck you guys. Alright, we'll read it. This is the thing\n\n01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.040\nBut I'm telling you I could just tell I just it's just it's just wafting off of it\n\n01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.840\nI'm like I'm seeing random words and we're going no I know because I think this is like I don't even think this is a story\n\n01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.160\nI ride ahead. It's not as compelling. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah\n\n01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:33.200\nI think this is like free writing or something. Yeah, this is not how do we read how do we read this one?\n\n01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.480\nDo we do we even know what to do with it? Yeah, I don't know if there's characters or we could do it looks\n\n01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:46.520\nI'm thinking that by and large it looks like a dialogue between two people. Yeah, so if you try to go every other line\n\n01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:50.760\nI mean, do you guys just want to try it? Yeah, that's it\n\n01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.640\nYou know what these are John what beautiful man? They're cool.

A. R. E. Not a bear, you know animal\n\n01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640\nThat would be weird\n\n01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.760\nThere's a world where could happen\n\n01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.640\nA friend of mine told me that there's a place in Chicago that like discovers amateur photographers\n\n01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:36.320\nI got their number and stuff this friend of his or something made like a whole bunch of money through them\n\n01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.820\nAnd he's like fucking famous now. Mmm\n\n01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.960\nMaybe that was like a mm-hmm like\n\n01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.240\nDeuce do so you think I could make money doing stuff like this. What do you want money for and what is this?\n\n01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.240\nNo offense, but it's not real clear\n\n01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.840\nWell, you know, why does anyone want money for food and stuff?\n\n01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.640\nThat's a picture of a soda cup in a theater. I split it. It's not real good built it. Come on. Oh, sorry\n\n01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.160\nIn fairness that was spelled correctly. We ever spilt it built it built it\n\n01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.400\nIt's not a real good photograph\n\n01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.600\nBut I wanted to remember it because I kind of got like this big idea in my head when it happened\n\n01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.600\nThis is before American Beauty\n\n01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.600\nIt\n\n01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:27.360\nWas one of those things like on TV when something happens to somebody or they see something that kind of changes their life\n\n01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.520\nLaugh in parentheses\n\n01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:38.240\nWell, what happened wait, don't tell me you spilled your soda and your friends ridiculed you and got loud and someone in back said\n\n01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:43.720\nShut up to them and they said shut up back and a fight broke out later and they blame the entire thing on you\n\n01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160\nNo, nothing like that\n\n01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.000\nReally shut down that nameless friend. Oh\n\n01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.440\nWell, that happened to me I guess so\n\n01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.200\nso\n\n01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.280\nNo, I spilled my soda right and I'm like pretty much in the middle of the theater and the floor slopes down, you know\n\n01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.520\nSo the soda big fucking soda, man\n\n01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:14.280\nThis is probably after reservoir dogs, I'm just assuming I don't know I can't tell why is that in parentheses\n\n01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.320\nIs he speaking in parentheses? No, I think I didn't know how I didn't know you just do a dash\n\n01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.960\nOh, I think this is before reservoir dogs and after I read something by David Mamet\n\n01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.520\nI'm trying to place this. Oh, I see. Yeah, it's big cuz like that's your foot, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah\n\n01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.520\nSo it's like bigger than my foot and um\n\n01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.720\nThere's a lot of soda and it flows downhill into everyone's feet that's sitting in front of me makes sense\n\n01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.040\nAll the people in front of me start turning around and looking back like who's spilling shit on my feet, man\n\n01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.160\nAnd they're all looking at me. So, you know what you're gonna, you know, what are you gonna do you?\n\n01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.800\nturn around\n\n01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.080\nI\n\n01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:59.280\nTurn around and the guys behind me. They ain't got no soda on their feet, but they do got 50 people turning around looking at them. So\n\n01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.560\nThey turn around because they're thinking are they looking at something really neat behind me and every everybody's doing this\n\n01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.280\nAnd there's this loudmouth big guy\n\n01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:16.320\nThat's everyone's afraid about a quarter everyone's afraid of presumably about a quarter way from the back and he starts up\n\n01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:22.680\nWhat the hell's going on? What and all of a sudden the movie goes out of oh, that's not I don't think that's dialogue anymore\n\n01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.360\nThere was no end quote, right. Oh, excuse the fuck\n\n01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:31.320\nAnd the movie goes out of focus see I think a guy in the booth\n\n01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.520\nThing up there. I thought that everyone was turning around going what the hell because it was out of focus\n\n01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:43.200\nSo he tried focusing, but he fucked it all up. So then everybody really does start yelling all caps focus\n\n01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:46.160\nFocus and so he eventually gets it back to normal\n\n01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.040\nThat's before Play-Doh's cave\n\n01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.520\nPlay-Doh's Play-Doh's cave had not happened yet\n\n01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.960\nOkay, well\n\n01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:09.600\nI'm really glad I didn't spend the whole interview going like what's with these fucking assholes have come up with this shit\n\n01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.600\nThat's embarrassing. What's wrong with them?\n\n01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.800\nBecause I know it would have been like you too\n\n01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.720\nThat's amazing that you guys kept that stuff around Jacob and Justin everybody\n\n01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:31.840\nBefore you were funny is the name of their show and when you listen to it your spirit will grow\n\n01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:38.640\nIt will grow from the pain that you feel inside because when you were younger your ego was wide\n\n01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:48.720\nI remember when you made that sound over there, buddy. I'd said something I thought was funny and you were like\n\n01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.920\nWell, it sounds like you're making a shit sound with your mouth\n\n01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.280\nYou're killing me\n\n01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:09.600\nTwo different sounds for a reason laughter other than the poop sound\n\n01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.720\nIt's like a boo\n\n01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000\nGet your shit together\n\n01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.720\nDid you when you were a kid when you were younger, did you did you write a lot a little bit? Yeah, you got anything\n\n01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.120\nAround you. Yeah, I've got some archives.

It's like\n\n01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:06.160\nGod, I don't know the metaphor is it's like like everyone the actual cut is as deep and it's like nice to learn\n\n01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.360\nThat it's not that deep but but it's interesting to see that the person that's\n\n01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.320\nThe person that's receiving the cut thinks that it's gonna cut their whole arm off\n\n01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.480\nAnd then watching it not do that because everyone's just like\n\n01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.280\nYeah, what is what how good a writer do you think you are now and uh?\n\n01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:28.320\nWell, how much do you think I care if you were ever a good writer and also\n\n01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.560\nLike isn't that the first honest the last honest thing you ever wrote in your life because you were like I try to get you pregnant\n\n01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.960\nBecause you're like you didn't know you're just like honest expressing something was that part of some longer\n\n01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:46.760\nStory novella.

This is the number of people we need right?\n\n01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.760\nSo you're right. You're Jeff Davis. Thank you, Ridley. You have no idea what you're doing, right?\n\n01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:55.640\nYou're playing Eve Liberty. That's Jeff Davis's character. I don't know where we are either two more just two more\n\n01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.360\nJust play Aaron Aaron is not here. Do we need a replacement for her?

I mean anyone's a face person if you believe\n\n01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.960\nAll it takes is a face\n\n01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:21.640\nAll right, well you get a recap and then we'll just let's just jump in and see how it goes\n\n01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.120\nYeah, oh um, so I made an email address\n\n01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.200\nIt's it's Harmontown Run if you have a Harmontown Shadow Run recap\n\n01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.840\nJust send it to Harmontown Run at Gmail that'll make it easier for everyone\n\n01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.760\nThis one was brought to you by ebb and burgoon who also wrote a different one that I said he didn't do but he did it\n\n01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.520\nOkay\n\n01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.520\nThat's all taken care of\n\n01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.680\nlast time on Shadow Run\n\n01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:54.800\nWith one last drink in a decision the gang hopped into their uber and set out to claim their reward from Johnson\n\n01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:03.000\nAfter some shrewd negotiations the crew handed over the BTL chip research and yellowman to the scheming corporate stooge\n\n01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.920\nThey were all smiles as Johnson gave them the hefty attache case\n\n01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.840\nFilled with the sweet sweet paper money of this digital age\n\n01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:18.760\nThose smiles quickly faded to horror as they watched their nefarious employer shoot out the\n\n01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.720\nOr shoot the unarmed yellowman his splattered blood now on their hands pants and faces\n\n01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:31.440\nThe question of their ethics barely coming into question until the noise from the Johnson driving away\n\n01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.200\nTurned to the sound of muted beeps from their briefcase\n\n01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.320\nWill our shadow runners ever get that next drink will they soon join Jesse yellowman in\n\n01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:50.040\nIn nanohell is the meter still running on their uber and do they take paper money? We find out now on Harmontown\n\n01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.880\nWell\n\n01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.880\nI'm I'm thinking\n\n01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.640\nThis is gonna go the briefcase is beeping and start running\n\n01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.920\nWe can't just throw it out of window. This is your apartment\n\n01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.520\nI think we're in a you're in a you're in a parking lot fence sort of area like a transpose lot\n\n01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.200\nSo I I'm I'm just running\n\n01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:25.680\nCan I not throw a physical barrier up around the suitcase? You absolutely can do that. I'm gonna do that. All right\n\n01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.240\nWell, I'll just say whilst we're running\n\n01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.080\nWell, well, you have to concentrate\n\n01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:38.000\nI'm gonna concentrate and do that while everyone else runs. I'm gonna nobly sacrifice sacrifice myself possibly all right\n\n01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.080\nNobly sacrificing yourself you throw up a force dome\n\n01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:49.440\nAround the briefcase as it's beeping is muted by the the sound or not the sound by the barrier\n\n01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.480\nYou can't hear it beeping. It's just chilling\n\n01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.360\nIt's just chilling and may have made a mistake\n\n01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.560\nWe now can't hear it beeping\n\n01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.660\nSo if it beeps faster as it counts dead, let's run\n\n01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:11.600\nNo, I'm right. I'm well, I'm I've seen her doing this and I'm so now I'm I'm I need to play off my shame and go like\n\n01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.840\nOh good. Yeah, I was good. I was good. I was clearing everybody out\n\n01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:17.880\nSo I think it's good what you're doing. That's good\n\n01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.720\nWe shouldn't be able to hear it beeping that the beeping comes through the explosion medium. Well\n\n01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:33.200\nWe should maybe move away if you can back up while you're creating that barrier. I'll make sure the path behind you is clear\n\n01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.480\nHolder guard\n\n01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.720\nruns to dr. Friend wraps an arm around dr. Friend lifts dr. Friend up and\n\n01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.680\nRuns away with the package using strength and agility\n\n01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.000\nThe package the person of the friend\n\n01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.320\nOkay, yeah, you run away towards the ends of the transpo lot. You don't see anything happen\n\n01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.720\nNow you're just far away from a force field dome\n\n01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.920\nYou hear the sounds the sounds of people moving maybe some sort of crowd or March\n\n01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.840\nPeople are moving footstep sounds coming from far off. You realize you're not in the best area of town\n\n01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:20.240\nUsing my ability to detect enemies\n\n01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:23.720\nI'm trying to see if there is anything that sparks inside of me\n\n01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:33.240\nUsing your detect enemy skill your perception shifts and you can start to see the flickering souls of life around you in the\n\n01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.080\nTranspo lot you can see the warm auras of your friends\n\n01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.120\nsparkling with vitality\n\n01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:45.000\nBut also much dimmer flickers many many flickers something some\n\n01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:53.520\nEntities have damaged souls some sort of weird magical interference, but there's lots of them and they're they're all surrounding you\n\n01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.800\nSo those of us with weapons should probably find them\n\n01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.280\nclose at hand and we should stick together and\n\n01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.000\nLook to be prepared\n\n01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:09.400\nFor some sort of what what are you looking at? What are you talking about? Well? I just have a feeling that they're sort of\n\n01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.360\nIt's things are going to go a bit Minnesota in a minute\n\n01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.800\nYou hear hissing and moaning is that Minnesota?\n\n01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.680\nIt certainly is in California. I'll tell you that month\n\n01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.480\nBut I digress I\n\n01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:37.440\nMean like that kind of sound like zombies or something they kind of do\n\n01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:41.960\nWhy are they flickering are they like hologram zombies?\n\n01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:47.160\nHis his enemy sense has the ability to read people's auras\n\n01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:53.200\nBut people who are unhealthy or maybe afflicted by various things might have flickering or damaged auras\n\n01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.200\nAll right, well just tell me where to shoot\n\n01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200\nI\n\n01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.880\nDon't say anybody does any\n\n01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.040\nWay that I can get location on this or there's just sort of in the on the periphery\n\n01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:11.520\nThere's easily more than 30 30 individuals. They're kind of all surrounding the general neighborhood\n\n01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:15.720\nIt's like they're fanning out walking around as if something's roused them\n\n01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:21.120\nWhy have lifted my Ari's Alpha assault rifle with the left hand and on the right the combat axe\n\n01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.920\nYou guys do the best you can do\n\n01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:29.280\nI'm sure I find find what weapon you have do we have a place we could all meet in case we get separated\n\n01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.840\nWell, I can't physically hurt someone who hasn't hurt me first. So I'm sticking with you\n\n01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600\nOkay\n\n01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.600\nYou can carry me right\n\n01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.280\nGet these smart link perhaps\n\n01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:52.840\nSmart link to future Uber or whatever this vehicle is and possibly get some thought of exit to egress from this situation\n\n01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.840\nYeah, you could hail an Uber\n\n01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.200\nThen this is what this is what I have done\n\n01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.520\nSo we're not gonna hang around and check it out at all\n\n01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.400\nIt's doing that thing where you can see all those cars, but no one's biting, you know\n\n01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.880\nI'm gonna go I'm gonna go up to the roof so that I can protect everybody\n\n01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.680\nYou're in a fenced area just like a like a parking lot. All right. I'm gonna go over the fence\n\n01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:28.000\nTo this and then I'm gonna seek higher ground like a brave cat\n\n01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:38.160\nAt the at the humane society in a cage with one shelf at the top\n\n01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:46.420\nJust higher ground. It makes me more comfortable. I I saw I saw a guy get killed on the ground once\n\n01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.680\nand\n\n01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.680\nKind of triggers me\n\n01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:56.320\nSo I'm gonna go up. I could cover you from here\n\n01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000\nPerhaps I know I'm\n\n01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:07.400\nFrom what what what just muzzle raised. I'm covering you in case some sort of action should happen. No, I'm\n\n01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.000\nYou said you're going. Well, I'm good. I was good. I thought we were all gonna go. Oh\n\n01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.360\nIt's a team operation. We're retreating. I\n\n01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:21.640\nThought you're just going on the roof to watch out for us. I was gonna go up the roof because I'm scared, okay?\n\n01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:26.000\nOkay, obviously it's come got you that one us to follow you. I\n\n01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:30.720\nDon't think you can so I think I have to leave you behind and go up to a higher place where I don't die\n\n01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.080\nSo the one who is so full of so much bluster with monologues and everything. Do you have a monologue for insecurity? I\n\n01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.960\nDon't think there's time for it. I'm scared. I'm scared of things on the ground. It's my thing\n\n01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:48.400\nBut but the money's on the ground. So so via com link or whatever that is sure\n\n01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.120\nWhat's the sitch what do you see people do you see zombies? What's going on? No, he said he saw\n\n01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:58.880\nI haven't seen anything yet\n\n01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.320\nTell us what you see look around. I'm\n\n01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.760\nWhat I see is my hands climbing over a chain link fence getting out of the fence area\n\n01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:13.560\nAnd I'm asking if I also see you guys coming with me or if I have to make up a lie about what happened to you\n\n01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.560\nTo my friends at the bar\n\n01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.440\nI'm in\n\n01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.800\nMight I try and is there some sort of distance that can I try to mind link with some of these darker souls?\n\n01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:30.000\nWhat does this you're not within range of any any mind linkable as I suspected\n\n01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.160\nSo what I did well to there's two votes in that direction\n\n01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.520\nSo I would say that then hold the guard will follow as will dr. Friend\n\n01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:45.680\nHeading over the fence you climb upon the roof of an old devastated gas station. Told you there's a roof\n\n01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:53.680\nWhat you see is people milling about they look all weird and screwed up\n\n01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:59.440\nThey definitely have sorts of skin conditions as well as white skin\n\n01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.920\nlike white white like pale\n\n01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:09.040\nAlbino style white you see their eyes are crusted over as if they are blinded and they're\n\n01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:16.280\nIn their hands are covered in gnarled claws as if they've been twisted by some sort of dark force or virus\n\n01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:23.360\nYou recognize them to be ghouls. That is to say people who have been infected by the HMH VV virus\n\n01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.600\nToo soon\n\n01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:35.120\nThey're milling about they haven't noticed you but something has brought them out of the woodwork\n\n01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:43.360\nThey haven't noticed us. No, no, they're just milling about blind style. Oh, how many lots like ocean\n\n01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.840\nNo, like like 40 40\n\n01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.240\nDo I do have I encountered ghouls before oh, yeah, I mean ghouls they're everywhere\n\n01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.880\nIt's it possible to use spell casting to sort of I\n\n01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:05.200\nFeel like we should just fight them right? I mean this is dying up here. I mean come on. Let's do something. Come on\n\n01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:07.200\nLet's fight\n\n01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:11.240\nDo we fight one or do we separate one and see if we can cure them\n\n01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.080\nWe could easily run away\n\n01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:18.040\nThe only thing that's keeping us here is that do we want to fight 40 ghouls for a briefcase full of paper money?\n\n01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:25.480\nThat's ticking right beeping. They've got HMH V, man. How hard can they be to defeat?\n\n01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:35.000\nIt's I got all kinds of magic spells and stuff. I'm sure you guys got some weapons\n\n01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.560\nLet's do this. You and the doctor maybe take\n\n01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.760\nTake your shot\n\n01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.600\nWell, can I Spencer? Yeah, this says can't physically hurt someone who hasn't hurt me first true\n\n01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:50.600\nAre they technically trying to hurt me? Well, uh, you haven't seen them try and hurt you\n\n01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.600\nBut you know your morals they slacken from time to time. So\n\n01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.280\nLet's do this. Well, what if they thank you? All right, fine. I'm with you sister\n\n01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.880\nTalking to Ridley. Yeah, I'm Eve libertine\n\n01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:12.040\nAll right. Well, okay, I guess I'll guess for lack of anything better to do as the guy who can only shoot guns\n\n01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.040\nI'll just run down and go\n\n01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.040\nAh and shoot my gun\n\n01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:24.520\nI'm sure you'll be right there to help me.

Okay\n\n01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:36.240\nSo everyone's just shooting. All right\n\n01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:45.080\nJim nightblade leaps off the top of the gas station and launches himself into the fray firing while yelling\n\n01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960\nsemi-sarcastic Lee\n\n01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:58.640\nHe pops two or three ghouls in their body parts as Eve libertine also fires her weapons\n\n01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.840\nOh, yeah at the ghouls dropping. Let me use some of this astral combat too. Oh\n\n01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.600\nI see there's a four next to it. That's not a gun though. It's combat\n\n01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:19.520\nAll right utilizing his astral combat, he realizes all the ghosts he could be attacking right now\n\n01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000\nOh ha ha ha\n\n01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440\nI'll get to them later\n\n01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:38.400\nContinuing to hail to hail the enemy with their fiery bullets. I don't know what the fuck\n\n01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.040\nAnyway firing many automatic weapons\n\n01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.600\nbullets plunge into the zombies\n\n01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000\nkilling at least\n\n01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.920\nKilling seven of them. No, see that's good. It's good\n\n01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:57.920\nThree surround Jim nightblade, but the rest seem to be scared and running away. Did you say 30 three? Oh\n\n01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.480\nNot not too bad. Yeah\n\n01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:07.960\nThey lunge nano whip. Well, they're lunging. Well, nano whip their lunge. They\n\n01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:17.840\nLunge and you yeah, no, you definitely dodge out of the way. Whoa, it seems that ghouls\n\n01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:30.640\nAre not too dexterous looks like you guys aren't too dexterous\n\n01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:35.080\nMight I recommend some calisthenics in the morning and oh not being a ghoul\n\n01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.640\nGhoul burn\n\n01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.640\nI\n\n01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:53.440\nWhere'd you go? Yeah, what happened? Yeah, I mean obviously take a shit, right? No other reason to leave\n\n01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.440\nvery subtle\n\n01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:03.880\nHorde guard with his combat sense expertly drops a few zombies as an adduce\n\n01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.120\nThen he sees Jim nightblades being surrounded\n\n01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:13.120\nBeing surrounded by ghouls. I called in the airstrike. Oh\n\n01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.640\nHorde guard you got you got crazy reflexes. You're the only one who can act right now\n\n01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.640\nSo obviously your skills of focus on it the negative, right? I\n\n01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:38.560\nI guess it could have been a peepee. No\n\n01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000\nIt was it was the latter\n\n01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.760\nThat was fast on\n\n01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:48.920\nYou didn't yeah, yeah, we'll talk about it. We'll talk about later\n\n01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.760\nSoil and soil and blue is not what it used to be\n\n01:52:52.760 --> 01:53:01.160\nUm save him horde guard from zombies\n\n01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400\nUsing a\n\n01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.120\nBlades I'm tossing blades\n\n01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.200\nOkay, what what blades do you have to toss?\n\n01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:25.560\nThe what the sort of blades I think the combat hatchets the only the only blade you have so I'm going to\n\n01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.160\nActually, I'm not going to toss. I'm gonna wield it. I'm gonna walk into the situation\n\n01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:33.640\nMoving as fast as I can reacting quickly and swinging\n\n01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:40.160\nWait, what with me? Okay murderous intent with anything that is a problem\n\n01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:43.080\nWalking quickly with murderous intent\n\n01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.080\nYou\n\n01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:51.880\nWield your axe wildly you leap off the gas station roof you land on top of a zombie\n\n01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:59.480\nComing down with your hatchet you cleave the other one in half in twain. This is like I what I'd like to call it right in twain\n\n01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:05.200\nCleft in twain was it's a really old D&D thing we did once\n\n01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:09.920\nYeah episode 8 it's something like those are the days\n\n01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.480\nOne zombie remains\n\n01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:21.480\nReally really oh a lot of them scan last he just killed two now. We're the bad guys. We're just gonna gather\n\n01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.480\nJust start taunting it and waiting for a zombie cop to show up to say is it possible that horde guard could fly off\n\n01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:45.120\nA fire off a flashback. Yep flashbang sure to possibly stop stop the zombie in his tracks. Well, it's blind\n\n01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.000\nBut the concussion sure might do a thing\n\n01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.320\nDo we need to question this zombie sorry before we kill yeah, yeah find out what it knows I\n\n01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:03.720\nKnow I'm the overzealous one, but everybody Eve Eve's everybody stand down Eve's gonna question the zombie the ghoul\n\n01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:06.160\nAll right get in there\n\n01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.360\nI mean I can heal things well what I'm saying.

There's no ghoul captain\n\n01:55:54.360 --> 01:56:00.200\nWe're not that they just came out of a play they didn't come out of the suitcase. There's no\n\n01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.400\nWe can't reason with the middle. Yeah, why are you assuming all this?\n\n01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.080\nEven if we could is what I'm saying if what if they were the smartest rats in the world\n\n01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.640\nBut what are you doing rat?

What where can I eat you?\n\n01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:25.980\nHe has no information for us. He's a mouth with legs\n\n01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:33.980\nThis is some kind of crazy cyber steampunk world. I don't know the rules are it's half magic half technology\n\n01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:39.900\nI don't know what ghouls are in this world. I have some facility with spell casting. Is there some sort of a spell?\n\n01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:44.060\nI'm searching my brain trying to pull out something that might\n\n01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:52.300\nLatch on to that kernel of human that might still be left within the zombies consciousness\n\n01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:59.180\nI mean, I don't know man. You got to check your spells. I have said the level is five. I don't I'm looking at\n\n01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:05.940\nI'm gonna go over to the briefcase. Well, this is happening.

It's if we can sell it at a fair\n\n01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:25.780\nWhat can we turn it off? Well, okay? I mean can you turn it off really by killing the ghoul like the ghoul magnet?\n\n01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:33.060\nI mean honestly, I you're talking to a person who's just at the end of his rope\n\n01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:36.780\nI just feel like such an idiot. I've changed my mind so many times on this job\n\n01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:42.780\nNo, we get the guy killed. We didn't do anything right. I'm a bad shadow runner. We got tricked by a ghoul magnet\n\n01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:49.980\nHold a gun fires off a shock round in the direction of the flashing threeling threshing beast\n\n01:58:49.980 --> 01:59:00.020\nIn the hopes that this will stop him from hoping you mean the ghoul, right? Yes, the ghoul you do that and it does that\n\n01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:02.020\nI noted Melissa\n\n01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:04.740\nSo at least we've solved this\n\n01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:10.340\nMelanie no, I know my place now. That's okay\n\n01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:21.500\nThe ghoul is down for the count ghoul magnet\n\n01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:28.860\nAll right, well, but not forever in the interim you two can work this out for yourselves\n\n01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:32.940\nWell, now you know what happens. We're gonna figure out how they end the end of the chapter\n\n01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:36.140\ndramatic pickup of the briefcase\n\n01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:42.260\nThe brief it's an empty briefcase. Somebody gave us this ghoul magnet, right? Yeah\n\n01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:50.260\nOh, but who the people that we're here and shot every but I wasn't I don't know I'm new to this story. I don't know\n\n01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:56.580\nIt's the people they hired us. They they we don't know who they are. They're the people that wanted the\n\n01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:03.980\nInformation about the BTL chicks. Can we look at like a serial number on the ghoul magnet trace it back to its manufacturer?\n\n02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:06.740\nAnd then find out who ordered and all that kind of stuff\n\n02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:11.820\nWhy not? I mean the funniest thing in the world would be if we ended up on a different adventure at a ghoul magnet factory\n\n02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:18.620\nThat's a big response.
