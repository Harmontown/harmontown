{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:20.000\nOh, shit. Chicago makes the fucking noise!\n\n00:20.000 --> 00:35.000\nYeah, this session of Harlington is about to begin. First, let me bring out the wonderful Spencer Crittenden. You can be louder than that.\n\n00:35.000 --> 00:50.000\nYeah! Tonight in the room of Jeff Davis, who we love so much, my name is Brandon Johnson and I will be your controller.\n\n00:50.000 --> 01:03.000\nAnd with no further ado, let me bring out the mayor of Harlington, Dan Harmon!\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:24.000\nBrandon Johnson! Thank you, Chicago! God bless you! God bless this fucking wonderful industrial Midwestern deprived, depressed city!\n\n01:24.000 --> 01:36.000\nGod bless the alcohol coursing through your arteries for generations that you can't even control. You Midwestern visit golfs.\n\n01:36.000 --> 01:46.000\nYou are my people. I grew up 90 minutes from you. I'm afraid to go back to my hometown so this is as close as we'll ever get.\n\n01:46.000 --> 01:56.000\nI don't know how they'd react to me if I went back to Milwaukee. I'm still scared. When I left, they said, you'll be back. That's not a good goodbye.\n\n01:56.000 --> 02:03.000\nThat's not something you say to people you love. I don't care how proud you are of your hometown. You don't say you'll be back when someone says goodbye.\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:09.000\nThey didn't say that to Frodo. They said, I hope you save the world from Sauron.\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:25.000\nWhy are you looking at me when you say that? That's fucked up. The man who grew up in California but looks more at home here than anyone.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:31.000\nOh yeah. I was walking around and I was like, I'm the most comfortable person in the city right now.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:44.000\nStill rocking the cargo shorts today. The weather was fine today for a nice stroll. It gets fucking cold in this area of the country.\n\n02:44.000 --> 02:53.000\nThere is an oppressive spiritual thing that no one talks about. The idea that when you look up at the sky, you don't see God.\n\n02:53.000 --> 03:06.000\nThe way that you do in an equatorial climate, you see blue and yellow and you feel like God's up there and he's somehow in charge of what happens to you.\n\n03:06.000 --> 03:14.000\nIt might be a good thing. It might be a bad thing. You might be part of some agricultural community where they play lacrosse and the winner loses their head.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.000\nYou do see guys named Jesus but they're usually pissing outside.\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:32.000\nBut when you're in the Midwest, it's like, I've said it a thousand times, you're descended from the genes of people who, like, they're descended from Plymouth Rock, either landed on them or they landed on it.\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:35.000\nThey didn't cross the border. The border crossed them.\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:49.000\nIn any case, they headed west, their wagon broke down, admit it, and then they were like, fuck it. But that's not a non-heroic thing to say because guess what?\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:56.000\nWell, what's waiting for you at the Pacific Ocean? We just got out there, we. I'm a Milwaukeean.\n\n03:56.000 --> 04:06.000\nI'm just saying, the people on the west coast, those are just the people that got that far and then they're like, we have no more dreams to chase, let's invent television.\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:15.000\nThe Midwest is the gene pool that was like, you know what? What if it was just cold? What if God tried to kill you?\n\n04:15.000 --> 04:21.000\nWhat if nine months of the year, God was unapologetic about his desire for you to die?\n\n04:21.000 --> 04:33.000\nWhat if everything you ate just tried to poison you? What if every time you stepped outside, what if the weatherman had to tell you how many seconds it took for human skin to freeze?\n\n04:33.000 --> 04:45.000\nWhat if your car required not only a key to start, but a fucking chisel and a heated blanket and a schedule, a regimen.\n\n04:45.000 --> 04:59.000\nIf you remember working in Milwaukee, you'd have to go out, you'd have to schedule, you'd backtrack it. Like, oh, I gotta be at the ground round at eight, so that means at seven, I gotta put a blanket on my car, I gotta start the car.\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:10.000\nI'm not made for this, I'm a ground round employee. And then the people that are coming in are gonna pay what they weigh.\n\n05:10.000 --> 05:12.000\nWhich in Milwaukee is a lot of fucking money.\n\n05:12.000 --> 05:22.000\nSo I'm gonna be rich, I guess, yeah. Anyway, I got Midwestern chops. I'm not some hoity-toity. You Google me.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:28.000\nOh, what's Dan Harmon worth? There's that page that says five million. I don't know what the fuck they're coming from. I don't know what that means.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:35.000\nI'm not worth five million dollars. I have a five bedroom house. Those bedrooms are not...\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:43.000\nWe lost Brandon, we lost Brandon. Those bedrooms are not worth a million dollars each.\n\n05:43.000 --> 05:50.000\nI've eaten out of comfortable existence. I'm terrified right now. I feel like we're fighting a fascist empire.\n\n05:50.000 --> 06:00.000\nWhatever, your politics are fine here. It's fine, Chicago. I don't care. I saw the map. I saw how red you were. It's okay.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:07.000\nYou're booing, you're saying, you're saying blue. Okay, then you're fine here too. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.\n\n06:07.000 --> 06:12.000\nThere's a couple people in here that voted for Trump. They're doing a good job. They're being polite.\n\n06:12.000 --> 06:21.000\nChicago was like the only city that like went in and wrecked up the place when Trump was around, you know?\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:23.000\nWhat does he mean? What are you talking about? What do you mean?\n\n06:23.000 --> 06:29.000\nThey came, like, he went and stumping around all these places, but in Chicago they shut it down. He wouldn't come outside.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:37.000\nOh, he wouldn't come out here. All right. Resist. Fine. As long as I know I'm safe, I'll say whatever.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:45.000\nLet's burn it down. I just needed to know I was safe. I'm part of the spineless demographic.\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:51.000\nI just don't want people to beat me up. That's all. The reason why I'm part of the resistance now is that it has nothing to do.\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:59.000\nThe reason I became politically activated to the extent, meaning that I tweet mean things now, it's because I'm lazy.\n\n06:59.000 --> 07:04.000\nBecause all of a sudden it didn't, now it's going to matter. I worked really hard to get my house.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:10.000\nI don't want to have to stand in front of it and like swing a bat and go like, get away. It won't work.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:18.000\nI don't know what I'm made of. So I bought a gun and I just like, I'm just sweating it out. I'm just sweating it out in my house.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:28.000\nAnyways, it doesn't matter. It's not about me. It's about me. It's about me. But you expect a show.\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:34.000\nYou want a show. You came to a Chicago.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:42.000\nDan, I don't think I want a show. I can't hear them. Do they want a show? I can't hear it.\n\n07:42.000 --> 07:48.000\nOkay. You guys think just because we came to Chicago, we're going to like improvise?\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:52.000\nIs that the idea? Because you're famous for improv?\n\n07:52.000 --> 08:16.000\nPlease welcome improv maestro Jimmy Corraine and star of stage and screen, Scott Anson.\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:24.000\nAll right. Take it easy. All right. Noted.\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.000\nAll right.\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.000\nI'm better than season three.\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:31.000\nYeah. Dan.\n\n08:31.000 --> 08:37.000\nBy the way, yeah, Rick and Morty started airing tonight. Part of an elaborate, strange, misguided April Fool's prank.\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:46.000\nI don't really understand it. I can finally tell you, Rick and Morty season three's premiere is airing on a loop. When you go home, you can watch it.\n\n08:46.000 --> 09:00.000\nYou're not missing anything. It's a prank, get it? I don't get it, but I couldn't tell you and you fucking 15 year olds kept riding me.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:06.000\nI'd be like, Trump's an idiot. He's a fascist. We're going to lose our civil liberties.\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:11.000\nYeah. Well, you're going to lose season three of Rick and Morty.\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:16.000\nI'm not doing any. I'm finished. They're drawing it.\n\n09:16.000 --> 09:19.000\nProve it.\n\n09:19.000 --> 09:24.000\nExactly, sir.\n\n09:24.000 --> 09:29.000\nI mean, like anyone was going to hear that. I mean, you could have said anything.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:37.000\nYou snail sew the ricks out. You sound like a Star Wars character.\n\n09:37.000 --> 09:45.000\nI liked him yelling out. I think that was helpful. But I didn't hear what you said. Would you come down here and say it into my mic?\n\n09:45.000 --> 09:47.000\nWell, people will take that invitation.\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:50.000\nHe'll be down here in 20 minutes.\n\n09:50.000 --> 09:52.000\nWe'll vamp until you get here.\n\n09:52.000 --> 10:03.000\nYou guys are improvisational professionals. See, people are cheering because now nine dudes are pretending to be him and there's going to be a line of people coming up.\n\n10:03.000 --> 10:07.000\nI was that guy. Sneak snog up ricks out.\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:11.000\nI was that guy. Game fan for Sample.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:16.000\nYou guys all have an improv background. Brandon Johnson, you did improv.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:22.000\nI did improv. I did not do improv as well as these two fucking gods we have on stage in front of you.\n\n10:22.000 --> 10:23.000\nWrong.\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:24.000\nThank you.\n\n10:24.000 --> 10:25.000\nWrong though, wrong.\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.000\nDid you work with Brandon?\n\n10:27.000 --> 10:30.000\nWe improvised a few times. I can set some stuff. We weren't of the same generation.\n\n10:30.000 --> 10:36.000\nAnd that was your understudy. So you never missed a day of work.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:43.000\nBut a lot of people might be coming because there's 900 people here. There's 900 people here.\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:47.000\nThey may only be here because they know that I'm amazing.\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:52.000\nSome of them, even though they're from Chicago, may not know what improv really is.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:56.000\nThey may think it's just, well, oh, that's when you don't have a script.\n\n10:56.000 --> 11:03.000\nLet's just, on a molecular level, we'll just show them for what improv is on a fundamental level.\n\n11:03.000 --> 11:07.000\nOkay.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:20.000\nSo I will, let's tell a story in four lines of dialogue.\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:26.000\nI will enter with a line. Then we have two more lines to do.\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:29.000\nAnd then, Brandon, you come in with the fourth line.\n\n11:29.000 --> 11:31.000\nOh, great. Great.\n\n11:31.000 --> 11:33.000\nNo pressure. No pressure at all.\n\n11:33.000 --> 11:35.000\nWho we are and what we're doing and where we are now.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.000\nAnd we'll get as much information as we can because that's part of improv.\n\n11:38.000 --> 11:42.000\nIt's like being positive and providing information, piping and things. Yes.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:53.000\nSo four lines. Here's how improv works.\n\n11:53.000 --> 12:01.000\nI would like to return this fur coat because it's too big.\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:14.000\nBut I'm a ghost. I can't run the cash register.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:23.000\nI am the manager and I can help you, sir.\n\n12:23.000 --> 12:32.000\nHe said he wanted a 15 dog coat, so I made him a 15 dog coat.\n\n12:32.000 --> 12:36.000\nAll right. Thank you.\n\n12:36.000 --> 12:40.000\nSo that's the atomic structure of improv.\n\n12:40.000 --> 12:45.000\nYeah, I don't think we have to explain it. I think it's pretty self-explanatory.\n\n12:45.000 --> 12:46.000\nWhen its merits are.\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.000\nIn that, I was the Steve Harvey character.\n\n12:48.000 --> 12:50.000\nBecause we know what we're doing.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:56.000\nAnd then people go, oh, so improv, they compare it to written comedy.\n\n12:56.000 --> 13:00.000\nSo there's a laptop back here. This is going to be tough.\n\n13:00.000 --> 13:03.000\nIt's going to run the risk of making a bad show.\n\n13:03.000 --> 13:22.000\nOkay. All right. Yeah. So if we were to write that scene.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:26.000\nInterior coat shop.\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:33.000\nFor a second, I thought that was the guy from upstairs and I was like, get the fuck out of here.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:38.000\nI'll kick you in your face. You look like Steve Bannon.\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:44.000\nOh, yeasty and shit. That dude has a yeast. He's got some yeast shit on his face.\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:51.000\nThat's the good thing about not liking that dude is we can talk shit on him and nobody's going to be like, don't be like that about Steve Bannon.\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.000\nFucking brought Steve Bannon to the party, you guys. Be nice tonight.\n\n13:55.000 --> 14:04.000\nHe's got on a diaper.\n\n14:04.000 --> 14:10.000\nOh, shit. He wants to save the, ah, damn it, eSports.\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:15.000\nFucking bullshit. Some YouTube show we're doing.\n\n14:15.000 --> 14:20.000\nTimbuck says the first thing that came up was the porn from last night on that laptop.\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:24.000\nGhost coat. We'll call it.\n\n14:24.000 --> 14:28.000\nThere's a lot of mannequin porn on his computer.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.000\nHow to make a ghost costume.\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:37.000\nAnd then the manager. What did you say, Jimmy? You said...\n\n14:37.000 --> 14:40.000\nI was the manager. I can help you.\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.000\nI'm the manager. I can help you.\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:44.000\nAnd if you could do that in...\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:48.000\nAnd then Brandon disembodied.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:53.000\nI played a young Nigerian trying to find his way through the furry industry.\n\n14:53.000 --> 14:55.000\nHis mentor was Steve Harvey.\n\n14:55.000 --> 15:00.000\n$15. Okay, so we have a flawed story here that we created improvisationally.\n\n15:00.000 --> 15:04.000\nLike, where did it break down? I thought my line was awesome.\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:11.000\nLike, and then you introducing the fact that you're a ghost brought us across a threshold.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.000\nRight. I was introducing a mythology that we could explore.\n\n15:14.000 --> 15:18.000\nI think, and then it starts to break down ironically with our improv masters.\n\n15:18.000 --> 15:23.000\nJimmy Corraine, who teaches improv.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:26.000\nI'm a manager. I can help you.\n\n15:26.000 --> 15:29.000\nBut ironically, you couldn't.\n\n15:29.000 --> 15:33.000\nAs an improv manager, you couldn't help anyone.\n\n15:33.000 --> 15:36.000\nAlthough he could have made his line longer.\n\n15:36.000 --> 15:38.000\nYou just said line.\n\n15:38.000 --> 15:42.000\nSo let's try it again. Let's do a rewrite.\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:46.000\nThat's not how improv works, Mayor Harmon.\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.000\nBut I'm not going to change what I did because I nailed it.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:55.000\nAnd I don't think Scott did very bad either.\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.000\nNow, I feel a lot of pressure.\n\n15:57.000 --> 15:59.000\nCan I just say before we do this, I'm feeling a lot of pressure.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:01.000\nI'm in my head right now.\n\n16:01.000 --> 16:03.000\nI'm going to alter my line just a little bit. It may help you.\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:06.000\nOkay. All right. You're going to set me up. Thank you, Scott.\n\n16:06.000 --> 16:10.000\nAnd also, if you were more relaxed before, that may have been the problem.\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:12.000\nOkay.\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:15.000\nCha-ding-ding!\n\n16:15.000 --> 16:18.000\nI'd like to return this coat. It doesn't fit me very well.\n\n16:18.000 --> 16:21.000\nI'm a ghost, remember?\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:30.000\nI'm a ghost, too. I'm the manager ghost.\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:40.000\nI think I'm catching on. What do you think?\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:43.000\nYou're still in character? I can't respond if you are.\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:48.000\nNo. We'll talk later.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:53.000\nWhy is that lady wearing a fur coat on the beach?\n\n16:53.000 --> 16:56.000\nWhoa! Okay.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:59.000\nI mean, that was interesting because that changed everything.\n\n16:59.000 --> 17:02.000\nI just thought I'd try something different for this improv.\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.000\nSo, the actors thought they knew where they were,\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:12.000\nbut then the dialogue shows that we were actually on a beach with a door.\n\n17:12.000 --> 17:15.000\nNow, the interesting thing is the characters knew that. The actors didn't.\n\n17:15.000 --> 17:21.000\nThat's right. Like all good improv alcoholism together, all rooted in denial.\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:24.000\nYou say plain, I say boat.\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:27.000\nSo, if we were to continue with that scene, like,\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:31.000\nso he's now revealed that we're on a beach with a door and that we have two ghosts,\n\n17:31.000 --> 17:34.000\nbut I'm returning a coat that doesn't fit.\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:39.000\nAnd you're a lady.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:50.000\nYou promised me when I rubbed that seashell\n\n17:52.000 --> 17:58.000\nthat if I wore your coat, you'd give me lightning power.\n\n17:58.000 --> 18:04.000\nThe lightning power has always been in you.\n\n18:07.000 --> 18:10.000\nThe coat was just a catalyst to your realization.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.000\nUse your power now.\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:18.000\nI'm still the manager ghost.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:22.000\nAnd with your power, you can kill me.\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:27.000\nWait a minute, Andy. When you get out of prison,\n\n18:27.000 --> 18:30.000\nyou can help me work on the boat. Shawshank.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.000\nAll right. Well, okay.\n\n18:45.000 --> 18:48.000\nAll right. So there's a...\n\n18:48.000 --> 18:50.000\nI like that one.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:54.000\nSo what we're learning about improv is that it's different from writing.\n\n18:54.000 --> 18:58.000\nLike, if you held it to the same standards, it wouldn't hold up.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.000\nLike, a lot of people watch, like, whose line is it anyway?\n\n19:01.000 --> 19:04.000\nAnd they go, like, well, why don't you just write that stuff?\n\n19:04.000 --> 19:07.000\nAnd then, but then you go, like, no, they're making it up.\n\n19:07.000 --> 19:10.000\nYou go to, like, an improv show in Chicago,\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.000\nlike a long-form improv show by really talented, like, long-form improv people.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:17.000\nAnd you could witness something that could never be written.\n\n19:17.000 --> 19:19.000\nIt could never be written. Jimmy, what is that phenomenon?\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:21.000\nWhat is that magic?\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:25.000\nWell, I think it's because each show is always different every night.\n\n19:25.000 --> 19:29.000\nSometimes they're going to fail and sometimes they're going to succeed.\n\n19:29.000 --> 19:31.000\nIt's really like a sporting event.\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\nThat's what makes it so fun to watch.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:36.000\nWhat do you think, Scott?\n\n19:36.000 --> 19:37.000\nI hate sports metaphors.\n\n19:37.000 --> 19:38.000\nOkay.\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\nEspecially in relation to art.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:47.000\nBut I'll say that the difference, I think, is that when somebody's written\n\n19:47.000 --> 19:50.000\nand people know it's written, then they have a higher expectation\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.000\nfor it being crafted and satisfying.\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:57.000\nAnd an improv survival is a win.\n\n19:57.000 --> 19:59.000\nAnd the people in the audience know that,\n\n19:59.000 --> 20:02.000\nand they know that everyone's on a tightrope,\n\n20:02.000 --> 20:05.000\nand if they land gracefully, then that's a success.\n\n20:05.000 --> 20:08.000\nAnd the highest compliment you can get in an improv show\n\n20:08.000 --> 20:12.000\nis people will come and say, are you sure that wasn't scripted?\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:14.000\nThat's, like, the highest compliment you can get.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:17.000\nBut that would mean that you did so good at improv\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:21.000\nthat it was just slightly less, like, good than something that was written.\n\n20:21.000 --> 20:22.000\nRight?\n\n20:22.000 --> 20:23.000\nWell, there are terrible situations.\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:24.000\nThere should be something.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:26.000\nPeople should be coming up to you and saying,\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:28.000\nI know for sure that wasn't written,\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:31.000\nbut it was better than anything that could have been written.\n\n20:31.000 --> 20:32.000\nWe both heard that.\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:33.000\nYeah.\n\n20:33.000 --> 20:34.000\nRight.\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:37.000\nWho are these people you get into a fight with, Dan?\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:39.000\nBut we're just saying, like, the audience, they're dumb.\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:40.000\nThey don't have the vocabulary.\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:44.000\nThey're just like, oh, that seemed like written it.\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:46.000\nAnd I was like, OK, yeah, give me your 10 bucks.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:47.000\nOK.\n\n20:47.000 --> 20:50.000\nYou're very cynical about improv.\n\n20:50.000 --> 20:51.000\nNo, I'm cynical about America.\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:52.000\nOK.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:53.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n20:53.000 --> 20:54.000\nI confused it.\n\n20:54.000 --> 20:57.000\nSpencer, where does it, so when you're a dungeon master,\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:58.000\nwhere does this come in?\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:01.000\nBecause you're improvising as a narrator,\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:03.000\nand then people are looking at a sheet of paper,\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:05.000\nand they're saying, well, then because of this sheet of paper,\n\n21:05.000 --> 21:08.000\nwhich isn't a script, but it is a bunch of facts, I do this.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:11.000\nAnd then, like, what?\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.000\nTalk.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:13.000\nSay some stuff.\n\n21:13.000 --> 21:14.000\nOh.\n\n21:14.000 --> 21:18.000\nIt is like writing and improv.\n\n21:18.000 --> 21:23.000\nSo what if...\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.000\nI just...\n\n21:24.000 --> 21:25.000\nSo you couldn't write that?\n\n21:25.000 --> 21:26.000\nIt's so easy.\n\n21:26.000 --> 21:27.000\nIt's so easy with these guys.\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.000\nSo what if I were to say, OK, Jimmy Corraine,\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:33.000\nimprov extraordinaire, would be your dice,\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.000\nbecause you don't have any, and we don't have a campaign.\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:40.000\nSo then, could you dungeon master an improvised campaign\n\n21:40.000 --> 21:46.000\nfor me and Scott and Brandon to be in a little campaign,\n\n21:46.000 --> 21:49.000\nand then Jimmy is like the dice.\n\n21:49.000 --> 21:55.000\nCould Jimmy improvise results?\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.000\nSo many clues.\n\n21:56.000 --> 21:57.000\nYeah.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.000\nCan you improvise results?\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:03.000\nDoes that sound fun to you?\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:05.000\nI...\n\n22:05.000 --> 22:06.000\nWhatever.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:11.000\nWhatever anyone wants, yes.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.000\nIt's kind of like if Jimmy was human dice,\n\n22:14.000 --> 22:20.000\nlike if you just, like, any time we wanted to do something,\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:26.000\nSpencer would look at you, and then you would represent a random result,\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:28.000\nand then Spencer would read it,\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:32.000\nand then explain to us what we had accomplished.\n\n22:32.000 --> 22:37.000\nNow, to connect the dots, backstage, me and Dan were thinking that\n\n22:37.000 --> 22:41.000\na true improv master would be able to improvise perfectly\n\n22:41.000 --> 22:47.000\nthe random results as if from a die.\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:48.000\nThat's part of this conceit.\n\n22:48.000 --> 22:50.000\nAlmost like a magician.\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.000\nRight.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:52.000\nDo you mean that the...\n\n22:52.000 --> 22:53.000\nYeah, what do you...\n\n22:53.000 --> 22:54.000\nNo, I've just...\n\n22:54.000 --> 22:55.000\nYou said that!\n\n22:55.000 --> 22:57.000\nDo you mean like...\n\n22:57.000 --> 23:00.000\nDo you mean like Jimmy would say three and eight,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:02.000\nor do you mean like Jimmy would be like,\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:04.000\nyou hit and you get a critical hit?\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.000\nLet's ask the person who said that.\n\n23:06.000 --> 23:07.000\nWhat you...\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:08.000\nI didn't suggest...\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:09.000\nThat's me?\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:12.000\nYeah, I didn't say, hey, Jimmy would be great at pretending to be dice,\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.000\nbut, like, I don't...\n\n23:14.000 --> 23:17.000\nI believe you when you say it, but I don't know your thinking.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:18.000\nYeah, but I'm drunk.\n\n23:18.000 --> 23:21.000\nWhy are you listening to me about anything?\n\n23:21.000 --> 23:22.000\nI think you were...\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:24.000\nI was sitting down and you looked taller.\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:25.000\nAll right, well, fine.\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.000\nSo I'll control everything.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:31.000\nWell, you can do... you control what you want me to control.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:32.000\nOkay.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:33.000\nRight.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:34.000\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:35.000\nAll right.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:36.000\nSpencer, you're in charge of...\n\n23:36.000 --> 23:37.000\nOf...\n\n23:37.000 --> 23:38.000\nOf...\n\n23:38.000 --> 23:39.000\nOf what...\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:40.000\nWhat happens...\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:41.000\nOkay.\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:46.000\nOver what we're seeing and what's in the room.\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:47.000\nOkay.\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.000\nAnd then whenever anyone wants to do anything,\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:52.000\ninstead of rolling dice,\n\n23:52.000 --> 23:55.000\nJimmy, who's not part of the narrative,\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:58.000\nyou're like a non-diagetic element.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:03.000\nThat is not a word.\n\n24:03.000 --> 24:05.000\nUh, you...\n\n24:05.000 --> 24:07.000\nNon-diagetic.\n\n24:07.000 --> 24:08.000\nYou produce results.\n\n24:08.000 --> 24:10.000\nYou're sort of like a god or a...\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:14.000\nI mean, it wouldn't be fun for him to say random numbers.\n\n24:14.000 --> 24:16.000\nJimmy, you have to do more than that.\n\n24:16.000 --> 24:19.000\nYou have to represent kind of like...\n\n24:19.000 --> 24:20.000\nDice?\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:32.000\nYou have to... you have to indicate fate in a way that Spencer can read.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nSo you stand over there.\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nCan you give me an example?\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nYes.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.000\nGive me an example.\n\n24:36.000 --> 24:37.000\nOkay.\n\n24:37.000 --> 24:38.000\nAll right.\n\n24:38.000 --> 24:39.000\nWell, you be me.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.000\nYou be me.\n\n24:40.000 --> 24:41.000\nI'm you.\n\n24:41.000 --> 24:42.000\nAn example and I'll be you what I want you to do.\n\n24:42.000 --> 24:43.000\nI'm Dan.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:44.000\nDo you know how to play Dungeons & Dragons?\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:45.000\nI don't know how to play Dungeons & Dragons.\n\n24:45.000 --> 24:46.000\nYou tell him what he's looking at.\n\n24:46.000 --> 24:47.000\nOkay.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:49.000\nJimmy, you're in a wonderful field,\n\n24:49.000 --> 24:50.000\nsurrounded by trees.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:52.000\nMaybe it's a forest, even.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:53.000\nWhat do you do?\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:55.000\nSo tell him what you want to do.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.000\nI'd like to climb up one of the trees.\n\n24:57.000 --> 25:00.000\nOh, shit.\n\n25:00.000 --> 25:02.000\nThat's him rolling?\n\n25:02.000 --> 25:03.000\nAre you rolling?\n\n25:03.000 --> 25:04.000\nIt's a very sexy tree.\n\n25:04.000 --> 25:05.000\nI don't...\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.000\nYou have to interpret it.\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:07.000\nBecause...\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:08.000\nWait, what?\n\n25:08.000 --> 25:09.000\nBecause...\n\n25:09.000 --> 25:11.000\nLike, I'm a human die.\n\n25:11.000 --> 25:12.000\nOkay.\n\n25:12.000 --> 25:14.000\nLike, I'm not going to just say...\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:17.000\nI'm just saying like, this could mean to you...\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:18.000\nIt's like a tarot card.\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:19.000\nIt could mean like...\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:20.000\nMan.\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:22.000\nIt's like, oh, that seems like a normal,\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:23.000\naverage thing.\n\n25:23.000 --> 25:24.000\nHe's acquiescent.\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:26.000\nSo if he says he wants to climb a tree,\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:27.000\nand I'm going like this,\n\n25:27.000 --> 25:28.000\nI guess he climbs the tree, maybe.\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:29.000\nWell, I thought...\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:30.000\nOr if I'm like...\n\n25:30.000 --> 25:31.000\nOr if I'm like...\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:33.000\nThen it's like he fell...\n\n25:33.000 --> 25:34.000\nOh, a twig poked him in the eye,\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:36.000\nand he fell out of the tree.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.000\nBecause I'm being, like, aggressive.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:40.000\nNow, Dan, were you the tree?\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.000\nNo.\n\n25:41.000 --> 25:42.000\nNo.\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:43.000\nI'm like...\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.000\nYeah, what are you?\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.000\nI'm a human die.\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:48.000\nWell, a human die would tumble around and reveal a face\n\n25:48.000 --> 25:50.000\nwith a number of sides, like a number on it.\n\n25:50.000 --> 25:51.000\nThat's...\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.000\nYeah.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:53.000\nThat's if a human was a die.\n\n25:53.000 --> 25:54.000\nRight.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:55.000\nYeah, a human die.\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:57.000\nIf a human played the role of a die.\n\n25:57.000 --> 25:58.000\nUh-huh.\n\n25:58.000 --> 26:01.000\nA human wouldn't have to say three or eight.\n\n26:01.000 --> 26:04.000\nA human could use all their human faces and behaviors\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:09.000\nto indicate the vibe.\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.000\nSo like, if a person was just like...\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.000\nYou know, like, if you were just like...\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:17.000\nYou know, like, you...\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\nIt's clearly a two.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:22.000\nTo you, that might mean an extreme result.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:23.000\nWell...\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:24.000\nYeah.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:26.000\nIsn't a result of a dice a number?\n\n26:26.000 --> 26:27.000\nOh, okay.\n\n26:27.000 --> 26:28.000\nI got it.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:29.000\nI got it.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:30.000\nNo, if it's a human die...\n\n26:30.000 --> 26:32.000\nYou gotta say the number, the dice...\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:34.000\nOkay, so you gotta say how many sides are on the die.\n\n26:34.000 --> 26:36.000\nSo, like, if you say this is a 20-sided die,\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:39.000\nthen it's like, oh, is that a 17 out of 20?\n\n26:39.000 --> 26:40.000\nOr is that, like, you know...\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:41.000\nIt's gotta be like that.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:42.000\nNo, why wouldn't they just say seven?\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:44.000\nThey would just say a number, then.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:46.000\nBecause it's like, what are you trying to roll?\n\n26:46.000 --> 26:48.000\nAre you trying to roll a very high roll of a six-sided die?\n\n26:48.000 --> 26:49.000\nI'm getting the iron rolling.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:50.000\nAre you trying to get a...\n\n26:50.000 --> 26:52.000\nI'm saying that the person's...\n\n26:52.000 --> 26:54.000\nI think it's more like a drill.\n\n26:54.000 --> 26:55.000\nUh-huh.\n\n26:55.000 --> 27:00.000\nBecause he's rolling and becoming a symbol for something\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:03.000\nrather than a number quantifying something,\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:06.000\nand he wants you to interpret it as the next action\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:08.000\nand how successful it is based on the emotion\n\n27:08.000 --> 27:10.000\nyou're getting from his action.\n\n27:10.000 --> 27:15.000\nI told you...\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.000\nI told you these are gods!\n\n27:17.000 --> 27:18.000\nOkay, so Jimmy...\n\n27:18.000 --> 27:20.000\nOkay, so I was climbing the tree.\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:22.000\nWell, why don't you guys be the adventurers?\n\n27:22.000 --> 27:24.000\nI'm obviously... I'll be the die.\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.000\nOkay.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:29.000\nBut it's like...\n\n27:29.000 --> 27:30.000\nAnd don't be distracted by the fact that\n\n27:30.000 --> 27:32.000\nI'm just gonna, like, feel the vibe.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.000\nOkay, no.\n\n27:33.000 --> 27:35.000\nLike, another thing about a die is that it's like\n\n27:35.000 --> 27:37.000\nthis punctuated thing where it's like,\n\n27:37.000 --> 27:39.000\noh, now we roll it, now we get a number.\n\n27:39.000 --> 27:42.000\nNo, I'm over here, I'm not part of your narrative,\n\n27:42.000 --> 27:44.000\nbut Spencer's got one eye on me mentally,\n\n27:44.000 --> 27:47.000\nand I'm just sort of, like, feeling things.\n\n27:47.000 --> 27:48.000\nOkay.\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:50.000\nAnd I'm just sort of like...\n\n27:50.000 --> 27:52.000\nHow do we quantify a roll, then?\n\n27:52.000 --> 27:55.000\nIt sounds like you're in a continuous rolling.\n\n27:55.000 --> 27:57.000\nYou're not quantifying.\n\n27:57.000 --> 28:00.000\nSo I look at you, I just take a snapshot\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:04.000\nand go, this frame of Dan's existence...\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:05.000\nYeah, I would say that's accurate.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.000\nWell, then when do I decide when I should throw to you?\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.000\nLike...\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:10.000\nThat's your own decision.\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:11.000\nWell, that's...\n\n28:11.000 --> 28:13.000\nIt's like taking a cup and dipping it in a river.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.000\nLike...\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.000\nLike, the river, it could be, you know,\n\n28:17.000 --> 28:19.000\nso, like, when do you do it and how big's the cup?\n\n28:19.000 --> 28:20.000\nAnd it's like, it's up to you.\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:23.000\nIt's like, that's what dice are supposed to...\n\n28:23.000 --> 28:27.000\nI thought I would be the most on board for this.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:33.000\nI feel like you are crafting a new paradigm.\n\n28:33.000 --> 28:34.000\nI'm already doing it.\n\n28:34.000 --> 28:35.000\nOh, I'm not.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:36.000\nHe's crafted it.\n\n28:36.000 --> 28:37.000\nNo, no, but you're a big part of it.\n\n28:37.000 --> 28:39.000\nI mean, I really think we're sitting on a gold mine.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.000\nI'm already doing it.\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:42.000\nNo, this is great.\n\n28:42.000 --> 28:44.000\nI'm already doing it.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.000\nWe have to go on the adventure.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.000\nRight, we're on a journey.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:53.000\nAnd I would like to be Gwynethor, the Gollum Fairy Princess.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:56.000\nOkay, can I still be the manager, the ghost manager?\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.000\nOkay.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:02.000\nGwynethor?\n\n29:02.000 --> 29:03.000\nYeah, Gwynethor.\n\n29:03.000 --> 29:05.000\nGwynethor and ghost manager!\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:07.000\nYou find yourself in Bristle Bees,\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.000\nthe merry town of bristles and bees.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.000\nAround you, you see bristles and bees\n\n29:15.000 --> 29:19.000\nwinding their merry ways through the city of Bristle Bees.\n\n29:19.000 --> 29:20.000\nI don't know what it's called anymore.\n\n29:20.000 --> 29:22.000\nBristled Bees.\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:32.000\nAt your feet, you can see the tiny dwellings of the bees\n\n29:32.000 --> 29:35.000\nand the slightly larger dwellings of the bristles.\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:41.000\nWe must be careful where we stop.\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:45.000\nOkay, we will walk very gently.\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:57.000\nOw! Ow! You got me!\n\n30:03.000 --> 30:05.000\nYou don't step on any more bees\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:08.000\nthan those ones that just earlier made noise.\n\n30:08.000 --> 30:13.000\nYou find yourself to what seems like the town hall of Bristle Bees.\n\n30:13.000 --> 30:16.000\nNo repercussions for killing townspeople.\n\n30:16.000 --> 30:17.000\nYes.\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.000\nThere is the tiny town hall there.\n\n30:21.000 --> 30:22.000\nLet's go in.\n\n30:22.000 --> 30:23.000\nYes.\n\n30:23.000 --> 30:26.000\nYou open the door and out comes the mayor.\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:27.000\nHe's a little bee.\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:28.000\nHe's got a...\n\n30:28.000 --> 30:30.000\nHe looks like the Honey Nut Cheerios bee,\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:31.000\nbut like with a mustache.\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:39.000\nWelcome to our town.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:43.000\nGo be the guy. You don't have to stand back there.\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:45.000\nYou want this, Mike?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nThanks so much.\n\n30:48.000 --> 30:49.000\nHello, little bee.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\nWelcome to our town.\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:54.000\nI am Gwynethor, the Gollum Princess,\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.000\nand this is my manager.\n\n30:59.000 --> 31:02.000\nWe have waited for your arrival.\n\n31:02.000 --> 31:04.000\nWe've heard so much about you.\n\n31:04.000 --> 31:07.000\nWelcome to Bristle Bees.\n\n31:07.000 --> 31:11.000\nYou've killed about a thousand of our residents.\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\nSorry about that.\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:16.000\nIt's okay. We're just happy to see you.\n\n31:17.000 --> 31:20.000\nWe realized as soon as we came to town\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:24.000\nthat nothing random really happens here ever, does it?\n\n31:24.000 --> 31:25.000\nNope.\n\n31:26.000 --> 31:28.000\nMonday looks like Friday.\n\n31:28.000 --> 31:30.000\nFriday looks like Saturday.\n\n31:30.000 --> 31:31.000\nYou get it.\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:34.000\nYou smell the smell of sweet lemons.\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:37.000\nIt's weird because lemons smell sour usually.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.000\nAnd at the same time,\n\n31:39.000 --> 31:42.000\nyou feel everything expanding and growing,\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:44.000\nincluding yourselves and the buildings around you.\n\n31:44.000 --> 31:47.000\nOh, my God, the scale remains.\n\n31:48.000 --> 31:50.000\nIt looks about the same\n\n31:50.000 --> 31:52.000\nbecause everything grows at roughly the same size,\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.000\nbut you're clearly larger than you were.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.000\nSo I'd be about this tall.\n\n31:58.000 --> 31:59.000\nNo, you grow more.\n\n31:59.000 --> 32:02.000\nYou grow more as a weird occurrence.\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:03.000\nGreat.\n\n32:03.000 --> 32:04.000\nYeah.\n\n32:05.000 --> 32:08.000\nAllow me to show you around our beautiful town.\n\n32:08.000 --> 32:09.000\nThat would be great.\n\n32:09.000 --> 32:11.000\nThat's the library.\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:12.000\nOh.\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.000\nThat's the other library.\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:25.000\nI'm not sure how I feel about it yet.\n\n32:27.000 --> 32:29.000\nYou feel conflicted.\n\n32:29.000 --> 32:30.000\nCome.\n\n32:30.000 --> 32:32.000\nWhich library should I go to?\n\n32:32.000 --> 32:33.000\nI'll go to the...\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.000\nNo!\n\n32:34.000 --> 32:35.000\nI'll go to...\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:36.000\nNo!\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.000\nI'll go to this one.\n\n32:37.000 --> 32:38.000\nNo!\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:39.000\nI'll go to this one.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:40.000\nNo!\n\n32:40.000 --> 32:43.000\nWell, that library is boring.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:45.000\nThis library contains books\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:49.000\nthat will lead you into the arms of our...\n\n32:49.000 --> 32:51.000\nmascot?\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:53.000\nOh, the Tai Chi mascot over there?\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.000\nThe Tai Chi master!\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:58.000\nOr maybe...\n\n32:58.000 --> 33:00.000\nI think he wants to be left alone.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:01.000\nYes.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:03.000\nHe bates to be misnamed.\n\n33:03.000 --> 33:05.000\nHe's been doing things all by himself\n\n33:05.000 --> 33:06.000\nwithout anyone talking to him\n\n33:06.000 --> 33:08.000\nor acknowledging his existence.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.000\nLet's see.\n\n33:09.000 --> 33:12.000\nYou guys are being literal and you're...\n\n33:14.000 --> 33:18.000\nMaybe you'd like to meet the soul of our town.\n\n33:18.000 --> 33:19.000\nNo, no.\n\n33:19.000 --> 33:21.000\nI think he's meant to be separate from us.\n\n33:21.000 --> 33:22.000\nYes.\n\n33:22.000 --> 33:24.000\nHe's not part of the narrative.\n\n33:24.000 --> 33:25.000\nOkay, Spencer, I'll do...\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:26.000\nI'll do...\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:27.000\nYou do my part.\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.000\nI'll do your part.\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:29.000\nWell, okay.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:30.000\nLet's trade.\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:31.000\nOkay.\n\n33:36.000 --> 33:37.000\nOkay.\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:39.000\nI'm not saying I'm going to do better.\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:40.000\nI'm just saying, like, obviously,\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:42.000\nI owe it to people to demonstrate what I mean.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:45.000\nIt's like, like, you guys, don't worry about him.\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.000\nYou're just people.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:49.000\nYou exist in your own narrative.\n\n33:49.000 --> 33:51.000\nDon't worry about him.\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:53.000\nThat's fucked up.\n\n33:53.000 --> 33:55.000\nI'll worry about him.\n\n33:55.000 --> 33:57.000\nSorry we let you down, Dan.\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.000\nSpencer, where are they?\n\n33:58.000 --> 33:59.000\nThey're in a tree trunk?\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.000\nWhere are they?\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.000\nDan, we were really feeling sorry for you.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:03.000\nYeah, we did.\n\n34:03.000 --> 34:04.000\nYeah, man.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.000\nWe're trying to execute your fucking vision.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:10.000\nWe were feeling bad for you, Dan.\n\n34:10.000 --> 34:11.000\nNo, don't feel sorry for me.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.000\nNo, you were out there all alone\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:15.000\nand looked kind of ridiculous and...\n\n34:15.000 --> 34:18.000\nIt didn't seem like you were generating anything\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:20.000\nand inspiring any new directions.\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:21.000\nAre you guys trying to...\n\n34:21.000 --> 34:22.000\nWe want to please you, Dan.\n\n34:22.000 --> 34:23.000\nYou're trying to construct\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:25.000\na meta-improved narrative.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.000\nNo, that was...\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:28.000\nNo, that was your idea, Dan.\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.000\nWe were just trying to support it.\n\n34:30.000 --> 34:33.000\nYou give gifts with all these crazy body movements.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.000\nYou showin' your body and everything.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:39.000\nAnd we wanted to accept those gifts and heighten.\n\n34:39.000 --> 34:40.000\nAnd right now we're playing a game\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.000\nwhere the scene has broken down\n\n34:41.000 --> 34:43.000\nand we are playing our personas.\n\n34:43.000 --> 34:44.000\nYeah.\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.000\nWell, what if my character decides\n\n34:48.000 --> 34:50.000\nthat because you're disappointing me,\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:52.000\nI will go back in time?\n\n34:52.000 --> 34:57.000\nWell, why don't we see what that would look like?\n\n34:57.000 --> 34:58.000\nCut to.\n\n34:59.000 --> 35:01.000\nA great Chicago phrase.\n\n35:01.000 --> 35:02.000\nCut to.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:07.000\nSh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh…\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:10.000\n...sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh…\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.000\nAll right.\n\n35:13.000 --> 35:17.000\nYou guys are adventuring\n\n35:17.000 --> 35:22.000\nare adventuring in a big field.\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:27.000\nYou're a fighter and a wizard.\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.000\nI'm a fighter, great.\n\n35:29.000 --> 35:33.000\nJimmy Carrain, you are Jimmy Carrainus, the great fighter.\n\n35:33.000 --> 35:35.000\nYes, I'm Jimmy Carrain, the great fighteress.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:40.000\nYou have a plate armor and a hat and a sword.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:45.000\nScott adds that you are at Sortarus,\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:52.000\nthe wizard of Suckedicula.\n\n35:52.000 --> 36:02.000\nYou love magic, but you don't mind Suckin' Nick.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:12.000\nYou got a bag of tricks that includes Suckin' Nick and some spells.\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:16.000\nAnd you guys are on a field in a field, a great field,\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:23.000\noverlooking a town and you're on a quest to find a gold ring\n\n36:23.000 --> 36:30.000\nthat you heard might exist.\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:31.000\nPretty original.\n\n36:31.000 --> 36:34.000\nBut there's some goblins.\n\n36:34.000 --> 36:41.000\nThere's some goblins coming.\n\n36:41.000 --> 36:43.000\nIt's so easy.\n\n36:43.000 --> 36:45.000\nThere's goblins coming.\n\n36:45.000 --> 36:51.000\nAnd I'm basing that on his movement, but he's not the goblins.\n\n36:51.000 --> 36:53.000\nYou understand?\n\n36:53.000 --> 36:56.000\nWhy would we waste all that good movement, though?\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:59.000\nBut I'm looking at his movement, but it's not...\n\n36:59.000 --> 37:02.000\nGod damn it, it's not that hard.\n\n37:02.000 --> 37:04.000\nDon't acknowledge the dice.\n\n37:04.000 --> 37:06.000\nGoblins are coming.\n\n37:06.000 --> 37:08.000\nJust don't acknowledge the dice.\n\n37:08.000 --> 37:12.000\nThe goblins are shooting at you.\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:16.000\nYou got hit real bad, Jimmy.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:19.000\nYou got hit in the arm with an arrow.\n\n37:19.000 --> 37:22.000\nOh, Zephyr wins.\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:26.000\nBlow some cock.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.000\nYou're waving your arms in a magical manner.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:32.000\nYou try to cast a healing spell on Jimmy Crane's character.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:34.000\nAnd it's doing okay.\n\n37:34.000 --> 37:36.000\nIt's doing fine.\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:38.000\nWow, not nearly as good as the dick.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.000\nDon't use it for about three weeks.\n\n37:40.000 --> 37:43.000\nIt's feeling a little sore, but it's feeling a little better.\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:46.000\nI don't have to suck your dick, do I, for that?\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:52.000\nYou don't have to, but I would really appreciate it.\n\n37:52.000 --> 37:55.000\nMore arrows are raining down in you.\n\n37:55.000 --> 38:00.000\nBut they're missing, generally, because the goblins are far away.\n\n38:00.000 --> 38:02.000\nThey're just taking potshots at you.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:05.000\nMaybe there's a way we can stop the goblins.\n\n38:05.000 --> 38:08.000\nOkay, I've got a sword. I forgot.\n\n38:08.000 --> 38:10.000\nOh, the goblins aren't the move.\n\n38:10.000 --> 38:12.000\nI was trying to slay the goblin.\n\n38:12.000 --> 38:16.000\nAlright, I'm going to try a multiplying spell on your sword\n\n38:16.000 --> 38:19.000\nand throw one sword that will land as a hundred.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:24.000\nYour multiplying spell fails.\n\n38:24.000 --> 38:26.000\nHere it goes.\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.000\nI'm sorry, I was distracted.\n\n38:28.000 --> 38:29.000\nI was looking at your dick.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.000\nYour sword flies off into the grass.\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:34.000\nThe goblins are laughing at you.\n\n38:34.000 --> 38:35.000\nThat's not the goblins.\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.000\nThey're continuing to march towards you.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:40.000\nWe've got to stop them somehow or get out of here.\n\n38:40.000 --> 38:42.000\nJimmy, you still...\n\n38:42.000 --> 38:45.000\nNo, you don't, okay.\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:47.000\nYou're wearing armor. Why don't you just go fight them for us?\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:49.000\nThat's a great idea.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:54.000\nIf I don't come back, I love you.\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:57.000\nNo.\n\n38:57.000 --> 39:00.000\nThat's an incentive if I come back.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:06.000\nJimmy proceeds across the great plains of Dixiculine.\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:11.000\nOh, the goblins are terrified of something.\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.000\nThey're summoning healing powers to buff themselves,\n\n39:15.000 --> 39:17.000\nto give themselves higher armor.\n\n39:17.000 --> 39:21.000\nAs you get towards them, you see them starting to glow bright red,\n\n39:21.000 --> 39:24.000\nindicating that it's going to be harder to hit them.\n\n39:24.000 --> 39:27.000\nUse the strategy I used at Offaldor.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.000\nAlright.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:31.000\nGo for their penises.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:35.000\nThe goblins attack. You attack.\n\n39:35.000 --> 39:38.000\nYour attacks are not doing good.\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:42.000\nAlright.\n\n39:42.000 --> 39:44.000\nThe goblins are now...\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:45.000\nThey return to attack.\n\n39:45.000 --> 39:46.000\nThey're doing real good.\n\n39:46.000 --> 39:48.000\nThey're real excited.\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:53.000\nAnd their arrows are piercing you for...\n\n39:53.000 --> 39:54.000\nI'm down.\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:56.000\nI've been hit by an arrow.\n\n39:56.000 --> 40:00.000\nI'm going to approach a goblin and try to get it to surrender through pleasure.\n\n40:00.000 --> 40:05.000\nOkay.\n\n40:05.000 --> 40:08.000\nThe goblins are considering your offer.\n\n40:08.000 --> 40:11.000\nIs it working?\n\n40:11.000 --> 40:13.000\nI think it's working.\n\n40:13.000 --> 40:16.000\nThey seem into it.\n\n40:16.000 --> 40:19.000\nThe goblins are down.\n\n40:19.000 --> 40:22.000\nKeep going. I see the ring.\n\n40:22.000 --> 40:24.000\nI see the ring.\n\n40:24.000 --> 40:25.000\nIt's attached to what I'm using.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:27.000\nThe goblins have an offer for you.\n\n40:27.000 --> 40:29.000\nThey say if you continue to pleasure them,\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:36.000\nthat they'll spare your lives.\n\n40:36.000 --> 40:41.000\nOne by one, the goblins' chodes go down your throat,\n\n40:41.000 --> 40:46.000\nfilling you with the goblin's seed.\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:47.000\nNo.\n\n40:47.000 --> 40:48.000\nI'm pregnant.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:49.000\nNo.\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:51.000\nThey're different than us.\n\n40:51.000 --> 40:53.000\nOh my God.\n\n40:53.000 --> 40:55.000\nI'm giving birth through my urethra.\n\n40:55.000 --> 40:57.000\nAll right.

we, midwesterners,\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:42.000\nwe like to bring something to the host of the party.\n\n42:42.000 --> 42:43.000\nAll right.\n\n42:43.000 --> 42:47.000\nWell, I appreciate the gesture.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:48.000\nThank you.\n\n42:48.000 --> 42:50.000\nDid that improv exhaust you, Dan?\n\n42:50.000 --> 42:51.000\nNo, no.\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.000\nI'm just, I'm moving on.\n\n42:52.000 --> 42:53.000\nOkay.\n\n42:53.000 --> 42:54.000\nYou know, it's like.\n\n42:54.000 --> 42:56.000\nKing of the segue.\n\n42:56.000 --> 42:58.000\nSo what, so what do we know about?\n\n42:58.000 --> 43:03.000\nSo, so as improvisers, like we, we, we, we, we make things up.\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:04.000\nWe go, okay.\n\n43:04.000 --> 43:09.000\nSo God is in the moment and everything that happened before\n\n43:09.000 --> 43:11.000\nand everything that's about to happen.\n\n43:11.000 --> 43:12.000\nThat's the devil.\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:13.000\nHe's going to fuck you up.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.000\nGod is in the moment.\n\n43:15.000 --> 43:16.000\nYou guys are following me, right?\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:17.000\nTotally.\n\n43:17.000 --> 43:18.000\nJust like the last exercise.\n\n43:18.000 --> 43:19.000\nRight.\n\n43:19.000 --> 43:25.000\nSo in politics, like we have this right versus left paradigm.\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.000\nSo we can recognize Republicans, for instance,\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:28.000\nas being very out of the moment.\n\n43:28.000 --> 43:30.000\nThey're worried about what happened yesterday\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.000\nand what's about to happen.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:33.000\nDemocrats, are they really in the moment\n\n43:33.000 --> 43:35.000\nor are they just a mirror image of Republicans\n\n43:35.000 --> 43:37.000\nimprovisationally speaking?\n\n43:37.000 --> 43:38.000\nThey're not.\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:41.000\nThey're not really making it up as they go\n\n43:41.000 --> 43:43.000\nbecause they're politicians.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:46.000\nSo don't we just need a revolution where everybody\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.000\njust like rips off their clothes and runs in the street\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:49.000\nand goes like, well, make it up.\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:50.000\nMake it up as you go.\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.000\nBut here's, and before you answer that.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:53.000\nOkay.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:57.000\nAre, aren't we doomed as a society?\n\n43:57.000 --> 44:02.000\nBecause like, don't, it hasn't the height of what we've been\n\n44:02.000 --> 44:06.000\nable to adopt democracy and, and, and doesn't that by default\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:11.000\nmean mob rule and aren't, isn't, aren't most people stupid?\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:15.000\nAnd, and, and then like, so if you're smart and you're liberal,\n\n44:15.000 --> 44:18.000\nthen don't you have to either choose between consorting\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:21.000\nwith a bunch of morons who are like, yay, be liberal.\n\n44:21.000 --> 44:24.000\nAnd you're like, yeah, but you're dumb.\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:27.000\nAnd that's like kind of the, I see like there's a division\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:29.000\namong the Democrats between like the, you know,\n\n44:29.000 --> 44:31.000\nI don't want to put too fine a point on it,\n\n44:31.000 --> 44:33.000\nbut you get your Bernie, your Bernie people\n\n44:33.000 --> 44:36.000\nand your, and your, and your traditional Democrats and stuff.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:39.000\nBut there's like a real heavy division between folks\n\n44:39.000 --> 44:42.000\nbecause they're like, yeah, we don't want fucking more corruption\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.000\nand all this stuff and then it's like, like, yeah,\n\n44:45.000 --> 44:47.000\nbut if you don't, it's fucking, yeah,\n\n44:47.000 --> 44:49.000\ndon't even get excited sir.\n\n44:49.000 --> 44:53.000\nI always, I just feel like this is like wedge.\n\n44:53.000 --> 44:56.000\nIt's like right now it's like so fun watching the bad guys\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:59.000\nbe in power and watching them kind of fumble over themselves.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:02.000\nBut then you feel this dark cloud in the horizon where it's like,\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:04.000\nwe're supposed to, the next move is we're supposed\n\n45:04.000 --> 45:06.000\nto all agree on something and do something together\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:08.000\nand we can't get our shit together.\n\n45:08.000 --> 45:12.660\nWe're gonna start like arguing with each other really soon. We're already doing it. What was my point like?\n\n45:13.980 --> 45:15.980\nHow do we isn't there a way to like?\n\n45:18.740 --> 45:23.860\nWhat are we gonna do why shouldn't I just kill myself nobody's stopping you\n\n45:27.580 --> 45:33.700\nOnly you are stopping you Dan if you did kill yourself, right? Well, how would you do it?\n\n45:33.700 --> 45:35.700\nI\n\n45:35.900 --> 45:38.220\nMean I wouldn't be in front of a large crowd. Yeah\n\n45:40.420 --> 45:45.540\nAt like a comedy festival I do a major podcast and keep talking about how I hadn't gotten my gun yet\n\n45:45.940 --> 45:48.840\nAnd then I'd announced that I had gotten my gun\n\n45:49.820 --> 45:52.820\nAnd I'd pick a I'd pick an obscure town\n\n45:53.140 --> 45:58.380\nOkay, give me an example hard work in town, but I'd maximize the number of people okay blue state red\n\n45:58.380 --> 46:03.580\nWant to push like a thousand people okay somewhere around my hometown, okay, and then I just pull out a gun\n\n46:03.580 --> 46:06.420\nJust blow my brains out on it. No, I I\n\n46:07.900 --> 46:13.860\nDo feel I do feel like I'm a gun I like I'm a I blow my brains out. I think okay now\n\n46:18.260 --> 46:22.540\nBecause I feel like pills like if you took like a bottle of Tylenol you'd be like I\n\n46:23.220 --> 46:25.420\nFeel like you'd be like ow my kidney\n\n46:25.420 --> 46:31.060\nAnd then you'd be like I got my kidney hurts. I changed my mind. I changed my mind\n\n46:31.060 --> 46:36.780\nI don't killing myself hurts and then you'd be like yeah, but your kidneys are shut down.

I never had to be hungry\n\n50:07.700 --> 50:09.700\nLike I wasn't a black woman\n\n50:10.900 --> 50:13.540\nBut yeah, can I just stop right now? I'm getting the sense\n\n50:15.860 --> 50:17.860\nSome of the best lives on the planet\n\n50:17.860 --> 50:23.700\nI just remind you Beyonce is kicking it right about now. Well, I wasn't Beyonce is obvious\n\n50:23.700 --> 50:28.180\nI think that's the unspoken part of this.

Even in my suicide note. I'm I'm persecuted. Well, no, but\n\n50:40.900 --> 50:42.900\nIf I read that\n\n50:43.380 --> 50:48.100\nI can't get a break. No, no, no, no. No, no, I want to help you. I mean, it's funny how\n\n50:48.500 --> 50:53.700\nYou know, the improvisers are helping the writer, but uh as as I was going through the note\n\n50:53.700 --> 50:57.860\nI'm like that guy would never commit suicide. It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself out of it. Yes\n\n50:57.860 --> 51:02.260\nI was never in a war. I had a good life. Right. Yeah, right. No, you're right\n\n51:02.260 --> 51:04.260\nAnd I have no plans to kill myself by the way\n\n51:05.460 --> 51:07.460\nYou sure?\n\n51:08.900 --> 51:10.900\nI mean you brought it all\n\n51:13.540 --> 51:15.540\nThis is what friends do we help out\n\n51:15.780 --> 51:18.900\nSo how does the note go from there? You say a bunch of positive things about your wife. Yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n51:18.900 --> 51:22.020\nIt's got a turn. I say I say everybody you're off the hook, please\n\n51:22.020 --> 51:27.140\nI'm so sorry for the mess like I wish that I could have just jumped into a vaporizer or a sarlacc pit\n\n51:27.140 --> 51:32.820\nI'm so sorry like if you're for those of you who found it and all this stuff. I'm so sorry and then I'd say\n\n51:33.540 --> 51:37.540\nyou know, I think our species is plagued with a\n\n51:38.340 --> 51:46.180\nnotion that we are not good enough and I think it provokes us to do things that hurt ourselves in each other\n\n51:46.820 --> 51:50.340\nAnd I think that once you get to the spot that I'm in go ahead\n\n51:50.340 --> 51:55.140\nI think you got to personalize you can't speak of the whole world. You know, I already said my personal shit\n\n51:55.140 --> 51:58.980\nI thought you said you have a great life, but the world sucks. So I'm going to kill myself\n\n52:00.020 --> 52:04.980\nEverybody else is acting like human beings. Well, yeah, I'm not going to wait for my life to I yeah\n\n52:04.980 --> 52:06.980\nIf I wait for my life to suck. I'll never kill myself\n\n52:14.180 --> 52:17.940\nSo you want to go out on a high like the carol brunette show. Yeah, like I well, I mean like\n\n52:18.580 --> 52:21.540\nIt's it's it's no big trick to have a comfortable life\n\n52:21.540 --> 52:26.180\nIt is for some. Yeah, that's why I want to kill myself\n\n52:26.740 --> 52:30.820\nSo you feel responsibility for the people who are not as successful as you. Yeah, it's hard\n\n52:31.060 --> 52:34.020\nLike they're not as lucky, but it's not reading in your note right now\n\n52:35.540 --> 52:40.740\nI'm not getting that. Are you Scott? Well, I'm just curious you have regret for being successful. Yeah. Yes. Yes\n\n52:40.900 --> 52:42.900\nOkay, you can stop that right now\n\n52:43.140 --> 52:47.540\nWait, but well instead of the suicide I just give all my money away and then wander around the street\n\n52:47.540 --> 52:50.900\nOh, yeah, you can you can stop being successful anytime you want\n\n52:51.220 --> 52:56.100\nBut you want to work hard and be successful and get praised and have a thousand people cheer you. No, I don't\n\n52:59.780 --> 53:04.820\nThat sounded like about 500 people that was really about 200. Well, yeah\n\n53:07.220 --> 53:12.500\nA percentage of a thousand people cheer you in their defense 500 of them want to kill themselves so\n\n53:14.260 --> 53:16.260\nLook at you clap.

You're a comedian. You want to save the world tell funny your jokes, right?\n\n54:45.540 --> 54:51.620\nYou delight people, right? But you think people are unhappy and your job your delight is to delight them\n\n54:52.260 --> 54:54.260\nSo you're making the world better\n\n54:54.580 --> 54:56.580\nThe world you're complaining about\n\n54:56.660 --> 54:59.220\nYou're fixing and so then you take yourself out of it\n\n55:00.020 --> 55:07.380\nYeah, but what about all the people that say don't you should go back to work writing cartoons instead of talking about how\n\n55:07.380 --> 55:14.340\nDumb the president is and then you're like, well, I don't want to write. What am I supposed to write a cartoon about 13 years old?\n\n55:21.940 --> 55:23.940\nNot physically\n\n55:27.220 --> 55:32.100\nBut wait, how did we get it? I never said when did I you said the world is unhappy so I'm gonna kill myself\n\n55:32.100 --> 55:34.100\nI guess I maybe technically said that\n\n55:34.100 --> 55:39.380\nYou have an existential crisis. Yeah, but you're intelligent enough to think past an existential crisis\n\n55:39.380 --> 55:42.420\nI guess it's that's what it is is that we are at a point in\n\n55:42.980 --> 55:44.980\nPolitically like we've gotten to a point like\n\n55:45.460 --> 55:50.420\nLike it was easy in the bush years and the all the shit with the dangling chads and all that crap\n\n55:50.740 --> 55:55.700\nIt was very easy to just be like a Han Solo and be like, I don't have no love for the empire\n\n55:55.780 --> 55:58.180\nBut I love this fucking smuggle\n\n55:58.740 --> 56:00.420\num\n\n56:00.420 --> 56:04.340\nIt as of the election it was like, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n56:04.500 --> 56:11.300\nYou're either in favor of the mass enslavement of all humanity and absolute fucking apocalypse\n\n56:11.380 --> 56:17.460\nOr you're part of some rebellion that has to spend its life like flying and x-wings and doing like horrible\n\n56:18.020 --> 56:20.020\nruns and stuff and it's like\n\n56:20.740 --> 56:27.140\nWoe be to the to the rich white lazy piece of shit, you know, like you're just like, well, where am I supposed to fit in?\n\n56:27.140 --> 56:31.460\nI don't want to earn my bread and butter. I don't I don't want to find out what I'm made of. It's just a\n\n56:32.020 --> 56:34.260\nDrag I'd rather be a martyr and just be dead\n\n56:35.300 --> 56:38.340\nLike that's what it is. Like I don't want to you know, I don't have it if you take your own life\n\n56:38.820 --> 56:42.500\nYou have to someone take your life. I could make it look like an accident\n\n56:44.180 --> 56:46.180\nAll right, how would that look?\n\n56:46.420 --> 56:52.020\nHow would you do it? I could I could I could have some friends over and I could have like a roller skate party\n\n56:53.860 --> 56:55.860\nAnd I could rent a five-story\n\n56:55.860 --> 57:02.900\nThree tower, okay, and I have a roller skate party. You're gonna just get really drunk and come on. All right. We're no\n\n57:02.900 --> 57:04.980\nWe were getting somewhere. I liked what we were doing, but\n\n57:06.180 --> 57:14.020\nYou know, I'm not you're right. What you're saying is that I'm a fat white straight. I never said fat or straight\n\n57:16.660 --> 57:18.660\nI'm pretty sure that was me\n\n57:19.780 --> 57:21.780\nYou're saying that my responsibility\n\n57:21.780 --> 57:27.380\nIt's it's like moving forward. You have to live in the fucking apocalypse. You can't dramaticize it so much\n\n57:27.860 --> 57:32.260\nThat you can avoid living in it. You actually have to be a character in it. You have to let go\n\n57:32.580 --> 57:37.540\nOkay, so this is the way the world is. It's not normal. It's not good, but I'm in it. You can't be\n\n57:38.580 --> 57:41.380\nThere's there's it's no country for old narcissists\n\n57:41.380 --> 57:50.180\nAnd it's it's what women and black people do every fucking day\n\n57:52.180 --> 57:54.580\nI don't believe there's that many women and black people out there\n\n57:55.940 --> 58:00.580\nSome of you are trying to get on a gravy train. What was the point you were trying to make to dan?\n\n58:02.260 --> 58:04.020\nWhen\n\n58:04.020 --> 58:09.620\nWhen you were saying to him about okay, you're you know, you you do comedy you make people's lives better\n\n58:09.620 --> 58:15.620\nYeah, well, he was he was saying that the world is unhappy and he's one of the reasons some of us aren't\n\n58:16.500 --> 58:19.940\nA part of it anyway. I don't know. Yeah. Well, no, it was it was just like\n\n58:20.580 --> 58:24.660\nI think it's like it's defeatism. That's what we're that's what we ended up addressing\n\n58:24.740 --> 58:28.260\nIt's like a lot of people out there probably feel that way like you wake up in the morning\n\n58:28.340 --> 58:33.220\nYou're like, holy fuck. How could it be so bad? Like like and and how come I can't do anything about it\n\n58:33.220 --> 58:39.220\nYou can and then and then you if you react to that with like, oh fuck. I'm gonna like just you know\n\n58:40.020 --> 58:42.020\nGive up or go cynical\n\n58:42.180 --> 58:46.900\nYou know, that's because you're like well the alternative is you have to like do shit that's like uncomfortable\n\n58:46.900 --> 58:49.460\nYou're gonna strain your back, but at least enjoy being\n\n58:50.180 --> 58:54.420\nCynical about everything you can enjoy that. Yeah, it was easier before\n\n58:55.140 --> 58:58.420\nTo be cynical you can't be cynical now. It's harder to be cynical now\n\n58:58.420 --> 59:03.380\nWhat happens if you I'm still cynical if you're cynical now, then you're like one of these like\n\n59:04.020 --> 59:07.460\nLibertarian people that's like this an ass burger trump voter\n\n59:08.900 --> 59:15.540\nYou're like one of these silicon valley people that's like meat moop logic says no hillary because her emails like it's like\n\n59:16.740 --> 59:19.380\nI'm not I don't want I'm not gonna be one of those people\n\n59:19.460 --> 59:24.420\nI'm not gonna be like meat moop logic says be a fucking nazi like I'm not doing it\n\n59:24.420 --> 59:30.260\nYou could be a shindler. You could use your ring to buy a shindler. I would like to be a shindler.
