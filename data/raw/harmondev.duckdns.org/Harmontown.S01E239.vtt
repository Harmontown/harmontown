WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh, shit. Chicago makes the fucking noise!

00:20.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah, this session of Harlington is about to begin. First, let me bring out the wonderful Spencer Crittenden. You can be louder than that.

00:35.000 --> 00:50.000
Yeah! Tonight in the room of Jeff Davis, who we love so much, my name is Brandon Johnson and I will be your controller.

00:50.000 --> 01:03.000
And with no further ado, let me bring out the mayor of Harlington, Dan Harmon!

01:03.000 --> 01:24.000
Brandon Johnson! Thank you, Chicago! God bless you! God bless this fucking wonderful industrial Midwestern deprived, depressed city!

01:24.000 --> 01:36.000
God bless the alcohol coursing through your arteries for generations that you can't even control. You Midwestern visit golfs.

01:36.000 --> 01:46.000
You are my people. I grew up 90 minutes from you. I'm afraid to go back to my hometown so this is as close as we'll ever get.

01:46.000 --> 01:56.000
I don't know how they'd react to me if I went back to Milwaukee. I'm still scared. When I left, they said, you'll be back. That's not a good goodbye.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
That's not something you say to people you love. I don't care how proud you are of your hometown. You don't say you'll be back when someone says goodbye.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
They didn't say that to Frodo. They said, I hope you save the world from Sauron.

02:09.000 --> 02:25.000
Why are you looking at me when you say that? That's fucked up. The man who grew up in California but looks more at home here than anyone.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
Oh yeah. I was walking around and I was like, I'm the most comfortable person in the city right now.

02:31.000 --> 02:44.000
Still rocking the cargo shorts today. The weather was fine today for a nice stroll. It gets fucking cold in this area of the country.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
There is an oppressive spiritual thing that no one talks about. The idea that when you look up at the sky, you don't see God.

02:53.000 --> 03:06.000
The way that you do in an equatorial climate, you see blue and yellow and you feel like God's up there and he's somehow in charge of what happens to you.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
It might be a good thing. It might be a bad thing. You might be part of some agricultural community where they play lacrosse and the winner loses their head.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
You do see guys named Jesus but they're usually pissing outside.

03:18.000 --> 03:32.000
But when you're in the Midwest, it's like, I've said it a thousand times, you're descended from the genes of people who, like, they're descended from Plymouth Rock, either landed on them or they landed on it.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
They didn't cross the border. The border crossed them.

03:35.000 --> 03:49.000
In any case, they headed west, their wagon broke down, admit it, and then they were like, fuck it. But that's not a non-heroic thing to say because guess what?

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, what's waiting for you at the Pacific Ocean? We just got out there, we. I'm a Milwaukeean.

03:56.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm just saying, the people on the west coast, those are just the people that got that far and then they're like, we have no more dreams to chase, let's invent television.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
The Midwest is the gene pool that was like, you know what? What if it was just cold? What if God tried to kill you?

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
What if nine months of the year, God was unapologetic about his desire for you to die?

04:21.000 --> 04:33.000
What if everything you ate just tried to poison you? What if every time you stepped outside, what if the weatherman had to tell you how many seconds it took for human skin to freeze?

04:33.000 --> 04:45.000
What if your car required not only a key to start, but a fucking chisel and a heated blanket and a schedule, a regimen.

04:45.000 --> 04:59.000
If you remember working in Milwaukee, you'd have to go out, you'd have to schedule, you'd backtrack it. Like, oh, I gotta be at the ground round at eight, so that means at seven, I gotta put a blanket on my car, I gotta start the car.

04:59.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm not made for this, I'm a ground round employee. And then the people that are coming in are gonna pay what they weigh.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Which in Milwaukee is a lot of fucking money.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
So I'm gonna be rich, I guess, yeah. Anyway, I got Midwestern chops. I'm not some hoity-toity. You Google me.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
Oh, what's Dan Harmon worth? There's that page that says five million. I don't know what the fuck they're coming from. I don't know what that means.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm not worth five million dollars. I have a five bedroom house. Those bedrooms are not...

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
We lost Brandon, we lost Brandon. Those bedrooms are not worth a million dollars each.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
I've eaten out of comfortable existence. I'm terrified right now. I feel like we're fighting a fascist empire.

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
Whatever, your politics are fine here. It's fine, Chicago. I don't care. I saw the map. I saw how red you were. It's okay.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
You're booing, you're saying, you're saying blue. Okay, then you're fine here too. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
There's a couple people in here that voted for Trump. They're doing a good job. They're being polite.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
Chicago was like the only city that like went in and wrecked up the place when Trump was around, you know?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
What does he mean? What are you talking about? What do you mean?

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
They came, like, he went and stumping around all these places, but in Chicago they shut it down. He wouldn't come outside.

06:29.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, he wouldn't come out here. All right. Resist. Fine. As long as I know I'm safe, I'll say whatever.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's burn it down. I just needed to know I was safe. I'm part of the spineless demographic.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
I just don't want people to beat me up. That's all. The reason why I'm part of the resistance now is that it has nothing to do.

06:51.000 --> 06:59.000
The reason I became politically activated to the extent, meaning that I tweet mean things now, it's because I'm lazy.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Because all of a sudden it didn't, now it's going to matter. I worked really hard to get my house.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
I don't want to have to stand in front of it and like swing a bat and go like, get away. It won't work.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
I don't know what I'm made of. So I bought a gun and I just like, I'm just sweating it out. I'm just sweating it out in my house.

07:18.000 --> 07:28.000
Anyways, it doesn't matter. It's not about me. It's about me. It's about me. But you expect a show.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
You want a show. You came to a Chicago.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
Dan, I don't think I want a show. I can't hear them. Do they want a show? I can't hear it.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
Okay. You guys think just because we came to Chicago, we're going to like improvise?

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Is that the idea? Because you're famous for improv?

07:52.000 --> 08:16.000
Please welcome improv maestro Jimmy Corraine and star of stage and screen, Scott Anson.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
All right. Take it easy. All right. Noted.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
All right.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm better than season three.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Yeah. Dan.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
By the way, yeah, Rick and Morty started airing tonight. Part of an elaborate, strange, misguided April Fool's prank.

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
I don't really understand it. I can finally tell you, Rick and Morty season three's premiere is airing on a loop. When you go home, you can watch it.

08:46.000 --> 09:00.000
You're not missing anything. It's a prank, get it? I don't get it, but I couldn't tell you and you fucking 15 year olds kept riding me.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
I'd be like, Trump's an idiot. He's a fascist. We're going to lose our civil liberties.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah. Well, you're going to lose season three of Rick and Morty.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
I'm not doing any. I'm finished. They're drawing it.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Prove it.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
Exactly, sir.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
I mean, like anyone was going to hear that. I mean, you could have said anything.

09:29.000 --> 09:37.000
You snail sew the ricks out. You sound like a Star Wars character.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
I liked him yelling out. I think that was helpful. But I didn't hear what you said. Would you come down here and say it into my mic?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, people will take that invitation.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
He'll be down here in 20 minutes.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
We'll vamp until you get here.

09:52.000 --> 10:03.000
You guys are improvisational professionals. See, people are cheering because now nine dudes are pretending to be him and there's going to be a line of people coming up.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
I was that guy. Sneak snog up ricks out.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
I was that guy. Game fan for Sample.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
You guys all have an improv background. Brandon Johnson, you did improv.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
I did improv. I did not do improv as well as these two fucking gods we have on stage in front of you.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Wrong.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Thank you.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Wrong though, wrong.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Did you work with Brandon?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
We improvised a few times. I can set some stuff. We weren't of the same generation.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
And that was your understudy. So you never missed a day of work.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
But a lot of people might be coming because there's 900 people here. There's 900 people here.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
They may only be here because they know that I'm amazing.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Some of them, even though they're from Chicago, may not know what improv really is.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
They may think it's just, well, oh, that's when you don't have a script.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's just, on a molecular level, we'll just show them for what improv is on a fundamental level.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Okay.

11:07.000 --> 11:20.000
So I will, let's tell a story in four lines of dialogue.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
I will enter with a line. Then we have two more lines to do.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
And then, Brandon, you come in with the fourth line.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh, great. Great.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
No pressure. No pressure at all.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Who we are and what we're doing and where we are now.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
And we'll get as much information as we can because that's part of improv.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
It's like being positive and providing information, piping and things. Yes.

11:42.000 --> 11:53.000
So four lines. Here's how improv works.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
I would like to return this fur coat because it's too big.

12:01.000 --> 12:14.000
But I'm a ghost. I can't run the cash register.

12:14.000 --> 12:23.000
I am the manager and I can help you, sir.

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
He said he wanted a 15 dog coat, so I made him a 15 dog coat.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
All right. Thank you.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
So that's the atomic structure of improv.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, I don't think we have to explain it. I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
When its merits are.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
In that, I was the Steve Harvey character.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Because we know what we're doing.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
And then people go, oh, so improv, they compare it to written comedy.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
So there's a laptop back here. This is going to be tough.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
It's going to run the risk of making a bad show.

13:03.000 --> 13:22.000
Okay. All right. Yeah. So if we were to write that scene.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Interior coat shop.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
For a second, I thought that was the guy from upstairs and I was like, get the fuck out of here.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
I'll kick you in your face. You look like Steve Bannon.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh, yeasty and shit. That dude has a yeast. He's got some yeast shit on his face.

13:44.000 --> 13:51.000
That's the good thing about not liking that dude is we can talk shit on him and nobody's going to be like, don't be like that about Steve Bannon.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
Fucking brought Steve Bannon to the party, you guys. Be nice tonight.

13:55.000 --> 14:04.000
He's got on a diaper.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
Oh, shit. He wants to save the, ah, damn it, eSports.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
Fucking bullshit. Some YouTube show we're doing.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Timbuck says the first thing that came up was the porn from last night on that laptop.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
Ghost coat. We'll call it.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
There's a lot of mannequin porn on his computer.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
How to make a ghost costume.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
And then the manager. What did you say, Jimmy? You said...

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
I was the manager. I can help you.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I'm the manager. I can help you.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And if you could do that in...

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
And then Brandon disembodied.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
I played a young Nigerian trying to find his way through the furry industry.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
His mentor was Steve Harvey.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
$15. Okay, so we have a flawed story here that we created improvisationally.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Like, where did it break down? I thought my line was awesome.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Like, and then you introducing the fact that you're a ghost brought us across a threshold.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Right. I was introducing a mythology that we could explore.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
I think, and then it starts to break down ironically with our improv masters.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.000
Jimmy Corraine, who teaches improv.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I'm a manager. I can help you.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
But ironically, you couldn't.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
As an improv manager, you couldn't help anyone.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
Although he could have made his line longer.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You just said line.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
So let's try it again. Let's do a rewrite.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
That's not how improv works, Mayor Harmon.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
But I'm not going to change what I did because I nailed it.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
And I don't think Scott did very bad either.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Now, I feel a lot of pressure.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Can I just say before we do this, I'm feeling a lot of pressure.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
I'm in my head right now.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
I'm going to alter my line just a little bit. It may help you.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Okay. All right. You're going to set me up. Thank you, Scott.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
And also, if you were more relaxed before, that may have been the problem.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Okay.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Cha-ding-ding!

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
I'd like to return this coat. It doesn't fit me very well.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm a ghost, remember?

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm a ghost, too. I'm the manager ghost.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
I think I'm catching on. What do you think?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
You're still in character? I can't respond if you are.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
No. We'll talk later.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Why is that lady wearing a fur coat on the beach?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Whoa! Okay.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I mean, that was interesting because that changed everything.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
I just thought I'd try something different for this improv.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So, the actors thought they knew where they were,

17:05.000 --> 17:12.000
but then the dialogue shows that we were actually on a beach with a door.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Now, the interesting thing is the characters knew that. The actors didn't.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
That's right. Like all good improv alcoholism together, all rooted in denial.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
You say plain, I say boat.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
So, if we were to continue with that scene, like,

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
so he's now revealed that we're on a beach with a door and that we have two ghosts,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
but I'm returning a coat that doesn't fit.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
And you're a lady.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
You promised me when I rubbed that seashell

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
that if I wore your coat, you'd give me lightning power.

17:58.000 --> 18:04.000
The lightning power has always been in you.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
The coat was just a catalyst to your realization.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Use your power now.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm still the manager ghost.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
And with your power, you can kill me.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Wait a minute, Andy. When you get out of prison,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
you can help me work on the boat. Shawshank.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
All right. Well, okay.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
All right. So there's a...

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I like that one.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
So what we're learning about improv is that it's different from writing.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Like, if you held it to the same standards, it wouldn't hold up.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Like, a lot of people watch, like, whose line is it anyway?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
And they go, like, well, why don't you just write that stuff?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
And then, but then you go, like, no, they're making it up.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
You go to, like, an improv show in Chicago,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
like a long-form improv show by really talented, like, long-form improv people.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
And you could witness something that could never be written.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It could never be written. Jimmy, what is that phenomenon?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
What is that magic?

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, I think it's because each show is always different every night.

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
Sometimes they're going to fail and sometimes they're going to succeed.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
It's really like a sporting event.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
That's what makes it so fun to watch.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
What do you think, Scott?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I hate sports metaphors.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Okay.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Especially in relation to art.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
But I'll say that the difference, I think, is that when somebody's written

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
and people know it's written, then they have a higher expectation

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
for it being crafted and satisfying.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
And an improv survival is a win.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And the people in the audience know that,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
and they know that everyone's on a tightrope,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
and if they land gracefully, then that's a success.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And the highest compliment you can get in an improv show

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
is people will come and say, are you sure that wasn't scripted?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
That's, like, the highest compliment you can get.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
But that would mean that you did so good at improv

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
that it was just slightly less, like, good than something that was written.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Right?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, there are terrible situations.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
There should be something.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
People should be coming up to you and saying,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I know for sure that wasn't written,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
but it was better than anything that could have been written.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
We both heard that.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Right.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Who are these people you get into a fight with, Dan?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
But we're just saying, like, the audience, they're dumb.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
They don't have the vocabulary.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
They're just like, oh, that seemed like written it.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
And I was like, OK, yeah, give me your 10 bucks.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
OK.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
You're very cynical about improv.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
No, I'm cynical about America.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
OK.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
I'm sorry.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I confused it.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Spencer, where does it, so when you're a dungeon master,

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
where does this come in?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
Because you're improvising as a narrator,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
and then people are looking at a sheet of paper,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
and they're saying, well, then because of this sheet of paper,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
which isn't a script, but it is a bunch of facts, I do this.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
And then, like, what?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
Talk.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Say some stuff.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Oh.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
It is like writing and improv.

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
So what if...

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I just...

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
So you couldn't write that?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
It's so easy.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
It's so easy with these guys.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
So what if I were to say, OK, Jimmy Corraine,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
improv extraordinaire, would be your dice,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
because you don't have any, and we don't have a campaign.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
So then, could you dungeon master an improvised campaign

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
for me and Scott and Brandon to be in a little campaign,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
and then Jimmy is like the dice.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
Could Jimmy improvise results?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
So many clues.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Can you improvise results?

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Does that sound fun to you?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I...

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Whatever.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
Whatever anyone wants, yes.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
It's kind of like if Jimmy was human dice,

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
like if you just, like, any time we wanted to do something,

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
Spencer would look at you, and then you would represent a random result,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and then Spencer would read it,

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
and then explain to us what we had accomplished.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
Now, to connect the dots, backstage, me and Dan were thinking that

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
a true improv master would be able to improvise perfectly

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
the random results as if from a die.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
That's part of this conceit.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Almost like a magician.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Right.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Do you mean that the...

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Yeah, what do you...

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
No, I've just...

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
You said that!

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Do you mean like...

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Do you mean like Jimmy would say three and eight,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
or do you mean like Jimmy would be like,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
you hit and you get a critical hit?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Let's ask the person who said that.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
What you...

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I didn't suggest...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
That's me?

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah, I didn't say, hey, Jimmy would be great at pretending to be dice,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
but, like, I don't...

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I believe you when you say it, but I don't know your thinking.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Yeah, but I'm drunk.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Why are you listening to me about anything?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I think you were...

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
I was sitting down and you looked taller.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
All right, well, fine.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
So I'll control everything.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
Well, you can do... you control what you want me to control.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Okay.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Right.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
That's what I'm going to do.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
All right.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Spencer, you're in charge of...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Of...

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Of...

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Of what...

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
What happens...

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Okay.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
Over what we're seeing and what's in the room.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Okay.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
And then whenever anyone wants to do anything,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
instead of rolling dice,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Jimmy, who's not part of the narrative,

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
you're like a non-diagetic element.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
That is not a word.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Uh, you...

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Non-diagetic.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
You produce results.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
You're sort of like a god or a...

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
I mean, it wouldn't be fun for him to say random numbers.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Jimmy, you have to do more than that.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
You have to represent kind of like...

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Dice?

24:20.000 --> 24:32.000
You have to... you have to indicate fate in a way that Spencer can read.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
So you stand over there.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Can you give me an example?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yes.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Give me an example.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Okay.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
All right.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Well, you be me.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
You be me.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I'm you.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
An example and I'll be you what I want you to do.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
I'm Dan.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Do you know how to play Dungeons & Dragons?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
I don't know how to play Dungeons & Dragons.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
You tell him what he's looking at.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Okay.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Jimmy, you're in a wonderful field,

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
surrounded by trees.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Maybe it's a forest, even.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
What do you do?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
So tell him what you want to do.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I'd like to climb up one of the trees.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Oh, shit.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
That's him rolling?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Are you rolling?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
It's a very sexy tree.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
I don't...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
You have to interpret it.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Because...

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Wait, what?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Because...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Like, I'm a human die.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Like, I'm not going to just say...

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
I'm just saying like, this could mean to you...

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
It's like a tarot card.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It could mean like...

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Man.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It's like, oh, that seems like a normal,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
average thing.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
He's acquiescent.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
So if he says he wants to climb a tree,

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
and I'm going like this,

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I guess he climbs the tree, maybe.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Well, I thought...

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Or if I'm like...

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Or if I'm like...

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Then it's like he fell...

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Oh, a twig poked him in the eye,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and he fell out of the tree.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Because I'm being, like, aggressive.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Now, Dan, were you the tree?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
No.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
No.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
I'm like...

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah, what are you?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I'm a human die.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
Well, a human die would tumble around and reveal a face

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
with a number of sides, like a number on it.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
That's...

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That's if a human was a die.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Right.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Yeah, a human die.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
If a human played the role of a die.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Uh-huh.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
A human wouldn't have to say three or eight.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
A human could use all their human faces and behaviors

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
to indicate the vibe.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
So like, if a person was just like...

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
You know, like, if you were just like...

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
You know, like, you...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
It's clearly a two.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
To you, that might mean an extreme result.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Well...

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Yeah.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Isn't a result of a dice a number?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Oh, okay.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I got it.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I got it.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
No, if it's a human die...

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
You gotta say the number, the dice...

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Okay, so you gotta say how many sides are on the die.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
So, like, if you say this is a 20-sided die,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
then it's like, oh, is that a 17 out of 20?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Or is that, like, you know...

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
It's gotta be like that.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
No, why wouldn't they just say seven?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
They would just say a number, then.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Because it's like, what are you trying to roll?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Are you trying to roll a very high roll of a six-sided die?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I'm getting the iron rolling.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Are you trying to get a...

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm saying that the person's...

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I think it's more like a drill.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Uh-huh.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Because he's rolling and becoming a symbol for something

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
rather than a number quantifying something,

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
and he wants you to interpret it as the next action

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and how successful it is based on the emotion

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
you're getting from his action.

27:10.000 --> 27:15.000
I told you...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
I told you these are gods!

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Okay, so Jimmy...

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Okay, so I was climbing the tree.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Well, why don't you guys be the adventurers?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I'm obviously... I'll be the die.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Okay.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
But it's like...

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
And don't be distracted by the fact that

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I'm just gonna, like, feel the vibe.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Okay, no.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Like, another thing about a die is that it's like

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
this punctuated thing where it's like,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
oh, now we roll it, now we get a number.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
No, I'm over here, I'm not part of your narrative,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
but Spencer's got one eye on me mentally,

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
and I'm just sort of, like, feeling things.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Okay.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And I'm just sort of like...

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
How do we quantify a roll, then?

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
It sounds like you're in a continuous rolling.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
You're not quantifying.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
So I look at you, I just take a snapshot

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
and go, this frame of Dan's existence...

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah, I would say that's accurate.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Well, then when do I decide when I should throw to you?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Like...

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
That's your own decision.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Well, that's...

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
It's like taking a cup and dipping it in a river.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Like...

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Like, the river, it could be, you know,

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
so, like, when do you do it and how big's the cup?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
And it's like, it's up to you.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
It's like, that's what dice are supposed to...

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
I thought I would be the most on board for this.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
I feel like you are crafting a new paradigm.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
I'm already doing it.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Oh, I'm not.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
He's crafted it.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
No, no, but you're a big part of it.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I mean, I really think we're sitting on a gold mine.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm already doing it.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
No, this is great.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I'm already doing it.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
We have to go on the adventure.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Right, we're on a journey.

28:48.000 --> 28:53.000
And I would like to be Gwynethor, the Gollum Fairy Princess.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
Okay, can I still be the manager, the ghost manager?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Okay.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Gwynethor?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Yeah, Gwynethor.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Gwynethor and ghost manager!

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
You find yourself in Bristle Bees,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
the merry town of bristles and bees.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Around you, you see bristles and bees

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
winding their merry ways through the city of Bristle Bees.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
I don't know what it's called anymore.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Bristled Bees.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
At your feet, you can see the tiny dwellings of the bees

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
and the slightly larger dwellings of the bristles.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
We must be careful where we stop.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
Okay, we will walk very gently.

29:45.000 --> 29:57.000
Ow! Ow! You got me!

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
You don't step on any more bees

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
than those ones that just earlier made noise.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
You find yourself to what seems like the town hall of Bristle Bees.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
No repercussions for killing townspeople.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Yes.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
There is the tiny town hall there.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Let's go in.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Yes.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
You open the door and out comes the mayor.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
He's a little bee.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
He's got a...

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
He looks like the Honey Nut Cheerios bee,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
but like with a mustache.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Welcome to our town.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
Go be the guy. You don't have to stand back there.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
You want this, Mike?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Thanks so much.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Hello, little bee.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Welcome to our town.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
I am Gwynethor, the Gollum Princess,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and this is my manager.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
We have waited for your arrival.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
We've heard so much about you.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
Welcome to Bristle Bees.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
You've killed about a thousand of our residents.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Sorry about that.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
It's okay. We're just happy to see you.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
We realized as soon as we came to town

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
that nothing random really happens here ever, does it?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Nope.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Monday looks like Friday.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Friday looks like Saturday.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
You get it.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
You smell the smell of sweet lemons.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
It's weird because lemons smell sour usually.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
And at the same time,

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
you feel everything expanding and growing,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
including yourselves and the buildings around you.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Oh, my God, the scale remains.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It looks about the same

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
because everything grows at roughly the same size,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
but you're clearly larger than you were.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
So I'd be about this tall.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
No, you grow more.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
You grow more as a weird occurrence.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Great.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Yeah.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Allow me to show you around our beautiful town.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
That would be great.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That's the library.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Oh.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
That's the other library.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I'm not sure how I feel about it yet.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You feel conflicted.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Come.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Which library should I go to?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
I'll go to the...

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
No!

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I'll go to...

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
No!

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
I'll go to this one.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
No!

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
I'll go to this one.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
No!

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Well, that library is boring.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
This library contains books

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
that will lead you into the arms of our...

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
mascot?

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Oh, the Tai Chi mascot over there?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
The Tai Chi master!

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Or maybe...

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I think he wants to be left alone.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Yes.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
He bates to be misnamed.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
He's been doing things all by himself

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
without anyone talking to him

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
or acknowledging his existence.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Let's see.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
You guys are being literal and you're...

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Maybe you'd like to meet the soul of our town.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
No, no.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I think he's meant to be separate from us.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yes.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
He's not part of the narrative.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Okay, Spencer, I'll do...

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
I'll do...

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
You do my part.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
I'll do your part.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Well, okay.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Let's trade.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Okay.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Okay.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm not saying I'm going to do better.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm just saying, like, obviously,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I owe it to people to demonstrate what I mean.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
It's like, like, you guys, don't worry about him.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
You're just people.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
You exist in your own narrative.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Don't worry about him.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
That's fucked up.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I'll worry about him.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Sorry we let you down, Dan.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Spencer, where are they?

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
They're in a tree trunk?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Where are they?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Dan, we were really feeling sorry for you.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah, we did.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah, man.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
We're trying to execute your fucking vision.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
We were feeling bad for you, Dan.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
No, don't feel sorry for me.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
No, you were out there all alone

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
and looked kind of ridiculous and...

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
It didn't seem like you were generating anything

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
and inspiring any new directions.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Are you guys trying to...

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
We want to please you, Dan.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
You're trying to construct

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
a meta-improved narrative.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
No, that was...

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
No, that was your idea, Dan.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
We were just trying to support it.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
You give gifts with all these crazy body movements.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
You showin' your body and everything.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
And we wanted to accept those gifts and heighten.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
And right now we're playing a game

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
where the scene has broken down

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
and we are playing our personas.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Yeah.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Well, what if my character decides

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
that because you're disappointing me,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I will go back in time?

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
Well, why don't we see what that would look like?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Cut to.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
A great Chicago phrase.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Cut to.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh…

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
...sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh…

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
All right.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
You guys are adventuring

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
are adventuring in a big field.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
You're a fighter and a wizard.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I'm a fighter, great.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Jimmy Carrain, you are Jimmy Carrainus, the great fighter.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Yes, I'm Jimmy Carrain, the great fighteress.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
You have a plate armor and a hat and a sword.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
Scott adds that you are at Sortarus,

35:45.000 --> 35:52.000
the wizard of Suckedicula.

35:52.000 --> 36:02.000
You love magic, but you don't mind Suckin' Nick.

36:02.000 --> 36:12.000
You got a bag of tricks that includes Suckin' Nick and some spells.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
And you guys are on a field in a field, a great field,

36:16.000 --> 36:23.000
overlooking a town and you're on a quest to find a gold ring

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
that you heard might exist.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Pretty original.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
But there's some goblins.

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
There's some goblins coming.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
It's so easy.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
There's goblins coming.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
And I'm basing that on his movement, but he's not the goblins.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You understand?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Why would we waste all that good movement, though?

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
But I'm looking at his movement, but it's not...

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
God damn it, it's not that hard.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Don't acknowledge the dice.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Goblins are coming.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Just don't acknowledge the dice.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
The goblins are shooting at you.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
You got hit real bad, Jimmy.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
You got hit in the arm with an arrow.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Oh, Zephyr wins.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Blow some cock.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You're waving your arms in a magical manner.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
You try to cast a healing spell on Jimmy Crane's character.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
And it's doing okay.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
It's doing fine.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Wow, not nearly as good as the dick.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Don't use it for about three weeks.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
It's feeling a little sore, but it's feeling a little better.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
I don't have to suck your dick, do I, for that?

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
You don't have to, but I would really appreciate it.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
More arrows are raining down in you.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
But they're missing, generally, because the goblins are far away.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
They're just taking potshots at you.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Maybe there's a way we can stop the goblins.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Okay, I've got a sword. I forgot.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Oh, the goblins aren't the move.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I was trying to slay the goblin.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Alright, I'm going to try a multiplying spell on your sword

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
and throw one sword that will land as a hundred.

38:19.000 --> 38:24.000
Your multiplying spell fails.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Here it goes.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I'm sorry, I was distracted.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I was looking at your dick.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Your sword flies off into the grass.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
The goblins are laughing at you.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
That's not the goblins.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
They're continuing to march towards you.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
We've got to stop them somehow or get out of here.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Jimmy, you still...

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
No, you don't, okay.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
You're wearing armor. Why don't you just go fight them for us?

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
That's a great idea.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
If I don't come back, I love you.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
No.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
That's an incentive if I come back.

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
Jimmy proceeds across the great plains of Dixiculine.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
Oh, the goblins are terrified of something.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
They're summoning healing powers to buff themselves,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
to give themselves higher armor.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
As you get towards them, you see them starting to glow bright red,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
indicating that it's going to be harder to hit them.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Use the strategy I used at Offaldor.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Alright.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
Go for their penises.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
The goblins attack. You attack.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
Your attacks are not doing good.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
Alright.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
The goblins are now...

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
They return to attack.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
They're doing real good.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
They're real excited.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
And their arrows are piercing you for...

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm down.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I've been hit by an arrow.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
I'm going to approach a goblin and try to get it to surrender through pleasure.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
Okay.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
The goblins are considering your offer.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Is it working?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I think it's working.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
They seem into it.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
The goblins are down.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Keep going. I see the ring.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I see the ring.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
It's attached to what I'm using.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
The goblins have an offer for you.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
They say if you continue to pleasure them,

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
that they'll spare your lives.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
One by one, the goblins' chodes go down your throat,

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
filling you with the goblin's seed.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
No.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
I'm pregnant.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
No.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
They're different than us.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Oh my God.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm giving birth through my urethra.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
All right. Hold it. Hold it.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
It's coming.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
I got it.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
A goblin baby.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
All right.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
A goblin baby came out.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
It's a boy. It's a baby boy.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
All right.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:22.000 --> 41:29.000
At least I know he's mine.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I'm willing to admit this isn't working,

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
if you guys are.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
All right.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Okay.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
That's all.

41:35.000 --> 41:44.000
Okay. Spencer, you can have it.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And you're saying you couldn't write that.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Okay.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Now I get it.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Now I understand what he meant when he said,

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
Dan, I want to ask you what you learned from that.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
It doesn't work.

41:55.000 --> 42:03.000
You can't just come out on the stage and make up a show.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
But I wanted to give you something.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I'm a midwesterner. You're a midwesterner.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
You've been very kind to me over the years.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And I wanted to get you a little gift.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
This is big in Chicago.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
It's frango mince.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Frango mince.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
Yeah.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
Frango mince when you care to send frango mince.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
Thanks.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Thank you.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
I didn't know, you know,

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
usually people bring, you know, pizzas or what else?

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
Bone in pork sandwich.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Polish sausage.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But in Chicago, we, midwesterners,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
we like to bring something to the host of the party.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
All right.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Well, I appreciate the gesture.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Thank you.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Did that improv exhaust you, Dan?

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
No, no.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
I'm just, I'm moving on.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Okay.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
You know, it's like.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
King of the segue.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
So what, so what do we know about?

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
So, so as improvisers, like we, we, we, we, we make things up.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
We go, okay.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
So God is in the moment and everything that happened before

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
and everything that's about to happen.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
That's the devil.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
He's going to fuck you up.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
God is in the moment.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
You guys are following me, right?

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Totally.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Just like the last exercise.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Right.

43:19.000 --> 43:25.000
So in politics, like we have this right versus left paradigm.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
So we can recognize Republicans, for instance,

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
as being very out of the moment.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
They're worried about what happened yesterday

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
and what's about to happen.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Democrats, are they really in the moment

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
or are they just a mirror image of Republicans

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
improvisationally speaking?

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
They're not.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
They're not really making it up as they go

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
because they're politicians.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
So don't we just need a revolution where everybody

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
just like rips off their clothes and runs in the street

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
and goes like, well, make it up.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Make it up as you go.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
But here's, and before you answer that.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Okay.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
Are, aren't we doomed as a society?

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
Because like, don't, it hasn't the height of what we've been

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
able to adopt democracy and, and, and doesn't that by default

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
mean mob rule and aren't, isn't, aren't most people stupid?

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
And, and, and then like, so if you're smart and you're liberal,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
then don't you have to either choose between consorting

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
with a bunch of morons who are like, yay, be liberal.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
And you're like, yeah, but you're dumb.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
And that's like kind of the, I see like there's a division

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
among the Democrats between like the, you know,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I don't want to put too fine a point on it,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
but you get your Bernie, your Bernie people

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
and your, and your, and your traditional Democrats and stuff.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
But there's like a real heavy division between folks

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
because they're like, yeah, we don't want fucking more corruption

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
and all this stuff and then it's like, like, yeah,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
but if you don't, it's fucking, yeah,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
don't even get excited sir.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
I always, I just feel like this is like wedge.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
It's like right now it's like so fun watching the bad guys

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
be in power and watching them kind of fumble over themselves.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
But then you feel this dark cloud in the horizon where it's like,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
we're supposed to, the next move is we're supposed

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
to all agree on something and do something together

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
and we can't get our shit together.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.660
We're gonna start like arguing with each other really soon. We're already doing it. What was my point like?

45:13.980 --> 45:15.980
How do we isn't there a way to like?

45:18.740 --> 45:23.860
What are we gonna do why shouldn't I just kill myself nobody's stopping you

45:27.580 --> 45:33.700
Only you are stopping you Dan if you did kill yourself, right? Well, how would you do it?

45:33.700 --> 45:35.700
I

45:35.900 --> 45:38.220
Mean I wouldn't be in front of a large crowd. Yeah

45:40.420 --> 45:45.540
At like a comedy festival I do a major podcast and keep talking about how I hadn't gotten my gun yet

45:45.940 --> 45:48.840
And then I'd announced that I had gotten my gun

45:49.820 --> 45:52.820
And I'd pick a I'd pick an obscure town

45:53.140 --> 45:58.380
Okay, give me an example hard work in town, but I'd maximize the number of people okay blue state red

45:58.380 --> 46:03.580
Want to push like a thousand people okay somewhere around my hometown, okay, and then I just pull out a gun

46:03.580 --> 46:06.420
Just blow my brains out on it. No, I I

46:07.900 --> 46:13.860
Do feel I do feel like I'm a gun I like I'm a I blow my brains out. I think okay now

46:18.260 --> 46:22.540
Because I feel like pills like if you took like a bottle of Tylenol you'd be like I

46:23.220 --> 46:25.420
Feel like you'd be like ow my kidney

46:25.420 --> 46:31.060
And then you'd be like I got my kidney hurts. I changed my mind. I changed my mind

46:31.060 --> 46:36.780
I don't killing myself hurts and then you'd be like yeah, but your kidneys are shut down. I think you mean your liver

46:37.100 --> 46:40.140
What I think you yes, we heard you liver sir

46:40.900 --> 46:45.740
liver too many people talking over each other everyone knows kidneys don't filter out a damn thing

46:46.940 --> 46:52.780
Okay, I just want to ask you this I want to play to the audience on this one really common here in Chicago's people will

46:52.780 --> 47:00.000
Jump in front of the L to take their life really. Yeah, would you do something like no absolutely no no big too dramatic to macho

47:01.740 --> 47:05.700
To fucking like I don't know just too you want to go out quietly with a gun I

47:08.620 --> 47:10.620
Just I just don't think I just don't I

47:11.820 --> 47:15.580
The thing about jumping in front of a train right to athletic

47:17.500 --> 47:22.460
I'll tell you what always pisses me off about it is the people that do it do it during rush hour, right?

47:22.460 --> 47:27.700
Yeah, and that really inconvenient just ruins everyone's day where it's not gonna affect that's the other thing is

47:27.700 --> 47:30.420
I don't want to fuck other people's days up like I don't want to do that

47:30.420 --> 47:32.620
I would if I was gonna blow my brains out by the way

47:32.620 --> 47:35.780

47:36.740 --> 47:41.980
So so I would and I would like write the nicest note like for my housekeeper. I'd be like I

There's a mess up there, but

47:49.300 --> 47:57.220
You can just undo the masking tape and just seal it all up put me in the blue bin and just be done with it

47:57.220 --> 48:00.340
Like and here's a box of toys for your kid

48:00.340 --> 48:05.780

48:05.780 --> 48:06.460
Yeah, okay

48:06.460 --> 48:12.300
We'll see I think the absence of you and the fact that you feel such a failure that they would feel that maybe they failed you and they

48:12.300 --> 48:15.620
Would I wish I could bring any of my family out right now and prove you so wrong?

48:15.620 --> 48:22.740

Dear world, okay

Uh, so sorry they will play this when you're dead by the way, go ahead

49:43.540 --> 49:50.660
Uh, you don't want to put them in his head wise writing. Yeah, I guess you saw what I saw things are getting hard like

49:51.860 --> 49:53.860
Don't take this as uh

49:54.340 --> 49:56.100
as encouragement

49:56.100 --> 49:58.100
To do what I did

49:58.100 --> 50:00.100
I had a good life

50:00.100 --> 50:06.820
Uh, like I didn't have to fight in any wars. I never had to be hungry

50:07.700 --> 50:09.700
Like I wasn't a black woman

50:10.900 --> 50:13.540
But yeah, can I just stop right now? I'm getting the sense

50:15.860 --> 50:17.860
Some of the best lives on the planet

50:17.860 --> 50:23.700
I just remind you Beyonce is kicking it right about now. Well, I wasn't Beyonce is obvious

50:23.700 --> 50:28.180
I think that's the unspoken part of this. What you don't know is that a lot of black women can do the same shit as Beyonce

50:28.180 --> 50:29.940
We just ain't showing off

50:29.940 --> 50:32.900
You want to come back as a black woman?

50:34.900 --> 50:39.780
I don't want to be a black woman. Even in my suicide note. I'm I'm persecuted. Well, no, but

50:40.900 --> 50:42.900
If I read that

50:43.380 --> 50:48.100
I can't get a break. No, no, no, no. No, no, I want to help you. I mean, it's funny how

50:48.500 --> 50:53.700
You know, the improvisers are helping the writer, but uh as as I was going through the note

50:53.700 --> 50:57.860
I'm like that guy would never commit suicide. It sounds like you're trying to talk yourself out of it. Yes

50:57.860 --> 51:02.260
I was never in a war. I had a good life. Right. Yeah, right. No, you're right

51:02.260 --> 51:04.260
And I have no plans to kill myself by the way

51:05.460 --> 51:07.460
You sure?

51:08.900 --> 51:10.900
I mean you brought it all

51:13.540 --> 51:15.540
This is what friends do we help out

51:15.780 --> 51:18.900
So how does the note go from there? You say a bunch of positive things about your wife. Yeah, yeah, yeah

51:18.900 --> 51:22.020
It's got a turn. I say I say everybody you're off the hook, please

51:22.020 --> 51:27.140
I'm so sorry for the mess like I wish that I could have just jumped into a vaporizer or a sarlacc pit

51:27.140 --> 51:32.820
I'm so sorry like if you're for those of you who found it and all this stuff. I'm so sorry and then I'd say

51:33.540 --> 51:37.540
you know, I think our species is plagued with a

51:38.340 --> 51:46.180
notion that we are not good enough and I think it provokes us to do things that hurt ourselves in each other

51:46.820 --> 51:50.340
And I think that once you get to the spot that I'm in go ahead

51:50.340 --> 51:55.140
I think you got to personalize you can't speak of the whole world. You know, I already said my personal shit

51:55.140 --> 51:58.980
I thought you said you have a great life, but the world sucks. So I'm going to kill myself

52:00.020 --> 52:04.980
Everybody else is acting like human beings. Well, yeah, I'm not going to wait for my life to I yeah

52:04.980 --> 52:06.980
If I wait for my life to suck. I'll never kill myself

52:14.180 --> 52:17.940
So you want to go out on a high like the carol brunette show. Yeah, like I well, I mean like

52:18.580 --> 52:21.540
It's it's it's no big trick to have a comfortable life

52:21.540 --> 52:26.180
It is for some. Yeah, that's why I want to kill myself

52:26.740 --> 52:30.820
So you feel responsibility for the people who are not as successful as you. Yeah, it's hard

52:31.060 --> 52:34.020
Like they're not as lucky, but it's not reading in your note right now

52:35.540 --> 52:40.740
I'm not getting that. Are you Scott? Well, I'm just curious you have regret for being successful. Yeah. Yes. Yes

52:40.900 --> 52:42.900
Okay, you can stop that right now

52:43.140 --> 52:47.540
Wait, but well instead of the suicide I just give all my money away and then wander around the street

52:47.540 --> 52:50.900
Oh, yeah, you can you can stop being successful anytime you want

52:51.220 --> 52:56.100
But you want to work hard and be successful and get praised and have a thousand people cheer you. No, I don't

52:59.780 --> 53:04.820
That sounded like about 500 people that was really about 200. Well, yeah

53:07.220 --> 53:12.500
A percentage of a thousand people cheer you in their defense 500 of them want to kill themselves so

53:14.260 --> 53:16.260
Look at you clap. Yes

53:16.260 --> 53:20.740
All right. Well, let me start my note over. Okay kids

53:24.820 --> 53:26.820
It's not gonna get any better

53:28.740 --> 53:30.740
The writing's on the wall

53:31.700 --> 53:33.700
From where I was sitting

53:35.780 --> 53:41.460
The next thing that happens is your knees starts to ache and then it just it gets it gets harder and harder

53:41.780 --> 53:43.620
I'm leaving

53:43.620 --> 53:44.900
soon

53:44.900 --> 53:46.900
Now after I finish the letter

53:51.220 --> 53:53.220
Unless there's another draft

53:56.580 --> 53:58.580
I uh

53:58.580 --> 54:02.580
I I can't it's hard. It's hard to be on twitter

54:03.300 --> 54:04.820
Uh

54:04.820 --> 54:05.940
What?

54:05.940 --> 54:09.540
You guys you guys you guys another twitter related death. Yeah

54:10.740 --> 54:12.740
You guys seem unhappy

54:12.740 --> 54:14.740
Uh, there's not enough

54:15.380 --> 54:17.380
Gravy but see don't you see

54:17.940 --> 54:19.940
I'm gonna I'm gonna interrupt your note for a second. Right

54:20.580 --> 54:25.620
You guys are unhappy. So I'm gonna kill myself. Right. Okay. I understand the empathy you have

54:25.940 --> 54:29.060
I'm leaving all my money in a box. You remember start us memories

54:29.700 --> 54:31.300
Right. No, we'll kind of yeah, okay

54:31.460 --> 54:36.500
So he's suicidal and he says why don't I just kill myself and he says that the alien

54:37.060 --> 54:39.060
All-knowing person says to woody

54:39.140 --> 54:40.100
Uh

54:40.100 --> 54:45.220
You're you know, you're not superman. You're a comedian. You want to save the world tell funny your jokes, right?

54:45.540 --> 54:51.620
You delight people, right? But you think people are unhappy and your job your delight is to delight them

54:52.260 --> 54:54.260
So you're making the world better

54:54.580 --> 54:56.580
The world you're complaining about

54:56.660 --> 54:59.220
You're fixing and so then you take yourself out of it

55:00.020 --> 55:07.380
Yeah, but what about all the people that say don't you should go back to work writing cartoons instead of talking about how

55:07.380 --> 55:14.340
Dumb the president is and then you're like, well, I don't want to write. What am I supposed to write a cartoon about 13 years old?

55:21.940 --> 55:23.940
Not physically

55:27.220 --> 55:32.100
But wait, how did we get it? I never said when did I you said the world is unhappy so I'm gonna kill myself

55:32.100 --> 55:34.100
I guess I maybe technically said that

55:34.100 --> 55:39.380
You have an existential crisis. Yeah, but you're intelligent enough to think past an existential crisis

55:39.380 --> 55:42.420
I guess it's that's what it is is that we are at a point in

55:42.980 --> 55:44.980
Politically like we've gotten to a point like

55:45.460 --> 55:50.420
Like it was easy in the bush years and the all the shit with the dangling chads and all that crap

55:50.740 --> 55:55.700
It was very easy to just be like a Han Solo and be like, I don't have no love for the empire

55:55.780 --> 55:58.180
But I love this fucking smuggle

55:58.740 --> 56:00.420
um

56:00.420 --> 56:04.340
It as of the election it was like, are you fucking kidding me?

56:04.500 --> 56:11.300
You're either in favor of the mass enslavement of all humanity and absolute fucking apocalypse

56:11.380 --> 56:17.460
Or you're part of some rebellion that has to spend its life like flying and x-wings and doing like horrible

56:18.020 --> 56:20.020
runs and stuff and it's like

56:20.740 --> 56:27.140
Woe be to the to the rich white lazy piece of shit, you know, like you're just like, well, where am I supposed to fit in?

56:27.140 --> 56:31.460
I don't want to earn my bread and butter. I don't I don't want to find out what I'm made of. It's just a

56:32.020 --> 56:34.260
Drag I'd rather be a martyr and just be dead

56:35.300 --> 56:38.340
Like that's what it is. Like I don't want to you know, I don't have it if you take your own life

56:38.820 --> 56:42.500
You have to someone take your life. I could make it look like an accident

56:44.180 --> 56:46.180
All right, how would that look?

56:46.420 --> 56:52.020
How would you do it? I could I could I could have some friends over and I could have like a roller skate party

56:53.860 --> 56:55.860
And I could rent a five-story

56:55.860 --> 57:02.900
Three tower, okay, and I have a roller skate party. You're gonna just get really drunk and come on. All right. We're no

57:02.900 --> 57:04.980
We were getting somewhere. I liked what we were doing, but

57:06.180 --> 57:14.020
You know, I'm not you're right. What you're saying is that I'm a fat white straight. I never said fat or straight

57:16.660 --> 57:18.660
I'm pretty sure that was me

57:19.780 --> 57:21.780
You're saying that my responsibility

57:21.780 --> 57:27.380
It's it's like moving forward. You have to live in the fucking apocalypse. You can't dramaticize it so much

57:27.860 --> 57:32.260
That you can avoid living in it. You actually have to be a character in it. You have to let go

57:32.580 --> 57:37.540
Okay, so this is the way the world is. It's not normal. It's not good, but I'm in it. You can't be

57:38.580 --> 57:41.380
There's there's it's no country for old narcissists

57:41.380 --> 57:50.180
And it's it's what women and black people do every fucking day

57:52.180 --> 57:54.580
I don't believe there's that many women and black people out there

57:55.940 --> 58:00.580
Some of you are trying to get on a gravy train. What was the point you were trying to make to dan?

58:02.260 --> 58:04.020
When

58:04.020 --> 58:09.620
When you were saying to him about okay, you're you know, you you do comedy you make people's lives better

58:09.620 --> 58:15.620
Yeah, well, he was he was saying that the world is unhappy and he's one of the reasons some of us aren't

58:16.500 --> 58:19.940
A part of it anyway. I don't know. Yeah. Well, no, it was it was just like

58:20.580 --> 58:24.660
I think it's like it's defeatism. That's what we're that's what we ended up addressing

58:24.740 --> 58:28.260
It's like a lot of people out there probably feel that way like you wake up in the morning

58:28.340 --> 58:33.220
You're like, holy fuck. How could it be so bad? Like like and and how come I can't do anything about it

58:33.220 --> 58:39.220
You can and then and then you if you react to that with like, oh fuck. I'm gonna like just you know

58:40.020 --> 58:42.020
Give up or go cynical

58:42.180 --> 58:46.900
You know, that's because you're like well the alternative is you have to like do shit that's like uncomfortable

58:46.900 --> 58:49.460
You're gonna strain your back, but at least enjoy being

58:50.180 --> 58:54.420
Cynical about everything you can enjoy that. Yeah, it was easier before

58:55.140 --> 58:58.420
To be cynical you can't be cynical now. It's harder to be cynical now

58:58.420 --> 59:03.380
What happens if you I'm still cynical if you're cynical now, then you're like one of these like

59:04.020 --> 59:07.460
Libertarian people that's like this an ass burger trump voter

59:08.900 --> 59:15.540
You're like one of these silicon valley people that's like meat moop logic says no hillary because her emails like it's like

59:16.740 --> 59:19.380
I'm not I don't want I'm not gonna be one of those people

59:19.460 --> 59:24.420
I'm not gonna be like meat moop logic says be a fucking nazi like I'm not doing it

59:24.420 --> 59:30.260
You could be a shindler. You could use your ring to buy a shindler. I would like to be a shindler. You can be a shindler

59:30.980 --> 59:33.940
There's a lot of this is a great opportunity for all of us to be heroes

59:34.340 --> 59:38.580
Because it's so very bad you even the small amount of shit you do what did?

59:42.020 --> 59:45.460
What did shindler do again, he didn't do enough

59:48.340 --> 59:50.340
He could have done more

59:50.340 --> 59:55.700
In his defense that was a sweet fucking ring. It was a beautiful ring

59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.220
I see like I see like young

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:08.100
Black women like millennial black women on twitter who are like like like going like

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:13.460
Trying to rally like the democratic cause and then they're like up against like

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.300
This thing that's like you can't even you can't dismiss it

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:24.020
Like we got behind hillary and she lost and so there's like this thing

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.740
That's like we're looking down the barrel of this thing or it's like

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.180
Don't look at your watch. I have a show at town

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.220
It's like we're we're gonna go up against this thing like there's just this cloud

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:40.020
Like you got to be on the other side of the cloud and like but we can't get along with each other

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:44.820
Like we're like there's like genuine socialists and I I see everything that they're saying they're like

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:49.300
Yeah, fucking like why do we keep mitigating our language about this? Why do we keep playing ball?

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:54.580
Why are we acting like politicians when it's not going to work? We're in a political debate with professional politicians

01:00:54.580 --> 01:01:01.060
Why don't we just revolt and resist and have resistance mean something and be socialists and leftists and then

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:09.220
Yeah, so that's 30 of our 900 audience and then there's the other people that are just like fuck man

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:14.900
No, we got to get behind one boulder and push it otherwise the boulder is not going to go anywhere because it's up

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.700
It's up against another boulder. It's like all the evil people

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:22.580
They have no problem getting along because they all agree that they should just lie and hang out like like

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:27.220
So everybody so then those people equally sensible to me are like no

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:32.900
Let's be Democrats because how else are we going to win you got a if you don't like pepsi if pepsi's owned by hitler

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.060
Guess what you love coke

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:41.460
And I hate that I hate that I hate that I hate fucking being forced to drink coke just because pepsi's hitler

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.460
I had to fucking sucks

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:48.420
But what are you gonna do be Sierra missed and have no one drink you ever

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:56.580
Just despite corn syrup, I don't know what to do so I want to kill myself

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.220
Because I don't want to be I don't want to be a passive party to it

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.460
I just want to just go quietly into my mansion and just

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.220
Write a little note and then say hope you like season three

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.420

I mean, what do you do jimmy corain? I don't mean to see me

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.300
I don't mean to say your last name

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.980
Like an attack

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.980

What well, who'd you vote for I voted in the primary I voted for bernie sanders and then

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:15.220
And then I had huge resentment towards uh

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:20.980
The democratic party because I didn't like how they traded treated bernie sanders and I didn't vote

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.980
Wow

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.660
I'll respect his bravery. Yeah, that wasn't gonna be a fun thing to say out loud

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.040
It's time to open up a can of privilege

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.660
I needed you I needed you

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.860
White people we trusted you

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.140
Fucking up without a rack war

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:50.660
And then we let you run around and this is what you fucking do

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.860
Well, we taking that shit back

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:59.700
We taking it back the next candidate we run is going to be a black burn victim

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.180
Who's in a wheelchair just to send you a message?

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.020
God damn it

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.060
You don't know what to do because you never had to fight

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.860
You shouldn't be fighting right now because we shouldn't be this far gone, but neither we are

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:17.700
That's what you do. You get involved. God damn it

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.060
Is there is there a connection you think between

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:31.620
Jimmy not voting in the in the election and dan wanting to kill himself like

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:38.020
It's both these two people that didn't get their way and kind of don't want to do what they think is the hard work

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.180
They need to do and just kind of having a little tantrum or no offense

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:45.300
Yes, no, none taken. I mean some taken but

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:50.020
But isn't there similarness there? I mean it seems like it might just be I mean

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:54.900
Last week we talked about white fragility, but it's fragility. Yeah, no offense to me

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:59.380
I I thank you so much for your honesty, by the way. This is a very great discussion to have

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:06.180
But I don't know it's just it's it's this thing, you know, right the people who aren't used to dealing with adversity

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:11.380
They deal with adversity and they kind of don't know how to deal with it because they're not, you know, conditioned to do it

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:17.220
Like uh underprivileged people tend to be well and the thing is dan you still have hope for the democratic party

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:24.100
I've totally like I feel betrayed by the democratic party and I feel like both parties like are taking corporate money

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:31.220
Yeah, I'm totally hopeless about that. Yeah, and I was never I was never this is like my entree into politics

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:36.260
Because I was like I always looked at the bipartisan system as being part of one big fucking Pringles sham

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:40.180
Where it was like, oh, what do you like ranch or cool ranch?

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.180
Um

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:49.860
And then we elected a fucking legit Nazi and I was like holy shit. How do we fight this and I started like analyzing it

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.140
It was like wait

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:57.060
You can't be in the resistance and also be surrounded by hip people all the time

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:06.660
Like you're gonna some sometimes be around morons if you represent the interest of a majority of people

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.700
Uh because most people are stupid

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:15.220
But if you if you're on the side that the rebellion's on in the star wars universe, it's like, yeah, there's a guy

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.660
This is fat wing x-wing guys who you wanted to die

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.820
It's like it's like you got to just go

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.420
Oh the galaxy's made up of a bunch of different people and like like who knows

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.860
Slugs get along with the lobsters or whatever the fuck who cares?

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:33.380
But I know I don't want to be fucking christopher lee like pinching people's necks shut just because they don't look

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:38.900
They don't dress like a girl scout like I like I don't I don't side with the death star period

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.380
How about we don't judge the people we're trying to help?

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:42.980
What's that?

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:47.060
We don't judge the people we're trying to help well, you can't yeah, you can't be like a populist

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:52.580
You can't you can't like go like oh, I believe that every but that a society should be judged by

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:59.940
The quality of life of its less least fortunate people and then simultaneously be like that dude smells like a shoe

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:06.340
Um, you can't you can give a homeless dude a dollar and still say he smells like piss and you don't want him to sit on your couch

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.540
But at least go the step of giving the mother fucker a dollar

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:15.540
It's just I think the guys like me and jimmy like we're we're taught with like we're used to that stuff

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:21.060
But we're not used to like the laser line dividing like it's that it's that that laser line

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:25.940
That divides the bernie crap from the hillary krat or whatever like we had an easy I

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:33.460
I except that I did not vote I vote I like I was I was I was behind bernie and hoped that bernie would like

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.260
I was like go go bernie and I stayed out of it because of the gender thing because I did not want to

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.860
Like I was like this is trouble. This is a hot button

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:48.340
And we know the last thing we need is divisiveness right right now and then once she had secured the nomination

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:50.740
I was like fucking are at full steam ahead

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.340
Let's all vote for her because she's a democrat and we need to defeat these nazis

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.340
so but but

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:02.580
But you know and it's just that's stinking thinking to 30% of you who who who cheered for the other thing

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.980
And I don't want those people dismissed because they're smart people

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.660
But but but like yeah, that's that's that's where I was at

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:14.180
You know the truth because I didn't show up for no primary vote because I was like this whole system's a piece of shit

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.940
Why don't we fuck your primaries?

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:20.660
This is a bipartisan system of these people built a fucking government on top of our constitution

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:25.700
Fuck these assholes like it's garbage like fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck them in the eye

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:26.900
but

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.260
Goddamn it

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:34.420
Fuck away one of one half of them has been hacked the half of the fucked up system has been hacked

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:39.140
By a cancer by a virus. They've moved in

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:46.820
White nationalist actual nazis possibly russian spies don't even go there just forget all the russia gate

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:50.260
They're just white nationalists. They hacked the republican party

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.540
Our dream that the bipartisan system which has been shoved down our throat since we were born

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:01.700
Like would collapse that dream came true in a way that maybe is not as convenient for us as we thought it would be

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:08.260
Like starting with the republicans going like oh fuck it hitler's running. Okay. Well as long as he's wearing a red hat

01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.500
um

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.020
That represented the end of the republican party like if we live through this

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.020
I don't know how you're gonna

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:21.140
You know the republicans could be fucking dead and that's a great thing on the other side

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:28.260
The democrats are also got hacked in the sense that there was a socialist running on the democratic ticket

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:35.300
Like when I went my first vote was for uh ross perot. I was 18 years old and I was like fucking let's do it

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.500
um

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.820
And and he was a third party candidate and third party candidates can't win and all that stuff

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:45.220
So I'm off on a tangent and just saying like I'm 44

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:48.420
I was like like like like okay democrat

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.820
We're democrat then because we have to get this done

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:56.900
But I am sick and tired of being told by this system that we're in a state of fucking emergency the entire time

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.540
When are we ever going to achieve this this unachievable dream where we're voting our conscience?

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.660
And I know that that speaks to privilege. I do I I I know I know how silly that sounds to a democrat

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:09.460
just me

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.820
I

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:15.540
That's the thing is that like like like black women are the ones that are turning me like when I look at them on twitter

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.340
I'm like they're the ones that are putting up at the most shit. They're the ones that

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:22.580
It's I'm not like I'm just like I'm looking at

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.500
I think the statue of liberty now is just like a black woman a black millennial woman who is like fuck it

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:34.100
I've been hurt. I don't give a fuck. I still believe in some form of some system

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:40.100
I have every reason to self-destruct, but I'm just going to be a democrat and I'm just going to push this boulder

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:45.220
And we're going to push it and like I look at them as being heroes right now because they're not being treated very

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.700
Like like people are just coming. You know, they have to deal with the meet-meet moot moops

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:54.340
It's just dudes coming out and going like, you know, no, that's interesting. What about the drone strikes?

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.340
What about the emails?

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.660
I love that a black woman come home from work is like man. It goddamn meet meet meet moot

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:04.100
I don't know what to do jimmy crane. I don't know what to do. I don't know what we're supposed to do

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.580
We're supposed to ask the first thing you should do is ask another white person

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.260
About how to lead you out of some treacherous moments

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:15.780
I didn't hear what he said

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:22.660
And I don't have a clue

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.660
I don't have a clue

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.660
I don't have a clue

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:30.660
I said I don't have a clue

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.660
And I don't have to

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.180
Turn his mic off turn his mic off

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:43.780
Let's fix let's fix america with an amazing uh scene. Let's use our stagecraft

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:54.100
Right, I don't know that's what it's for man. Yeah, you've been awful quiet 30 rocks. Yeah, you vote for it. Yeah

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:01.620
You are uncomfortable with this one, aren't you till Tina have to pay who you voted for

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.380
I voted for trump

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.420
You're not joking

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.420
Jesus christ on a cracker

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:14.580
It's the first of april everyone. It is the first of april

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.260
I was ready to go by 10 minutes on how I support you

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:24.740
Did you really vote for trump? No, okay

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.660
Since I've known you in columbia you're getting to be a better and better actor

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:41.220
Uh, uh, I can't believe that was so convincing

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:48.740
What if america was a child born, okay at the dawn of progress

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.740
Yes

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:08.900
He's beautiful. Yes, he is

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.740
I want poor people

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:18.340
Bill I don't know about this one

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:26.820
He wants poor people now what self-respecting little baby would want poor people. Hmm. Give me your weary

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.900
Your wretched masses

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.140
I want to hang out with the dirty folk

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:41.540
I'm worried about the boy because no baby full of immigrants can succeed

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.060
You're right bill

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.900
Apox upon you mother and father

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.500
Don't you talk to Europe like that?

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:59.460
I'll talk how I want I have freedom of speech

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:03.780
The right to assemble all my dirty parts

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.540
I will learn to do skateboard tricks

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.740
And if you come to invade me

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:16.660
You'll be so tired from the trip that you won't be able to deal with the fact that we fight like indians now

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.060
Bill is this what

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:23.220
Bill is this what happened when we're on fertility? I mean this I don't understand this

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.460
What are you doing? I'm learning to skateboard

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.180
You're too young to be riding a skateboard

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.820
I love tea in the harbor

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.820
I love suffrage

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.740
For everyone but black people and women

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:47.060
I feel like I want to interpret his movements as some symbol of something

01:14:47.060 --> 01:15:00.580
I'm 14 now in america years that means it's 1812 we know what it means yes it does

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.940
Your mother now has menopause

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.300
And we've gone through a strange confusing war

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:12.180
During which the white house was burnt to the ground by a canadian advancing army

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:16.020
Oh, please don't bring that up not in this house. He's very bookish. Yes

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:21.140
Mind your own business. I want my own room. I'm an isolationist

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:31.140
Bill, he's been up there for hours. What are you doing up there young man?

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:38.580
I smell something funny. Are you gonna do something? Sorry, I didn't mean to talk over you

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:44.820
It's there's only telegram technology, so that's how the wars happen stop

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:54.020
Finally bill you're disciplining him. He's been talking over me since he's been born

01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:00.500
I have learned from the chinese and mexicans that there's such a thing as opium and marijuana

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.820
I am having a great time

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:12.020
How old are you now 17 which makes it 1848

So grandpa's divine, right? Didn't earn you anything at the bank mo fuck

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.380
We're thinking maybe we did some things wrong. We'd like to try it again

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:56.020
Oh, would you like to supplant your existing class system based on inheritance with a new one based on a meritocracy?

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.180
Let's not go too far

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.060
The class system works

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:06.340
Well, I'll believe it when I see it bill. I told you this wouldn't work with him. He's just

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.860
Money's everything let's just imitate him for a while. I think that's a good idea

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.180
Look at the end of the day. Nothing else has worked with him

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:28.980

You can now make a dollar inside a dollar with an integrated dollar chip

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:11.780
That makes multiple dollars come out and go up through a raganomic chip onto an internet

01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:16.420
And just trust me. There's no more gold back in anything. It's just dollars

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:23.540
I'm sure I don't think it really came mainstream. It was like when cable first came it didn't really come it took 10 years

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.900

It's kind of a knee-jerk reaction a lot of people are thinking the same way you are right now

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:12.500
You fuck think the same way france. Fuck your french fries

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.740
Hello

01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.740
Hi

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.740
Hi

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:45.380
You look fantastic son. Yes, I don't have much time to talk to you. I've got a lot of drone strikes to do

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.820
Okay

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:58.820
There's been no change to the existing class system, but I'm wearing a suit. I'm very sick. You look fantastic

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:04.420
Yes, I didn't even recognize you. Yep. It must be the 4% unemployment

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.460
It looks good on you

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.420
So, uh

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.420
I don't need anything from you

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.940
Uh, just thought I'd come by and

01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:22.340
Again, you look just you look fantastic. Yeah, you've dropped a lot of uh cynicism

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:27.540
Your father's too proud to say this your father. Well, uh, you should probably

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:31.540
Not pigeonhole him into a gender role. Wow. Wow

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:38.020
He might be my mother. I don't know. Okay. Well

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:41.780
You know, he's got that heart thing

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:46.980
We all have a heart thing. Well, I'm talking about it has a heart thing and america has a heart thing

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:49.220
Wow

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.940
I can't believe it. Well, anyways, it's

01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.660
You know like a serious heart thing

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.660
And he needs medical

01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:03.620
Can you know medical coverage and we just don't seem to all our money is going to

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:08.180
Insurance say y'all want money or we'll die

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.340
Oh, what is that odor?

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:19.940
Oh my god

01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:21.940
Oh no, no

01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:25.540
Oh god, something's coming out of his stomach. Remember me, bitch

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.580
It's the 80s. No

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.180
It's unexplainable. Oh my god

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:41.300
How did the 80s spring out of that perfect man? I don't know. It's got the head of reagan. We never broke up

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.700
We just took a long break, bitch

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:49.780
But I thought you were gonna say you were gonna help us with health insurance. Yeah surprise, bitch

01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:51.780
Oh

01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:56.660
No more need for wit when you've got it

01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:06.500
I'm america. It's 2016. I'm 45 years old. I guess if you're following the

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:13.860
I'm gonna masturbate. Oh, I have knives on my fingers. It hurts, but I won't admit it. Ow

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:22.180
Ow, I'm pretending. It feels great. I'm gonna come any minute now. I'm not mangling my penis

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:31.860
Oh god, it hurts. Oh god. Oh god. It hurts. I'm bleeding to death, but the blood is good. The blood is calm

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.580
I come red come

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.100
Oh

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:38.100
Coal is important. Oh

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:41.780
Oh

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:49.060
Oh, I was never racist ever. I was never racist. You were supposed to take care of us

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:52.260
Uh, I want a divorce

01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:56.900
Oh shit

01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.980
I'm just gonna take a

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:01.540
I'm gonna exit this marriage

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.060
It's a mexit

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.900
A mexit

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.900
Bye-bye. Oh

01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:20.980
No, oh no. Oh shit

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:30.340
I hope one of his spies doesn't have a dossier on me getting pissed on

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.380
I'm proud I did it

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.020
That's my right to be taken care of

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.460
Mom

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:46.580
There's nothing more I can do, bitch

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.900
Maternity is a disease

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.460
Pregnancy is your fault

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:58.980
I won't help you not get pregnant if you do get pregnant. It's your problem

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:04.580
If you have a miscarriage, you have to carry the dead baby around until you die yourself

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.420
If you lactate, I don't lactate

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:13.540
If you live in a trailer park, I don't understand

01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:17.540
Anything about what you need

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:23.380
I don't understand if you're france or women

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.380
I

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.220
That about sums you up

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.380
I never

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:42.260
I never expected to be here. I didn't know I didn't want this. I didn't think this would ever happen

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:44.740
That's why my symbol is

01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:50.580
Just a frog from a cartoon that didn't it's everything about me is unintentional

01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:56.420
It almost suggests outside collusion from a foreign power, but I won't I'm gonna get into that

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:04.100
Look, you keep looking at me and you're looking at me like you want me to fucking change

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.500
Yes, I do

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:08.980
Do not listen to them America

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:17.780
Keep drinking imported vodka and fucking our beautiful beautiful prostitutes

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:21.140
We have some of the best prostitutes in the world that pee on you

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:34.900
I'm sorry. I have to go now. All right. I guess I'll just be left alone. I hope that you

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.020
Are NATO

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:46.740
Escalator escalator escalator

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.340
Welcome to Tromsky Tower

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:52.340
Thank you

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:59.300
We knew you would eventually be here when you got tired of the blacks and the mexicans. Oh, I hate everything. That's not white

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.820
So do we

01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:05.860
You should have seen what we did to the chinese

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:09.620
It's oh so many chinese people angry

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:12.660
too soon

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.860
Anyway, I don't listen to american crying

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.980
I just got to a point where I couldn't have anything to be proud of anymore

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:24.420
So it got down to what I was born as

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.300
We were watching you had no direction

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:34.580
You didn't know whether you wanted oil or to save the world or to conserve or to spend in the end

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:41.140
Specialness was all anyone wanted. We all want to be special. No one wants to say. I'm a part of something

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:43.460
That's why even the most elite

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:51.380
liberal white chic people when not given control over their own world will just retreat into suicidal

01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:54.180
drama

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:56.180
You are talking about Dan Harmon

01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.940
Jimmy corain, yes

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:04.420
Uh, uh, that's it voted for trump. Thank you Scott. That's it

01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:12.500
In the end, I guess I failed because no small part of me wanted to just be a small part of me

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:19.300
It's ironic given that the greatest part of me john f kennedy or my spleen

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:25.860
Once never not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:28.580
also ironic that he

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.580
Then was shot

01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.820
I was gonna say that he objectified women

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.140
But he got away with it because he's better looking

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:39.700
Uh

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:44.020
We are splitting hairs right and then we have no hairs left to sweat right

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.140
You and me poody

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:49.780
You are going to love the future

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.020
All white

01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.420
Beautiful even africa would be white

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.140
We'll grow oranges there

01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:03.220
I can't wait. I love oranges. I love white people. I love white skin

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.580
Take me there now

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.820
Take me. Oh, you're already there

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:11.540
I'm there

01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:13.540
Here we are together

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:15.620
But it just looks like a

01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:18.580
Like the architect's office and the matrix reloaded

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:21.300
It's just a

01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.620
What do you mean? It's just a room full of tv's

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:26.420
It wasn't gonna be fun

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:31.140
You you tricked me. Yes. I wanted the earth

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:37.860
Yes, but you were going to bring along rap music and uh high high fat foods foot popular people made me popular

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.980
We made you popular. No

01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:47.140
I gotta get out. I want to make america great. Ask your parents for help

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:54.980
No, and a scene

01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.940
We did it

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.900
We did it. Wow, we solved the problems

01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:06.420
We changed the world

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:12.820
Uh, I think we I think we revealed that we we read a lot about politics

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.860
You do it's obvious. I don't

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:20.900
What what time is it? Is it we should do that show at high schools? So kids learn

01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:27.380
Or getting close to we're getting there we can wrap it up with like uh

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:33.220
Like I I people like they like to come and they like to hear the uh rapping skills of me

01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:43.220
You give me a thumbs up on the rapping. Yeah, if you can make music

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:46.900
And then when you guys leave here, you can go watch Rick and Morty. It's like running on a

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.420
Maybe you'll like it

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:56.100
All right, there may be a couple false starts because it's been a it's been a an intense show

01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.820
It was an okay one

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.140
Like my energy's lagging. I just got I just let me get in the flow

Your daddy's a piece of shit. He's just a dick and balls on a stick

01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:27.300
Men are dumb

He ate the poo and he said that's good. I took him outside and made him chop wood

01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.860
He was an indentured servant to me

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.820
Then I made him drink my pee
