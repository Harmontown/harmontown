{"content":"WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:18.400\nHey everybody, welcome to the beautiful Dine-A-C typewriter, how's everybody doing tonight?\n\n00:18.400 --> 00:25.760\nHarmontown is now in session, you know what that means, let's give it up for our Dungeon\n\n00:25.760 --> 00:42.280\nMaster Spencer Crittenden, I'm Rob Trabbe, I'm cop trolling tonight, thanks mom, let's\n\n00:42.280 --> 00:55.920\ngive it up for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon, yeah, Dan Harmon, yeah.\n\n00:55.920 --> 01:07.320\nThank you, thank you to my friends for showing up and supporting me, thank you, thank you\n\n01:07.320 --> 01:15.760\nto the audience for coming in and standing in line and buying a ticket at the right\n\n01:15.760 --> 01:16.760\ntime.\n\n01:16.760 --> 01:23.200\nDamn, seems like back in the day you used to not come here the regular way, you used\n\n01:23.200 --> 01:30.760\nto come in a different way, and now it just seems like every time you come this other way.\n\n01:30.760 --> 01:42.320\nWhat happened to us, damn, I want to bring that back till the break is done, making love\n\n01:42.320 --> 01:47.640\nto you, damn.\n\n01:47.640 --> 01:54.920\nOkay, all right, what was the name of that song?\n\n01:54.920 --> 01:58.200\nI don't know, back in the day.\n\n01:58.200 --> 02:05.680\nSo effort, lazy, lazy, lazy comedically, lazy creatively, lazy musically.\n\n02:05.680 --> 02:13.240\nLazy opener, yeah, but also kind of in a positive way, like rolling out into the ocean, not a\n\n02:13.240 --> 02:19.760\nbeached whale, the original whale to become a whale, after going like, I don't want to\n\n02:19.760 --> 02:26.280\nbe a giant hippo, there's no market for this, I took a wrong turn at the Albuquerque of\n\n02:26.280 --> 02:33.360\nTarwinian progress, like I somehow am basically like a big, blubbery pig on a beach.\n\n02:33.360 --> 02:39.080\nIf these giant ham hocks were flippers, I could be the most powerful fucker in the ocean.\n\n02:39.080 --> 02:42.960\nI'm doing it, I'm going back, Todd, don't!\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:50.600\nThose are pre-whale, pre-aquatic whales, Steve Levy, Ice Bucket.\n\n02:50.600 --> 03:04.160\nPre-whales, pre-whales, I went back to the water whale that I am, I also went back to\n\n03:04.160 --> 03:13.000\nthe water, hey guys, what was I, am I not supposed to interpret that as you, he's practicing\n\n03:13.000 --> 03:20.320\nhe needs to get in some errors, Rob is practicing hosting, because he's going to moderate run\n\n03:20.320 --> 03:24.520\na Red Lobster.\n\n03:24.520 --> 03:35.440\nTable for five, follow that guy, pretty easy, pretty, doesn't seem that hard, a lot of the\n\n03:35.440 --> 03:41.640\nwork seems to be being done by that guy and even the customer, follow that guy, yeah.\n\n03:41.640 --> 03:45.440\nIt's a bit easy, it's not too, it's a bit easy.\n\n03:45.440 --> 03:54.160\nWhat is the deal with, when you go to a restaurant that has a host and also waiter people, is\n\n03:54.160 --> 04:02.400\nthe host, is that a person, is it like the military, is it like the military where officer\n\n04:02.400 --> 04:08.480\nschool is different from enlisted men, I was surprised to find out that never the twain\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:09.480\nshall meet.\n\n04:09.480 --> 04:13.360\nYeah, the hosts are on the fast track, they get promoted to metal manager or whatever.\n\n04:13.360 --> 04:16.440\nThey've never scrubbed a dish, possibly some of them have, some of them haven't, but at\n\n04:16.440 --> 04:19.960\nany rate, that's not really, they're like, I'd like to host.\n\n04:19.960 --> 04:23.440\nWell I believe that host is usually where you start and then you work up to waiter because\n\n04:23.440 --> 04:25.320\nthen you get tips.\n\n04:25.320 --> 04:35.520\nOh, the host is more like a shadow program, like Wonder Mutt at the Hall of Justice, yeah.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:42.160\nI understand that sound you made, well because you're picturing a laborer and now I'm comparing\n\n04:42.160 --> 04:43.640\nthem to an animal.\n\n04:43.640 --> 04:44.640\nYes.\n\n04:44.640 --> 04:48.040\nBut what an animal.\n\n04:48.040 --> 04:50.560\nFirst name is Wonder, yeah, exactly.\n\n04:50.560 --> 04:55.880\nI was more thinking in terms of the strata, like where you start, you're kind of in training\n\n04:55.880 --> 05:00.800\nbecause you're kind of like hanging back, but when you're the customer, you're perceiving\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:06.680\nthe host as like some kind of, like they have power over things, I don't know, or at least\n\n05:06.680 --> 05:07.680\nI did.\n\n05:07.680 --> 05:12.140\nYeah, they have a power over hospitality, like they're welcoming you.\n\n05:12.140 --> 05:16.360\nIt feels like it's their place, but no, they can't even wait.\n\n05:16.360 --> 05:26.240\nI'm very conscious of my body today, I was inventorying my mood, that's a new word, inventorying,\n\n05:26.240 --> 05:36.360\nand I was like, I think maybe consciousness of your body should be like a mood, like sometimes\n\n05:36.360 --> 05:39.720\nyou just feel, you're just like, there's nothing you're going to be able to do, sometimes\n\n05:39.720 --> 05:46.400\nyou feel a little handsome.\n\n05:46.400 --> 05:52.120\nThat's not, no, I did a little bit there at the end, I rift, I was like, go 90 degrees\n\n05:52.120 --> 05:58.640\nnow, because like, what are you doing, you're telling them you feel fat, like what is your\n\n05:58.640 --> 06:03.320\nshow and who are you, why are you talking into a microphone, who are they, what are\n\n06:03.320 --> 06:04.320\nthey supposed to think about themselves?\n\n06:04.320 --> 06:11.880\nWe're going to answer all these questions tonight on Dan Harmon's Harmontown.\n\n06:11.880 --> 06:22.720\nSo Rob's going to be moderating the Rick and Morty Comic-Con panel, so he wants to practice\n\n06:22.720 --> 06:23.720\nhosting.\n\n06:23.720 --> 06:31.920\nYeah, I want to practice, and I don't want it to turn into Harmontown, because no one\n\n06:31.920 --> 06:34.200\nwins that way.\n\n06:34.200 --> 06:39.360\nBut you want to, well, yeah, and you picked a great place to practice.\n\n06:39.360 --> 06:45.000\nWell, no, no, no, hear me out, I'm usually not comptrolling, I'm usually here, and I\n\n06:45.000 --> 06:49.280\nusually come out, and you ignore me, and the only way I'm going to make it worth my drive\n\n06:49.280 --> 06:57.240\nhere is pissing you off, so if I'm comptrolling, I'm kind of, you know, I have a job to do,\n\n06:57.240 --> 07:03.800\nyou've said hi to me tonight, so, you know, bonus, win, win, win.\n\n07:03.800 --> 07:07.360\nI've got so much win.\n\n07:07.360 --> 07:14.800\nIt is different, maybe I'm an elitist, and I think of hosts differently than guests,\n\n07:14.800 --> 07:23.080\nand busboys, like, it's connected, I'm thinking the same thing at a Benignans as I am in my\n\n07:23.080 --> 07:25.800\nstage craft, which hosts are important.\n\n07:25.800 --> 07:29.320\nYou've done how many Comic-Con panels?\n\n07:29.320 --> 07:31.480\nLet's be serious for a second.\n\n07:31.480 --> 07:36.800\nWell, okay, so probably, there's been, like, what, three Rick and Morty ones, and then\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:38.840\nyeah, about three or five news.\n\n07:38.840 --> 07:41.560\nWell, let's just talk about Rick and Morty, okay, just talk about him.\n\n07:41.560 --> 07:45.400\nOkay, well, I'll go four, I think Rick and Morty's probably got four big panels.\n\n07:45.400 --> 07:49.160\nWhat are some do's and don'ts?\n\n07:49.160 --> 07:55.400\nGive me, start with the do's, go.\n\n07:55.400 --> 07:57.680\nNumber one.\n\n07:57.680 --> 08:04.320\nI think, well, I think that big crowd dynamics in general, but you and I wrote on awards\n\n08:04.320 --> 08:06.440\nshows together.\n\n08:06.440 --> 08:07.440\nOne and Emmy.\n\n08:07.440 --> 08:08.440\nKid.\n\n08:08.440 --> 08:13.720\nBut, you know, and so you're familiar with the kind, I don't have to advise you on this,\n\n08:13.720 --> 08:19.560\nbut it's like, Hall H is like 3,000 people, like, or 6,000, how many does Hall H hold?\n\n08:19.560 --> 08:20.560\nMany, many thousands.\n\n08:20.560 --> 08:21.560\nI don't think that'll be a problem.\n\n08:21.560 --> 08:22.560\nMy voice kind of carries.\n\n08:22.560 --> 08:28.760\nYou know, crowds are different, like 150 people, like they, it's like you could get\n\n08:28.760 --> 08:33.000\na laugh off of clearing your throat at the right time or taking the right pause and there's\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:37.840\nan interface and then the larger the crowd gets, it's not, they're dumber, it's just\n\n08:37.840 --> 08:44.720\nthat they're kind of wearing gloves on their feelings, so like you're, it just, people\n\n08:44.720 --> 08:48.680\nmake the mistake of thinking that that means that you have to dumb everything down.\n\n08:48.680 --> 08:55.400\nIt's very close to that, but it's not, I think that's a negative thing to think that 3,000\n\n08:55.400 --> 09:02.200\npeople aren't smarter than 150 people, but just in a different way.\n\n09:02.200 --> 09:10.880\nThey're like, you're dealing with like a kind of like more of a on-off, like Frankenstein\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:16.480\nswitch than a light switch in terms of like, you want to like be big and crisp with your\n\n09:16.480 --> 09:23.800\nhair, hey, who here wants to react to the word sandwich?\n\n09:23.800 --> 09:28.920\nAnd then you're like, shugunk, you know, well then it's just, it's just more, it's more\n\n09:28.920 --> 09:33.480\nof a big, it's a bigger, simpler, but more powerful machine.\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:38.160\nIs there anybody here going to Comic Con this year, anybody?\n\n09:38.160 --> 09:39.160\nTwo people.\n\n09:39.160 --> 09:40.160\nTwo people.\n\n09:40.160 --> 09:41.160\nAll right.\n\n09:41.160 --> 09:42.160\nWe'll see you in there.\n\n09:42.160 --> 09:43.160\nWe'll see you in this room.\n\n09:43.160 --> 09:46.360\nThat's riveting.\n\n09:46.360 --> 09:48.720\nMaybe they've seen you enough.\n\n09:48.720 --> 09:49.720\nYeah.\n\n09:49.720 --> 09:56.440\nSo, sorry, and then let's segue into, one of your jobs is going to be to introduce everybody.\n\n09:56.440 --> 09:57.440\nRight.\n\n09:57.440 --> 10:00.760\nIs there a story of somebody not doing that, right?\n\n10:00.760 --> 10:01.760\nNo.\n\n10:01.760 --> 10:02.760\nNo.\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:03.760\nNo.\n\n10:03.760 --> 10:07.120\nWe, we, we, we, We didn't Ryan Ridley come out dressed like...\n\n10:07.120 --> 10:09.480\nYou guys remember Ryan Ridley?\n\n10:09.480 --> 10:14.760\nWell, I will, I will, I will let Ryan Ridley, I think we've already talked about it on the\n\n10:14.760 --> 10:15.760\nshow.\n\n10:15.760 --> 10:19.200\nRyan does a great job of explaining, like, what, what, what, what, what.\n\n10:19.200 --> 10:20.440\nI watched it online.\n\n10:20.440 --> 10:27.480\nIt was way funnier than you told it, because it's, Ryan, Ryan, for those of you who don't\n\n10:27.480 --> 10:31.520\nknow what we're talking about, Ryan Ridley, who was a writer on Rick and Morty, came out,\n\n10:31.520 --> 10:37.520\nhe moderated, and he dressed up like a king of whatever, you know, something.\n\n10:37.520 --> 10:41.480\nHe was a king, but like a king from a pack of cards almost.\n\n10:41.480 --> 10:42.480\nRight.\n\n10:42.480 --> 10:45.680\nHe spent, he didn't like go, oh, I'm going to make a crown.\n\n10:45.680 --> 10:48.840\nAnd I'm going to get like my, oh, shitty wig or whatever.\n\n10:48.840 --> 10:51.520\nHe spent some time on this costume.\n\n10:51.520 --> 10:56.440\nAnd then he comes out and he, like, and it's a huge room.\n\n10:56.440 --> 10:58.200\nSo the silence is deafening.\n\n10:58.200 --> 11:06.160\nSo he comes out and he's like, eh, expecting people to be laughing already.\n\n11:06.160 --> 11:07.720\nAnd it's, he sits there for a long time.\n\n11:07.720 --> 11:13.200\nBecause the joke was, and it's a brilliant joke, Ryan's very, he's a genius, like, like\n\n11:13.200 --> 11:20.160\nthe joke was that Game of Thrones panel was after ours and he was just there to, you know,\n\n11:20.160 --> 11:25.000\nkill the time, like, like the audience was waiting for, to get, he, he took the moderating\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:27.920\ngig so he could be at the Game of Thrones panel kind of thing.\n\n11:27.920 --> 11:29.320\nIt didn't go over well.\n\n11:29.320 --> 11:33.760\nWell, because again, he looked like a deck of cards and he never said who he was.\n\n11:33.760 --> 11:39.680\nYeah, he never, he never said, he didn't really kind of set up the bit for it to land.\n\n11:39.680 --> 11:44.520\nWell, and also, like, after it kind of like hit the skids, my memory is that he also never\n\n11:44.520 --> 11:48.640\nat any point said, by the way, my name is Ryan Ridley, I work on the show.\n\n11:48.640 --> 11:55.200\nI'm responsible for you, you like me, you just don't know, like, because a lot of the\n\n11:55.200 --> 12:01.360\npanels will be moderated by like some guy from Buzzfeed or something and I'm not diminishing\n\n12:01.360 --> 12:02.360\nthat.\n\n12:02.360 --> 12:05.800\nIt's just that people are used to in those halls with like, we don't, we don't, this\n\n12:05.800 --> 12:11.960\nperson may be good at this job, bad at this job, inevitably who cares?\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:17.040\nBecause like, what is being good or bad at that job, like, when the people are like,\n\n12:17.040 --> 12:22.240\nI just think the people are there to like, like, I don't want to use the word worship\n\n12:22.240 --> 12:27.560\nbecause we tend to punish, like, you know, like we, I don't know, we have like a negative\n\n12:27.560 --> 12:34.240\nview of like fandom in general kind of still, but, but like, you know, Comic Con is a mecca,\n\n12:34.240 --> 12:39.160\nwe have journeyed there, blah, blah, blah, it is, the Kool-Aid is real.\n\n12:39.160 --> 12:43.640\nIt's like, it's like, it's, it's, the Kool-Aid doesn't kill you, it's just good to drink\n\n12:43.640 --> 12:44.640\nit.\n\n12:44.640 --> 12:46.360\nAnd it take, because it's Kool-Aid, it tastes great.\n\n12:46.360 --> 12:50.920\nAnd it's like, the people are in this room of like, at least we can all fucking express\n\n12:50.920 --> 12:56.680\nthat we love the Simpsons for the next 45 minutes without loving it wrong or like someone\n\n12:56.680 --> 12:59.760\nlike letting us know that it was ugly the way we liked the Simpsons.\n\n12:59.760 --> 13:02.880\nIt's like, it's like, it's just, there's something really powerful about that that\n\n13:02.880 --> 13:07.320\nprobably is the same thing going on at a Grateful Dead concert, Burning Man, whatever.\n\n13:07.320 --> 13:12.080\nWhy am I explaining audiences?\n\n13:12.080 --> 13:15.680\nWhy don't we practice bringing people out, because that's going to be a big, that's the\n\n13:15.680 --> 13:16.680\nmoderator thing.\n\n13:16.680 --> 13:22.240\nIt's like, they're like there and, and like, they're like, who does this guy think he is?\n\n13:22.240 --> 13:27.040\nThe meters, that meter's running, because like, it's like,\n\n13:27.040 --> 13:30.840\nBut according to you, there's no way I can screw this up.\n\n13:30.840 --> 13:36.960\nWell, what about like, you're saying, you're saying, who cares?\n\n13:36.960 --> 13:40.240\nSo I should just go on and be myself.\n\n13:40.240 --> 13:41.240\nOh yeah.\n\n13:41.240 --> 13:42.240\nThey'll love that.\n\n13:42.240 --> 13:43.440\nWhy don't you bring someone out?\n\n13:43.440 --> 13:44.440\nOkay.\n\n13:44.440 --> 13:55.400\nLadies and gentlemen, from his tour of America, is Jeff Bryan Davis from Whose Line Is It\n\n13:55.400 --> 14:00.920\nAnyway?\n\n14:00.920 --> 14:03.040\nWelcome back.\n\n14:03.040 --> 14:06.600\nThis is Jeff Davis's first win.\n\n14:06.600 --> 14:12.360\nHe's been on many different episodes of this podcast.\n\n14:12.360 --> 14:13.360\nJeff Davis.\n\n14:13.360 --> 14:14.360\nJeff Davis.\n\n14:14.360 --> 14:16.920\nJeff Davis is now doing.\n\n14:16.920 --> 14:17.920\nOh no.\n\n14:17.920 --> 14:18.920\nOh damn.\n\n14:18.920 --> 14:19.920\nOkay.\n\n14:19.920 --> 14:20.920\nOkay.\n\n14:20.920 --> 14:21.920\nOkay.\n\n14:21.920 --> 14:22.920\nAll

okay.\n\n14:34.600 --> 14:39.280\nOh, well, if you're going to do it that way.\n\n14:39.280 --> 14:44.760\nThat's like the fifth time I've made out with a man for comedy in 20 years and like,\n\n14:44.760 --> 14:46.000\nbut it's all potent now.\n\n14:46.000 --> 14:50.960\nLike I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry, I was like, is there, the whole time I was going, Oh,\n\n14:50.960 --> 14:54.000\nis there such a thing called, is there gay face now?\n\n14:54.000 --> 14:56.480\nIs there like a, like Jeff Davis?\n\n14:56.480 --> 14:57.480\nWhat do you think?\n\n14:57.480 --> 14:58.480\nIs there gay face?\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:02.120\nHey, that's a great interviewing question.\n\n15:02.120 --> 15:03.320\nThank you.\n\n15:03.320 --> 15:05.520\nYou are fucking ready to go.\n\n15:05.520 --> 15:07.360\nYou know, I've been rehearsing.\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:08.360\nYeah.\n\n15:08.360 --> 15:09.520\nThe pump has been primed.\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:10.520\nYou are ready.\n\n15:10.520 --> 15:13.960\nBut I was also distracted by your tender lips.\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:17.000\nIt was a loved kissing.\n\n15:17.000 --> 15:19.200\nIt got kind of good there.\n\n15:19.200 --> 15:21.120\nI was like, I was like, I do this.\n\n15:21.120 --> 15:24.920\nThere was a moment when we crossed, I mean, I don't know about you, I felt we crossed\n\n15:24.920 --> 15:30.560\nthe threshold into kind of a, like a, a real thing.\n\n15:30.560 --> 15:31.560\nYeah.\n\n15:31.560 --> 15:38.160\nLike I don't think I've ever felt the tender touch of another human being in the way that\n\n15:38.160 --> 15:40.360\nwe experienced that just now.\n\n15:40.360 --> 15:41.360\nOkay.\n\n15:41.360 --> 15:42.360\nGood.\n\n15:42.360 --> 15:43.360\nSame page club.\n\n15:43.360 --> 15:47.360\nAlso, if you, if you spend $5, you can see this on, for the subscription.\n\n15:47.360 --> 15:48.360\nYeah.\n\n15:48.360 --> 15:52.800\nYou can see Dan and me make up.\n\n15:52.800 --> 15:56.120\nWe never said anything during all of Pride Month, by the way, we miss Pride Month.\n\n15:56.120 --> 15:57.120\nLike, I don't know.\n\n15:57.120 --> 16:00.440\nWe'll say it now.\n\n16:00.440 --> 16:04.760\nI want to remind people that remember our guest, David Cummings, he is like, like Pride Month\n\n16:04.760 --> 16:11.640\ncontinues to be really like, strongly celebrated in horror fiction podcasts, like, or I'll\n\n16:11.640 --> 16:16.760\njust say the no sleep podcast, like they just do a fucking great job of like rolling out\n\n16:16.760 --> 16:23.120\nthe LGBTQ carpet while without, and it's like, it's, it feels, you feel, you feel like you've\n\n16:23.120 --> 16:28.240\ndone something for anyone by listening, but you feel also feel like you're cheating because\n\n16:28.240 --> 16:30.520\nyou're like, but it's better.\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:37.200\nThese stories about stories from gay couple perspectives that are about like not like how\n\n16:37.200 --> 16:41.520\nthat are about like a hook coming through a window or like, it's like, it's more compelling.\n\n16:41.520 --> 16:44.400\nIt's like here, you're, it's, it's better horror.\n\n16:44.400 --> 16:45.400\nRob.\n\n16:45.400 --> 16:47.240\nI have a question for that.\n\n16:47.240 --> 16:49.240\nWhere did the hook come from?\n\n16:49.240 --> 16:50.240\nI don't know.\n\n16:50.240 --> 16:52.800\nI got, I got high before the show interview.\n\n16:52.800 --> 16:56.480\nThe hook coming from the window is cool idea.\n\n16:56.480 --> 17:00.160\nSo what, what, what do you, yeah, like Rob, like, or what do you want to pretend it's\n\n17:00.160 --> 17:03.040\na panel and get real hands on practice there?\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:04.040\nYeah.\n\n17:04.040 --> 17:07.400\nDo you want to do some real like, yes, I guess, but are we pretending that, do you want to\n\n17:07.400 --> 17:08.720\ntry pandering?\n\n17:08.720 --> 17:15.360\nLet's say like, get some pandering in, Dan, or Spencer, why don't you pitch me as a panelist\n\n17:15.360 --> 17:19.920\nlike, like someone that Rob has to interview on the panel, all right, and I'll be that\n\n17:19.920 --> 17:20.920\nperson.\n\n17:20.920 --> 17:23.040\nRob, what do you think about this?\n\n17:23.040 --> 17:28.880\nJeff is the guy who plays Morty.\n\n17:28.880 --> 17:30.600\nOkay.\n\n17:30.600 --> 17:33.240\nSo Justin, yeah.\n\n17:33.240 --> 17:34.400\nOkay.\n\n17:34.400 --> 17:44.920\nSo what's the nastiest, sickest, sexiest, like most like, oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck,\n\n17:44.920 --> 17:52.440\noh, offensive thing that ever happened behind the scenes at Rick and Morty.\n\n17:52.440 --> 18:02.080\nOh, well, one time we were in the edit bay, we were in the edit bay and, and Dan came\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:09.880\ninto the edit bay with me and we just started really, really getting on each other's balls.\n\n18:09.880 --> 18:15.120\nAnd I mean, like, not in like a kissy, like touchy way, but we just, we really got on\n\n18:15.120 --> 18:16.120\neach other's balls.\n\n18:16.120 --> 18:17.120\nOh, that's, yeah.\n\n18:17.120 --> 18:21.880\nAnd that's, and that's how, that's how we broke season four.\n\n18:21.880 --> 18:22.880\nWow.\n\n18:22.880 --> 18:23.880\nOkay.\n\n18:23.880 --> 18:26.480\nIs that why the show takes so long to make?\n\n18:26.480 --> 18:27.480\nYeah.\n\n18:27.480 --> 18:28.720\nThat's another thing you want to hit a lot.\n\n18:28.720 --> 18:30.840\nWhen's the show coming out?\n\n18:30.840 --> 18:31.840\nWhat's taking so long?\n\n18:31.840 --> 18:33.760\nWhy is the show coming out?\n\n18:33.760 --> 18:34.760\nWhat would be the best?\n\n18:34.760 --> 18:37.160\nWhy is it so hard to make the damn show?\n\n18:37.160 --> 18:38.160\nYeah.\n\n18:38.160 --> 18:39.160\nWhy?\n\n18:39.160 --> 18:41.120\nWhere are you at right now, Harmon?\n\n18:41.120 --> 18:52.320\nYou and Justin, like where, in your 70 episode, Odyssey, 70 episodes, I don't like 70 anything.\n\n18:52.320 --> 18:53.320\nHow are you?\n\n18:53.320 --> 18:54.320\nWhere are you?\n\n18:54.320 --> 18:55.320\nThree?\n\n18:55.320 --> 18:56.320\nI mean, what the fuck are you gonna do?\n\n18:56.320 --> 18:57.320\nWhat the fuck are you faking?\n\n18:57.320 --> 18:58.320\nWhat the fuck?\n\n18:58.320 --> 19:00.320\nYou bought a house with a giant pool.\n\n19:00.320 --> 19:01.320\nJesus.\n\n19:01.320 --> 19:02.320\nYou're gonna fucking die broke.\n\n19:02.320 --> 19:03.320\nOh my God.\n\n19:03.320 --> 19:04.320\nYou shine paperwork.\n\n19:04.320 --> 19:07.800\nThere's no way that this is even humanly possible.\n\n19:07.800 --> 19:10.800\nAnd if it is, it's not even gonna be good.\n\n19:10.800 --> 19:13.800\nYeah, you know, they're gonna be shit.\n\n19:13.800 --> 19:14.800\nYeah.\n\n19:14.800 --> 19:15.800\nA.V.\n\n19:15.800 --> 19:16.800\nClarke.\n\n19:16.800 --> 19:23.800\nThis is Justin Roy, let's say that.\n\n19:23.800 --> 19:28.040\nI noticed, here's something, okay, I'm breaking the shit.\n\n19:28.040 --> 19:29.800\nThis is me just breaking down.\n\n19:29.800 --> 19:37.760\nI was, I was looking at other cues and a panels and I noticed you were doing your homework.\n\n19:37.760 --> 19:38.760\nHe really is.\n\n19:38.760 --> 19:46.480\nI, well, I don't phone anything in.\n\n19:46.480 --> 19:49.520\nRob gave an insulting response to a high five.\n\n19:49.520 --> 19:51.520\nHe will phone in a high five.\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:53.520\nWell, I cut my finger.\n\n19:53.520 --> 19:54.520\nI didn't.\n\n19:54.520 --> 19:55.520\nOh, okay.\n\n19:55.520 --> 19:56.520\nYou don't want to give me your age.\n\n19:56.520 --> 19:57.520\nYou could make me feel better.\n\n19:57.520 --> 19:58.520\nRob has AIDS.\n\n19:58.520 --> 19:59.520\nIt's okay.\n\n19:59.520 --> 20:00.520\nWe can talk about it.\n\n20:00.520 --> 20:01.520\nIt's adorable.\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:08.240\nI noticed that your fans don't audition when they ask questions.\n\n20:08.240 --> 20:16.520\nUsually like when I've done panels, it's usually like, hello there, just one is new.\n\n20:16.520 --> 20:22.240\nAnd then they do like this very, they've been rehearsing this bit and then it comes off very\n\n20:22.240 --> 20:28.000\nlike the whole audience goes what or whatever, but your, your, your fans at Rick and Morning\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:34.480\nfans, they're like, why did Doc do this or what's in his bottle or are those both trash\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:39.800\ncans from the, the, the Smith house or did he steal those or, or what, you know, like\n\n20:39.800 --> 20:43.840\nthey have very specific question, which kind of cool, right?\n\n20:43.840 --> 20:49.080\nI mean, that's not really a question, but this is a, I don't know if you've noticed\n\n20:49.080 --> 20:50.080\nthat.\n\n20:50.080 --> 20:54.240\nI think there's, well, I guess I haven't is my answer because I've only done panels\n\n20:54.240 --> 20:59.200\nfor community and Rick and Morty and I, I don't, there's not a lot of like, I think\n\n20:59.200 --> 21:03.160\nthere's like a self policing kind of enzyme in the air.\n\n21:03.160 --> 21:08.600\nPeople that might otherwise, like they want to, they want to, they want to contribute to\n\n21:08.600 --> 21:13.280\nlike this very short runtime, you know, they don't want to be the one that asks the question\n\n21:13.280 --> 21:19.880\nthat causes other people a problem of some kind, you know, like there's a lot of pressure,\n\n21:19.880 --> 21:24.220\nlike you're lining up to ask your question into the mic and every once in a while, there's\n\n21:24.220 --> 21:31.000\npeople that take us a shot at the moon with some kind of larger than just a regular question\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:37.400\nbit, but like 80% of those actually work, like they're good, like if somebody is just\n\n21:37.400 --> 21:41.520\nlike in a costume and they go like, I have one question, when am I coming back?\n\n21:41.520 --> 21:45.640\nIt's like, oh, Bluedow, next season when Popeye gets super.\n\n21:45.640 --> 21:50.560\nI dressed up as Mr. Poopy Butthole and asked Sarah like, why'd you shoot me?\n\n21:50.560 --> 21:51.560\nRight.\n\n21:51.560 --> 21:52.560\nThat's funny.\n\n21:52.560 --> 21:54.680\nNo, the audience loved it.\n\n21:54.680 --> 21:55.680\nYeah.\n\n21:55.680 --> 21:59.000\nSo who's going to be on the panel with who's on the on the dais?\n\n21:59.000 --> 22:01.200\nI think Dan is right.\n\n22:01.200 --> 22:03.560\nYou're going to show up for that, right?\n\n22:03.560 --> 22:04.560\nYeah.\n\n22:04.560 --> 22:10.360\nIf I'm feeling better about my body, but just do head and shoulders with the camera.\n\n22:10.360 --> 22:15.040\nThere's mirrors all over the green room and just kind of like, and it's it's what it's\n\n22:15.040 --> 22:19.760\njust one of those like, that's what I think it's like a bio rhythmic thing, like my body\n\n22:19.760 --> 22:25.640\ndoesn't look any different to, but I just like my t-shirts like a tarp like laid over\n\n22:25.640 --> 22:35.480\nthis bowling pin made of like like softening candle wax and like, that sounds like a lyric\n\n22:35.480 --> 22:40.280\nand I like, I like, I look in the mirror and I go like, hey, fix that posture that and\n\n22:40.280 --> 22:45.400\nthen I'll like, go like this and it gets really depressing because it's like, ah, a\n\n22:45.400 --> 22:51.680\nfucking monster with good posture, like your belly didn't change shape at all.\n\n22:51.680 --> 22:55.280\nIt just like moved on the Y axis.\n\n22:55.280 --> 22:58.320\nHave you been backsliding with your, with your Dave Klan workouts or?\n\n22:58.320 --> 22:59.320\nI don't know.\n\n22:59.320 --> 23:00.320\nWell, I don't know.\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:01.320\nCertainly.\n\n23:01.320 --> 23:03.920\nWell, I, maybe yes, but not through his fault.\n\n23:03.920 --> 23:10.640\nI, but you know, there's been, yeah, I'm sure it's like I'm sliding in, in a, in a way\n\n23:10.640 --> 23:12.640\nthat I'm maybe noticing or whatever.\n\n23:12.640 --> 23:13.640\nYeah.\n\n23:13.640 --> 23:14.640\nI mean, I don't want.\n\n23:14.640 --> 23:15.640\nHe's up.\n\n23:15.640 --> 23:16.640\nI'm controlling.\n\n23:16.640 --> 23:17.640\nI did want it.\n\n23:17.640 --> 23:18.640\nHey, you didn't answer that question.\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:19.640\nI'm going to get to the truth.\n\n23:19.640 --> 23:20.640\nWho's on the panel?\n\n23:20.640 --> 23:21.640\nYou are.\n\n23:21.640 --> 23:22.640\nJustin.\n\n23:22.640 --> 23:23.640\nI don't know.\n\n23:23.640 --> 23:24.640\nGee, I don't know.\n\n23:24.640 --> 23:25.640\nYeah.\n\n23:25.640 --> 23:26.640\nI don't actually know.\n\n23:26.640 --> 23:27.640\nAnother voice talent.\n\n23:27.640 --> 23:28.640\nIs it like not like Ryan Ridley?\n\n23:28.640 --> 23:29.640\nWho do you think?\n\n23:29.640 --> 23:43.840\nI would, I would assume that it's some voice, voice people, but I don't know how they pick\n\n23:43.840 --> 23:44.840\nthem and voice people.\n\n23:44.840 --> 23:45.840\nYeah.\n\n23:45.840 --> 23:49.480\nIt's probably going to be Chris and Sarah and Spencer, right?\n\n23:49.480 --> 23:58.320\nI would, I would, you know, yeah, probably not me, but I would hate to be wrong about\n\n23:58.320 --> 23:59.320\nthat.\n\n23:59.320 --> 24:00.320\nAll right.\n\n24:00.320 --> 24:02.480\nWell, yeah, I said probably somebody you'll be there.\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:08.160\nRob, Rob, if you could ask one question, right, what would it be, Dan, are you coming\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:10.160\ninto work tomorrow?\n\n24:10.160 --> 24:12.160\nYeah, good.\n\n24:12.160 --> 24:13.320\nI like it when you're there.\n\n24:13.320 --> 24:14.320\nYeah.\n\n24:14.320 --> 24:15.560\nWe got a lot done today.\n\n24:15.560 --> 24:17.520\nWe got a lot done today.\n\n24:17.520 --> 24:21.480\nKind of two, almost two episodes, almost two stories broken.\n\n24:21.480 --> 24:22.480\nYeah.\n\n24:22.480 --> 24:23.480\nAre you working on it?\n\n24:23.480 --> 24:25.720\nYeah, I think I am.\n\n24:25.720 --> 24:27.600\nI wouldn't call it working.\n\n24:27.600 --> 24:29.000\nHello.\n\n24:29.000 --> 24:32.000\nHe has his moments.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.000\nAre you a writer, producer?\n\n24:33.000 --> 24:34.000\nWhat are you doing?\n\n24:34.000 --> 24:35.000\nI'm not sure.\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.520\nI just show up until they tell me to get the fuck out.\n\n24:39.520 --> 24:40.760\nI don't really know.\n\n24:40.760 --> 24:43.200\nWe're communicating in this language in the writer's room.\n\n24:43.200 --> 24:48.680\nIt's like an old married couple, and it's like, I don't, I assume it's bad for the other\n\n24:48.680 --> 24:49.680\npeople.\n\n24:49.680 --> 24:56.680\nWhy would that, because there's a showrunner and kind of guy that's deputized, like his\n\n24:56.680 --> 25:03.080\njob is to keep the trains running on time, but it's like, but he can't fire me.\n\n25:03.080 --> 25:05.560\nAnd then he's like, and then I'm just doing this bit with Schrab.\n\n25:05.560 --> 25:10.840\nI'll tell you what, I'll be like, okay, well, what if, what if the space suit had a thing?\n\n25:10.840 --> 25:16.080\nAnd if it had a thing, don't fucking question me.\n\n25:16.080 --> 25:21.240\nIf you have something to contribute, fucking pitch something, otherwise shut the fuck up.\n\n25:21.240 --> 25:25.840\nI'm just trying to help, man.\n\n25:25.840 --> 25:30.800\nIf you want to help pitch something, I pitched something a couple minutes ago.\n\n25:30.800 --> 25:39.480\nYour pitch was a question was like, why isn't Rick Morty?\n\n25:39.480 --> 25:40.480\nAnd this will go on.\n\n25:40.480 --> 25:41.480\nBitch.\n\n25:41.480 --> 25:42.480\nNo, there was a question.\n\n25:42.480 --> 25:43.480\nFor a really long time.\n\n25:43.480 --> 25:44.480\nAnd anyways, it's center.\n\n25:44.480 --> 25:50.800\nAnd it's like, it's kind of like, it's just, it's just a 40 year, 30 years.\n\n25:50.800 --> 25:51.800\nIt's just, it's just.\n\n25:51.800 --> 25:54.160\nHow much does a job pay?\n\n25:54.160 --> 25:57.760\nI'll let you know at the end of the month.\n\n25:57.760 --> 26:01.720\nAnd I do have to wonder, like, why, yeah, why are you, are you making a living doing\n\n26:01.720 --> 26:02.720\nthis?\n\n26:02.720 --> 26:03.720\nI hope so.\n\n26:03.720 --> 26:06.200\nI'm, Kate's going to be really pissed.\n\n26:06.200 --> 26:10.440\nI'm like, what about, what about, what about the younger writers that are like, fuck, man.\n\n26:10.440 --> 26:13.560\nI'm going to get, get up in the morning and they're like, maybe I went to Harvard.\n\n26:13.560 --> 26:14.960\nWhat the fuck is going on right now?\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:16.320\nLike, so wait, so what?\n\n26:16.320 --> 26:17.320\nWhat is this?\n\n26:17.320 --> 26:22.960\nSix years of the onion and now this is, he just, he just, he just wanted his husband\n\n26:22.960 --> 26:23.960\nat work.\n\n26:23.960 --> 26:34.760\nBut we, they, they're coming around, they realize that's how we work and we do, we did a good\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:35.760\njob today.\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:42.280\nYeah, but well, I wonder if my mind goes back to the note we would get in Milwaukee from\n\n26:42.280 --> 26:45.920\nthe improv community.\n\n26:45.920 --> 26:46.920\nConference sports or did LS?\n\n26:46.920 --> 26:51.640\nWell, but I mean, I feel like, I feel like we would, we got the same note in both, which\n\n26:51.640 --> 26:56.800\ngoes to show you that we had the problem because one was like, they were very different from\n\n26:56.800 --> 27:01.960\neach other, but they both would express to us, basically, like, in the politest way,\n\n27:01.960 --> 27:08.080\nit was like, like, it would be nice when you guys are doing something, if you would let\n\n27:08.080 --> 27:15.320\npeople know what it is and how they can help, like, like, and not just make, like, latch\n\n27:15.320 --> 27:22.600\nonto each other and make fun of everything around you in some, like, heavenly creatures,\n\n27:22.600 --> 27:29.840\nlike, twisted, like, two British girls, like, fantasizing about homicide in the 50s, kind\n\n27:29.840 --> 27:35.280\nof, like, vibe you give off, like, it's like, all of a sudden, just talking in diehard references\n\n27:35.280 --> 27:42.200\nand there's like, you know, like, a referee, you know, I don't, what, so you recreated\n\n27:42.200 --> 27:47.520\ndiehard, that's not the theater game, all right.\n\n27:47.520 --> 27:51.360\nI remember when I first met you, was it, like, 94?\n\n27:51.360 --> 27:59.480\nProbably, yeah, at Milwaukee Comedy Sports Tournament, and I had been in LA Comedy Sports\n\n27:59.480 --> 28:04.560\nfor, like, I think, like, six months, like, I was pretty new, and I had heard about the\n\n28:04.560 --> 28:10.320\nNew York Comedy Sports guys, like, Talman and Mike Rock and, like, all the other guys,\n\n28:10.320 --> 28:16.600\nand then you guys, the Dead L Wives, and I was so intimidated to meet you and we all,\n\n28:16.600 --> 28:19.880\nlike, met and wanted to hang out with each other, but we never really talked, we just\n\n28:19.880 --> 28:25.120\nkind of stared at our feet and had a drink, but then I saw you guys do the Dead L Wives\n\n28:25.120 --> 28:31.520\nshow and it fucking blew my mind, it was really, like, oh, like, you can be funny and weird\n\n28:31.520 --> 28:37.720\nand not give a fuck about the audience, because you guys truly didn't care about the quality\n\n28:37.720 --> 28:42.840\nof what was going on, but that's why it was funny, that you cared about quality in the\n\n28:42.840 --> 28:45.880\nright way, which is like, like, we're gonna do what we want.\n\n28:45.880 --> 28:51.960\nIt just didn't, we didn't know, we didn't have any option of pleasing the audience,\n\n28:51.960 --> 28:54.360\nlike, we wouldn't know how, so.\n\n28:54.360 --> 28:58.680\nBut you were signing, like, Skud Books, and I think that's when I first met you, you\n\n28:58.680 --> 29:03.440\nwere sitting at a little table and you were signing Skud, I didn't know what that was,\n\n29:03.440 --> 29:04.440\nand I just wanted-\n\n29:04.440 --> 29:05.440\nMost people don't.\n\n29:05.440 --> 29:06.440\nRight.\n\n29:06.440 --> 29:07.440\nAll right.\n\n29:07.440 --> 29:09.440\nIt's time for a segment.\n\n29:09.440 --> 29:10.440\nOh, shit.\n\n29:10.440 --> 29:14.080\nOne of your jobs as a host will be to deal with segments.\n\n29:14.080 --> 29:15.080\nOkay.\n\n29:15.080 --> 29:20.120\nAnd since you didn't bring music, you have to sing, like, if you want to add a musical\n\n29:20.120 --> 29:21.120\nsting to it.\n\n29:21.120 --> 29:27.120\nIt's time for Spencer to update us on My Backyard B problem.\n\n29:27.120 --> 29:28.120\nOh, okay.\n\n29:28.120 --> 29:32.680\nWhen it's time for Spencer to update you on the piece.\n\n29:32.680 --> 29:35.400\nOh, thank you, Zach.\n\n29:35.400 --> 29:38.280\nFour wings, six legs.\n\n29:38.280 --> 29:41.040\nDo you guys remember when we tried really hard-\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:42.600\nI said musical sting.\n\n29:42.600 --> 29:44.600\nThat was okay.\n\n29:44.600 --> 29:47.040\nAnd I don't think that got the full credit.\n\n29:47.040 --> 29:48.040\nIt deserves.\n\n29:48.040 --> 29:49.040\nAll right.\n\n29:49.040 --> 29:50.040\nGo ahead, Rob.\n\n29:50.040 --> 29:57.800\nYou remember when we spent, like, an afternoon trying to break or figure out, like, how to\n\n29:57.800 --> 30:03.720\ndo the Austin Powers as a B movie?\n\n30:03.720 --> 30:06.520\nWe came up with, do I make you honey, B-B?\n\n30:06.520 --> 30:08.520\nOh, my God.\n\n30:08.520 --> 30:09.520\nWait, wait, wait.\n\n30:09.520 --> 30:10.520\nWow.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:11.520\nOh, B-Hive.\n\n30:11.520 --> 30:12.520\nOh, B-Hive.\n\n30:12.520

call it?\n\n30:17.520 --> 30:20.520\nWhat would we call it?\n\n30:20.520 --> 30:21.520\nAustin pollen.\n\n30:21.520 --> 30:22.520\nAustin pollen.\n\n30:22.520 --> 30:25.940\nThat's not nearly as good as O-B-Hive.\n\n30:25.940 --> 30:27.040\nBusting.\n\n30:27.040 --> 30:28.520\nBusting.\n\n30:28.520 --> 30:29.920\nB-Hive.\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:30.900\nBusting.\n\n30:30.900 --> 30:32.400\nO-B-Hive.\n\n30:32.400 --> 30:33.400\nO-B-Hive.\n\n30:33.400 --> 30:37.400\nDo I make you honey, baby?\n\n30:37.400 --> 30:41.500\nDo I make you honey?\n\n30:41.500 --> 30:42.500\nHoneymaker.\n\n30:42.500 --> 30:43.500\nStinging water.\n\n30:43.500 --> 30:45.000\nDo I make you honey, baby?\n\n30:45.000 --> 30:46.000\nDo I make you honey, baby?\n\n30:46.000 --> 30:54.040\nWho was there when we did seven hours at the rustic end of about I just got back from so-and-so and my boy on my arms\n\n30:54.040 --> 30:57.480\nTired were you there for that one? No, I wasn't there. That was there\n\n30:58.360 --> 31:03.600\nDamn, I don't know. Okay. I don't know. I was there when we spent seven hours\n\n31:04.200 --> 31:06.760\nre-enacting what the first submarine was\n\n31:10.720 --> 31:15.280\nPeople built a submarine ago. Okay, we're gonna have to get our best. We have to do what?\n\n31:15.280 --> 31:17.280\nWe have to wait. We have to get our best\n\n31:18.280 --> 31:23.240\nSailors we get everybody there and we're gonna put them in a lead tube and sink it\n\n31:23.240 --> 31:26.680\nI mean their job is to keep the boat up and then I go well\n\n31:26.680 --> 31:56.520\nWe can't tell them until it's sink and so we keep redoing them like the Navy has trained\n\n31:56.520 --> 31:58.520\nThese men their entire life\n\n31:59.640 --> 32:05.460\nOn top of the water you're asking them to go against it every\n\n32:15.000 --> 32:17.800\nIt's like getting BA on a plane in the A-Team. I\n\n32:18.840 --> 32:20.840\nDon't fly Hannibal like\n\n32:20.840 --> 32:26.520\nWhat BA we can't take a jeep to deal with killer ants in the Yucatan\n\n32:27.200 --> 32:31.840\nI don't care sucker. I pity the fool who tries to make me fly and then they're like, okay\n\n32:31.840 --> 32:33.840\nHave a glass of milk mr. T. You love it\n\n32:34.840 --> 32:40.440\nAnd it's like that's what they had to do with the sailors. They're like, you'll thank us at the fucking nautical Emmys. Yes\n\n32:42.760 --> 32:47.120\nYeah, who is the first I mean, I know that like there was the first people that tried to make a\n\n32:47.120 --> 32:55.200\nSubmersible thing they were crazy people. They had to determine the first time you built a U-boat or a submarine\n\n32:55.200 --> 33:00.240\nAnd you put a bunch of fuckers on that thing. That's crazy. Yeah, that's murder. Oh, man\n\n33:00.960 --> 33:03.880\nI did gentlemen your job is to sink. Yeah\n\n33:04.920 --> 33:11.240\nAre you fucking kidding me? This boat is made to sink. I'm not coming near it guys. Don't worry. We've packed\n\n33:11.240 --> 33:18.440\nHey, 30% of this boat is packed with baking soda. Can I ask a little bit at Admiral?\n\n33:18.680 --> 33:20.880\nMy name is Ensign Davis\n\n33:21.880 --> 33:28.400\nI'm noticing there's no sales on this boat. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was I believe I may be wrong about this\n\n33:28.400 --> 33:33.400\nThere's probably historians in the audience and things and there's but but I know there is a story about\n\n33:34.080 --> 33:35.120\nthe\n\n33:35.120 --> 33:41.920\nCivil War what there was a con I think they were Confederates if you can believe that those little those little dickens\n\n33:43.160 --> 33:45.160\nWhat are they doing thinking about science?\n\n33:47.120 --> 33:52.520\nWell, God said I can own people however we might be able to breathe underwater\n\n33:54.040 --> 33:56.680\nWell, wait a minute pick a lane. Oh\n\n33:57.360 --> 34:02.880\nWe're saying to you is one day. We'll live in a fucking hive mind. Yeah, but we're gonna fight that a little bit\n\n34:02.880 --> 34:06.320\nThink about how much you have to love slavery to think that you can breathe on\n\n34:07.760 --> 34:11.800\nTo it's like being a flat earth or so dedicated to your cause that you\n\n34:12.800 --> 34:17.300\nSpace program that works because you want to take pictures of the flat earth and you're like\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:21.000\nSay cheese you round piece of shit. I\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:28.120\nKnow you're flat and they're like holy shit. You made your own spaceship. Yeah, fuck you. I'm not a dummy\n\n34:28.120 --> 34:32.120\nIt's just an accent\n\n34:32.880 --> 34:35.080\nThere's a lot of smart southern people\n\n34:35.840 --> 34:42.280\nFucking oodles of them. Yeah, it's just a way you talk John Oliver's got a real low-class British accent\n\n34:42.600 --> 34:47.440\nWhat was the first I know this way? I can't think right now. What was the first submersible in the Civil War?\n\n34:47.440 --> 34:53.840\nIt was like Bathysphere is probably first right which is just on a big crane and so it's not like it's not a\n\n34:53.840 --> 35:01.840\nSelf-contained it doesn't cruise around but they would use to go underwater and they would go up to like a like a sailing vessel and\n\n35:02.360 --> 35:06.120\nLike that's not bombs. Well the Civil War thing. I think was that yet\n\n35:06.120 --> 35:14.000\nIt was basically like it was it was a higher tech equivalent of six dudes putting a bathtub over their heads and\n\n35:14.960 --> 35:20.600\nCarrying a spear with a bomb on the end of it. So they could walk up to ships and like\n\n35:20.600 --> 35:26.760\nIt's kind of that's it. That's hyperbole. Is anybody in the audience like relatively is anybody here in the civil war like\n\n35:27.440 --> 35:33.800\nThat's civil war. Do we have any Confederates in the house the guy they kind of blew themselves up\n\n35:33.800 --> 35:36.360\nBut they also did accomplish like a lot\n\n35:36.360 --> 35:40.840\nI think there's a it's a very twisted strange story because there was also a bit of forensics to it like\n\n35:41.440 --> 35:43.440\nNo one knows what happened down there\n\n35:44.800 --> 35:49.880\nThey succeeded in their mission and then exploded I think is what it was and no one knows what went wrong\n\n35:49.880 --> 35:51.880\nWas there a lot of\n\n35:52.080 --> 35:54.840\nNaval battles during the Civil War. Yeah\n\n35:55.880 --> 35:59.760\nWhat was it? I can't yeah, there was a bunch of there was the ironclads and\n\n36:00.800 --> 36:06.040\nAnd there were also submersibles that would go and try to torpedo the it was more about I mean it was it was you're talking\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:09.680\nIt's like blockades and things because you're talking about supply lines chiefly\n\n36:09.680 --> 36:15.720\nYou're not you're not like competing for domination of the seas except in the but then again, that's a description of all war\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:19.640\nIt's just that no there weren't there aren't a lot of famous like water lose happening\n\n36:19.640 --> 36:25.920\nOn the water. Why did it water loo? I'm like I always pictured water loo. What did water loo the elbow?\n\n36:26.960 --> 36:30.240\nHey, I'd rather you know enough about the\n\n36:31.120 --> 36:39.000\nConquering the seas I want to hear about conquering the bees. Hello. Let's go back. Yeah, we have that intro music\n\n36:39.000 --> 36:40.700\nThis is all part of that segment\n\n36:40.700 --> 36:42.200\nYeah\n\n36:42.200 --> 36:44.200\nHit it\n\n36:44.280 --> 36:46.280\nsix legs\n\n36:46.280 --> 36:52.720\nFour wings four wings four wings four wings four wings pollen sacks on the knees\n\n36:53.920 --> 37:01.480\nTerrian neck cargo. You're the bees knees. You're the bees knees. You're the bees knees mother fucker. Please listen to my\n\n37:02.040 --> 37:06.920\nPlease they don't know nothing. I'm the flea. I ain't a bee but Paula makes me sneeze\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:08.760\nyo\n\n37:08.760 --> 37:10.760\nKing Kingdom\n\n37:10.760 --> 37:12.760\nanimalia\n\n37:12.760 --> 37:14.760\nOh\n\n37:15.720 --> 37:19.280\nPhylum insect insectoid insect a insect a\n\n37:22.280 --> 37:24.280\nOrder after Phylum King Philip\n\n37:24.720 --> 37:28.200\nEats pussy with the eats.

That's bees and ants\n\n37:38.960 --> 37:40.480\nOkay\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:42.480\ntaxonomy right\n\n37:42.480 --> 37:45.400\nHi, I'm a hymen. I'm a hymenologist\n\n37:48.720 --> 37:50.720\nI'm a hymenologist\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:54.440\nThat's what I'm talking about\n\n37:55.360 --> 37:59.880\nIt's in session. I'm the hymenologist. I'll remove that shit before you\n\n38:02.040 --> 38:09.440\nSpencer what what's the new deal with bees in the backyard? We're getting rid of them just quickly\n\n38:09.440 --> 38:15.480\nI looked it up. Wait, but don't ever get rid of the bees. We need bees submarine. No, we don't need bees\n\n38:15.480 --> 38:17.240\nThat's a common misconception\n\n38:17.240 --> 38:23.320\nCall it or what do you call it colony collapse disorder is a natural thing that should be allowed to continue\n\n38:23.920 --> 38:25.920\nuntil all bees are gone\n\n38:26.760 --> 38:29.440\nAnd I won't hear anything else\n\n38:30.160 --> 38:35.200\nOn the subject. No, but there was a seven-man submarine that yeah, they had a bomb spear\n\n38:35.200 --> 38:40.640\nThey they sank a ship and then they've got lost before they returned and then they basically\n\n38:41.480 --> 38:43.920\nMission did the monitor. That's what I'm thinking of\n\n38:45.120 --> 38:50.640\nWas it an ankle or was it a submersible?

It was really well done. I'm going out on a limb here by recommending you watch chair noble\n\n01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.960\nIt's very good. It's very well done. I\n\n01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:27.280\nYeah, I watched it because all of you were watching it. I'm telling you my chair noble is good. I like that quite a bit\n\n01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:33.480\nDid you like the part where they shot all the dogs? No, I fast forward over it. That's what that makes sense\n\n01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.040\nYeah, this guy can't watch that. No, I know I can watch people fucking dying horribly, but if they yeah, well, they're asking for it\n\n01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000\nOkay, so\n\n01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000\nLevy yeah\n\n01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000\nare you still a\n\n01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760\nGood guy.

Yeah, we went to the\n\n01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.640\nI\n\n01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.120\nDon't know how\n\n01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.280\nBahamas. Yeah, we went to the Atlantis. We were in Atlantis\n\n01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.440\nWhat the big-ass water park that yeah, yeah\n\n01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.880\nThe one where you see all the commercials and you go down the slides to the shark tanks that who chose that he\n\n01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.280\nYeah, all right. Yeah, so you there's 20 20 guys there to sell\n\n01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.000\nWell, you went to a water park, but you know, it's all a fancy hotel\n\n01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.640\nWhat but it's got the big water slide thing you go through a pyramid. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right\n\n01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.360\nDoesn't this water park just seems like a great way to get all the hepatitis. There was a lazy river\n\n01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.920\nThose are so fun. It was actually pretty fun. It's like swimming without trying\n\n01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.800\nYeah, and they had like little rapids so it felt like, you know, man, that sounds\n\n01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.880\nWith the children there was it was it all is it the rapid or is it lazy?\n\n01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.720\nI mean make up your mind river pick a lane Atlantis\n\n01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.240\nLittle rapids, but you're lazy. I mean come on\n\n01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.400\nWe were we were at the adults hotel and then there are kids\n\n01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.600\nYeah, the adults and where the lotion goes on. Yeah, never had a real\n\n01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.280\nUh-uh jealousy of the people on the lazy river at the hotels that boast those\n\n01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:20.840\nYeah, but I do like the concept. I wouldn't take it away from anybody, right?\n\n01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.960\nI'd really like to go on an inner tube actual river thing where it wasn't a lazy river\n\n01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:31.760\nBecause actually ironically I think that would play on a lot of my social anxieties because it's not lazy in terms of like\n\n01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:39.440\nIf you're going on a figure eight around a hotel, like you're like am I I'm on the lazy river, but like where's Kyle?\n\n01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840\nYou know Kyle was on the lazy river\n\n01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.200\nAm I gonna be uncool if I like\n\n01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.480\nBack splash so I slow down for Kyle and he's gonna be like dude. It's a lazy river. Don't be clingy\n\n01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.560\nYeah, you know like like and oh do I knew am I supposed to speed ahead and maybe I'll lap Kyle and then like\n\n01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:04.640\nI actually had a business trip. There's eight kiles and then you're like who why this is no lazy\n\n01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.600\nYeah, this is an exercise and we got shot down at different times\n\n01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.720\nSo I actually was like oh am I gonna are they gonna get too far ahead of me?\n\n01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.880\nI paddled but for some reason in my mind that would be way more doable if you're on our actual river because then it's like\n\n01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.120\nYou'd be like oh man\n\n01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.680\nI'm way behind or I'm way ahead and there is no like kind of you're like well\n\n01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:32.840\nThat's that's analogous to is it lazy all year long. I mean like if like there was a CSI in Miami\n\n01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:40.640\nWhere the a shark from one of the shark tank at one resort casino\n\n01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.760\nSomehow ended up in the lazy river of another casino hotel\n\n01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.720\nThat was the that was the cold open call in shark attack in the lazy river\n\n01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.480\nIt's like one of the sharks was transplanted into what from one casino what show was this other?\n\n01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.360\nI think it was CSI Miami because it was like there's no way a shark\n\n01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.280\nRight then he ended like going like looks like you know, I don't know what he would have said\n\n01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.240\nWe're gonna need a bigger. We're gonna need a lazier lazier boat\n\n01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.600\nYeah\n\n01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.720\nBut I was like wow now I get what if this if this is every episode of this fucking show\n\n01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.240\nOh, but wait was in Las Vegas if why was CSI Miami in Las Vegas?\n\n01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.040\nNever mind\n\n01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.120\nProbably a different show. Why was it? Why did the Brady Bunch go to Hawaii? It's fucking\n\n01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.280\nTower in Las Vegas. Hello. Why did the\n\n01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.800\ngolfer wear two pairs of pants in case he got a hole in one\n\n01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:43.000\nWhat damn he was ready for that. Oh well\n\n01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.680\nOh, yeah, how is how is y'all's fourth of July?

out?\n\n01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.960\nWait, what was Mad Dog Johnson in for?\n\n01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.800\nI don't know.\n\n01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.600\nBut was it rape?\n\n01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.960\nI think if you were listening to that theme song,\n\n01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.440\nI think what you heard is commonly known in the audio\n\n01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.120\nindustry is that was a glitch where you're actually hearing\n\n01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.760\na tail on a recording session, where sometimes the theme song\n\n01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.280\nfor a segment actually also was used by a record label\n\n01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.480\nfor what they call walk-ins.\n\n01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.240\nAnd I guess the Mad Dog Johnson, I guess you heard a little more\n\n01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.680\nthan we bargained for.\n\n01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.800\nWhen you buy your segment themes in bulk,\n\n01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:57.120\nyou end up with a couple pig anuses in your calamari.\n\n01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.080\nThe cheaper it is, the more it is, the same shape.\n\n01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.040\nAnd then it's like, I guess that's what we were hearing there.\n\n01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.680\nAnd I don't know if it'll be in the final edit.\n\n01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.920\nBut yeah, I have the same questions as you.\n\n01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.200\nWhy did they let him out?\n\n01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.360\nHow did he make parole?\n\n01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.200\nWhy was he?\n\n01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.960\nI'll put myself on the shoes of Mad Dog Johnson.\n\n01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.760\nIf I've just gotten released from prison,\n\n01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.280\nI'm certainly not going to rap about.\n\n01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.560\nI think my upcoming rape.\n\n01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.200\nAnd that's the other question, of course,\n\n01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.760\nis that what he said?\n\n01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.560\nI'm going to.\n\n01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.520\nIt was kind of solid.\n\n01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.120\nNo, it's certainly what he said.\n\n01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.480\nIt's Mad Dog Johnson.\n\n01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.760\nWas he like second guessing it?\n\n01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.600\nThe thing is, I actually just went through the court files.\n\n01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.840\nRaise up my marriage.\n\n01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:44.120\nHe was only in prison for tax fraud.\n\n01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.600\nBut he got institutionalized, and now he's\n\n01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.360\ngoing to go out and commit a series of horrible crimes.\n\n01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.800\nThat's why it's important to know what he was in for.\n\n01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.200\nBecause we don't want to judge convicts if they got out.\n\n01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.920\nBut if he was in for tax evasion,\n\n01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.880\nand he got out for good behavior,\n\n01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.680\nthen there's probably a misunderstanding happening here.\n\n01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.520\nMad Dog Johnson.\n\n01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.280\nHe just admitted he was going to go rape people.\n\n01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.080\nBut if he was in for murder, and he wasn't supposed to get out.\n\n01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.360\nYeah, it informs everything.\n\n01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.200\nYeah, well, look.\n\n01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.200\nRevolving door.\n\n01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.800\nWe buy in volume here.\n\n01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.680\nAll right, so anyway.\n\n01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.960\nThe segment is Dean Harmon's Top 7 Earthquake Suppositions.\n\n01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.160\nTop 7 Earthquake Suppositions.\n\n01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.280\nAll right, number 7.\n\n01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:25.960\nNumber 7.\n\n01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.520\nWe're coming in at number 7, Dan Harmon's Top 7\n\n01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.040\nEarthquake Suppositions.\n\n01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.480\nI suppose.\n\n01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.560\nThis is number 7.\n\n01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:35.880\nYeah.\n\n01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.920\nOK.\n\n01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:45.240\nThat if you're going to die in an earthquake\n\n01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.120\nby something falling on top of you,\n\n01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.120\nthat that's also how you're going to wake up.\n\n01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.720\nIn my 30s, I was very scared about, oh god, the big earthquake.\n\n01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.720\nAnd it's like, oh my god, shit can fall on you.\n\n01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.480\nAnd now in my 40s, I'm kind of like, wait a minute.\n\n01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.880\nThere's two kinds of earthquakes.\n\n01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.920\nThere's like rock and roll.\n\n01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.520\nAnd those are damaging.\n\n01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.120\nWe see the grocery stores and like the fucking regus\n\n01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.880\nfalling everywhere.\n\n01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.720\nFatalities can occur in the rolling thunder thing.\n\n01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.920\nI mean, that is a huge amount of fucking motion and energy.\n\n01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.480\nWhen I think of all the lost ragu.\n\n01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.760\nBut the earthquakes that result in, I think,\n\n01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:32.320\nin disasters like global, where things are collapsed.\n\n01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.200\nThis is my supposition, because I didn't research it at all.\n\n01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:43.720\nThis is my supposition, is that those society profits.\n\n01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.280\nWe have six more of these, you guys.\n\n01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280\nSix more.\n\n01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.840\nWho made that fucking straw sound?\n\n01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.520\nWho did that?\n\n01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:57.080\nWho went, come on, own it and say, OK, was that critical?\n\n01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:00.840\nOr were you kind of like, I don't want to tell you what\n\n01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.120\nto tell me, but if you can just pretend that it was saying.\n\n01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.040\nNobody did anything.\n\n01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.760\nNo, he's raising his finger.\n\n01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.960\nHe's being, we're, and it was like, it's OK if it was mostly.\n\n01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.760\nCan you do the sound again, because I missed it.\n\n01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.480\nI missed it, too.\n\n01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.240\nYeah, OK.\n\n01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.440\nHalf of that's a lot of drinking.\n\n01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.960\nThat's what I wanted to hear, is that I'll own one half of it.\n\n01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.160\nIs that you were kind of like, Jesus Christ,\n\n01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.400\nthis fucking fat idiot.\n\n01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.080\nBut I want you to just pallbear the other half,\n\n01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.960\nwhere you're like, also, I've had a lot of coronas.\n\n01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.600\nI'm like, I don't need this.\n\n01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.680\nYeah, fucking bros, see?\n\n01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:36.280\nOK.\n\n01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.320\nI just needed that.\n\n01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320\nWhat was the sound that you heard?\n\n01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.200\nAll right, let me get back to my fucking thing.\n\n01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.320\nIt was like an exhale.\n\n01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.440\nI think that in an earthquake that's\n\n01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.560\ngoing to fucking kill you by dropping shit on your head,\n\n01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.520\nI'm not saying don't prepare for earthquakes.\n\n01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.600\nI'm just saying, in a nihilistic sense,\n\n01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.040\nI think what they're not telling us\n\n01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.200\nis that when the earthquake's that big,\n\n01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.560\nlike no amount of shoes and flashlights next to your bed\n\n01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.760\nare going to stop you from having a cinder block on your head.\n\n01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.080\nThat is how you wake up in an earthquake that kills you,\n\n01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.640\nis the thing that kills you.\n\n01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.880\nYou're waking up dead because the cinder block is on you?\n\n01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.640\nAnd I say that optimistically, because I think\n\n01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.800\na lot of our worst nightmares are thoughts of where people\n\n01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.520\nare like, because we hear survivors' horror stories.\n\n01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.480\nNumber six.\n\n01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.480\nOK.\n\n01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.680\nThank you.\n\n01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.920\nAnd now are we?\n\n01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.360\nBecause you're sobering me up, and you're moving it on,\n\n01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.240\nand we're like, yeah, we need each other.\n\n01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.680\nI could use a guy to kick my ass around here.\n\n01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.800\nAnd it should be my shadow self.\n\n01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.160\nI can only see your silhouette, but you're basically\n\n01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.840\nme, except you're less afraid of the color turquoise.\n\n01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.560\nLike, that's all I know about you.\n\n01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.880\nLike, I'm just like, I could never take that risk.\n\n01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.440\nLike, that's too outgoing.\n\n01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.880\nAnd you're like, I'm not on stage.\n\n01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.560\nI don't care.\n\n01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.360\nTurquoise.\n\n01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.400\nGive me a turquoise shirt, you fuck.\n\n01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:56.880\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.040\nI'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.\n\n01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.920\nI'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.\n\n01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.400\nIs it even turquoise or are we kidding?\n\n01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.640\nI'm kidding.\n\n01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.320\nNumber six.\n\n01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.760\nOK, number six.\n\n01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:06.880\nFuck, I think I'm out of them.\n\n01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.880\nOK, all right, number six.\n\n01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.760\nYou can do a speed round from six to two.\n\n01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.960\nNumber six, there's no such thing as earthquake weather.\n\n01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.640\nThat's not a thing.\n\n01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.360\nThat's pop size.\n\n01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:18.880\nNumber five.\n\n01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:25.360\nNumber five, the thing that you really need to be afraid of\n\n01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.560\nis called liquefaction.\n\n01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.320\nIt's when you're in a moisture area, then dry,\n\n01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.960\nbecause earthquakes can then create instant quicksand that\n\n01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.520\nwill suck your body or house or golf cart instantly down.\n\n01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.920\nOr golf cart.\n\n01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.120\nInto the earth.\n\n01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:47.440\nAnd as quickly as it happens, the dirt reconstitutes this dirt.\n\n01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.400\nYou are fucking Han Solo'd alive.\n\n01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:53.360\nAnd it's going to happen to Portland.\n\n01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.400\nI think Han Solo was Han Solo'd alive, too.\n\n01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.480\nOK, well, that's just a supposition.\n\n01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.520\nNumber four.\n\n01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:03.400\nNumber four, earthquakes.\n\n01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.240\nNumber three.\n\n01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.400\nOK, we're sipping along now.\n\n01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.520\nI almost breathed out.\n\n01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.160\nEarthquakes are like when people start worrying about\n\n01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:27.160\naftershocks, as long as the next one isn't bigger, you're done.\n\n01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.600\nIf the first one didn't destroy anything,\n\n01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.880\nand then the second one is smaller than the first one,\n\n01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.560\ntake that string off the back of your TV.\n\n01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.600\nFucking ride bareback for a while.\n\n01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.680\nWell, watch HBO with like a fucking unearthquake proof TV.\n\n01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.520\nWhat the fuck is the string on a TV?\n\n01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.520\nWho puts a string on a TV?\n\n01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.160\nYou guys don't have an earthquake proof TV.\n\n01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:54.560\nI've never been more embarrassed for you in my life.\n\n01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.880\nYou have a string on your TV?\n\n01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.520\nYou're supposed to tell him to fuck no, but I'm just.\n\n01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.040\nAll right.\n\n01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.800\nOK, but this guy started the sentence by meowing earlier,\n\n01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.560\nso I'm not going to fucking take earthquake prep.\n\n01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.880\nThere was an earthquake, and then remember when they said,\n\n01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.720\nlike, that was a foreshock, not an aftershock,\n\n01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.080\nbecause the next one was bigger.\n\n01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.120\nYeah.\n\n01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.120\nAnd we were like, fuck, that was the time to panic,\n\n01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.920\nbecause it was like, is this a foreshock?\n\n01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.160\nIt could be.\n\n01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.280\nWe won't know until the next one's even bigger.\n\n01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280\nWhere do you put this?\n\n01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.840\nBut if the next one's smaller, you\n\n01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:34.680\ncan jump into a lattice of jumper cables\n\n01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.720\nthat are all gingerly arranged to only make contact\n\n01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.520\nwith the leads that touch your body.\n\n01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.400\nWhere do you put the string on the TV,\n\n01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.960\nand what are you putting the string?\n\n01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.560\nYou're supposed to just anchor your tippable furniture\n\n01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:51.080\nto the wall with a screw and a stud.\n\n01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.880\nThis is especially for people that have kids and pets,\n\n01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.280\nlike because a relatively non-disasterous earthquake\n\n01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:04.320\ncan tip a bookcase, which can be a, this isn't funny, Steve.\n\n01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.760\nI'm looking at Spencer.\n\n01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.320\nHe's leading it.\n\n01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.000\nWait, what?\n\n01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.560\nI'm not, this isn't easy to agree with, you.\n\n01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.560\nI do nothing.\n\n01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.720\nI've had a great time.\n\n01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:24.200\nNumber two, we are two away from the Dan Harmon's top seven\n\n01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:25.360\nsuppositions about earthquakes.\n\n01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.480\nDying.\n\n01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.720\nAnd the number one earthquake supposition.\n\n01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.840\nThe important things to have for an earthquake have less,\n\n01:28:49.840 --> 01:29:00.360\nyou should have condoms and a lot of shoes.\n\n01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.360\nI truly think a gun is a good thing,\n\n01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:05.000\nbecause then you just roll into a fucking store\n\n01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.680\nand be like, give me all the stuff.\n\n01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.480\nIt's an earthquake.\n\n01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.840\nI need this for my family.\n\n01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.840\nHave you ever fired your gun, actually?\n\n01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.480\nNo.\n\n01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.200\nHe's afraid that it'll explode.\n\n01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.000\nI cleaned it.\n\n01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.240\nIt's a deadly weapon.\n\n01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.120\nIt's supposed to explode out the barrel.\n\n01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:21.760\nRight.\n\n01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.240\nThat's what my.\n\n01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.840\nYou're afraid that you cleaned it wrong?\n\n01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.480\nYou might have.\n\n01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.520\nI'm saying cleaned it wrong.\n\n01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.240\nWhy did you clean it if you haven't fired it?\n\n01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.880\nI always wanted to clean a gun.\n\n01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.200\nI never wanted to fire one.\n\n01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.520\nWhat kind of gun is it?\n\n01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:37.120\nIt's a Glock.\n\n01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.960\nClean.\n\n01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.000\nAnd broken, I'm sure of it.\n\n01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.720\nClean and dangerous.\n\n01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.440\nAll right, number one earthquake supposition,\n\n01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.200\nI just learned that gas lines have\n\n01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.880\nearthquake sensors on them.\n\n01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.320\nYeah.\n\n01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.680\nDan's hot water went out, and we didn't know why.\n\n01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.240\nAnd I called a guy, and he was like,\n\n01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.720\nI'm going to check your earthquake sensor.\n\n01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.600\nAnd I was like, the what now?\n\n01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.360\nAnd he's like, yeah, all these houses,\n\n01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.000\nthey got earthquake sensors on them.\n\n01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.520\nAnd I was like, well, that's the great idea, actually.\n\n01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.960\nAnd it turns out that the electronics guys\n\n01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.440\nwere jackhammering or some such on the outside walkway\n\n01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.880\nto lay some cable.\n\n01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.240\nAnd that tremor sensation tripped the earthquake sensor\n\n01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.000\nand turned off the gas to the house.\n\n01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.680\nIt didn't turn off with the earthquake sensors.\n\n01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.400\nImagine those poor earthquake sensors.\n\n01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:30.880\nYeah.\n\n01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.760\nThat story, those guys, imagine that Pixar movie.\n\n01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.280\nEarthquake sensors, exclamation point.\n\n01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.680\nDid you know earthquake sensors have a secret world\n\n01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.760\nof their own?\n\n01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.280\nAnd there's a one for one analogy of a lot of the problems\n\n01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.840\nthat you and I have.\n\n01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.520\nAnd Tony earthquake sensor is like the earthquake sensor\n\n01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.600\nthat cried wolf.\n\n01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.360\nHe's like, guys, guys, there's an earthquake.\n\n01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.840\nAnd it's like, wha wha, as the Randy Newman song starts,\n\n01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.000\nit's like a reveal that yet again, it's just a guy installing\n\n01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.760\ncable, oh, you got a tender touch.\n\n01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.200\nOh, you got a sensitivity.\n\n01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.520\nOh, you're the first to know about my love for you\n\n01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.000\nbecause, you know, you got a hair trigger for you\n\n01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.480\nand you for me.\n\n01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.320\nDa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.\n\n01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.320\nOh, the Council of Earthquake Sensor Elders\n\n01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:31.400\nwill now review the case of Tony once again.\n\n01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.400\nEye roll, eye roll, eye roll.\n\n01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:36.280\nI'm a professional sensor, and I'm\n\n01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.520\npicking up on your eye rolls.\n\n01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.920\nYeah, that's not ironic.\n\n01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.960\nYou pick up on, yeah, OK, never mind.\n\n01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.280\nWe'll workshop that bit.\n\n01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.800\nWe should pick up on more stuff.\n\n01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.360\nYes, we should have less of an eye roll.\n\n01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.560\nYes, OK, fucking, let's be on the same team.\n\n01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.640\nTony, come forth and explain yourself.\n\n01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.560\nHey, guys, come sorry.\n\n01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.440\nLook, I really thought the earth was shaking\n\n01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.320\nand my job was to turn off the gas.\n\n01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.080\nWho was celebrities voicing Tony?\n\n01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:03.800\nBill Hader.\n\n01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.560\nBill Hader, all right.\n\n01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.800\nAnd then they're like, Tony, we sentence you\n\n01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.760\nto re-education camp.\n\n01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.440\nYou will follow the unused gas lines that run underneath.\n\n01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:21.000\nOh, dear.\n\n01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.800\nSo I'm sorry.\n\n01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:26.040\nWhen I hear camp and gas, I went to, yeah.\n\n01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.600\nNo, you should.\n\n01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600\nThis thing is not here to.\n\n01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.320\nYeah, it's not called show friends.\n\n01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.160\nYeah, OK, OK.\n\n01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.360\nGo ahead.\n\n01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.240\nIt's Pixar.\n\n01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.600\nYou weren't a character in the movie.\n\n01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.800\nYou were like the producer watching a screen test.\n\n01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:45.440\nOh, I'm Jack Wapke going, whoa, boy.\n\n01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.520\nHoly shit, why didn't we catch that?\n\n01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.280\nMy family died in the Holocaust.\n\n01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.560\nYikes.\n\n01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.880\nI'm so proud of it.\n\n01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.360\nThere's a deep cut, but there was a community season\n\n01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.440\nthat was on Yahoo.\n\n01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.040\nAnd there was like an episode where\n\n01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.240\nlike Steve Gutenberg played this guy that was like a producer.\n\n01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.800\nAnd there was this whole thing about this movie\n\n01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.520\nAbed made, and my favorite thing was that there's\n\n01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.560\nthe second act that is like Steve Gutenberg\n\n01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.440\nguys, this producer character watching on a laptop,\n\n01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.560\nthe kind of like the Abed movie.\n\n01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.560\nAnd I just love like the discovery of like,\n\n01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.160\nhe should be really into it.\n\n01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:18.000\nLike there's nothing.\n\n01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.400\nThe story doesn't have to turn on him being like,\n\n01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.720\nhe's like, he's like, we just got all these like reactions\n\n01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.880\nfrom Gutenberg like watching this movie that Abed made.\n\n01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.160\nAnd he's just like, oh, oh, oh, God.\n\n01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.600\nAnd it's just to me, it's really funny\n\n01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.480\nbecause it's vulnerable and funny.\n\n01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.080\nIt's like comedy where it's like everybody wins.\n\n01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.320\nLike he's really into the movie.\n\n01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:42.480\nSo what is the Tony, the sensor act one?\n\n01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.720\nWell, OK, so I want to do a little retconning here\n\n01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.800\nbecause I got a little, it's like,\n\n01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.080\nI think they sentenced him to be like a sprinkler\n\n01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:50.640\nsensor or something.\n\n01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.880\nAnd he, but then there's an actual emergency.\n\n01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.480\nSo there's a real earthquake.\n\n01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.800\nAnd no one will listen to him.\n\n01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.640\nWe know that story.\n\n01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.800\nBecause he's cried wolf to me.\n\n01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.040\nBut then because of where he is positioned,\n\n01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.280\nlike, so he's been sent to be a sprinkler sensor.\n\n01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:08.760\nAnd he, so he is actually privy to the fact\n\n01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.960\nthat an earthquake is coming.\n\n01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.640\nSo these are like a fun like action movie thing,\n\n01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.640\nlike what's it called, San Fernando with the Rock\n\n01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.680\nor whatever he's like going.\n\n01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.200\nSan Andreas.\n\n01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.960\nYeah, it's like, he's, I thought it was more local.\n\n01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.240\nSan Fernando.\n\n01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.520\nWith the Rock.\n\n01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.200\nThe decommissioned roller rink is not\n\n01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.240\ngoing to have enough arugula unless I rescue my girlfriend.\n\n01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:33.960\nI've got to get past this film development lab.\n\n01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.400\nSan Fernando jokes.\n\n01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:45.720\nIt's a movie that introduced the world to San Fernando\n\n01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.560\nBoulevard culture.\n\n01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.240\nSan Fernando Boulevard.\n\n01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.120\nThat famous Boulevard.\n\n01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.680\nAll right.\n\n01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.560\nStreet, what is it?\n\n01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:55.960\nWhat are you?\n\n01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.400\nSo now there's a real emergency.\n\n01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.840\nHe works now as a sprinkler sensor.\n\n01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.320\nSo there's an earthquake coming.\n\n01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.640\nAnd it's like the earthquake has to,\n\n01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.200\nI do not want to do a Bugs Life here,\n\n01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.200\nbecause I stopped watching Bugs Life when it was like, wait,\n\n01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.600\nyou mean the fucking protagonist caused the problem?\n\n01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.920\nLike, that's going to send him.\n\n01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.480\nAnd that's like, like, like, like, no, I don't know likey.\n\n01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:19.640\nLike, I was like, I'm not going to watch a bunch of bugs\n\n01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.560\ngo through a lot of shit that challenges them,\n\n01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.480\nbecause Dave Foley's character did something wrong\n\n01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.320\nand then was like, guess we got to do a thing now.\n\n01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.880\nWell, yeah, clean up your messes, baby.\n\n01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.240\nIsn't that like risky business?\n\n01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.240\nDidn't Tom Cruise do something wrong\n\n01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.680\nand he had to fix his own problem?\n\n01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.080\nNo.\n\n01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.000\nNo, sir.\n\n01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000\nNo.\n\n01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.960\nNo, Tom Cruise is risky business.\n\n01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.320\nHis parents are leaving and they're like, be a good boy\n\n01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.000\nor whatever he's.\n\n01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.160\nI mean, his thing has nothing to do with it.\n\n01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.760\nHe creates a crisis of his own design\n\n01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.760\nand has to grow up and fix his own problem, doesn't he?\n\n01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:58.360\nYeah, but he didn't like make his parents leave town.\n\n01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.640\nBut maybe that's why they left town,\n\n01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.280\nbecause I fucking want to hang out with Tom Cruise\n\n01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:04.200\nall the fucking time.\n\n01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:09.160\nThat would be a less enjoyable story.\n\n01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160\nThat's why.\n\n01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.440\nI was like, oh, he fucked up.\n\n01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.640\nI've never seen Bugs Life.\n\n01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:16.560\nWhat did Dave Foley do in Bugs Life that created his own problem?\n\n01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.760\nI feel like he like forgot to put out the grasshopper bird\n\n01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.240\nseeds.\n\n01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.480\nNo, no, they're collecting all the food.\n\n01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.080\nAnd then he fucked it all up and all went into the river.\n\n01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.920\nYeah, it's like, you dumb fuck.\n\n01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.520\nAnd then he's like, well, boy, I guess I got to be willow now.\n\n01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.200\nYou're not willow?\n\n01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.680\nGod damn.\n\n01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.240\nAll right, anyways, whatever.\n\n01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.560\nOK, so stick with me.\n\n01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:40.960\nYou'll write a million movies.\n\n01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:41.840\nI suck.\n\n01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.120\nI suck worse than anything.\n\n01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.040\nThat's why I'm so cynical.\n\n01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.200\nAll right, can we get back to what we were talking about?\n\n01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.680\nSprinkler sensor, now we've got.\n\n01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.760\nOK, so the sprinkler sensor, like, yeah.\n\n01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.200\nOh, I want to be careful here, because I\n\n01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.200\nwant to make sure you resonate with this character.\n\n01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.800\nYou want them to be like.\n\n01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.920\nHe's been demoted from earthquake sensor.\n\n01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:59.320\nSo they know the earthquake's coming.\n\n01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.920\nAnd then it's like, they fuck.\n\n01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.840\nI mean, we've got to put a pin in some stuff here.\n\n01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.160\nBut I'd skip to the idea that what ends up happening,\n\n01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.800\nbecause I like this device I created,\n\n01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:14.320\nis there's like an ancient, there's a lower tech.\n\n01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.320\nBack when California was still being tamed.\n\n01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.840\nExcuse my belching.\n\n01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:25.880\nThere was like, the water and the gas\n\n01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.960\nand the used to come in the same tubes.\n\n01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.600\nAnd there was less room for alarm.\n\n01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:37.480\nIt's like a regression to a more primitive world.\n\n01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.360\nAnd you got John Houston from Chinatown.\n\n01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.280\nHe's talking about how like.\n\n01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:48.280\nIt's like flushed away meets Chinatown, meets Rango.\n\n01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.080\nWhat's the guy?\n\n01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.640\nWhat's the lizard?\n\n01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.880\nYeah, yeah.\n\n01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.040\nJohnny Depp played Rango.\n\n01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.560\nThat had some problems that you could fix with this.\n\n01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.040\nI like the tone.\n\n01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.640\nAnd then he's like, oh man, I can't believe I'm in a deeper\n\n01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.040\ntube.\n\n01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:05.720\nSo now that he's been demoted from high tech\n\n01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.760\nto more analog, more old tech.\n\n01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.840\nBut that puts him more in touch with the actual.\n\n01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.160\nSo he just wants to contribute.\n\n01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:15.320\nSo he's like always going like, hey, something's shaking.\n\n01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.520\nAnd they're always telling him, hey, pick your battles.\n\n01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.960\nYour job's not to like rock the boat.\n\n01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.920\nAnd he's like, but I'm an earthquake sensor.\n\n01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.920\nAnd they're like, yeah, you can't just see earthquakes\n\n01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.560\neverywhere.\n\n01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.640\nSo then a real earthquake, I think\n\n01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.120\nit's got to be him actually being like, oh,\n\n01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.360\nthat can't be an earthquake.\n\n01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.120\nAnd for that reason, he bothers to show up for work\n\n01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.080\nand no one else does.\n\n01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:37.480\nSo there's like a kind of Simon Peggy kind of like,\n\n01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.040\nshot of the dead thing where you're like, he's naive.\n\n01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.040\nFor a segment, you're kind of like, oh, that poor guy,\n\n01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.400\nhe doesn't know that there's been an evacuation, home alone.\n\n01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:50.360\nAnd so that's why he ends up like the only earthquake sensor\n\n01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.720\nin a community where it really needs to be sensed.\n\n01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.880\nWhat's the meeting with the goddess here?\n\n01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:05.080\nWhere are we at in the story arc right now?\n\n01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.440\nI mean, the meeting of the goddess\n\n01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.120\nis he senses an earthquake, isn't it?\n\n01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.720\nI think it's that he senses the destruction\n\n01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.800\nof a new unlikely family that he builds in a new community.\n\n01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:17.600\nSo you have to think about, what is\n\n01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.960\nthe opposite of an earthquake sensor, aesthetically,\n\n01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.200\nand maybe not, if not purposefully?\n\n01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.800\nThere's no such thing as an earthquake sensor\n\n01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.640\non the earthquake side.\n\n01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:31.320\nEarthquakes don't have their own sensors.\n\n01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.520\nAn earthquake sensor?\n\n01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.040\nYeah.\n\n01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.440\nCould there be a character that is the earthquake?\n\n01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.720\nCan you anthropomorphize the actual earthquake?\n\n01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.600\nIt could be earthquake.\n\n01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.680\nLike fern gully.\n\n01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:43.280\nWell, you could in the form of someone\n\n01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.320\nwith a mental disorder that was like\n\n01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:47.520\na human earthquake, like a character earthquake.\n\n01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.320\nThey're unpredictable.\n\n01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.400\nThey're uncontrollable.\n\n01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.800\nAnd so what our protagonist is learning\n\n01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:56.960\nis it's not about the false dichotomy of alarmism\n\n01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.720\nversus stagnation.\n\n01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.520\nIt's about mirroring and sensitivity.\n\n01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.120\nHe needs to become a person's sensor.\n\n01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.920\nAnd when he thinks that there is a crisis,\n\n01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:14.040\nit's true, but it's not a zero sum game in terms\n\n01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.760\nof whether or not everyone needs to do something.\n\n01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.560\nHe needs to realize that he's the most sensitive earthquake\n\n01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.320\nsensor of all.\n\n01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.640\nBut there has to be something that he was not sensitive to,\n\n01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.360\nthat he has to become more sensitive to about himself\n\n01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.560\nor about somebody that's important to him.\n\n01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.240\nHis own self-esteem, maybe?\n\n01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.080\nMaybe, yeah.\n\n01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.160\nYeah.\n\n01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.640\nOr maybe like his mother or some other character.\n\n01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:41.880\nHe realized that my job is to be sensitive,\n\n01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.560\nand yet look how insensitive I've been to the people that\n\n01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.520\nmatter most to me.\n\n01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.840\nI told Spencer today that my therapist asked\n\n01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.320\nme to start taking showers.\n\n01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:55.400\nWe got the same, me and Dan have the same therapist.\n\n01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.040\nWe're at the same wall in therapy now.\n\n01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.560\nHe started seeing my therapist.\n\n01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.600\nBut my therapist is like a super person that I was like,\n\n01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.960\nman, she saved my life.\n\n01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.480\nBut I think she's just hitting that wall\n\n01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.600\nbecause she's like, god, damn, this dude's perfect,\n\n01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.320\nexcept he's fucking dirty and gross.\n\n01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.680\nWe've got nothing, no bubble left to pop.\n\n01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:14.360\nWell, she's saying, because I have another client coming in,\n\n01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.200\nand you need to start taking showers,\n\n01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.720\nor I have to start buying more for breeze.\n\n01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:18.800\nIt started with a UTI conversation,\n\n01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.600\nwhere I was like, I got a UTI, and she's kind of like,\n\n01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.560\nwhat were you at, a fucking weird public pool\n\n01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.400\nin the middle of a fucking dump?\n\n01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.600\nAnd I was like, well, I don't know how I got a UTI,\n\n01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.640\nand she's going to like, how many showers do you take?\n\n01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:31.000\nI was kind of like, where's this going?\n\n01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.640\nGod damn.\n\n01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.960\nCan I ask how many showers you take?\n\n01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.800\nI take a shower every time I work out.\n\n01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.360\nI work out every other day.\n\n01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.120\nThat is 10,000 times more showers\n\n01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.280\nthan I ever have taken in my life.\n\n01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.520\nBecause there's been times when you've gone weeks and months\n\n01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.360\nwithout a shower.\n\n01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.560\nAnd people are shocked by that.\n\n01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.520\nAnd then I started working out, and I'm like, oh, now\n\n01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.520\nI don't mind taking a shower.\n\n01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.400\nBecause after a workout, I'm like, jeez,\n\n01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.080\nI don't want this to be the case.\n\n01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:57.560\nAnd then I have this almost inarticulable outrage\n\n01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:59.360\nthat I know is now unfashioned anymore.\n\n01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:03.440\nBut it's this idea of people being like,\n\n01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.800\nit's OK that you're fascinated by like, oh, what?\n\n01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.120\nYou don't want to take a shower.\n\n01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.280\nBut will you just like fucking think\n\n01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:15.760\nabout how much you want to take a shower, which is probably\n\n01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.360\na lot if you're doing it all the time,\n\n01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.600\nand that's not an accomplishment?\n\n01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.560\nYou're not like fucking disciplined.\n\n01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.960\nFuck you, you fucking shower addict.\n\n01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:27.160\nYou're just a fucking shower person.\n\n01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.000\nYou don't get a medal for that.\n\n01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.960\nBut you also don't get shit on it for that.\n\n01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.440\nI'm never like fucking shower people.\n\n01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.560\nActually, problematically enough, as I was developing,\n\n01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.160\nyeah, I was like fucking shower people,\n\n01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.680\nwhich is like that's a whammy you\n\n01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:43.600\ndon't want to put on a guy that can fucking hurt you or help\n\n01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:44.100\nyou.\n\n01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:48.200\nAnd now I'm like, I think it's like I'm working out\n\n01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:48.720\nevery other day.\n\n01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.680\nSo I'm like, this is like a million times more showers\n\n01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.560\nthan I've ever taken.\n\n01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.760\nAnd now my therapist is like, she's like,\n\n01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.720\nI'm trying to explain to her.\n\n01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.600\nI'm like, look, man, if you're hanging out,\n\n01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.440\nyou know if you wake up in the morning\n\n01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.520\nand you're like, I can't believe my body's\n\n01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.360\nbeen in this dirty bed for eight hours.\n\n01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.360\nI'm so proud of you for feeling that way\n\n01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.000\nabout your dirt level when you wake up.\n\n01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.120\nAnd I'm so extra proud of you for like having that carrying\n\n01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:25.480\nyou like a fucking black stallion to the fucking Kentucky\n\n01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.000\nDerby.\n\n01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.400\nYour destiny lies in you going into your tiled room\n\n01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.880\nof your choosing and

think they're definitely, it's like, you know,\n\n01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.040\nthe military, it's like, oh, you got to make your bed\n\n01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.040\nwhen you get up at, like, I think it really is,\n\n01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.800\nlike, this regimen that they're, like, resigned to.\n\n01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.760\nThey just have good habits.\n\n01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.600\nRight, yeah.\n\n01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.440\nThat's what discipline is.\n\n01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.360\nIt's a habit, it's a good, yeah.\n\n01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.200\nSo it's like, who fucking cares?\n\n01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.040\nSo I got a habit that looks different from your habit,\n\n01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.000\nbut then the people with the, they're like,\n\n01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.960\nso don't you think you, don't you think maybe you're,\n\n01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.800\nyou don't have my habits because you're unhappy?\n\n01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:27.760\nThat could very well be true, man.\n\n01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.600\nLike, I, like, that's definitely worth peeking into.\n\n01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.200\nLet's talk about neglect and, like, I assume, like,\n\n01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:37.560\nlike, maybe taking your body into a fucking weird\n\n01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:40.240\noperating room and, like, spraying it with water,\n\n01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:42.200\njust so you can, like, dry it back off,\n\n01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.080\nget on the bus and have a fucking dude with a crew cut\n\n01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.920\ngo, like, whoa, fucking, like,\n\n01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.400\nnerd faggot took a shower, dude, gimme five.\n\n01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.480\nMan, I, I, like,\n\n01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:58.920\nI'm positive that the fact that I'm not into that,\n\n01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:02.160\nlike, means I'm unhappier than you.\n\n01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:04.480\nI, like, great.\n\n01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:05.720\nUnpack it, it will.\n\n01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.600\nBut, like, but, like, stop patting yourself on the back.\n\n01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.960\nWait, did you just say

better.\n\n01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.000\nIs it the act of starting the shower\n\n01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.640\nand crossing that threshold, like,\n\n01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:27.560\nthe effort it takes to start the process\n\n01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.400\nof getting into a shower?\n\n01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.240\nYeah.\n\n01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.600\nOr is it, or do you not like the actual.\n\n01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.160\nThat's what I think the discipline comes from.\n\n01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:34.240\nDo you not enjoy the actual hot water,\n\n01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.680\nlike, raining down on you?\n\n01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:39.320\nI do, I do, if, if, if the alternative is being covered\n\n01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.680\nin sweat and dirt.\n\n01:46:40.680

of people.\n\n01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.800\nYou're just a dude taking a bath and like it allowed me\n\n01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.920\nto be like, yeah, what the fuck?\n\n01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.760\nWe're all different.\n\n01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.580\nWho cares?\n\n01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:33.420\nLike what's the line between?\n\n01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:37.400\nAnd then, and then the irony is that I got comfortable.\n\n01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.040\nI was like, I don't have any, I don't have enough shame\n\n01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.920\nto keep my little keister tight as a little drum.\n\n01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:45.080\nI was just like, like, like, like,\n\n01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.280\nit's probably like a sign of like, you're vulnerable\n\n01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:49.360\nand you're like, you know what, this makes me feel good.\n\n01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.200\nOpen.\n\n01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.040\nWow.\n\n01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.720\nAnd then it was like, like, yeah.\n\n01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.640\nI think I just think that's poetic.\n\n01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.560\nI know it's not a, there's no moral to that story,\n\n01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.880\nbut I like that geometry.\n\n01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.600\nThere's certainly a moral to that story.\n\n01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.640\nWell, because my therapist had said to me recently,\n\n01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:06.320\nI thought this was a really powerful lesson.\n\n01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.760\nI think I might probably mention this in the podcast,\n\n01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:11.220\nbut when I was going through this like writer's block thing\n\n01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:12.680\nand I was like procrastinating and stuff\n\n01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:16.240\nand she said something really important to me\n\n01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:19.280\nbecause there was just a series of weeks that went by\n\n01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:21.000\nwhere I was like, you know that thing I said\n\n01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.280\nI had an epiphany about last week, about writing\n\n01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:25.760\nand how I just need to do this and that, uh-huh.\n\n01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.960\nYeah, and then I was absolutely positive of that\n\n01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.160\nwhen I walked out and then I went and did the same shit.\n\n01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.640\nAgain, yeah, I did, yeah.\n\n01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.000\nBut it was like, she made sure, like,\n\n01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.740\nbecause she made sure that that was the place\n\n01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:40.200\nwhere I could always say that,\n\n01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.920\nso I would never stop saying it.\n\n01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.840\nSo it was like, first of all, she had to make sure\n\n01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.520\nthat my brain understood that this is the place\n\n01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.960\nwhere you come and say, whether it's five times in a row\n\n01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.960\nor a thousand times in a row,\n\n01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.280\nI walked out of here thinking I know how to write\n\n01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.840\nand I went home and I didn't write\n\n01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.600\nand I did the same fucking shit and I self-distracted\n\n01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.920\nand I ended up not writing anything and I'm back again\n\n01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.280\nand it's the same story as last time,\n\n01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280\neven though then we had a 45 minute conversation\n\n01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.480\nabout how it's all gonna change and then I did it again.\n\n01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.480\nAnd that she created this avenue\n\n01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:14.480\nwhere I could walk to my fucking little heart's content\n\n01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:18.080\nin that direction and like the fourth time\n\n01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:20.080\nI was in her office going, like, I did it again\n\n01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:23.360\nor it is again or it is again and this time I said,\n\n01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:25.240\nbut you know what, it's making me think that,\n\n01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:27.080\nyou know what I think I'm doing wrong\n\n01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.080\nis that I need to do it this way instead of that way.\n\n01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.920\nAnd she said, you know what I think you're doing wrong\n\n01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.020\nis that you think that you know how to do it right\n\n01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:40.020\nand that makes you not sit and accept\n\n01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:45.020\ndoing it wrong and like the pressure you put on yourself\n\n01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:48.740\nto be the guy that knows how to do it\n\n01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:53.740\nis gonna keep you in an eternity of trying to get it right\n\n01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:55.820\nand you're gonna be continually confused\n\n01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.740\nthat you got it wrong again and here's what I hear\n\n01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.420\nwhen you say to me, you did it wrong again\n\n01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:04.940\nin spite of all odds, I hear that we're on to something\n\n01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:09.160\nbecause we decided last two weeks ago that like,\n\n01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.820\noh, it's all about this or that.\n\n01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.220\nI think whatever makes you fuck up is scared.\n\n01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.780\nIt's like, you don't walk away from die hard\n\n01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.540\nbecause the time lock engages.\n\n01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.020\nLike, you know you're almost there.\n\n01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.540\nYou need to drill further.\n\n01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.020\nIt's like, that's another way of saying,\n\n01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:30.260\nforgive yourself for fucking up\n\n01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:32.660\nas you have like cited the thing you wanna change\n\n01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:37.660\nabout yourself, not changing overnight means you're at the\n\n01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:40.580\nyou're at the site of the construction.\n\n01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.100\nLike you're at the spot where a wall needs to be a door.\n\n01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:46.380\nFucking idiots.\n\n01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:53.320\nBut then she was like, why do you have dirty dick disease?\n\n01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.620\nWhy don't you take a shower, you fucking faggot.\n\n01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.460\nClip hanger.\n\n01:54:01.460 -->
